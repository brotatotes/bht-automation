<p>IN ver. 2 of this chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span> the apostle most evidently alludes to the history of the <i>temptation</i>, and <i>fall</i> of Adam and Eve, as related in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:1">Genesis 3:1</span>, c. and which fall is there attributed to the agency of a being called נחש <i>nachash</i>, here, and in other places, translated οφις, <i>serpent</i>. In my notes on Genesis I have given many, and, as I judge, solid reasons, why the word cannot be understood <i>literally</i> of a <i>serpent</i> of any kind; and that most probably a creature of the <i>simia</i> or <i>ape</i> genus was employed by the devil on this occasion. The arguments on this subject appeared to me to be corroborated by innumerable probabilities; but I left the <i>conjecture</i> afloat, (for I did not give it a more decisive name,) and placed it in the hands of my readers to adopt, reject, or amend, as their judgments might direct them. To several this sentiment appeared a monstrous <i>heresy</i>! and speedily the <i>old serpent</i> had a host of <i>defenders</i>. The very modest opinion, or <i>conjecture</i>, was controverted by some who were both <i>gentlemen</i> and <i>scholars</i>, and by several who were <i>neither</i>; by some who could not affect <i>candour</i> because they had not even the <i>appearance</i> of it, but would affect <i>learning</i> because they wished to be reputed <i>wise</i>. What <i>reason</i> and <i>argument</i> failed to produce they would supply with <i>ridicule</i>; and as <i>monkey</i> was a convenient term for this purpose, they attributed it to him who had never used it. What is the result? They no doubt believe that they have established their system; and their arguments are to <i>them</i> conclusive. They have my full consent; but I think it right to state that I have neither seen nor heard of any thing that has the <i>least tendency to weaken</i> <i>my conjecture</i>, or produce the <i>slightest</i> wavering in my opinion. Indeed their arguments, and mode of managing them, have produced a very different effect on my mind to what they designed. I am now more firmly persuaded of the probability of my <i>hypothesis</i> than ever. I shall, however, leave the subject as it is: I never proposed it as an <i>article of faith</i>; I press it on no man. I could fortify it with many additional arguments if I judged it proper; for its <i>probability</i> appears to me as strong as the utter <i>improbability</i> of the common opinion, to defend which its abettors have descended to insupportable conjectures, of which infidels have availed themselves, to the discredit of the sacred writings. To those who choose to be <i>wise</i> and <i>witty</i>, and wish to provoke a controversy, this is my answer: <i>I am doing a great work, so that I</i> <i>cannot come down</i>. <i>Why should the work cease, while I leave it</i> and <i>come</i> DOWN <i>to</i> YOU? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ne+6:3">Nehemiah 6:3</span>.</p>
