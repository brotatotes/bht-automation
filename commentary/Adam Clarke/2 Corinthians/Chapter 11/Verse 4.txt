<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span>. <i><b>For if he that cometh</b></i> — The false apostle, who came <i>after</i> St. Paul had left Corinth.</p>
<p><i><b>Preacheth another Jesus</b></i> — Who can save more fully and more powerfully than that Jesus <i>whom I have preached</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Or</b></i><b> if </b><i><b>ye receive another spirit</b></i> — And if in consequence of believing in this new saviour ye receive another <i>spirit</i>, the gifts, graces, and consolations of which are greater than those which ye have received from the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, which has been given to you on your believing on the Christ whom we preached.</p>
<p><i><b>Or another Gospel</b></i> — Containing more privileges, spiritual advantages, and stronger excitements to holiness, than that which we have preached and which ye have accepted, <i>ye might well bear</i> <i>with him</i>. This would be a sufficient reason why you should not only <i>bear with him</i>, but prefer him to me.</p>
<p>Others think that the last clause should be rendered, <i>Ye might</i> <i>well bear with</i> ME-notwithstanding he brought you another Jesus, spirit, and gospel, ye might bear with me, who have already ministered so long to and done so much for you. But the former sense seems best.</p>
