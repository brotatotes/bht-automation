<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:6">2 Corinthians 11:6</span>. <i><b>But though</b></i><b> I be </b><i><b>rude in speech</b></i> — ιδιωτης τω λογω Though I speak like a <i>common unlettered man</i>, in plain unadorned phrase, studying none of the graces of eloquence; yet I am not unskilled in the most profound <i>knowledge</i> of God, of spiritual and eternal things, of the nature of the human soul, and the sound truths of the Gospel system: ye yourselves are witnesses of this, as in all these things <i>I have been thoroughly manifested among</i> <i>you</i>.</p>
<p>Inspired men received all their doctrines immediately from God, and often the very <i>words</i> in which those doctrines should be delivered to the world; but in general the Holy Spirit appears to have left them to their own language, preventing them from using any expression that might be equivocal, or convey a contrary sense to that which God intended.</p>
<p>That St. Paul wrote a strong, nervous, and sufficiently pure language, his own writings sufficiently testify; but the <i>graces</i> of the Greek tongue he appears not to have <i>studied</i>, or at least he did not think it proper to use them; for perhaps there is no tongue in the world that is so apt to <i>seduce the understanding</i> by its <i>sounds</i> and <i>harmony</i>, as the Greek. It is not an unusual thing for Greek scholars to the present day to be in raptures with the <i>harmony</i> of a <i>Greek verse</i>, the sense of which is but little regarded, and perhaps is little worth! I should suppose that God would <i>prevent</i> the inspired writers from either speaking or writing thus, that <i>sound</i> might not carry the hearer away from <i>sense</i>; and that the persuasive force of truth might alone prevail, and the excellence of the power appear to be of God and not of man. Taking up the subject in this point of view, I see no reason to have recourse to the supposition, or <i>fable</i> rather, that the apostle had an <i>impediment in his speech</i>, and that he alludes to this infirmity in the above passage.</p>
