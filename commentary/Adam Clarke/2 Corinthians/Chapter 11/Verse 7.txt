<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:7">2 Corinthians 11:7</span>. <i><b>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself</b></i> â€” Have I transgressed in <i>labouring with my hands</i> that I might <i>not be</i> <i>chargeable to you</i>? and getting my deficiencies supplied by contributions from other Churches, while I was employed in labouring for your salvation? Does your false apostle insinuate that I have disgraced the apostolic office by thus descending to servile labour for my support? Well; I have done this <i>that you</i> <i>might be exalted</i>-that you might receive the pure doctrines of the Gospel, and be exalted to the highest pitch of intellectual <i>light</i> and <i>blessedness</i>. And will you complain that I preached the Gospel <i>gratis</i> to you? Surely not. The whole passage is truly ironical.</p>
