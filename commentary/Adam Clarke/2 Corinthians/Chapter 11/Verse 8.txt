Verse 2 Corinthians 11:8. I robbed other Churches — This part of the sentence is explained by the latter, taking wages to do you service.

As if he had said: I received food and raiment, the bare necessaries of life, from other Churches while labouring for your salvation. Will you esteem this a crime?
