<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span>. <i><b>I robbed other Churches</b></i> — This part of the sentence is explained by the latter, <i>taking wages to do you service</i>. The word οψωνιον signifies the <i>pay</i> of money and provisions given daily to a <i>Roman soldier</i>. As if he had said: I received food and raiment, the bare necessaries of life, from other Churches while labouring for <i>your</i> salvation. Will <i>you</i> esteem this a crime?</p>
