<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span>. <i><b>It is not expedient for me</b></i> — There are several various readings on this verse which are too minute to be noticed here; they seem in effect to represent the verse thus: "If it be expedient to glory, (which does not become me,) I will proceed to visions," c. The plain meaning of the apostle, in this and the preceding chapter, in reference to <i>glorying</i> is, that though to boast in any attainments, or in what God did by him, was in all possible cases to be avoided, as being contrary to the <i>humility</i> and <i>simplicity</i> of the Gospel yet the circumstances in which he was found, in reference to the Corinthian Church, and his detractors there, rendered it absolutely necessary; not for his personal vindication, but for the honour of the Gospel, the credit of which was certainly at stake.</p>
<p><i><b>I will come to visions</b></i> — οπτασιας. Symbolical representations of spiritual and celestial things, in which matters of the deepest importance are exhibited to the eye of the mind by a variety of emblems, the nature and properties of which serve to illustrate those spiritual things.</p>
<p><i><b>Revelations</b></i> — αποκαλυψεις. A manifestation of things not before known, and such as God alone can make known, because they are a part of his own inscrutable counsels.</p>
