Verse 2 Corinthians 12:10. Therefore I take pleasure â€” I not only endure them patiently, but am pleased when they occur; for I do it for Christ's sake-on his account; for on his account I suffer. For when I am weak-most oppressed with trials and afflictions, then am I strong; God supporting my mind with his most powerful influences, causing me to rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
