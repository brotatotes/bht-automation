<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:11">2 Corinthians 12:11</span>. <i><b>I am become a fool in glorying</b></i> — It is not the part of a <i>wise</i> or <i>gracious</i> man to <i>boast</i>; but <i>ye have compelled</i> <i>me</i>-I have been obliged to do it, in order to vindicate the cause of God.</p>
<p><i><b>I ought to have been commended of you</b></i> — You should have vindicated both myself and my ministry against the detractors that are among you.</p>
<p><i><b>The very chiefest apostles</b></i> — See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:1">2 Corinthians 11:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Though I be nothing.</b></i> — Though I have been thus <i>set at nought</i> by your false apostle; and though, in consequence of what he has said, some of you have been ready to consider me <i>as nothing</i>-what we call <i>good for nothing</i>. This must be the meaning of the apostle, as the following verses prove.</p>
<p>A kind of <i>technical</i> meaning has been <i>imposed</i> on these words, of which many good people seem very fond. <i>I am nothing</i>-I am all sin, defilement, and unworthiness in myself; but <i>Jesus Christ is all in</i> <i>all</i>. This latter clause is an eternal truth; the former may be very true also; the person who uses it may be all <i>sin, defilement</i>, c., but let him not say that the <i>apostle of the Gentiles</i> was <i>so</i> too, because this is not true it is false, and it is injurious to the character of the apostle and to the grace of Christ; besides, it is not the meaning of the text, and the use commonly made of it is abominable, if not wicked.</p>
