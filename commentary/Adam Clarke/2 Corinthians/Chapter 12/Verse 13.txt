<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13">2 Corinthians 12:13</span>. <i><b>For what is it wherein you were inferior</b></i> â€” This is a fine, forcible, yet delicate <i>stroke</i>. It was <i>your</i> duty and your interest to have supported your apostle; other Churches have done so: I did not require this from you; in this respect all other Churches are <i>superior</i> to <i>you</i>. I am the cause of your <i>inferiority,</i> by not giving you an opportunity of <i>ministering</i> to my necessities: <i>forgive me</i> the <i>wrong</i> I have done you. It is the <i>privilege</i> of the Churches of Christ to support the ministry of his Gospel among them. Those who do not contribute their part to the support of the Gospel ministry either care nothing for it, or derive no good from it.</p>
