<p>Verse 14. <i><b>The third time I am ready</b></i> — That is, this is the third time that <i>I am ready</i>-have formed the <i>resolution</i>, to visit you. He had formed this resolution <i>twice</i> before, but was disappointed. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span>. He now formed it a <i>third time</i>, having more probability of seeing them now than he had before. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:2">2 Corinthians 13:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>I seek not yours, but you</b></i> — I seek your <i>salvation</i>, I desire not your <i>property</i>; others have sought your <i>property</i>, but not your <i>salvation</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>For the children ought not to lay up for the parents</b></i> — You may have <i>many teachers</i>, but you have but one FATHER; <i>for in Christ</i> <i>Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel</i>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:15">1 Corinthians 4:15</span>. Ye are my <i>children</i>, and I am your father. You have not contributed to <i>my</i> support, but I have been labouring for your life. I will act towards you as the loving father who works hard, and lays up what is necessary to enable his children to get their bread.</p>
