See 2 Corinthians 11:20.For the children ought not to lay up for the parents — You may have many teachers, but you have but one FATHER; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel; see 1 Corinthians 4:15. Ye are my children, and I am your father. You have not contributed to my support, but I have been labouring for your life. I will act towards you as the loving father who works hard, and lays up what is necessary to enable his children to get their bread.
