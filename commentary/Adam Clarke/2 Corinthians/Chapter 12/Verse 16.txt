<p>Verse 16. <i><b>But be it so, I did not burden you</b></i> â€” That is: You grant that I did not burden you, that I took nothing from you, but preached to you the Gospel freely; but you say that, BEING CRAFTY, <i>I caught you with guile</i>; i.e. getting from you, by means of <i>others</i>, what I pretended to be unwilling to receive immediately from yourselves.</p>

This doctrine is abominable and the words are most evidently those of the apostle's detractors, against which he defends his conduct in the two following verses.</p>
