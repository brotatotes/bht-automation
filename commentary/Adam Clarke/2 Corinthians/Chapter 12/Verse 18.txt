Verse 18. I desired Titus â€” I never sent any to you but Titus and another brother; 2 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Corinthians 8:18. And did Titus make a gain of you? Did he get any thing from you, either for himself or for me? You know he did not. He was actuated by the same spirit, and he walked in the same steps.
