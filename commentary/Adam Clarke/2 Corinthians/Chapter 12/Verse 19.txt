<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Think ye that we excuse ourselves</b></i> — απολογουμεθα; That we make an apology for our conduct; or, that I have sent Titus and that brother to you because I was ashamed or afraid to come myself?</p>
<p><i><b>We speak before God in Christ</b></i> — I have not done so; I speak the truth before God; he is judge whether I was actuated in this way by any sinister or unworthy motive.</p>
<p><i><b>For your edifying.</b></i> — Whatever I have done in this or any other way, I have done for your <i>edifying</i>; not for any <i>emolument</i> to myself or friends.</p>
