Verse 19. Think ye that we excuse ourselves — απολογουμεθα; That we make an apology for our conduct; or, that I have sent Titus and that brother to you because I was ashamed or afraid to come myself?We speak before God in Christ — I have not done so; I speak the truth before God; he is judge whether I was actuated in this way by any sinister or unworthy motive.For your edifying. — Whatever I have done in this or any other way, I have done for your edifying; not for any emolument to myself or friends.
