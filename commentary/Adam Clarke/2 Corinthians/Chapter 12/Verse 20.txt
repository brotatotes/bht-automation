<p>Verse 20. <i><b>I fear, lest, when I come</b></i> — I think the <i>present time</i> is used here for the <i>past</i>; the apostle seems most evidently to be giving them the <i>reason</i> why he <i>had not come</i> to them according to his former purposes, and why he sent Titus and his companion. He was afraid to come at that time lest he should have found them perverted from the right way, and he be obliged to make use of his apostolical <i>rod</i>, and punish the offenders; but, feeling towards them the heart of a tender <i>father</i>, he was unwilling to use the <i>rod</i>; and sent the first epistle to them, and the messengers above mentioned, being reluctant to go himself till he had satisfactory evidence that their divisions were ended, and that they had repented for and put away the evils that they had committed; and that he should not be obliged to bewail them who had sinned so abominably, and had not repented for their crimes. If this verse be understood in this way, all difficulty will vanish; otherwise, what is here said does seem to contradict what is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6">2 Corinthians 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:16">2 Corinthians 7:16</span>, c. as well as many things both in the <i>eighth</i> and <i>ninth</i> chapters.</p>
<p><i><b>Debates, envyings</b></i> — From these different expressions, which are too <i>plain</i> to need interpretation, we see what a <i>distracted</i> and <i>divided</i> state the Church at Corinth must have been in. <i>Brotherly</i> <i>love</i> and <i>charity</i> seem to have been driven out of this once heavenly assembly. These <i>debates</i>, &amp;c., are precisely the opposites to that <i>love</i> which the apostle recommends and explains by its different <i>properties</i> in the 13th chapter of his first epistle.</p>
<p>Mr. Wakefield translates the original thus: <i>strifes, rivalries,</i> <i>passions, provocations, slanders, whisperings, swellings, quarrels</i>.</p>
