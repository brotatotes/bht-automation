<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:21">2 Corinthians 12:21</span>. <i><b>Lest, when I come again</b></i> — And even after all that has been done for you, I fear that when I <i>do come</i>-when I pay you my <i>second</i> visit, <i>my God will humble me</i>-will permit me to be <i>affected</i> with deep sorrow through what I may see among you; as I have been by the <i>buffetings</i> of the <i>apostle of Satan</i>, who has perverted you. Humiliation is repeatedly used for <i>affliction</i>, and here ταπεινωση has certainly that meaning.</p>
<p><i><b>Have sinned already</b></i> — προημαρτηκοτων. <i>Who have sinned before</i>; who were some of the <i>first</i> offenders, and have not yet repented.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the uncleanness</b></i>, c.] There must have been a total relaxation of discipline, else such abominations could not have been tolerated in the Christian Church. And although what is here spoken could only be the ease of a <i>few</i> yet the <i>many</i> were ill disciplined, else these must have been cast out. On the whole, this Church seems to have been a composition of excellences and defects, of vices and virtues; and should not be quoted as a <i>model</i> for a Christian Church.</p>
<p>1. FROM St. Paul we receive <i>two remarkable sayings</i> of our Lord, which are of infinite value to the welfare and salvation of man; which are properly parts of the Gospel, but are not mentioned by any evangelist. The <i>first</i> is in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>: <i>I have showed you, the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said</i>, IT IS MORE BLESSED TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE. Every liberal heart feels this in bestowing its bounty; and every poor man, who is obliged to receive help, and whose independency of spirit is still whole in him, feels this too. To the <i>genuine</i> poor, it is more <i>burdensome</i> to receive a kindness, than it is to the <i>generous</i> man who gives it. The <i>second</i> is recorded in the <i>ninth</i> verse of this chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:9">2 Corinthians 12:9</span>: <i>He said unto me</i>, MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR THEE; FOR MY STRENGTH IS MADE PERFECT IN WEAKNESS. Of these two most blessed sayings, St. Paul is the only <i>evangelist</i>. This last is of <i>general</i> application. In all <i>states</i> and <i>conditions</i> of life God's grace is sufficient for us. If in any case we <i>miscarry</i>, it is because we have not <i>sought God earnestly</i>. Let no man say that he is overcome by sin through want of grace; God's grace was sufficient for him, but he did not apply for it <i>as did</i> St. Paul, and therefore he did not receive it. Men often lay the issue of their own infidelity to the charge of God, they excuse their commission of sin through their scantiness of grace; whereas the whole is owing to their <i>carelessness</i>, and <i>refusal to be saved in God's own way</i>; and in <i>this way</i> alone will God save any man, because it is the only effectual way.</p>
<p>2. The apostle must have been brought into a blessed state of subjection to God, when he could say, <i>I take pleasure in</i> <i>infirmities</i>; that is, in <i>afflictions</i> and <i>sufferings</i> of different kinds. Though this language was spoken on <i>earth</i>, we may justly allow, with one, that he learned it in HEAVEN.</p>
<p>3. St. Paul preached the Gospel without being <i>burdensome</i>. In every case the <i>labourer is worthy of his hire</i>. He who labours for the cause of God should be supported by the cause of God; but wo to that man who aggrandizes himself and grows <i>rich</i> by the <i>spoils</i> <i>of the faithful</i>! And to him especially who has made a fortune out of the <i>pence</i> of the poor! In such a man's heart the <i>love of money</i> must have its <i>throne</i>. As to his professed <i>spirituality</i>, it is <i>nothing</i>; he is a <i>whited sepulchre</i>, and an abomination in the sight of the Lord. If a man will love the world, (and he does love it who makes a fortune by the offerings of the poor,) the love of the Father is not in him.</p>
