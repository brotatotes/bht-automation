<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:4">2 Corinthians 12:4</span>. <i><b>Caught up into paradise</b></i> — The Jewish writers have no less than <i>four paradises</i>, as they have <i>seven</i> heavens; but it is needless to wade through their fables. On the word <i>paradise</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:8">Genesis 2:8</span>. The Mohammedans call it [Arabic] <i>jennet alferdoos</i>, the garden of paradise, and say that God created it out of <i>light</i>, and that it is the habitation of the prophets and wise men.</p>
<p>Among Christian writers it generally means the <i>place of the</i> <i>blessed</i>, or the state of separate spirits. Whether the third heaven and paradise be the same place we cannot absolutely say; they probably are not; and it is likely that St. Paul, at the time referred to, had at least <i>two</i> of these <i>raptures</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</b></i> — The Jews thought that the Divine name, the Tetragrammaton יהוה <i>Yehovah</i>, should not be uttered, and that it is absolutely <i>unlawful</i> to pronounce it; indeed they say that the true pronunciation is utterly lost, and cannot be recovered without an express revelation. Not one of them, to the present day, ever attempts to utter it; and, when they meet with it in their reading, always supply its place with אדני <i>Adonai</i>, Lord. It is probable that the apostle refers to some communication concerning the Divine nature and the Divine economy, of which he was only to make a <i>general</i> use in his <i>preaching</i> and <i>writing</i>. No doubt that what he learned at this time formed the <i>basis</i> of all his doctrines.</p>
<p>Cicero terms God <i>illud inexprimible</i>, that inexpressible Being. And <i>Hermes</i> calls him ανεκλαλητος, αρῥητος, σιωπῃ φωνουμενος: The <i>ineffable, the unspeakable, and that which is to be pronounced in</i> <i>silence</i>. We cannot have views too exalted of the majesty of God; and the less frequently we pronounce his <i>name</i>, the more reverence shall we feel for his <i>nature</i>. It is said of Mr. <i>Boyle</i> that he never pronounced the name of God without either <i>taking off his hat</i> or <i>making a bow</i>. Leaving out profane swearers, blasphemers, and such like open-faced servants of Satan, it is distressing to hear many well intentioned people making unscripturally free with this sacred name.</p>
