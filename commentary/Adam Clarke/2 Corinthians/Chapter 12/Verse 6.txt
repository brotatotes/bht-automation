Verse 2 Corinthians 12:6. I shall not be a fool — Who that had got such honour from God would have been fourteen years silent on the subject?I will say the truth — I speak nothing but truth; and the apostle seems to have intended to proceed with something else of the same kind, but, finding some reason probably occurring suddenly, says, I forbear-I will say no more on this subject.Lest any man should think of me above — The apostle spoke of these revelations for two purposes: first, lest his enemies might suppose they had cause to think meanly of him; and, secondly, having said thus much, he forbears to speak any farther of them, lest his friends should think too highly of him. It is a rare gift to discern when to speak, and when to be silent; and to know when enough is said on a subject, neither too little nor too much.
