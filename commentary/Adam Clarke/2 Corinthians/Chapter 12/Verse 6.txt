<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:6">2 Corinthians 12:6</span>. <i><b>I shall not be a fool</b></i> — Who that had got such honour from God would have been fourteen years silent on the subject?</p>
<p><i><b>I will say the truth</b></i> — I speak nothing but truth; and the apostle seems to have intended to proceed with something else of the same kind, but, finding some reason probably occurring suddenly, says, <i>I forbear</i>-I will say no more on this subject.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest any man should think of me above</b></i> — The apostle spoke of these revelations for <i>two</i> purposes: <i>first</i>, lest his <i>enemies</i> might suppose they had cause to think <i>meanly</i> of him; and, <i>secondly</i>, having said thus much, he forbears to speak any farther of them, lest his <i>friends</i> should think <i>too highly</i> of him. It is a rare gift to discern <i>when</i> to <i>speak</i>, and <i>when</i> to be <i>silent</i>; and to know when enough is said on a subject, neither <i>too little</i> nor <i>too</i> <i>much</i>.</p>
