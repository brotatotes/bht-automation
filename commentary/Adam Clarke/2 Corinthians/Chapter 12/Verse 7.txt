<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>. <i><b>And lest I should be exalted</b></i> — There were three evils to be guarded against:</p>
<p>1. The <i>contempt</i> of his gifts and call by his <i>enemies</i>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>overweening fondness</i> of his <i>friends</i>. And,</p>
<p>3. <i>Self-exultation</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A thorn in the flesh</b></i> — The word σκολοψ signifies a <i>stake</i>, and ανασκολοπιζεσθαι, to be <i>tied to a stake</i> by way of punishment; and it is used, says <i>Schoettgen</i>, to signify the <i>most oppressive</i> <i>afflictions</i>. Whatever it was, it was τησαρκι, <i>in the flesh</i>, i.e. of an <i>outward</i> kind. It was neither <i>sin</i> nor <i>sinfulness</i>, for this could not be <i>given him</i> to prevent his being <i>exalted</i> above measure; for <i>sin</i> never had and never can have this tendency. What this <i>thorn in the flesh</i> might be has given birth to a multitude of conjectures: <i>Tertullian</i> thought it <i>dolor auriculae</i>, the <i>ear ache;</i> <i>Chrysostom</i>, κεφαλαλγια, the <i>head ache; Cyprian, carnis et corporis</i> <i>multa ac gravia tormenta</i>, many and grievous bodily torments. I believe the apostle to refer simply to the distresses he had endured through the opposition he met with at Corinth; which were as painful and grievous to him as <i>a thorn in his flesh</i>, or his being <i>bound to a stake</i>; for, if he could have devoted himself to destruction, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span>, for his rebellious and unbelieving countrymen, what must he have suffered on account of an eminent <i>Church</i> being perverted and torn to pieces by a false teacher! God permitted this to keep the apostle humble, and at last completely delivered the Church out of the hands and influence of this deceiver; none, not even the incestuous person, having been turned finally out of the way by the false doctrines there preached.</p>
<p><i><b>The messenger of Satan</b></i> — Another mode of expressing what he calls the <i>thorn in the flesh</i>; and he seems most plainly to refer to the <i>false apostle</i> at Corinth. The apostle himself was, as he styles himself to this Church, αποστολος Ιησου Χριστου, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span>, <i>the apostle of Jesus Christ</i>. The person in question is styled here αγγελος σαταν, <i>the apostle</i> or <i>angel of Satan</i>. It is almost impossible to mistake the apostle's meaning and reference. JESUS CHRIST <i>sent</i> Paul to proclaim his truth, and found a Church at Corinth. SATAN, the <i>adversary</i> of God's truth, <i>sent</i> a man to preach lies at the same place, and turn the Church of God into his own <i>synagogue</i>; and by his teaching lies and calumnies the apostle was severely <i>buffeted</i>. We need seek no other sense for these expressions. Many, however, think that the apostle had really some <i>bodily infirmity</i> that rendered him contemptible, and was the means of obstructing the success of his ministry; and that the false apostle availed himself of this to set St. Paul at nought, and to hold him out to ridicule. I have shown this, elsewhere, to be very unlikely.</p>
<p>The best arguments in favour of this opinion may be found in <i>Whitby</i>; but I forbear to transcribe them because I think the meaning given above is more correct. No infirmity of body nor corporeal sufferings can affect and distress a minister of the Gospel, equally to the perversion or scattering of a flock, which were the fruit of innumerable labours, watchings, fastings, prayers, and tears.</p>
