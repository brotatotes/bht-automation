<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:8">2 Corinthians 12:8</span>. <i><b>I besought the Lord</b></i> — That is, <i>Christ</i>, as the next verse absolutely proves, and the Socinians themselves confess. And if Christ be an object of prayer in such a case as this, or indeed in any case, it is a sure proof of his <i>divinity</i>; for only an omniscient Being can be made an object of prayer.</p>
<p><i><b>Thrice</b></i> — Several suppose this to be a <i>certain number</i> for an <i>uncertain</i>; as if he had said, I <i>often</i> besought Christ to deliver me from this tormentor: or, which is perhaps more likely, the apostle may refer to <i>three</i> solemn, fixed, and fervent applications made to Christ at <i>different</i> times; at the last of which he received the answer which he immediately subjoins. It is worthy of remark, that our Lord in his agony acted in the same way: at three different times he applied to God that the cup might depart from him; and in each application he spoke the same words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39-44">Matthew 26:39-44</span>. There is, therefore, a manifest allusion to our Lord's conduct in these words of the apostle.</p>
