<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:9">2 Corinthians 12:9</span>. <i><b>My grace is sufficient for thee</b></i> — Thou shalt not be permitted to sink under these afflictions. Thy enemies shall not be able to prevail against thee.</p>
<p><i><b>My strength is made perfect in weakness.</b></i> — The more, and the more <i>violently</i>, thou art afflicted and tried, being upheld by my power, and prospered in all thy labours, the more eminently will my power be seen and acknowledged. For the weaker the instrument I use, the more the power of my grace shall be manifested. See at the end of this chapter. <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:21">2 Corinthians 12:21</span><i>"</i></p>
<p><i><b>Will I rather glory in my infirmities</b></i> — Therefore, his <i>infirmities</i> do not mean his <i>corruptions</i>, or <i>sins</i>, or <i>sinfulness</i> of any kind; for it would be blasphemous for any man to say, I will rather glory that God leaves my corruptions in me, than that he should take them away.</p>
<p><i><b>That the power of Christ may rest upon me.</b></i> — επισκηνωση επ εμε. That it may <i>overshadow</i> me as a <i>tent</i>, or <i>tabernacle</i>; affording me <i>shelter, protection, safety</i>, and <i>rest</i>. This expression is like that, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>: <i>And the word was made flesh</i>, και εσκηνωσεν εν ημιν <i>and made his</i> <i>tabernacle among us-full of grace and truth</i>. The same <i>eternal</i> WORD promised to make his <i>tabernacle</i> with the apostle, and gives him a proof that he was still the same-<i>full of grace and truth</i>, by assuring him that his <i>grace should be sufficient for him</i>. Paul, knowing that the promise of <i>grace</i> could not fail, because of the Divine <i>truth</i>, says: <i>Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in</i> <i>my afflictions, that</i> such a <i>power of Christ may overshadow</i> and defend me.</p>
<p>The words are also similar to those of the Prophet Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:5">Isaiah 4:5</span>: <i>On all the glory shall be a defence</i>. God gives the <i>glory</i>, and God gives the <i>defence</i> of that glory. The apostle had much <i>glory</i> or <i>honour</i>; both Satan and his apostles were very envious; in himself the apostle, as well as all human beings, was <i>weak</i>, and therefore needed the <i>power of God</i> to defend such glory. Grace alone can preserve grace. When we get a particular blessing we need <i>another</i> to <i>preserve</i> it; and without this we shall soon be shorn of our strength, and become as other men. Hence the necessity of continual <i>watchfulness</i> and <i>prayer</i>, and <i>depending</i> on the <i>all-sufficient grace of Christ</i>.
