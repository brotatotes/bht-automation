<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>. <i><b>This is the third</b></i><b> time </b><i><b>I am coming to you.</b></i> â€” These words are nearly the same with those <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>; and probably refer to the purpose which he had <i>twice</i> before formed of seeing them. But the latter clause seems to attach a different meaning to the passage; at least so it has been understood by some learned men.</p>
<p><i>Schoettgen</i> thus interprets the whole: the <i>first</i> coming of the apostle to Corinth was when he <i>personally</i> visited them, and there founded the Christian Church. By his <i>second</i> coming we are to understand his first epistle to them; and, by his being now ready to come to them the <i>third</i> time, we are to understand this <i>second</i> epistle, which he was then going to send them. These were the <i>two</i> witnesses, and the apostle the <i>third</i>, which he gave to the Corinthians concerning the truth of his own ministry, or the falsity of the ministry of the pretended apostle.</p>
<p><i>Calmet</i> contends that the apostle had been <i>twice</i> before at Corinth, and that he now purposed to go a <i>third</i> time; and that these visits were the <i>two</i> or <i>three witnesses</i> to which the apostle appeals.</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i> thinks that the two or three witnesses were <i>Stephanas, Fortunatus</i>, and <i>Achaicus</i>, sent to assure them of his coming. But this opinion cannot be supported.</p>
<p>With respect to the <i>two</i> or <i>three witnesses</i> establishing the subject, Dr. <i>Whitby</i> says. "Though these words seem to be cited from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+19:15">Deuteronomy 19:15</span>, rather than from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:16">Matthew 18:16</span>, it being rare to find this apostle citing any thing from the New Testament, without calling it <i>an ordinance of the Lord</i>, yet it is probable that he here alludes to the practice there prescribed for the reclaiming of offenders. And then his <i>first</i> epistle being written with this introduction: <i>Paul an apostle, and Sosthenes</i>; his <i>second</i> thus: <i>Paul and Timotheus</i>; may pass for <i>two or three witnesses</i>; and his <i>presence</i> the <i>third</i> time in <i>person</i>, to exercise his censures on those offenders, before the body of the Church, may bear a fair resemblance to our Lord's prescription in the above case: <i>If thy</i> <i>brother offend</i>," &amp;c.-So far <i>Whitby</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:16">Matthew 18:16</span>.</p>
