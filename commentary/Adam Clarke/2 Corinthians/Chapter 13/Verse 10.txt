<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:10">2 Corinthians 13:10</span>. <i><b>Therefore I write these things</b></i> — I only threaten you now, by this epistle, to put you on your guard, and lead you to reformation before I visit you that I may not then have to use <i>sharpness</i>, αποτομια, <i>a cutting off</i>, employing thus my apostolical authority to inflict punishment; a <i>power</i> which God has <i>given</i> me, rather to be employed in your <i>edification</i> than in your <i>destruction</i>.</p>
