<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>. <i><b>Finally</b></i> — δοιπον. All that <i>remains</i> for me now to write is, to wish you all manner of happiness, and so to take my leave.</p>
<p><i><b>Farewell.</b></i> — A good wish, from our old mother tongue, compounded of [Anglo-Saxon], <i>to go</i>, and [Anglo-Saxon], <i>fairly, properly</i>, or [Anglo-Saxon], with <i>felicity; go on prosperously</i>! This is the spirit of this good wish.</p>
<p>The Greek χαιρετε signifies nearly the same thing. χαιρω means to be <i>very joyous</i>; χαιρετε, <i>be joyous and happy, be ever</i> <i>prosperous</i>; this was among the last words which Cyrus, when dying, spoke to his friends.</p>
<p><i><b>Be perfect</b></i> — καταρτιζεσθε. <i>Be compact</i>; get <i>into joint again;</i> let <i>unity</i> and <i>harmony</i> be restored. See the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:9">2 Corinthians 13:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Be of good comfort</b></i> — παρακαλεισθε. <i>Receive admonition</i>; for παρακαλεω signifies to <i>admonish, beg, entreat</i>, and also <i>to</i> <i>comfort</i>. <i>Receive admonition</i>, that ye may <i>receive comfort</i>. If ye take my <i>advice</i>, ye shall have <i>consolation</i>; if ye do <i>not</i>, ye will have nothing but <i>misery</i> and <i>wo</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Be of one mind</b></i> — το αυτο φρονειτε. <i>Think the same</i>; let there be no dissensions among you. Be of the same creed, and let disputes about that religion which should be the <i>bond</i> of <i>peace</i> for ever subside.</p>
<p><i><b>Live in peace</b></i> — ειρηνευετε. <i>Cultivate peace</i>; or, as he says elsewhere, <i>Follow peace, and pursue it</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>. Cultivate a <i>peaceable disposition</i>, and neither say nor do any thing which has a tendency to irritate each other.</p>
<p><i><b>And the God of love and peace shall be with you.</b></i> — While ye are full of contentions, dissensions, and discord, <i>peace</i> can have no place among you; and as to <i>love</i>, the fulfilling of the law, that worketh no ill to its neighbour, it has necessarily taken its flight. <i>Love</i> cannot live, neither exist, where there are brawls, contentions, and divisions. And where neither <i>peace</i> nor <i>love</i> is to be found, there God cannot be. And if HE be not there, <i>yourselves</i> and the <i>devil</i> make the whole assembly.</p>
