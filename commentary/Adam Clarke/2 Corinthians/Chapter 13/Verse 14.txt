<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>. <i><b>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ</b></i> — All the <i>favour</i> and <i>beneficence</i> that come <i>from</i> and <i>through</i> the Redeemer of the world; as the LORD, the <i>ruler</i> and <i>governor</i> of all things; as JESUS, the <i>Saviour</i> of all men by his passion and death; as <i>Christ</i>, the distributer of all that Divine <i>unction</i> which enlightens, comforts, harmonizes, and purifies the mind. May this most exalted, glorious, and all-sufficient Saviour, be ever with you!</p>
<p><i><b>And the love of God</b></i> — GOD, your <i>Maker</i>, in that infinite love which induced him to create the world, and form man in his own image and in his own likeness, that he might be capable of knowing, loving, and enjoying him for ever; and God in the fullest manifestations of that love which caused him to give his only begotten Son, to the end that they who believe on him should not perish, but have everlasting life. May this <i>God of love</i>, and this <i>love of God</i>, be ever with you!</p>
<p><i><b>And the communion of the Holy Ghost</b></i> — May that Holy Spirit, that Divine and eternal energy which proceeds from the Father and the Son; that heavenly <i>fire</i> that gives <i>light</i> and <i>life</i>, that purifies and refines, sublimes and exalts, comforts and invigorates, make you all <i>partakers</i> with himself!</p>
<p>κοινωνια, which we translate <i>fellowship</i> and <i>communion</i>, signifies properly <i>participation</i>; having things <i>in common;</i> <i>partaking with each other</i>. This points out the astonishing privileges of true believers: they have <i>communion</i> with God's Spirit; share in all its <i>gifts</i> and <i>graces</i>; walk in its <i>light</i>; through him they have the fullest <i>confidence</i> that they are of God, that he is their father and friend, and has blotted out all their iniquities: this they know by the Spirit which he has given them. And is it possible that a man shall be a <i>partaker</i> with the <i>Holy</i> <i>Ghost</i>, and <i>not know it</i>! that he shall be <i>full of light</i> and <i>love</i>, and <i>not know</i> it! that he shall have the <i>spirit</i> of <i>adoption</i>, by which he can cry, Abba! Father! and yet <i>know nothing</i> of his <i>relationship</i> to God, but by <i>inference</i> from indirect proofs! In a word, that he shall have the <i>grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i> <i>the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost with him</i>, and all the while <i>know</i> nothing <i>certain</i> of the <i>grace</i>, as to his <i>portion</i> in it; <i>feel</i> nothing <i>warming</i> from the <i>love</i>, as to its part in <i>him</i>; and nothing <i>energetic</i> from the <i>communion</i>, as to his <i>participation</i> in the gifts and graces of this Divine energy! This is all as absurd as it is impossible. Every genuine Christian, who maintains a close walk with God, may have as <i>full an evidence</i> <i>of his acceptance with God</i> as he has of his <i>own existence</i>. And the doctrine that explains away this privilege, or softens it down to nothing, by making the most gracious and safe state consistent with innumerable <i>doubts</i> and <i>fears</i> and <i>general uncertainty</i>, is not of God. It is a <i>spurious gospel</i>, which, under the show of a <i>voluntary humility</i>, not only <i>lowers</i>, but almost <i>annihilates</i>, the <i>standard</i> of <i>Christianity</i>.</p>
<p>This text, as well as that, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16-17">Matthew 3:16-17</span>, and that other, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>, <i>strongly</i> marks the doctrine of the <i>holy</i> TRINITY. See the note on this latter text. And had not the apostle been convinced that there was a <i>personality</i> in this <i>ever-blessed</i> and <i>undivided</i> <i>Trinity</i>, he could not have expressed himself thus. And had not our Lord intended to be understood in <i>this way</i>, he would not have given such a commission to his apostles, to baptize the nations in the name of the <i>Father</i>, and of the <i>Son</i>, and of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>. The doctrine is the teaching of God, let men make of it what they please. And the genuine Church of God have ever received and understood it in this way.</p>
<p><i><b>Amen.</b></i> — This word is wanting, as usual, in almost every MS. of authority. <i>Amen</i> seems to have been anciently added at the conclusion of books, exactly as we add the word, <i>finis</i>, both merely signifying the end.</p>
<p>As to the <i>inscription</i>, it is wanting, either in whole or in part, in almost all the ancient MSS. The principal forms in which it exists are the following:-</p>
<p><i>To the Corinthians, the second</i>.</p>
<p>-<i>The second to the Corinthians</i> <i>is completed</i>.</p>
<p>-<i>The second to the Corinthians is finished</i>.</p>
<p>-<i>To the</i> <i>Corinthians, the second, written from Philippi</i>.</p>
<p>-<i>Written from</i> <i>Philippi by Titus</i>.</p>
<p>-<i>Written from Philippi by Titus and Luke</i>.</p>
<p>-<i>By</i> <i>Titus, Barnabas, and Luke</i>.</p>
<p>-<i>The Second Epistle to the Corinthians</i> <i>was written from Philippi of Macedonia, and sent by Titus</i>, SYRIAC.</p>
<p>-<i>The End of the Epistle. It was written from the city of</i> <i>Philippi by Titus and Luke. Praise be to God for ever</i>, ARABIC.</p>
<p>-In the VULGATE <i>there is no subscription; nor in the</i> ETHIOPIC.</p>
<p>-<i>Written in Philippi of Macedonia, and sent by Titus and Luke</i>, COPTIC.</p>
<p>-<i>The Second Epistle to the Corinthians is ended; which was</i> <i>written from Philippi of Macedonia, by Titus and Luke</i>, SYR. PHILOX.</p>
<p>It has been often remarked that no dependence can be placed on many of the subscriptions to the sacred books, which are found in MSS. and versions, because those subscriptions were not written by the <i>authors</i> of those books, but were afterwards added by the <i>transcribers</i> or <i>copiers</i>, who followed either tradition or their own judgment. It is generally allowed that this second epistle was written from <i>Macedonia</i>; and probably from the city of <i>Philippi</i>, in that province. See the <i>introduction</i> and <i>preface</i> to this epistle.</p>
