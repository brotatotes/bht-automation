<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:2">2 Corinthians 13:2</span>. <i><b>I told you before</b></i>, c.] As <i>Calmet</i> maintains that Paul had already been <i>twice</i> at Corinth, it is well to hear his reasons: "St. Paul came to Corinth the latter end of the year of our Lord 52, and remained there eighteen months, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1">Acts 18:1</span>, c. He came there a <i>second</i> time in the year 55, but stayed only a short time, as he had to return speedily to Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:7">1 Corinthians 16:7</span> hence it is that St. Luke makes no mention of this <i>second</i> journey in the Acts. Finally he determined to visit them a <i>third</i> time; as in effect he did about the year 57. Of his <i>second</i> voyage to Corinth, which is not mentioned in the Acts, he speaks expressly in this verse."</p>
<p>I do not see sufficient evidence to induce me to subscribe to this opinion of Calmet. I believe the apostle had been but <i>once</i> before at Corinth; and this matter is set in a clear point of view by Dr. <i>Paley</i>. See the Introduction, sec. xi.</p>
<p><i><b>I will not spare</b></i> â€” I will inflict the proper punishment on every incorrigible offender. It <i>does</i> appear, from all the apostle's threatenings, that he was possessed of a miraculous power, by which he <i>could inflict punishment on offenders; that he</i> <i>could deliver the body to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,</i> <i>that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>. What he says he told them before probably relates to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>: <i>Shall I come with a rod</i>, &amp;c.</p>
