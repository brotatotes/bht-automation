Verse 2 Corinthians 13:2. I told you before, c.] As Calmet maintains that Paul had already been twice at Corinth, it is well to hear his reasons: "St. Paul came to Corinth the latter end of the year of our Lord 52, and remained there eighteen months, Acts 18:1, c. He came there a second time in the year 55, but stayed only a short time, as he had to return speedily to Ephesus, 1 Corinthians 16:7 hence it is that St. Luke makes no mention of this second journey in the Acts. Finally he determined to visit them a third time; as in effect he did about the year 57. Of his second voyage to Corinth, which is not mentioned in the Acts, he speaks expressly in this verse."I do not see sufficient evidence to induce me to subscribe to this opinion of Calmet. I believe the apostle had been but once before at Corinth; and this matter is set in a clear point of view by Dr. Paley. See the Introduction, sec. xi.I will not spare â€” I will inflict the proper punishment on every incorrigible offender. It does appear, from all the apostle's threatenings, that he was possessed of a miraculous power, by which he could inflict punishment on offenders; that he could deliver the body to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, 1 Corinthians 4:21; 1 Corinthians 5:5. What he says he told them before probably relates to 1 Corinthians 4:21: Shall I come with a rod, &c.
