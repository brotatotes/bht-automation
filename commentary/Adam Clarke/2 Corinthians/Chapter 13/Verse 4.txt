<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:4">2 Corinthians 13:4</span>. <i><b>For though he was crucified through weakness</b></i> — It is true Christ was crucified, and his crucifixion appeared to be the effect of his <i>weakness</i>; yet even this was not so; he gave up his life, none could take it away from him; and in his last struggle, had he even been deficient in power, he could have had more than twelve legions of angels to support him against the high priest's mob, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:53">Matthew 26:53</span>; but how then could the Scripture be fulfilled? And had he <i>not died</i>, how could the human race have been <i>saved</i>?</p>
<p><i><b>Yet he liveth by the power of God.</b></i> — Though he appeared to be crucified through his own weakness, yet he now liveth by the power of God; exerting an almighty energy by which all things are subject to him.</p>
<p><i><b>We also are weak in him</b></i> — Because we are on Christ's side we appear to <i>you</i> as <i>weak</i> as he did to the <i>Jews</i>; but it is not so, for <i>we live with him</i>-under the same influence, and partaking of the same life; manifesting by our preaching and miracles the <i>power</i> <i>of God towards you</i>. While I do not use the <i>rod</i>, I appear to you <i>weak</i>; I will use it, and then you shall find me to be <i>strong</i>.</p>
