Verse 2 Corinthians 13:4. For though he was crucified through weakness — It is true Christ was crucified, and his crucifixion appeared to be the effect of his weakness; yet even this was not so; he gave up his life, none could take it away from him; and in his last struggle, had he even been deficient in power, he could have had more than twelve legions of angels to support him against the high priest's mob, Matthew 26:53; but how then could the Scripture be fulfilled? And had he not died, how could the human race have been saved?Yet he liveth by the power of God. — Though he appeared to be crucified through his own weakness, yet he now liveth by the power of God; exerting an almighty energy by which all things are subject to him.We also are weak in him — Because we are on Christ's side we appear to you as weak as he did to the Jews; but it is not so, for we live with him-under the same influence, and partaking of the same life; manifesting by our preaching and miracles the power of God towards you. While I do not use the rod, I appear to you weak; I will use it, and then you shall find me to be strong.
