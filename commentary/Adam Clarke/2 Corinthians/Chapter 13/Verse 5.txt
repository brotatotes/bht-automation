<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5">2 Corinthians 13:5</span>. <i><b>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith</b></i> — εαυτουςπειραζετε. <i>Try yourselves; pierce</i> your hearts; <i>bore</i> <i>yourselves throughout</i>; try yourselves by what I have written, and see whether ye retain the true faith of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Prove your own selves.</b></i> — εαυτουςδοκιμαζετε. <i>Put yourselves</i> <i>to the test</i>, as you would try <i>gold</i> or <i>silver</i> suspected of <i>adulteration</i>. No more take that for <i>Gospel</i> which is not so, than you would take <i>adulterated money</i> for <i>sterling coin</i>. This is a metaphor taken from <i>testing</i> or <i>assaying</i> adulterated metals.</p>
<p><i><b>Know ye not your own selves</b></i> — Are ye not full of wisdom and understanding? And is it not as easy to find out a <i>spurious</i> faith as it is to detect a <i>base coin</i>? There is an <i>assay</i> and <i>touchstone</i> for both. If <i>base</i> metal be mixed with the <i>pure</i> you can readily detect it; and as easily may you know that you are <i>in the faith</i> as you can know that <i>base metal</i> is mixed with the <i>pure</i>. Does Jesus Christ dwell in you? You have his <i>Spirit</i>, his power, his mind, if ye be Christians; and the Spirit of Christ bears witness with your spirit that ye are the children of God. And this is the case except ye <i>be reprobates</i>; αδοκιμοι, <i>base counterfeit coin</i>; mongrel Christians. This metaphor holds excellently here. They had a <i>Judaizing</i> Christian among them; such, presumptively, was the <i>false</i> <i>apostle</i>: they had received his <i>Judaico-Christian</i> doctrine, and were what the prophet said of some of the Israelites in his time. <i>Reprobate silver</i>, adulterated coin, <i>shall men call them</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+6:30">Jeremiah 6:30</span>. And thus, when they were brought to the <i>test</i>, they were found reprobate; that is, adulterated with this mixture of bad doctrine. There is no other kind of reprobation mentioned here than that which refers to the trial and rejection of adulterated coin; and, by way of metaphor, to the detection of false Christianity. This reprobation came of the people themselves: they, not God, adulterated the pure metal. Man pollutes himself; then God reprobates the polluted.</p>
