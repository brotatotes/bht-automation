Verse 2 Corinthians 13:6. Ye shall know that we are not reprobates. â€” Ye have had, and ye shall have, the fullest proof that I have preached the true faith among you; and that God has confirmed it by his testimony; and thus that I am proved and manifested to be what I ought to be, and shown to be approved of God.
