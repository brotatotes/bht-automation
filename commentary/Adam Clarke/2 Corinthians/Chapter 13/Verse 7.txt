<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:7">2 Corinthians 13:7</span>. <i><b>I pray to God that ye do no evil</b></i> — That ye do not persist in that course which will oblige me to use the power of Christ, with which I am endued, to punish you. Some apply this prayer to the apostle himself: <i>Now I pray to God that I may do</i> YOU <i>no evil</i>-that I may not be obliged to use my apostolic <i>rod</i>, and inflict evil upon you.</p>
<p><i><b>Not that we should appear approved</b></i> — We do not wish to give this proof that we are approved of God, by inflicting this punishment on the transgressors.</p>
<p><i><b>But that ye should do that which is honest</b></i> — That ye may do that which is <i>right</i> and <i>seemly</i>, το καλον, <i>though we</i> should <i>be</i>, in consequence of that, <i>as reprobates</i>-as persons <i>not approved</i> of God; because your reformation will <i>prevent</i> the exercise of this power, which would otherwise have given an <i>awful proof</i> that we are <i>approved</i> of God.</p>
