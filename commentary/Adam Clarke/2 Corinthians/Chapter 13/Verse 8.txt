<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:8">2 Corinthians 13:8</span>. <i><b>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>truth.</b></i> â€” As we are the apostles of God, we cannot bring to you any <i>false</i> doctrine; and, as we profess to be under the influence of God's Spirit, we cannot do any thing that is opposed to that truth, or which might be prejudicial to it. On the contrary, what we say and do is <i>for</i> that <i>truth</i>, to propagate and establish it. The Gospel of Jesus is truth; and my testimony concerning it is truth also. In my coming, and in my <i>rod</i>, you have nothing to fear, if you retain and abide in this truth.</p>
