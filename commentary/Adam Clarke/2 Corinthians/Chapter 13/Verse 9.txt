<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:9">2 Corinthians 13:9</span>. <i><b>For we are glad, when we are weak</b></i> — It will give me indescribable pleasure that I should still appear to be <i>poor,</i> <i>despicable</i>, and <i>destitute of this extraordinary power</i> with which God has clothed me, so that you <i>be strong</i> in all the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>And this also we wish</b></i><b>, even </b><i><b>your perfection.</b></i> — We cannot be satisfied that persons, with such eminent endowments, and who have once received the truth as it is in Jesus, should be deficient in any of the graces that constitute the mind of Christ; such as brotherly love, charity, harmony, unity, and order. I have given the above paraphrase to this verse, because of the last term καταρτισιν, which we render <i>perfection</i>. καταρτισις, from κατα, <i>intensive</i>, and αρτιζω, to <i>fit</i> or <i>adapt</i>, signifies the reducing of a <i>dislocated</i> limb to its proper place; and hence, as <i>Beza</i> says on this passage: "The apostle's meaning is, that whereas the <i>members</i> of the Church were all, as it were, <i>dislocated</i> and <i>out of joint</i>, they should be <i>joined together</i> in love; and they should endeavour to make <i>perfect</i> what was amiss among them, either in faith or morals."</p>
<p>It is a metaphor, also, taken from a <i>building</i>; the several <i>stones</i> and <i>timbers</i> being all put in their proper places and situations, so that the whole building might be <i>complete</i>, and be a <i>proper habitation</i> for the owner. The same <i>figure</i>, though not in the same <i>terms</i>, the apostle uses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20-22">Ephesians 2:20-22</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>perfection</i> or <i>rejointing</i> which the apostle wishes is that which refers to the <i>state of the Church</i> in its <i>fellowship, unity,</i> <i>order</i>, c. And <i>perfection</i> in the <i>soul</i> is the same, in reference to it, as perfection in the <i>Church</i> is to its order and unity. The perfection or rejointing of the soul implies its purification, and placing every <i>faculty, passion</i>, and <i>appetite</i> in its proper place so that the original order, harmony, unity, and purity of the soul may be restored; and the whole builded up to be a habitation of God through the Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span>.</p>
