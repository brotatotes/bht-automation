Verse 2 Corinthians 2:10. To whom ye forgive any thing — Here he farther shows them that his sole object in the punishment inflicted on the transgressor, was his amendment and therefore promises to ratify, in the name and authority of Christ, the free pardon which he exhorts them to dispense.In the person of Christ — As I believe Christ acts towards his penitent soul, so do I. Christ forgives his sin, and takes him to his favour; let us forgive him his offence against the Church, and restore him to its communion.
