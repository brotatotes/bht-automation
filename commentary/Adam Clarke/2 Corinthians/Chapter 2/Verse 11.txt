<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:11">2 Corinthians 2:11</span>. <i><b>Lest Satan should get an advantage</b></i> â€” If the man who has given sufficient proof of the sincerity of his repentance be not restored, he may be overwhelmed with sorrow, and sink into despair; and then the discipline of the Church will be represented, not as <i>emendatory</i>, but as leading to <i>destruction</i>. Of this our enemies would most gladly avail themselves, as they wish to discredit this ministry; and there is always at hand a devil to suggest evil, and prompt men to do it; for in this respect we have thorough acquaintance with <i>his devices</i>. Let us therefore be careful to remove, both from Satan and his partisans, all those occasions which might turn to the disadvantage or disparagement of the Gospel of Christ.</p>
