<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Now, thanks</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>unto God</b></i> â€” His coming dispelled all my fears, and was the cause of the highest satisfaction to my mind; and filled my heart with gratitude to God, who is the Author of all good, and who <i>always causes us to triumph in Christ</i>; not only gives us the <i>victory</i>, but such a victory as involves the <i>total ruin</i> of our enemies; and gives us cause of <i>triumphing</i> in him, through whom we have obtained this victory.</p>
<p>A <i>triumph</i>, among the Romans, to which the apostle here alludes, was a public and solemn honour conferred by them on a victorious general, by allowing him a magnificent procession through the city.</p>
<p>This was not granted by the senate unless the general had gained a <i>very signal</i> and <i>decisive victory</i>; conquered a <i>province</i>, c. On such occasions the general was usually clad in a rich purple robe, interwoven with figures of gold, setting forth the grandeur of his achievements his buskins were beset with pearls, and he wore a crown, which at first was of <i>laurel</i>, but was afterwards of pure <i>gold</i>. In one hand he had a branch of <i>laurel</i>, the emblem of <i>victory</i>; and in the other, his truncheon. He was carried in a magnificent chariot, adorned with ivory and plates of gold, and usually drawn by two <i>white horses</i>. (Other animals were also used: when <i>Pompey triumphed</i> over Africa, his chariot was drawn by <i>elephants</i>; that of <i>Mark Antony</i>, by <i>lions</i>; that of <i>Heliogabalus</i>, by <i>tigers</i>; and that of <i>Aurelius</i>, by <i>deer</i>.) His children either sat at his feet in the chariot, or rode on the chariot horses. To keep him humble amidst these great honours a slave stood at his back, casting out incessant railings, and reproaches; and carefully enumerating all his vices, c. <i>Musicians</i> led up the procession, and played triumphal pieces in praise of the general and these were followed by young men, who led the <i>victims</i> which were to be sacrificed on the occasion, with their horns gilded, and their heads and necks adorned with ribbons and garlands. Next followed <i>carts</i> loaded with the spoils taken from the enemy, with their horses, chariots, c. These were followed by the <i>kings, princes</i>, or <i>generals</i> taken in the war, loaded with chains. Immediately after these came the <i>triumphal chariot</i>, before which, as it passed, the people strewed flowers, and shouted <i>Io, triumphe</i>!</p>
<p>The triumphal chariot was followed by the <i>senate</i> and the procession was closed by the priests and their attendants, with the different sacrificial utensils, and a <i>white ox</i>, which was to be the <i>chief victim</i>. They then passed through the <i>triumphal arch</i>, along the <i>via sacra</i> to the <i>capitol</i>, where the victims were slain.</p>
<p>During this time all the temples were opened, and every altar <i>smoked</i> with offerings and incense.</p>
<p>The people at Corinth were sufficiently acquainted with the nature of a <i>triumph</i>: about two hundred years before this, <i>Lucius</i> <i>Mummius</i>, the Roman consul, had conquered all <i>Achaia</i>, destroyed <i>Corinth, Thebes</i>, and <i>Chalcis</i>; and, by order of the senate, had a grand triumph, and was surnamed <i>Achaicus</i>. St. Paul had now a <i>triumph</i> (but of a widely different kind) over the same people; his <i>triumph</i> was in Christ, and to Christ he gives all the glory; his <i>sacrifice</i> was that of <i>thanksgiving</i> to his Lord; and the <i>incense</i> offered on the occasion caused the <i>savour</i> of the knowledge of Christ to be manifested in every place. As the <i>smoke</i> of the victims and <i>incense</i> offered on such an occasion would fill the whole city with their <i>perfume</i>, so the <i>odour</i> of the <i>name</i> and <i>doctrine</i> of Christ filled the whole of Corinth and the neighbouring regions; and the apostles appeared as triumphing in and through Christ, over devils, idols, superstition, ignorance, and vice, wherever they came.</p>
