<p>Verse 15. <i><b>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ</b></i> â€” The apostle still alludes to the case of a <i>triumph</i>; the conqueror always represented the person of <i>Jupiter</i>; as even the heathens supposed that God alone could give the victory: and as the punishment of death was inflicted on <i>some</i> of the <i>captives</i>, who had often rebelled and broken leagues and covenants; so others were spared, made <i>tributaries</i>, and often became <i>allies</i>. Alluding to this, the apostle says: We are a <i>sweet savour to God</i>-we have fulfilled his will in faithfully proclaiming the Gospel, and fighting against sin. And as he has determined that those who <i>believe</i> shall be <i>saved</i>, and those who <i>believe not</i> shall <i>perish,</i> we are equally acceptable to him though we unsuccessfully preach the Gospel to some who obstinately reject it, and so <i>perish</i>, as we are in preaching to others who believe, and are <i>saved</i>.</p>
