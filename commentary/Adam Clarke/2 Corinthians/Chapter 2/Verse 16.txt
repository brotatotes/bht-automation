<p>Verse 16. <i><b>To the one</b></i><b> we are </b><i><b>the savour of death unto death</b></i> — There are several sayings among the ancient Jewish writers similar to this. In <i>Debarim Rabba</i>, sec. i. fol. 248, it is said: "As the bee brings home honey to its owner, but stings others; so it is with the words of the law;" : סם חיים לישראל <i>sam chaiyim leyisrael</i>, "They are a savour of lives to the Israelites:" וסם המות לאומות העולם <i>vesam hammaveth leomoth haolam</i>, "And a savour of death to the people of this world." The learned reader may see much more to this effect in <i>Schoettgen</i>. The apostle's meaning is plain: those who believe and receive the Gospel are saved; those who reject it, perish. The meaning of the rabbins is not less plain: the <i>Israelites</i> received the law and the prophets as from God, and thus possessed the <i>means of salvation</i>; the <i>Gentiles</i> ridiculed and despised them, and thus continued in the path of death. The same happens to the present day to those who receive and to those who reject the Gospel: it is the <i>means</i> of <i>salvation</i> to the former, it is the means of <i>destruction</i> to the latter; for they are not only <i>not saved</i> because they do not believe the Gospel, but they are <i>condemned</i> because they <i>reject</i> it. For how can they escape who neglect so great a salvation? The <i>sun</i> which nourishes the <i>tree</i> that is planted <i>in a good soil</i>, decomposes and destroys it if plucked up and laid on the surface.</p>
<p>That the <i>saved</i>, σωζομενοι, and they that <i>perish</i>, απολλυμενοι mean those who receive and obey the Gospel, and those who reject it and live and die in sin, needs no proof. No other kinds of <i>reprobate</i> and <i>elect</i>, in reference to the <i>eternal world</i>, are known in the BOOK of GOD, though they abound in the <i>books</i> of <i>men</i>. The Jews were possessed with such an exalted opinion of their own excellence that they imagined that all the <i>love</i> and <i>mercy</i> of God were <i>concentrated among themselves</i>, and that God never would extend his grace to the <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
<p>Such sentiments may <i>become</i> JEWS but when we find some <i>Gentiles</i> arrogating to themselves all the salvation of God, and endeavouring to prove that he has excluded the major part even of <i>their own world</i>-the <i>Gentiles</i>, from the <i>possibility</i> of obtaining mercy; and that God has made an <i>eternal purpose</i>, that the death of Christ shall never avail them, and that no <i>saving grace</i> shall ever be granted to them, and that they shall infallibly and eternally perish; what shall we say to such things? It is <i>Judaism</i> in its worst shape: Judaism with innumerable <i>deteriorations</i>. The propagators of such systems must answer for them to God.</p>
<p><i><b>Who</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>sufficient for these things?</b></i> — Is it the <i>false apostle</i> that has been labouring to <i>pervert</i> you? Or, is it the <i>men</i> to whom God has given an extraordinary commission, and sealed it by the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost? That this is the apostle's meaning is evident from the following verse.</p>
