<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>. <i><b>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>God</b></i> — God has made US <i>sufficient for these things</i> by giving us his own pure <i>doctrine</i>, the <i>ministry of reconciliation</i>, which we conscientiously preserve and preach; and we act, not like <i>many</i> among you, who, having received that doctrine, <i>corrupt</i> it; <i>mingling</i> with it their own inventions, and explaining away its force and influence, so as to accommodate it to men of carnal minds.</p>
<p>The word καπηλευοντες, from καπηλος, a <i>tavernkeeper</i>, signifies acting like an unprincipled vintner; for this class of men have ever been <i>notorious</i> for <i>adulterating</i> their wines, mixing them with liquors of no worth, that thereby they might increase their quantity; and thus the <i>mixture</i> was sold for the same price as the <i>pure wine</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:22">Isaiah 1:22</span>, <i>Thy wine is mixed with water</i>, the Septuagint thus translate: οἱ καπηλοι σου μισγουσι τον οινον ὑδατι· "Thy <i>vintners</i> mix thy wine with water;" that is, thy <i>false prophets</i> and <i>corrupt priests</i> <i>adulterate</i> the <i>word of God</i>, and render it of none effect, by their explanations and traditions.</p>
<p>The word has been used, both among the Greeks and Latins, to signify a prostitution of what was <i>right</i> and <i>just,</i> for the sake of <i>gain</i>. So <i>Herodian</i>, lib. vi. cap. 11; Ειρηνην χρυσιου καπηλευοντες, "Making peace for money." So <i>cauponari bellum</i> is, "To make war for money." In short, the word is used to signify any <i>artifice</i> employed to get <i>gain</i> by making a thing look <i>more</i> or <i>better</i> than it is; or <i>mingling</i> that which is <i>excellent</i> with what is not so to promote the gain of the adulterater.</p>
<p>It is used by <i>Aristophanes, Plut</i>. Act. iv., scene 5, ver. 1064, to express an old woman who was <i>patched</i> and <i>painted</i> to hide her deformity. </p>
<p><i><b>But as of sincerity</b></i> — εξ ειλικρινειας. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>. We <i>receive</i> the doctrine <i>pure</i> from God we <i>keep</i> it <i>pure</i>, and <i>deliver</i> it in its purity to mankind. For <i>we speak in Christ</i> - in the things of his Gospel, as being <i>in the sight of God</i> - our whole souls and all their motives being known to him. As the unprincipled vintner <i>knows</i> that he <i>adulterates</i> the <i>wine</i>, his conscience testifying this; so we know that we deliver the sincere truth of God, our conscience witnessing that we deliver it to you, as we receive it, by the inspiration of the Spirit of truth.</p>
<p>1. THAT St. Paul was a man of a very <i>tender</i> and <i>loving spirit</i> is evident from all his epistles; but especially from this, and particularly from the chapter before us. It was not an <i>easy</i> thing with him to give a <i>reproof</i>; and nothing but a sense of his duty to God and his Church could have led him to use his apostolical power, to inflict spiritual punishment on transgressors. He felt like a loving and tender father, who, being obliged to correct his froward and disobedient child, feels in his own heart the pain of a <i>hundred blows</i> for that occasioned by <i>one</i> laid on the body of his son. There are some ministers who think nothing of cutting off members from the Church of Christ; they seem to do it, if not cheerfully, yet with indifference and unconcern! How can this be? Nothing but absolute duty to God should induce any man to separate any person from the visible Church; and then it must be on the conviction that the <i>case is totally hopeless</i>. And who, even in those circumstances, that knows the worth of a soul, can do it without <i>torture</i> of heart?</p>
<p>2. We must not only love the <i>doctrines</i>, but also the <i>morality</i> of the Gospel. He who loves this will not corrupt it; but, as <i>Quesnel</i> says truly, in order to love the truth a man must practise it; as in order to practise it he must love it. That a minister, says he, may preach the word of God in such a manner as is worthy of him, he must, with St. Paul, be always mindful of these <i>three</i> things:</p>
<p>1. That he be sent by God, and that he speak directly from him, and as his ambassador.</p>
<p>2. That he speak as in his <i>presence</i>, and under his <i>immediate inspection</i>.</p>
<p>3. That he consider himself as being in the place of Christ, and endeavour to minister to the souls of men, as he has reason to believe Christ would do, were he in the place; and as he knows Christ <i>did</i>, when he sojourned among men.</p>
<p>The minister of the Gospel is Christ's ambassador; and he prays men in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>. The <i>people</i> should consider the nature of this <i>embassage</i>, and receive it as coming immediately from God, that it may accomplish the <i>end</i> for which he has sent it.</p>
