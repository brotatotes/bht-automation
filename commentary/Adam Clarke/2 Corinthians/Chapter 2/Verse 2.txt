<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:2">2 Corinthians 2:2</span>. <i><b>For if I make you sorry</b></i> â€” Should he have come and used his <i>apostolical authority</i>, in inflicting punishment upon the transgressors, this would have been a common cause of distress. And though he might expect that the <i>sound part</i> of the Church would be a cause of consolation to him, yet as all would be overwhelmed with trouble at the punishment of the transgressors, he could not rejoice to see those whom he loved in distress.</p>
