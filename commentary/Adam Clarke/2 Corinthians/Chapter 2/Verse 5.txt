<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:5">2 Corinthians 2:5</span>. <i><b>But, if any have caused grief</b></i> — Here he seems to refer particularly to the cause of the incestuous person.</p>
<p><i><b>Grieved me, but in part</b></i> — I cannot help thinking that the εκ μερους and απο μερους, which we render <i>in part</i>, and which the apostle uses so frequently in these epistles, are to be referred to the <i>people</i>. A <i>part</i> of them had acknowledged the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>; and here, <i>a part of them</i> had given him cause of grief; and therefore he immediately adds, <i>that I may not overcharge you all</i>; as only a part of you has put me to pain, (viz. the transgressor, and those who had taken his part,) it would be unreasonable that I should <i>load you all</i>, επιβαρω παντας υμας, with the blame which attaches to that party alone.</p>
