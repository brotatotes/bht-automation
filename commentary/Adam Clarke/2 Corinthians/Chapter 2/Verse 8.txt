<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:8">2 Corinthians 2:8</span>. <i><b>That ye would confirm</b></i><b> your </b><i><b>love toward him.</b></i> — You do love him, notwithstanding the reproach he has brought on the Gospel; and notwithstanding your love to him, ye were obliged to cut him off for the credit of the Gospel. Now that he has repented, <i>I beseech you to confirm</i>, κυρωσαι, to <i>ratify</i>, by a public act of the Church, your love to him; give him the <i>fullest</i> <i>proof</i> that you do love him; by forgiving him and restoring him to his place in the Church.</p>
