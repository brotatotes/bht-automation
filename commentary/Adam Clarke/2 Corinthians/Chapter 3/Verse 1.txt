<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span>. <i><b>Do we begin again to commend ourselves</b></i> — By speaking thus of our sincerity, Divine mission, c., is it with a design to conciliate your esteem, or ingratiate ourselves in your affections? By no means.</p>
<p><i><b>Or need we - epistles of commendation</b></i> — Are we so destitute of ministerial abilities and Divine influence that we need, in order to be received in different Churches, to have letters of recommendation? Certainly not. God causes us to triumph through Christ in <i>every place</i> and your conversion is such an evident <i>seal</i> to our ministry as leaves no doubt that God is with us.</p>
<p><b>Letters </b><i><b>of commendation</b></i> — Were frequent in the <i>primitive</i> Church; and were also in use in the <i>apostolic</i> Church, as we learn from this place. But these were, in all probability, not used by the <i>apostles</i>; their helpers, successors, and those who had not the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, needed such letters and they were necessary to prevent the Churches from being imposed on by false teachers. But when <i>apostles</i> came, they brought their own testimonials, the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
