<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:10">2 Corinthians 3:10</span>. <i><b>For even that which was made glorious</b></i> — The <i>law</i>, which was exhibited for a time in great glory and splendour, partly when it was given, and partly by the splendour of God in the tabernacle and first temple; but all this <i>ceased</i> and <i>was done</i> <i>away</i>; was intended to give place to the <i>Gospel</i>; and has actually given place to that system; so that <i>now</i>, in no part of the world is that law performed, even by the people who are attached to it and reject the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>The glory that excelleth.</b></i> — The Gospel dispensation, giving supereminent displays of the justice, holiness, goodness, mercy, and majesty of God.</p>
