Verse 2 Corinthians 3:10. For even that which was made glorious — The law, which was exhibited for a time in great glory and splendour, partly when it was given, and partly by the splendour of God in the tabernacle and first temple; but all this ceased and was done away; was intended to give place to the Gospel; and has actually given place to that system; so that now, in no part of the world is that law performed, even by the people who are attached to it and reject the Gospel.The glory that excelleth. — The Gospel dispensation, giving supereminent displays of the justice, holiness, goodness, mercy, and majesty of God.
