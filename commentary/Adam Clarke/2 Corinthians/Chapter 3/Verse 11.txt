<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:11">2 Corinthians 3:11</span>. <i><b>For if that which is done away</b></i>, c.] Here is another striking difference between the <i>law</i> and the <i>Gospel</i>. The former is termed τοκαταργουμενον, that <i>which</i> is <i>counterworked</i> and <i>abolished</i> the latter τομενον, <i>that</i> which <i>continues</i>, which is not for a particular <i>time, place</i>, and <i>people</i>, as the law was; but for ALL times, all places, and all <i>people</i>. As a <i>great,</i> <i>universal</i>, and <i>permanent</i> GOOD vastly excels a <i>good</i> that is <i>small, partial</i>, and <i>transitory</i>; so does the Gospel dispensation, that of the law.</p>
