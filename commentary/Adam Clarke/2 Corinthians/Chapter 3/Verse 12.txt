<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:12">2 Corinthians 3:12</span>. <i><b>Seeing - we have such hope</b></i> — Such glorious prospects as those blessings which the Gospel sets before us, producing such <i>confidence</i>, as the fulfilment of so many promises has already done, that God will still continue to work for us and by us;</p>
<p><i><b>We use great plainness of speech</b></i> — πολλη παρρησια χρωμεθα. We speak not only with all <i>confidence</i>, but with all imaginable <i>plainness</i>; keeping back nothing; disguising nothing; concealing nothing: and here we differ greatly from the Jewish doctors, and from the Gentile philosophers, who affect <i>obscurity</i>, and endeavour, by figures, metaphors, and allegories, to hide every thing from the vulgar. But we wish that all may <i>hear</i>; and we speak so that all may <i>understand</i>.</p>
