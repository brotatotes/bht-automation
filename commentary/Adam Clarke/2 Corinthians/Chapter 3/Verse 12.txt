Verse 2 Corinthians 3:12. Seeing - we have such hope — Such glorious prospects as those blessings which the Gospel sets before us, producing such confidence, as the fulfilment of so many promises has already done, that God will still continue to work for us and by us;We use great plainness of speech — πολλη παρρησια χρωμεθα. We speak not only with all confidence, but with all imaginable plainness; keeping back nothing; disguising nothing; concealing nothing: and here we differ greatly from the Jewish doctors, and from the Gentile philosophers, who affect obscurity, and endeavour, by figures, metaphors, and allegories, to hide every thing from the vulgar. But we wish that all may hear; and we speak so that all may understand.
