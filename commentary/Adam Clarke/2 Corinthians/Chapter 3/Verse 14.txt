<p>Verse 14. <i><b>But their minds were blinded</b></i> — By resting in the letter, shutting their eyes against the light that was granted to them, they contracted a <i>hardness</i> or <i>stupidity</i> of heart. And the veil that was on the face of Moses, which prevented the glory of his face from shining <i>out</i>, may be considered as emblematical of the veil of darkness and ignorance that is on their hearts, and which hinders the glory of the Gospel from shining <i>in</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Until this day remaineth the same veil</b></i> — They are still ignorant of the spiritual meaning and intention of their own law, called here παλαια διαθηκη, <i>the old covenant</i>. See the word explained in the <i>preface</i> to St. Matthew.</p>
<p><i><b>In the reading of the Old Testament</b></i> — Here is an evident allusion to the conduct of the Jews in their synagogues: when they read the law they cover their whole head with a veil, which they term the טלית <i>tallith, veil</i>, from טלל <i>talal, to cover</i>; and this voluntary usage of theirs, the apostle tells us, is an emblem of the darkness of their hearts while they are employed even in sacred duties.</p>
<p><i><b>Which</b></i><b> veil </b><i><b>is done away in Christ.</b></i> — It is only by acknowledging <i>Christ</i> that the darkness is removed, and the <i>end</i> and <i>spiritual meaning</i> of the law discerned.</p>
