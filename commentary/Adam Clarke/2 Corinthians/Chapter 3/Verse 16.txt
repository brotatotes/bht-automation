<p>Verse 16. <i><b>When it shall turn to the Lord</b></i> â€” When the Israelitish <i>nation</i> shall turn to the LORD <i>Jesus</i>, the veil shall be taken away; the true light shall shine; and they shall see all things clearly.</p>
<p>There is an evident allusion here to the case of Moses, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:34">Exodus 34:34</span>. When he <i>came from</i> the Lord, and spoke to the Israelites, he put the veil over his face; but when he <i>returned</i> to speak with the Lord, then he <i>took off the veil</i>. So, when the Israelitish nation shall <i>return</i> to speak with and <i>pray</i> to the <i>Lord Jesus</i>, the veil of darkness and ignorance shall be taken away from their hearts; but <i>never before</i> that time. The words seem to imply:</p>
<p>1. That there will be a <i>conversion</i> of the Jews to Christianity; and,</p>
<p>2. That this conversion will be <i>en masse</i>; that a time will come when the <i>whole nation</i> of the Jews, in every place, shall turn to Christ; and then the Gentiles and Jews make one fold, under one Shepherd and Bishop of all souls.</p>
