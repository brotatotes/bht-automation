<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Now the Lord is that Spirit</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:8">2 Corinthians 3:8</span>, the word το πνευμα, <i>spirit</i>, evidently signifies the Gospel; so called because it points out the <i>spiritual nature</i> and <i>meaning</i> of the <i>law</i>; because it produces spiritual effects; and because it is especially the dispensation of the Spirit of God. Here Jesus Christ is represented as that <i>Spirit</i>, because he is the <i>end</i> of the <i>law</i> for justification to every one <i>that believes</i>; and because the residue of the Spirit is with him, and he is the dispenser of all its gifts, graces, and influences.</p>
<p><i><b>And where the Spirit of the Lord is</b></i> — Wherever this Gospel is received, there the Spirit of the Lord is given; and wherever that Spirit lives and works, there is <i>liberty</i>, not only from Jewish bondage, but from the <i>slavery</i> of sin-from its <i>power</i>, its <i>guilt</i>, and its <i>pollution</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:33-36">John 8:33-36</span>, and the notes there.</p>
