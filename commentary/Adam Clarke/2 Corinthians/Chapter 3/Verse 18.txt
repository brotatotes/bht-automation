<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>. <i><b>But we all, with open face</b></i> — The Jews were not able to look on the face of Moses, the <i>mediator</i> of the <i>old covenant</i>, and therefore he was obliged to <i>veil</i> it; but <i>all we</i> Christians, with <i>face uncovered, behold</i>, as clearly as we can see our own natural face in a <i>mirror</i>, the glorious promises and privileges of the Gospel of Christ; and while we contemplate, we anticipate them by <i>desire</i> and <i>hope</i>, and apprehend them by <i>faith</i>, and are <i>changed from the glory</i> there represented to the <i>enjoyment</i> of the <i>thing</i> which is represented, even the glorious image-righteousness and true holiness-of the God of glory.</p>
<p><i><b>As by the Spirit of the Lord.</b></i> — By the energy of that Spirit of Christ which gives life and being to all the promises of the Gospel; and thus we are made partakers of the Divine nature and escape all the corruptions that are in the world. This appears to me to be the general sense of this verse: its peculiar terms may be more particularly explained.</p>
<p>The word κατοπτριζομενοι, <i>catoptrizomenoi</i>, acting on the doctrine of <i>catoptries</i>, which we translate <i>beholding in a glass</i>, comes from κατα, <i>against</i>, and οπτομαι, <i>I look</i>; and properly conveys the sense of <i>looking into a mirror</i>, or discerning by <i>reflected</i> light. Now as <i>mirrors</i>, among the Jews, Greeks, and Romans, were made of highly polished <i>metal</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>,) it would often happen, especially in strong light, that the face would be greatly <i>illuminated</i> by this strongly <i>reflected</i> light; and to this circumstance the apostle seems here to allude. So, by earnestly contemplating the Gospel of Jesus, and believing on him who is its Author, the soul becomes illuminated with his Divine splendour, for this sacred mirror reflects back on the believing soul the <i>image</i> of Him whose perfections it exhibits; and thus we see the glorious <i>form</i> after which our minds are to be fashioned; and by believing and receiving the influence of his Spirit, μεταμορφουμεθα, our form <i>is changed</i>, τηναυτηνεικονα, <i>into the same image</i>, which we behold there; and this is the image of God, lost by our <i>fall</i>, and now recovered and restored by Jesus Christ: for the shining of the face of God upon us, i.e. approbation, through Christ, is the cause of our transformation into the Divine image.</p>
<p>DR. WHITBY, in his notes on this chapters produces six instances in which the apostle shows the Gospel to be superior to the law; I shall transcribe them without farther illustration:-</p>
<p>1. The glory appearing on mount <i>Sinai</i> made the people <i>afraid of</i> <i>death</i>, saying: <i>Let not God speak to us any more, lest we die</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:19">Exodus 20:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:16">Deuteronomy 18:16</span>; and thus <i>they received the spirit of bondage to fear</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>. Whilst <i>we</i> have given to us the <i>spirit of power</i>, and <i>love</i>, and of a sound mind, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</span>; and <i>the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father</i>! and to this difference the Epistle to the Hebrews alludes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:18-24">Hebrews 12:18-24</span>.</p>
<p>2. Moses, with all his glory, was only the minister of the law, written on <i>tables of stone</i>; the apostles are ministers of the Gospel, written on the <i>hearts of believers</i>. Moses gave the Jews only the <i>letter that killeth</i>; the apostles gave the <i>Gospel</i>, which is accompanied with the <i>spirit</i> that gives <i>life</i>.</p>
<p>3. The glory which Moses received at the giving of the law did more and more <i>diminish</i>, because his law was to <i>vanish away</i>; but the glory which is received from Christ is an <i>increasing</i> glory; the <i>doctrine</i> and the <i>Divine influence</i> remaining for ever.</p>
<p>4. The <i>law</i> was <i>veiled</i> under <i>types</i> and <i>shadows</i>; but the <i>Gospel</i> has scarcely any ceremonies; <i>baptism</i> and the <i>Lord's Supper</i> being all that can be properly called such: and BELIEVE, LOVE, OBEY, the great precepts of the Gospel, are delivered with the utmost perspicuity. And indeed the whole doctrine of <i>Christ</i> <i>crucified</i> is made as plain as human language can make it.</p>
<p>5. The <i>Jews</i> only saw the <i>shining</i> of the face of Moses <i>through a</i> <i>veil</i>; but <i>we</i> behold the glory of the Gospel of Christ, in the person of Christ our Lawgiver, <i>with open face</i>.</p>
<p>6. <i>They</i> saw it through a veil, which prevented the reflection or shining of it <i>upon them</i>; and so this glory shone only on the <i>face of Moses</i>, but not at all upon the people. Whereas the <i>glory</i> <i>of God</i>, in <i>the face of Jesus Christ</i>, shines as in a mirror which reflects the image upon Christian believers, so that they are <i>transformed into the same image</i>, deriving the glorious gifts and graces of the Spirit, with the Gospel, from Christ the Lord and Distributor of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span>; and so, the glory which he had from the Father he has given to his genuine followers, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:22">John 17:22</span>. It is, therefore, rather with true Christians as it was with Moses himself, concerning whom God speaks thus: <i>With him will I speak</i> <i>mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the</i> <i>similitude of the Lord</i> (την δοξαν κυριον, <i>the glory of the Lord</i>) <i>shall he behold</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8">Numbers 12:8</span>. For as he saw the glory of God <i>apparently</i>, so we <i>with open face</i> behold the glory of the Lord: as he, by seeing of this glory, was <i>changed into the same likeness</i>, and his <i>face shone</i>, or was δεδοξασμενη, <i>made glorious</i>; so <i>we</i>, beholding the glory of the Lord in the face of Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>, are changed into the same glory.</p>
<p>Thus we find that in every thing the <i>Gospel</i> has a decided superiority over the <i>law</i> and its <i>institutions</i>.</p>
