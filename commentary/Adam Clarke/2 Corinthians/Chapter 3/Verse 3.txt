<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span>. <i><b>Manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ</b></i> — Ye are in our hearts, and Christ has written you there; but yourselves are the <i>epistle of Christ</i>; the change produced in your hearts and lives, and the salvation which you have received, are as truly the work of Christ as a letter dictated and written by a man in his work.</p>
<p><i><b>Ministered by us</b></i> — Ye are the writing, but Christ used me as the <i>pen</i>; Christ <i>dictated</i>, and I wrote; and the Divine characters are not made with <i>ink, but by the Spirit of the living God</i>; for the gifts and graces that constitute the mind that was in Christ are produced in you by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><i><b>Not in tables of stone</b></i> — Where men engrave contracts, or record events; <i>but in fleshly tables of the heart</i>-the work of salvation taking place in all your affections, appetites, and desires; working that change <i>within</i> that is so signally manifested <i>without</i>. See the parts of this figurative speech:</p>
<p>1. Jesus Christ <i>dictates</i>.</p>
<p>2. The apostle <i>writes</i>.</p>
<p>3. The <i>hearts</i> of the Corinthians are the substance on which the writing is made. And,</p>
<p>4. The Holy Spirit produces that <i>influence</i> by which the <i>traces</i> are made, and the mark becomes evident.</p>
<p>Here is not only an allusion to making inscriptions on stones, where one <i>dictates</i> the matter, and another <i>cuts</i> the letters; (and probably there were certain cases where some <i>colouring matter</i> was used to make the inscription the more <i>legible</i>; and when the stone was engraved, it was set up in some public place, as monuments, inscriptions, and contracts were, that they might be <i>seen, known</i>, and <i>read of all men</i>;) but the apostle may here refer to the <i>ten commandments</i>, written by the finger of God upon <i>two tables of stone</i>; which writing was an evidence of the Divine mission of Moses, as the conversion of the Corinthians was an evidence of the mission of St. Paul. But it may be as well to take the words in a general sense, as the expression is not unfrequent either in the Old Testament, or in the rabbinical writers. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
