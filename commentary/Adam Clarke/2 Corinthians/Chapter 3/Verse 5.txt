<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:5">2 Corinthians 3:5</span>. <i><b>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves</b></i> — We do not arrogate to ourselves any power to enlighten the mind or change the heart, we are only <i>instruments</i> in the hand of God. Nor was it possible for us apostles to <i>think</i>, to <i>invent</i>, such a scheme of salvation as is the Gospel; and if we even had been equal to the <i>invention</i>, how could we have <i>fulfilled</i> such <i>promises</i> as this scheme of salvation abounds with? God alone could fulfil these promises, and he fulfils only those which he makes himself. All these promises have been <i>amen</i>-ratified and fulfilled to you who have believed on Christ Jesus according to our preaching; therefore, ye are God's workmanship and it is only by God's <i>sufficiency</i> that we have been able to do any thing. This I believe to be the apostle's meaning in this place, and that he speaks here merely of the Gospel scheme, and the inability of human wisdom to invent it; and the words λογισασθαι τι, which we translate <i>to think any thing</i>, signify, properly, to <i>find any thing</i> <i>out by reasoning</i>; and as the Gospel scheme of salvation is the subject in hand, to that subject the words are to be referred and limited. The words, however, contain also a <i>general truth</i>; we can neither <i>think, act</i>, nor <i>be</i>, without God. From him we have received all <i>our powers</i>, whether of <i>body</i> or of <i>mind</i>, and without him we can do nothing. But we may abuse both our power of <i>thinking</i> and <i>acting</i>; for the power to <i>think</i>, and the power to <i>act</i>, are widely different from the <i>act of thinking</i>, and the <i>act of</i> <i>doing</i>. God gives us the power or capacity to <i>think</i> and <i>act</i>, but he neither <i>thinks</i> nor <i>acts</i> for us. It is on this ground that we may abuse our powers, and think evil, and act wickedly; and it is on <i>this ground</i> that we are accountable for our thoughts, words, and deeds.</p>
