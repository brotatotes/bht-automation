<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>. <i><b>Who hath made us able ministers</b></i> — This is a more formal answer to the question, <i>Who is sufficient for these things</i>? προς ταυτα τις ἱκανος; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:16">2 Corinthians 2:16</span>. God, says the apostle, has made us <i>able ministers</i>; ἱκανωσεν ἡμας διακονους, <i>he has made us</i> <i>sufficient for these things</i>; for the reader will observe that he uses the same word in both places. We apostles execute, under the Divine influence, what God himself has devised. We are ministers of the new covenant; of this new dispensation of truth, light, and life, by Christ Jesus; a system which not only proves itself to have come from God, but necessarily implies that God himself by his own Spirit is a continual agent in it, ever bringing its mighty purposes to pass. On the words καινη διαθηκη, <i>new</i> <i>covenant</i>, see the PREFACE to the gospel of St. Matthew.</p>
<p><i><b>Not of the letter, but of the Spirit</b></i> — The apostle does not mean here, as some have imagined, that he states himself to be a minister of the New Testament, in opposition to the Old; and that it is the <i>Old Testament</i> that kills, and the <i>New</i> that gives life; but that the New Testament gives the proper meaning of the Old; for the old covenant had its <i>letter</i> and its <i>spirit</i>, its <i>literal</i> and its <i>spiritual</i> meaning. The <i>law</i> was founded on the very supposition of the <i>Gospel</i>; and all its sacrifices, types, and ceremonies refer to the Gospel. The Jews <i>rested</i> in the <i>letter</i>, which not only afforded no <i>means of life</i>, but <i>killed</i>, by condemning every transgressor to death. They did not look at the <i>spirit</i>; did not endeavour to find out the spiritual meaning; and therefore they rejected Christ, who was the <i>end of the law for</i> <i>justification</i>; and so for redemption from death to every one that believes. The <i>new covenant</i> set all these spiritual things at once before their eyes, and showed them the <i>end, object</i>, and <i>design</i> of the <i>law</i>; and thus the apostles who preached it were ministers of that <i>Spirit</i> which gives life.</p>
<p>Every institution has its <i>letter</i> as well as its <i>spirit</i>, as every <i>word</i> must refer to <i>something</i> of which it is the <i>sign</i> or <i>significator</i>. The <i>Gospel</i> has both its <i>letter</i> and its <i>spirit</i>; and multitudes of professing Christians, by <i>resting in the</i> LETTER, receive not the <i>life</i> which it is calculated to impart. <i>Water</i>, in baptism, is the <i>letter</i> that points out the <i>purification of the</i> <i>soul</i>; they who rest in this letter are without this purification; and dying in that state they die eternally. <i>Bread</i> and <i>wine</i> in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, are the <i>letter</i>; the <i>atoning</i> <i>efficacy of the death of Jesus</i>, and the <i>grace</i> communicated by this to the soul of a believer, are the <i>spirit</i>. Multitudes rest in this <i>letter</i>, simply receiving these symbols, without reference to the <i>atonement</i>, or to their guilt; and thus lose the benefit of the atonement and the salvation of their souls. The whole Christian life is comprehended by our Lord under the letter, <i>Follow me</i>. Does not any one see that a man, taking up this <i>letter</i> only, and following Christ through <i>Judea, Galilee, Samaria</i>, c., to the <i>city, temple, villages, seacoast, mountains</i>, &amp;c., fulfilled no part of the <i>spirit</i> and might, with all this <i>following</i>, lose his soul? Whereas the SPIRIT, viz. <i>receive</i> my <i>doctrine, believe</i> my <i>sayings</i>, look by <i>faith</i> for the fulfilment of my <i>promises</i>, imitate my <i>example</i>, would necessarily lead him to life eternal. It may be safely asserted that the <i>Jews</i>, in no period of their history, ever rested more in the <i>letter</i> of their law than the vast majority of Christians are doing in the <i>letter</i> of the <i>Gospel</i>. Unto multitudes of Christians Christ may truly say: <i>Ye will not come unto me that</i> <i>ye may</i> have <i>life</i>.</p>
