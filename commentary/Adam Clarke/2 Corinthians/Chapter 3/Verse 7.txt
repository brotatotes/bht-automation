<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>. <i><b>The ministration of death</b></i> — Here the apostle evidently intends the <i>law</i>. It was a ministration, διακονια or <i>service</i> of <i>death</i>. It was the province of the law to ascertain the <i>duty</i> of man; to <i>assign</i> his <i>duties</i>; to fix <i>penalties</i> for transgressions, c. and by it is the knowledge of sin. As man is prone to sin, and is continually committing it, this law was to him a continual <i>ministration of death</i>. Its <i>letter</i> killed; and it was only the <i>Gospel</i> to which it referred that could <i>give life</i>, because that Gospel held out the only available <i>atonement</i>.</p>
<p>Yet this ministration of death (the ten commandments, written on stones; a part of the Mosaic institutions being put for the whole) was <i>glorious</i>-was full of <i>splendour</i>; for the apostle refers to the <i>thunderings</i>, and <i>lightnings</i>, and <i>luminous appearances</i>, which took place in the giving of the law; so that the very <i>body</i> of Moses partook of the <i>effulgence</i> in such a manner that the children of Israel could not look upon his face; and he, to hide it, was obliged to use a <i>veil</i>. All this was intended to show the excellency of that law, as an institution coming immediately from God: and the apostle gives it all its heightenings, that he may compare it to the Gospel, and thereby prove that, <i>glorious</i> as it was, it had no glory that could be compared with that of the <i>Gospel</i>; and that even the glory it had was a glory that was to be <i>done away</i>-to be absorbed, as the light of the stars, planets, and moon, is absorbed in the splendour of the sun.
