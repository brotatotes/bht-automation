Verse 2 Corinthians 3:8. The ministration of the Spirit — The Gospel dispensation, which gives the true spiritual sense of the law.Be rather glorious? — Forasmuch as the thing signified is of infinitely more consequence than that by which it is signified. The THING bread will preserve a man alive; the WORD bread can give life to nothing.
