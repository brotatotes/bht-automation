<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:8">2 Corinthians 3:8</span>. <i><b>The ministration of the Spirit</b></i> — The Gospel dispensation, which gives the true spiritual sense of the law.</p>
<p><i><b>Be rather glorious?</b></i> — Forasmuch as the thing signified is of infinitely more consequence than that <i>by which</i> it is signified. The THING <i>bread</i> will preserve a man <i>alive</i>; the WORD <i>bread</i> can give life to nothing.</p>
