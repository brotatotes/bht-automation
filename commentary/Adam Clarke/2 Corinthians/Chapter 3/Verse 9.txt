<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:9">2 Corinthians 3:9</span>. <i><b>The ministration of condemnation</b></i> — The <i>law</i>, which ascertained sin, and condemned it to just punishment.</p>
<p><i><b>The ministration of righteousness</b></i> — The Gospel, the grand business of which was to proclaim the doctrine δικαιοσυνης, <i>of</i> <i>justification</i>; and to show how <i>God</i> could <i>be just</i> and <i>yet the</i> <i>justifier of him who believeth in Jesus</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Exceed in glory.</b></i> — For great, glorious, and awful as the law may be, in its opposition to sin, which is a reproach to man, and a dishonour to God; and in its punishment of sin; yet it must be vastly exceeded by that system which, evidencing an <i>equal</i> abhorrence of sin, finds out a method to <i>forgive</i> it; to take away its <i>guilt</i> from the conscience, and remove all its infection from the soul. That this <i>could</i> be done the law pointed out by its <i>blood of bulls and of goats</i>: but every considerate mind must see that it was impossible for these to take away sin; it is the <i>Gospel</i> that does what the law signified; and forasmuch as the <i>performance</i> of a promise is greater than the <i>promise</i> itself, and the <i>substance</i> of a man is greater than the <i>shadow</i> projected by that substance; so is the Gospel of Jesus Christ greater than the law, with all its promises, types, ceremonies, and shadows.</p>
