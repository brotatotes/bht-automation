<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1">2 Corinthians 4:1</span>. <i><b>Seeing we have this ministry</b></i> — The <i>Gospel</i>, of which he gave that noble account which we read in the preceding chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>We faint not</b></i> — We meet with many tribulations, but are supported in and through all by the grace of the Gospel. Instead of ουκ εκκακουμεν, <i>we faint not</i>, ουκ εγκακουμεν, <i>we act not</i> <i>wickedly</i>, is the reading of ADFG, and some others. Wakefield thinks it the genuine reading; it certainly makes a very good sense with what goes before and what follows. If we follow this reading the whole verse may be read thus: <i>Wherefore, as we have</i> <i>obtained mercy</i>, or <i>been graciously intrusted</i>, ηλεηθημην, <i>with</i> <i>this ministry, we do not act wickedly, but have renounced the</i> <i>hidden things of dishonesty</i>, &amp;c.</p>
