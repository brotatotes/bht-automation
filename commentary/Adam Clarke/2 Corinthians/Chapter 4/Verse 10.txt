<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>. <i><b>Always bearing about in the body</b></i>, c.] Being every moment in danger of losing our lives in the cause of truth, as Jesus Christ was. We, in a word, bear his cross, and are ready to offer up our lives for him. There is probably an allusion here to the marks, wounds, and bruises which the contenders in those games got, and continued to carry throughout life.</p>
<p><i><b>That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest</b></i> â€” That in our preservation, the success of our ministry, and the miracles we work, we might be able to give the fullest demonstration that Jesus <i>is risen again</i> from the dead and that we are strengthened by him to do all these mighty works.</p>
