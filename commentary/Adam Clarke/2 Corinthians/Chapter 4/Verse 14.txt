<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Knowing that he which raised up the Lord</b></i>, &amp;c.] And though we shall at last seal this truth with our blood, we fear not, being persuaded that as the body of Christ was raised from the dead by the power of the Father, so shall our bodies be raised, and that we shall have an eternal life with him in glory.</p>
