<p>Verse 16. <i><b>For which cause we faint not</b></i> — ουκ εκκα κουμεν. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1">2 Corinthians 4:1</span>. Here we have the same various reading; εγκακουμεν, <i>we do no wickedness</i>; and it is supported by BDEFG, and some others: but it is remarkable that Mr. Wakefield follows the common reading <i>here</i>, though the various-reading is at least as well supported in this verse as in verse first. The common reading, <i>faint not</i>, appears to agree best with the apostle's meaning.</p>
<p><i><b>But though our outward man</b></i> — That is, our <i>body</i>-that part of us that can be <i>seen, heard</i>, and <i>felt, perish</i>-be slowly consumed by continual trials and afflictions, and be martyred at last;</p>
<p><i><b>Yet the inward man</b></i> — Our <i>soul</i>-that which cannot be felt or seen by others, is <i>renewed</i>-is <i>revived</i>, and receives a daily increase of light and life from God, so that we grow more holy, more happy, and more meet for glory every day.</p>
<p>It was an opinion among the Jews that even <i>spirits</i> stood in need of continual <i>renovation</i>. They say that "God renews the angels daily, by putting them into the fiery river from which they proceeded, and then gives them the same name they had before." And they add, that in like manner he renews the hearts of the Israelites every year, when they turn to him by repentance. It is a good antidote against the fear of death to find, as the body <i>grows old and decays</i>, the soul <i>grows young</i> and is <i>invigorated</i>. By the <i>outward man</i> and the <i>inward man</i> St. Paul shows that he was no <i>materialist</i>: he believed that we have both a <i>body</i> and a <i>soul</i>; and so far was he from supposing that when the <i>body</i> dies the <i>whole</i> <i>man</i> is decomposed, and continues so to the resurrection, that he asserts that the decays of the one lead to the invigorating of the other; and that the very decomposition of the body itself leaves the soul in the state of renewed youth. The vile doctrine of <i>materialism</i> is not <i>apostolic</i>.</p>
