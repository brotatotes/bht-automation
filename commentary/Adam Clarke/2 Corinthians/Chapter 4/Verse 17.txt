<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For our light affliction</b></i>, c.] Mr. Blackwall, in his sacred classics, has well illustrated this passage. I shall here produce his paraphrase as quoted by <i>Dr. Dodd</i>: "This is one of the most emphatic passages in all St. Paul's writings, in which he speaks as much like an <i>orator</i> as he does as an apostle. The <i>lightness</i> of the trial is expressed by το ελαφρον της θλιψεως, <i>the</i> <i>lightness of our affliction</i> as if he had said, it is even levity itself in such a comparison. On the other hand, the καθ' ὑπερβολην εις ὑπερβολην, which we render <i>far more exceeding</i>, is infinitely emphatical, and cannot be fully expressed by any translation. It signifies that all hyperboles fall short of describing that weight-eternal glory, so solid and lasting, that you may pass from hyperbole to hyperbole, and yet, when you have gained the last, are infinitely below it. It is every where visible what influence St. Paul's Hebrew had on his Greek: כבד <i>cabad</i>, signifies to be <i>heavy</i>, and to be <i>glorious</i>; the apostle in his Greek unites these two significations, and says, WEIGHT <i>of</i> GLORY."</p>
<p>St. <i>Chrysostom's</i> observations on these words are in his very best manner, and are both judicious and beautiful:</p>
<p>"The apostle opposes things <i>present</i> to things <i>future</i>; a <i>moment</i> to <i>eternity; lightness</i> to <i>weight; affliction</i> to <i>glory</i>. Nor is he satisfied with this, but he adds another word, and <i>doubles</i> it, saying, καθ' ὑπερβολην εις ὑπερβολην. This is a magnitude excessively exceeding." See <i>Parkhurst</i>, sub voce υπερβολη.</p>
