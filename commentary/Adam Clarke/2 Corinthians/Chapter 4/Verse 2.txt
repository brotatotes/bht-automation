<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span>. <i><b>But have renounced</b></i> — απειπαμεθα. We have disclaimed <i>the hidden things of dishonesty</i>; τα κρυπτα της αισχυνης, <i>the</i> <i>hidden things of shame</i>; those things which wicked men do; and which they are ashamed to have known, and ashamed to own. Dr. <i>Whitby</i> thinks that the apostle refers to carnal abominations, of which the Jews and their rabbins were notoriously guilty. And it does appear from the first epistle that there were persons in Corinth who taught that <i>fornication</i> was no sin; and it appears also that several had taken the part of the <i>incestuous</i> person.</p>
<p><i><b>Not walking in craftiness</b></i> — πανουργια. In <i>subtlety</i> and <i>clever cunning</i>, as the false teachers did, who were accomplished fellows, and <i>capable</i> of <i>any thing</i>. The word is compounded of παν, <i>all</i>, and εργον, <i>work</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor handling the word of God deceitfully</b></i> — Not using the doctrines of the Gospel to serve any <i>secular</i> or <i>carnal</i> purpose; not explaining away their force so as to palliate or excuse sin; not generalizing its precepts so as to excuse many in particular circumstances from obedience, especially in that which most crossed their inclinations. There were deceitful handlers of this kind in Corinth, and there are many of them still in the garb of Christian ministers; persons who disguise that part of their creed which, though they believe it is of God, would make them <i>unpopular</i>, affecting <i>moderation</i> in order to procure a larger audience and more extensive support; not attacking prevalent and popular vices; calling <i>dissipation of mind, relaxation</i>; and worldly and carnal <i>pleasures</i>, innocent amusements, c. In a word, turning with the tide, and shifting with the wind of popular opinion, prejudice, fashion, c.</p>
<p><i><b>But by manifestation of the truth</b></i> — An open, explicit acknowledgment of what we know to be the <i>truth</i>-what we are assured is the Gospel of Jesus concealing nothing blunting the edge of no truth; explaining spiritual things, not in the words of man's wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Commending ourselves to every man's conscience</b></i> — Speaking so that every man's conscience shall bear its testimony that we proclaim the truth of God. This is one characteristic of Divine truth: even every man's <i>conscience</i> will acknowledge it, though it speak decidedly against his own practices.</p>
<p><i><b>In the sight of God.</b></i> — Whose eye is ever on the heart and conscience of man, and who always bears testimony to his own word.</p>
