<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:3">2 Corinthians 4:3</span>. <i><b>But if our Gospel be hid</b></i> — κεκαλυμμενον. <i>Veiled</i>; he refers to the subject that he had treated so particularly in the conclusion of the preceding chapter. If there be a <i>veil on the</i> <i>Gospel</i>, it is only to the wilfully blind; and if any man's heart be <i>veiled</i> that hears this Gospel, it is a proof that he is among the <i>lost</i>, απολλυμενοι, those who are fully under the power of sin; who have given up themselves to work wickedness; persons who are mere <i>heathens</i>, or live like such, and yet such as Jesus Christ came to <i>seek</i> and <i>save</i>; for the word does not necessarily imply those that will <i>perish eternally</i>, but is a common epithet to point out a man without the Gospel and without God in the world. Christ commands his disciples in preaching the Gospel <i>to go to</i> προβατα τα απολωλοτα, <i>the</i> LOST <i>sheep of the house of Israel</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:6">Matthew 10:6</span>; for himself says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:11">Matthew 18:11</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:10">Luke 19:10</span>: <i>The Son of man is come</i> ζητησαι και σωσαι το απολωλος, <i>to seek and</i> <i>to</i> SAVE <i>that which is</i> LOST. And such persons he represents under the parable of the <i>lost sheep</i>; for <i>to find</i> το απολωλος, <i>that</i> <i>which is</i> LOST, the good shepherd <i>leaves the ninety-and-nine in the</i> <i>wilderness</i>, and goes in search of <i>it</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:12">Matthew 18:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:4">Luke 15:4</span>. The word more properly signifies, in all those connections, and in the parallel passages, not those who ARE LOST, but those who <i>are</i> <i>perishing</i>; and will perish, if not sought and saved.</p>
