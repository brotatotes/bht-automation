<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>. <i><b>In whom the god of this world</b></i>, c.] We see here that those whose minds are blinded, are they who believe not and because they believe not, their minds continue in darkness, and are proper subjects for <i>Satan</i> to work on; and he <i>deepens</i> the <i>darkness</i>, and <i>increases</i> the <i>hardness</i>. But who is meant by the <i>god of this world</i>? It is generally answered, the same who is called the <i>prince of this world</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span>. But the question recurs, who <i>is</i> the <i>prince of this world</i>? and the answer to both is, SATAN. The reader will do well to consult the notes on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span><i>"</i>, and the concluding observations on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span><i>"</i>. I must own I feel considerable reluctance to assign the epithet ο θεος, THE <i>God</i>, to <i>Satan</i>; and were there not a rooted prejudice in favour of the common opinion, the contrary might be well vindicated, viz. that by <i>the God of this world</i> the <i>supreme Being</i> is meant, who in his judgment gave over the minds of the <i>unbelieving Jews</i> to spiritual darkness, so that <i>destruction</i> came upon them to the uttermost. Satan, it is true, has said that the kingdoms of the world and their glory are his, and that he gives them to whomsoever he will; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:9">Matthew 4:9</span>. But has God ever said <i>so</i>? and are we to take this assertion of the <i>boasting</i> devil and father of lies for <i>truth</i>? Certainly not. We are not willing to attribute the blinding of men's minds to God, because we sometimes forget that he is the God of <i>justice</i>, and may in <i>judgment</i> remove mercies from those that <i>abuse</i> them; but this is repeatedly attributed to him in the Bible, and the expression before us is quite a parallel to the following, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:9">Isaiah 6:9</span>: <i>Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and</i> <i>see ye indeed, but perceive not</i>. MAKE <i>the</i> HEART <i>of this</i> PEOPLE FAT, <i>and</i> MAKE <i>their</i> EARS HEAVY, <i>and</i> SHUT <i>their</i> EYES; LEST <i>they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and</i> <i>understand with their heart</i>, c. And see the parallel places, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:14">Matthew 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:12">Mark 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:40">John 12:40</span>; and particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8-10">Romans 11:8-10</span>: <i>God</i> HATH GIVEN THEM THE SPIRIT <i>of</i> SLUMBER, EYES <i>that they</i> SHOULD <i>not</i> SEE, <i>and</i> EARS <i>that they</i> SHOULD <i>not</i> HEAR; <i>let their</i> EYES <i>be</i> DARKENED, c. Now all this is spoken of the same people, in the same circumstances of <i>wilful rebellion</i> and <i>obstinate</i> <i>unbelief</i> and the great God of heaven and earth is he who judicially <i>blinds their eyes; makes their hearts fat</i>, i.e. stupid; <i>gives them the spirit of slumber</i>: and <i>bows down their</i> <i>back</i>, c. On these very grounds it is exceedingly likely that the apostle means the <i>true God</i> by the words <i>the god of this world</i>.</p>
<p>And as to the expression <i>this world</i>, αιωνος τουτου, we are not to imagine that it necessarily means <i>wicked men</i>, or a <i>wicked age</i> for it is frequently used to express the <i>whole mundane system</i>, and all that is called <i>time: Whosoever speaketh against the Holy</i> <i>Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither</i> εν τουτω τω αιωνι, <i>in</i> THIS WORLD, <i>nor in the world to come</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:32">Matthew 12:32</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:34">Luke 20:34</span>, <i>the children</i>, υιοι του αιωνος τουτου, <i>of</i> THIS WORLD, mean simply <i>mankind at large</i> in their state of <i>probation</i> in this lower world, in opposition to their state in the <i>world to come</i>. The same meaning the word has in several other places, to which l need not refer; it simply implying the <i>present state of things, governed by</i> <i>the Divine providence</i>, in contradistinction from the <i>eternal</i> <i>state</i>: and it is very remarkable that, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>, God himself is called βασιλευς των αιωνων, the <i>King of the</i> WORLD; what we call <i>King eternal</i>; but here it evidently means him who <i>governs both</i> <i>worlds</i>, and rules in <i>time and eternity</i>. This character among the Asiatics is considered essential to God; and therefore in the very first surat of the <i>Koran</i> he is called [Arabic] <i>Rubbi Alalameen</i>, "the Lord of both worlds," an expression perfectly similar to that above. But it is needless to multiply examples; they exist in abundance. Some, and particularly the ancient fathers, have connected του αιωνος τουτου with των απιστων, and have read the verse: <i>But God hath blinded the minds of the unbelievers of this</i> <i>world</i>, c. Irenaeus, Tertullian, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Photius, Theophylact, and Augustine, all plead for the above meaning and St. Augustine says that it was the opinion of <i>almost all the</i> <i>ancients</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest the light of the glorious Gospel</b></i> — They have resisted the grace which God gave them, and have refused to yield to the evidences which amply prove the <i>Messiahship</i> of Jesus; and therefore their eyes were judicially darkened, as it is said in the prophet: <i>He hath closed their eyes, and hath given them the</i> <i>spirit of slumber</i>. That is, they have shut their eyes against the light, and their blindness and stupor are the consequence.</p>
<p>By <i>glorious Gospel</i> we are to understand the <i>luminous Gospel</i>; that which comes with so much <i>light</i> and <i>evidence</i> to every candid mind.</p>
<p><i><b>Who is the image of God</b></i> — Christ is called, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>, <i>the brightness of God's glory, and the express image of his</i> <i>person</i>. See the note there.</p>
