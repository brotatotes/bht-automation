<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:5">2 Corinthians 4:5</span>. <i><b>For we preach not ourselves</b></i> — We neither proclaim our own <i>wisdom</i> nor <i>power</i>; we have nothing but what we have received; we do not wish to establish our own <i>authority</i>, nor to procure our own <i>emolument</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But Christ Jesus the Lord</b></i> — We proclaim the author of this glorious Gospel as CHRIST, ο χριστος, the same as המשיח <i>hammashiach</i>, the MESSIAH, the <i>Anointed One</i>; him of whom the prophets wrote; and who is the expectation, as he is the glory, of Israel, We proclaim him as JESUS יהושע <i>Yehoshua</i>, the <i>Saviour</i> and <i>Deliverer</i>, who saves men from their sins. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>. And we proclaim <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i> to be the long-expected <i>Messiah</i>; and that there will be none other. And farther we proclaim this Jesus the Messiah to be the LORD, ο κυριος, the great <i>Ruler</i> who has all power in heaven and earth; who made and governs the world; and who can save to the uttermost all that come to God through him. Such was the <i>Redeemer</i> preached by St. Paul.</p>
<p><i><b>And ourselves your servants</b></i> — Labouring as fervently and as faithfully for your <i>eternal</i> interests as your most trusty <i>slaves</i> can do for your <i>secular</i> welfare. And we do this for <i>Christ's</i> <i>sake</i>; for although we by our labour show ourselves to be your <i>servants</i>, yea, your <i>slaves</i>, δουλους, yet it is a <i>voluntary</i> service; and we are neither employed by you nor receive our wages from you. We belong to Jesus; and are your servants on his account, and by his order.</p>
