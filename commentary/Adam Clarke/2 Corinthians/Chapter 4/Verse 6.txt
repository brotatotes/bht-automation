<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>. <i><b>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>darkness</b></i> — The apostle refers here to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:3">Genesis 1:3</span>. For when God created the heavens and the earth DARKNESS <i>was on the face of the</i> <i>deep; and God said, Let</i> THERE BE LIGHT; <i>and there was light</i>. Thus he caused the light to shine out of darkness.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath shined in our hearts</b></i> — He has given our <i>hearts</i> the glorious light of the <i>Gospel</i>, as he has given the <i>world</i> the glorious light of the <i>sun</i>. As sure, therefore, as God is the author of the <i>light</i> and the creator of the universe, so sure is he the author of the Gospel; it is no human invention; and is as far beyond the power of man's wisdom and might, as the creation of the world is beyond all created power, energy, and skill.</p>
<p><i><b>The light of the knowledge</b></i> — To give us that light, that we might <i>enlighten others</i>; this appears to me to be the design of the apostle's προς φωτισμον της γνωσεως της δοξης του Θεου, or, as Dr. <i>Whitby</i> paraphrases it, <i>to give us, and enable us to give to</i> <i>others, the light of the knowledge of God through Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>In the face of Jesus Christ.</b></i> — It is <i>in</i> and <i>through</i> Jesus that we can receive the Divine light, and it is <i>in</i> and <i>by</i> him that we can be made partakers of the Divine glory. The light mercy, holiness, and glory of God, are reflected upon and communicated to us through Jesus the Christ; and it is εν προσωπω, in the <i>appearance</i> and <i>person</i> of Jesus Christ that these blessings are communicated to us.</p>
