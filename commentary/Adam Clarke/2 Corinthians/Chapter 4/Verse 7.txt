<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>. <i><b>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels</b></i> — The original, οστρακινοις σκευεσιν, signifies, more literally, <i>vessels</i> made of <i>shells</i>, which are very <i>brittle</i>; and as the <i>shell</i> is the outward part of a fish, it is very fit, as Dr. Hammond observes, to resemble our bodies in which our souls dwell. The Platonists make <i>two bodies</i> of a man: the one they call οξημα φυχης, the <i>chariot of the soul</i>; the other, that which we see and touch; and this they call οστρακινον which is the same to us as the shell is to the <i>fish</i>. The word οστρακον not only signifies a <i>shell</i>, or vessel made of shell, but also πηλος ωπτημενος, an <i>earthen vessel</i> which has been <i>burnt in the kiln</i>, and earthen vessels or <i>pottery</i> in general; the difference between σκευηοστρακινα, <i>earthen ware</i>, and σκευη κεραμεως, the <i>potter's vessel</i>, is this: the latter implies the <i>vessel as it comes out of the hands of the potter</i> BEFORE <i>it is burnt</i>; and the other is the vessel AFTER it has <i>passed through the kiln</i>. St. Chrysostom, speaking of this difference, observes that the vessels once baked in the kiln, if broken, are incapable of being restored, δια την εκ τουπυρος εγγινομενην αυτοις ἁπαξ αντιτυπιαν, <i>because of the hardness once</i> <i>gotten by fire</i>; whereas the others are of <i>clay unbaken</i>, if they be spoiled ῥᾳδιωϚπρος το δευτερον επανελθῃ σχημα, <i>they may easily, by</i> <i>the skill of the potter, be restored to some second form</i>. See <i>Hammond</i>. This comports excellently with the idea of St. Paul: our bodies are in a <i>recoverable</i> form: they are very frail, and easily <i>marred</i>; but by the skill of the workman they may be easily built up anew, and made like unto his glorious body. The light and salvation of God in the soul of man is a heavenly treasure in a very mean casket.</p>
<p>The rabbins have a mode of speech very similar to this. "The daughter of the emperor thus addressed Rabbi Joshua, the son of Chananiah: O! how great is thy skill in the law, and yet how deformed thou art! what a great deal of wisdom is laid up in a <i>sordid vessel</i>! The rabbi answered, Tell me, I pray thee, of what are those vessels in which you keep your wines? She answered, They are <i>earthen vessels</i>. He replied, How is it, seeing ye are <i>rich</i>, that ye do not lay up your wine in <i>silver</i> vessels, for the common people lay up their wine in <i>earthen vessels</i>? She returned to her father, and persuaded him to have all the wine put into <i>silver</i> vessels; but the wine turned acid; and when the emperor heard it he inquired of his daughter who it was that had given her that advice? She told him that it was Rabbi Joshua. The rabbi told the whole story to the emperor, and added this sentence: <i>The</i> <i>wisdom and study of the law cannot dwell in a comely man</i>. Caesar objected, and said, There are comely persons who have made great progress in the study of the law. The rabbi answered, Had they not been so comely they would have made greater progress; for a man who is comely has not an <i>humble mind</i>, and therefore he soon forgets the whole law." See <i>Schoettgen</i>. There is a great deal of good sense in this allegory; and the most superficial reader may find it out.</p>
<p><i><b>That the excellency of the power may be of God; and not of us.</b></i> — God keeps us continually dependent upon himself; we have nothing but what we have received, and we receive every necessary supply just <i>when</i> it is necessary; and have nothing at our own command. The good therefore that is done is so evidently from the power of God, that none can pretend to share the glory with him.</p>
