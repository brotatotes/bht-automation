<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:8">2 Corinthians 4:8</span>. We are <i><b>troubled on every side</b></i> — We have already seen, in the notes on the ninth chapter of the preceding epistle, that St. Paul has made several allusions to those <i>public games</i> which were celebrated every <i>fifth</i> year at the <i>Isthmus</i> of <i>Corinth</i>; and those games have been in that place particularly described. In this and the three following verses the apostle makes allusion to the contests at those games; and the terms which he employs in these verses cannot be understood but in reference to those <i>agonistical</i> exercises to which he alludes. Dr. Hammond has explained the whole on this ground; and I shall here borrow his help. There are <i>four pairs</i> of expressions taken from the customs of the <i>agones</i>.</p>
<p>1. <i>Troubled on every side, yet not distressed</i>.</p>
<p>2. <i>Perplexed, but not in despair</i>.</p>
<p>3. <i>Persecuted, but not forsaken</i>.</p>
<p>4. <i>Cast down, but not destroyed</i>.</p>
<p><i>Three</i> of these pairs belong to the customs of <i>wrestling</i>; the fourth, to that of <i>running</i> in the <i>race</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Troubled on every side</b></i>, c.] Εν παντι θλιβομενοι. The word θλιβεσθαι, belongs clearly to παλη <i>wrestling</i>. So says Aristotle, Rhet. lib. i. cap. 5, (and the Scholiast on that place,) ὁ γαρ δυναμενος - θλιβειν και κατεχειν, παλαιστικος·. "He that can gripe his adversary, and take him up, is a good wrestler" there being two dexterities in that exercise:</p>
<p>1. to <i>gripe</i>, and</p>
<p>2. to <i>throw down</i>, which <i>Hesychius</i> calls ωθειν and κρατειν; the first of these is here mentioned, and expressed by θλιβεσθαι, <i>to be pressed down</i>; to which is here opposed, as in a higher degree, στενοχωρεισθαι, <i>to be brought to distress</i>, as when one cannot get out of his antagonist's hands, nor make any resistance against him. So in Isaiah: στενοχωρουμενοι ου δυναμεθα μαχεσθαι, <i>we are brought to such extremities that we can fight no</i> <i>longer</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Perplexed, but not in despair</b></i> — Απορουμενοι, αλλ' ουκ εξαπορουμενοι. The word απορεισθαι, <i>to be in perplexity</i>, is fit for the <i>wrestler</i>, who being puzzled by his antagonist's skill knows not what to do: so in <i>Hesychius</i>, απορουντες, αμηχανουντες, <i>they that are not able to do or attempt any thing</i>, yet are not εξαπορουμενοι, they miscarry not finally, ορθοι ισταμενοι, <i>stand</i> <i>after all upright</i>; ουκ απογινωσκοντες και ἡττωμενοι, <i>despair not,</i> <i>nor are they overcome</i>, but find a happy issue out of all, being at last <i>conquerors</i>.</p>
