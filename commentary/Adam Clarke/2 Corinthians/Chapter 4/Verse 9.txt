<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:9">2 Corinthians 4:9</span>. <i><b>Persecuted, but not forsaken</b></i> — Διωκομενοι, αλλ' ουκ εγκαταλειπομενοι. The διωκομενοι, <i>pursued</i>, is peculiar to the δρομος, or <i>race</i>, when one being foremost others pursue, and get up close after him, endeavouring to <i>outstrip</i> him, but cannot succeed: this is the meaning of ουκ εγκαταλειπομενοι, not <i>outstripped</i>, or <i>outgone</i>, as the word implies. So in PLUTARCH: τους απολειφθεντας ου στεφανουσι, <i>they do not crown them that</i> <i>are distanced or left behind</i>. So says the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>: <i>All run, but only</i> ONE <i>receiveth the</i> PRIZE.</p>
<p><i><b>Cast down, but not destroyed.</b></i> — Καταβαλλομενοι αλλ' ουκ απολλυμενοι. This also belongs to <i>wrestlers</i>, where he that <i>throws</i> the other first is <i>conqueror</i>. And so Hesychius: καταβαλει, νικησει, ῥιψει, to cast down is to overcome, to throw. And then, the being not <i>destroyed</i> signifies that, although they were <i>thrown</i> <i>down</i>-cast into troubles and difficulties, yet they <i>rose again</i>, and surmounted them all.</p>
