<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>. <i><b>If our earthly house of</b></i><b> this </b><i><b>tabernacle</b></i> — By earthly house, the apostle most evidently means the <i>body</i> in which the <i>soul</i> is represented as dwelling or sojourning for a time, and from which it is to be liberated at death; for as death <i>dissolves the</i> <i>tabernacle</i>, it can then be no habitation for the soul. The apostle also alludes here to the ancient <i>Jewish tabernacle</i>, which, on all removals of the congregation, was <i>dissolved</i> and <i>taken in</i> <i>pieces</i>; and the ark of the covenant, covered with its own curtains, was carried by itself; and when they came to the place of rest, then the dissolved parts of the tabernacle were <i>put</i> <i>together</i> as before. When we consider this simile in connection with the doctrine of the resurrection, which the apostle has treated so much at large in these epistles, and which he keeps constantly in view, then we shall see that he intends to convey the following meaning: that as the tabernacle was <i>taken down</i> in order to be <i>again put together</i>, so the <i>body</i> is to be <i>dissolved</i>, in order to be <i>re-edified</i>; that as the ark of the covenant subsisted <i>by itself</i>, while the <i>tabernacle</i> was <i>down</i>, so can the soul when separated from the body; that as the ark had then its own veil for its covering, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:21">Exodus 40:21</span>, so the soul is to have some vehicle in which it shall subsist till it receives its body at the resurrection.</p>
<p><i><b>A building of God</b></i> — Some think this refers to a certain <i>celestial vehicle</i> with which God invests holy souls on their dismissal from the body; others suppose it relates to the <i>resurrection body</i>; and some imagine that it relates merely to the <i>state</i> of blessedness which the saints shall possess in the kingdom of glory.
