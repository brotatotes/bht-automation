Verse 2 Corinthians 5:10. For we must all appear before the judgment seat — We labour to walk so as to please him, because we know that we shall have to give a solemn account of ourselves before the judgment seat of Christ; where he, whose religion we profess, will judge us according to its precepts, and according to the light and grace which it affords.That every one may receive the things — κομισηται εκαστος. That each may receive to himself, into his own hand, his own reward and his own wages.The things done in his body] That is, while he was in this lower state; for in this sense the term body is taken often in this epistle. We may observe also that the soul is the grand agent, the body is but its instrument. And it shall receive according to what it has done in the body.
