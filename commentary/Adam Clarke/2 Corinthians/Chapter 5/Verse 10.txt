<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>. <i><b>For we must all appear before the judgment seat</b></i> — We labour to walk so as to please him, because we know that we shall have to give a solemn account of ourselves before the judgment seat of Christ; where he, whose religion we profess, will judge us according to its precepts, and according to the light and grace which it affords.</p>
<p><i><b>That every one may receive the things</b></i> — κομισηται εκαστος. That <i>each may receive to himself, into his own hand</i>, his own reward and his own wages.</p>
<p><i><b>The things</b></i> done <i>in</i> his <i>body</i>] That is, while he was in this lower <i>state</i>; for in this sense the term <i>body</i> is taken often in this epistle. We may observe also that the soul is the grand <i>agent</i>, the body is but its <i>instrument</i>. And it shall receive according to what it has done in <i>the body</i>.</p>
