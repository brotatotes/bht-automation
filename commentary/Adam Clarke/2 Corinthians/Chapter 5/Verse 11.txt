<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:11">2 Corinthians 5:11</span>. <i><b>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord</b></i> — This, I think, is too harsh a translation of ειδοτες ουν τον φοβον του κυριου, which should be rendered, <i>knowing therefore the fear of</i> <i>the Lord</i>; which, strange as it may at first appear, often signifies the <i>worship</i> of the Lord, or that religious reverence which we owe to him; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:18">Romans 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:7">Romans 13:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:17">1 Peter 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:2">1 Peter 3:2</span>. As <i>we know therefore</i> what God requires of man, because we are favoured with his own <i>revelation</i>, we <i>persuade men</i> to become Christians, and <i>to labour to be acceptable to him</i>, because they <i>must all stand before the judgment seat</i>; and if they receive not the grace of the Gospel <i>here</i>, they must <i>there</i> give up their accounts with <i>sorrow</i> and not with <i>joy</i>. In short, a man who is not saved from his sin in <i>this life</i>, will be separated from God and the glory of his power in the <i>world to come</i>. This is a powerful <i>motive</i> to <i>persuade men</i> to accept the salvation provided for them by Christ Jesus. The <i>fear of God</i> is the <i>beginning of wisdom</i>; the <i>terror</i> of God confounds and overpowers the soul. We lead men to God through his <i>fear</i> and <i>love</i>, and with the <i>fear</i> of God the <i>love</i> of God is ever consistent; but where the <i>terror</i> of the Lord reigns there can neither be <i>fear, faith</i>, nor <i>love</i>; nay, nor <i>hope</i> either. Men who vindicate their <i>constant</i> declamations on hell and perdition by quoting this text, know little of its meaning; and, what is worse, seem to know but little of the nature of man, and perhaps less of the spirit of the Gospel of Christ. Let them go and learn a lesson from Christ, sweeping over Jerusalem: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft would I have gathered you together, as a hen would her brood under her wings!" And another from his last words on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!"</p>
<p><i><b>But we are made manifest unto God</b></i> — God, who searches the heart, knows that we are upright in our endeavours to please him; and because we are fully persuaded of the <i>reality of eternal</i> <i>things</i>, therefore we are fully in earnest to get sinners converted to him.</p>
<p><i><b>Manifest in your consciences.</b></i> — We have reason to believe that you have had such proof of our integrity and disinterestedness, that your consciences must acquit us of every unworthy motive, and of every sinister view.</p>
