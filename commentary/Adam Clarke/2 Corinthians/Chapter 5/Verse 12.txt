Verse 2 Corinthians 5:12. For we commend not ourselves? â€” I do not say these things to bespeak your good opinion, to procure your praise; but to give you an occasion to glory - to exult on our behalf; and to furnish you with an answer to all those who either malign us or our ministry, and who only glory in appearance - have no solid ground of exultation, and whose heart is dishonest and impure. St. Paul probably speaks here concerning the false apostle, who had been dividing the Church and endeavouring to raise a party to himself, by vilifying both the apostle and his doctrine.
