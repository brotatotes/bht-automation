<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span>. <i><b>For we commend not ourselves?</b></i> â€” I do not say these things to bespeak your good opinion, to procure your praise; but <i>to give you an occasion to glory</i> - to exult on our behalf; and to furnish you with an answer to all those who either malign us or our ministry, and who only <i>glory in appearance</i> - have no <i>solid</i> <i>ground</i> of exultation, and whose heart is dishonest and impure. St. Paul probably speaks here concerning the false apostle, who had been dividing the Church and endeavouring to raise a party to himself, by vilifying both the apostle and his doctrine.</p>
