<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And that he died for all, that they which live</b></i>, c.] This <i>third</i> position he draws from the preceding: <i>If all were dead</i>, and in danger of endless perdition and if <i>he died for all</i>, to save them from that perdition; then it justly follows that they <i>are not their own</i>, that they are bought by his blood; and <i>should</i> <i>not live unto themselves</i>, for this is the way to final ruin; <i>but</i> <i>unto him who died for them</i>, and thus made an atonement for their sins, and <i>rose again</i> for their justification.</p>
