Verse 15. And that he died for all, that they which live, c.] This third position he draws from the preceding: If all were dead, and in danger of endless perdition and if he died for all, to save them from that perdition; then it justly follows that they are not their own, that they are bought by his blood; and should not live unto themselves, for this is the way to final ruin; but unto him who died for them, and thus made an atonement for their sins, and rose again for their justification.
