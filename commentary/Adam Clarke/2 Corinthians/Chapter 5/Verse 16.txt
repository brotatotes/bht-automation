<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Know we no man after the flesh</b></i> — As we know that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; and as we know that all are alienated from God, and are dead in trespasses and sins; therefore we esteem no man on account of <i>his family</i> <i>relations</i>, or the <i>stock</i> whence he proceeded, because we see all are shut up in unbelief, and all are children of wrath.</p>
<p><i><b>Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh</b></i> — We cannot esteem a man who is a <i>sinner</i>, were he even allied to the blood royal of David, and were he of the same <i>family</i> with the <i>man Christ</i> himself; nor can we prize a man because he has seen Christ in the flesh; for many have seen him in the flesh to whom he will say; <i>Depart from me, for I never knew you</i>. So we: nothing weighs with us, nor in the sight of God, but redemption from this death, and <i>living to him</i> who died for them.</p>
<p>We know that the Jews valued themselves much in having Abraham for their father; and some of the Judaizing teachers at Corinth might value themselves in having <i>seen Christ in the flesh</i>, which certainly St. Paul did not; hence he takes occasion to say here that this kind of privilege availed nothing; for the <i>old creature</i>, however <i>noble</i>, or <i>well descended</i> in the sight of men, is under the <i>curse</i>; and the <i>new creature</i> only is such as God can approve.</p>
