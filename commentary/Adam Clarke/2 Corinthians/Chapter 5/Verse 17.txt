<p>Verse 17. <i><b>If any man</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>in Christ</b></i><b>, he is </b><i><b>a new creature</b></i> — It is vain for a man to profess affinity to Christ according to the <i>flesh</i>, while he is unchanged in his heart and life, and dead in trespasses and sins; for he that is <i>in Christ</i>, that is, a genuine Christian, having Christ dwelling in his heart by faith, is a <i>new</i> <i>creature</i>; his <i>old state</i> is changed: he was a <i>child of Satan</i>, he is now a <i>child of God</i>; he was a <i>slave</i> of sin, and his works were death; he is now made <i>free</i> from sin, and has his fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. He was before full of <i>pride</i> and <i>wrath</i>; he is now <i>meek</i> and <i>humble</i>. He formerly had his <i>portion</i> in <i>this life</i>, and lived for this world alone; he now hath GOD for his <i>portion</i>, and he looks not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are eternal. Therefore, <i>old things</i> <i>are passed away</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Behold, all things are become new.</b></i> — The man is not only <i>mended</i>, but he is <i>new made</i>; he is a <i>new creature</i>, καινη κτισις a <i>new creation</i>, a <i>little world</i> in himself; formerly, all was in <i>chaotic</i> disorder; now, there is a <i>new creation</i>, which God himself owns as his workmanship, and which he can look on and pronounce <i>very good</i>. The conversion of a man from idolatry and wickedness was among the Jews denominated a <i>new creation</i>. <i>He who converts a</i> <i>man to the true religion is the same</i>, says R. Eliezer, <i>as if he</i> <i>had created him</i>.</p>
