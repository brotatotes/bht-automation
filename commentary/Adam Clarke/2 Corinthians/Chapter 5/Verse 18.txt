<p>Verse 18. <i><b>And all things</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>of God</b></i> — As the thorough conversion of the soul is compared to a new <i>creation</i>, and <i>creation</i> is the proper work of an <i>all-wise, almighty Being</i>; then this total change of heart, soul, and life, which takes place under the preaching of the Gospel, is effected by the <i>power</i> and <i>grace</i> of God: this is <i>salvation</i>, and salvation must ever be of the Lord; and therefore men should apply to him, who alone can work this wondrous change.</p>
<p><i><b>Who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ</b></i> — Having given Jesus Christ to die for sinners, they have through him access unto God; for his sake and on his account God can receive them; and it is only by the <i>grace</i> and <i>Spirit</i> of Christ that the proud, fierce, and diabolic nature of men can be changed and reconciled to God, and <i>by</i> and <i>through</i> this sacrifice God can be propitious to them. There is an <i>enmity</i> in the heart of man against sacred things; the grace of Christ alone can remove this enmity.</p>

Καταλλαγη, <i>reconciliation</i>, comes from καταλλασσω, <i>to change thoroughly</i>; and the grand object of the Gospel is to make a complete change in men's <i>minds</i> and <i>manners</i>; but the first object is the removal of enmity from the heart of man, that he may be disposed to accept of the salvation God has provided for him, on the terms which God has promised. The <i>enmity</i> in the heart of man is the grand hinderance to his salvation.</p>
