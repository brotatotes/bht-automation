<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:2">2 Corinthians 5:2</span>. <i><b>For in this we groan</b></i> — While in this <i>state</i>, and in this <i>body</i>, we are encompassed with many infirmities, and exposed to many trials, so that life is a state of discipline and affliction, and every thing within and around us says, "Arise and depart, for this is not your rest!" Those who apply these words to what they call the <i>apostle's sense of indwelling sin</i>, abuse the passage. There is nothing of the kind either mentioned or intended.</p>
<p><i><b>Desiring to be clothed upon with our house</b></i> — This and the following verses are, in themselves, exceedingly obscure, and can be only interpreted by considering that the expressions used by the apostle are all <i>Jewish</i>, and should be interpreted according to their use of them. <i>Schoettgen</i> has entered largely into the argument here employed by the apostle, and brought forth much useful information.</p>
<p>He observes, 1. That the Hebrew word לבש <i>labash</i>, which answers to the apostle's ενδυσασθαι, <i>to be clothed</i>, signifies to be <i>surrounded, covered</i>, or <i>invested with any thing</i>. So, to be <i>clothed</i> with the <i>uncircumcision</i>, signifies to be <i>uncircumcised</i>. <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 163.</p>
<p>On the words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:18">Exodus 24:18</span>, <i>Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the</i> <i>mount</i>, Sohar Exod., fol. 77, has these words, <i>He went into the</i> <i>midst of the cloud, as if one put on a garment; so he was</i> CLOTHED <i>with the</i> CLOUD. Sohar Levit., fol. 29: "The righteous are in the terrestrial paradise, where their souls are <i>clothed with the lucid</i> <i>crown</i>;" i.e. they are <i>surrounded, encompassed</i> with light, c.</p>
<p>2. The word בית <i>beith</i>, HOUSE, in Hebrew often denotes a <i>cover,</i> <i>case</i>, or <i>clothing</i>. So, in the <i>Targum</i> of <i>Onkelos</i>, בית אפי beith appei, the HOUSE or the FACE, is a <i>veil</i> and so בית אצבעים <i>beith etsbaim</i>, the HOUSE of the FINGERS, and בית יד <i>beith yad</i>, the HOUSE of the HAND, signify <i>gloves</i>; בית רגלים beith regalim, the HOUSE of the FEET, <i>shoes</i>. Therefore, οικητηριον - επενδυσασθαι, <i>to be clothed on with a house</i>, may signify any particular <i>qualities of the soul</i>; what we, following the very same form of speech, call a <i>habit</i>, i.e. a <i>coat</i> or <i>vestment</i>. So we say the man has got a <i>habit of vice</i>, a <i>habit of virtue</i>, a <i>habit of</i> <i>swearing, of humility</i>, c., c.</p>
<p>3. The Jews attribute <i>garments</i> to the soul, both in this and the other world and as they hold that all human souls pre-exist, they say that, previously to their being appointed to bodies, they have a <i>covering</i> which answers the same end to them before they come into <i>life</i> as their bodies do <i>afterwards</i>. And they state that the design of God in sending souls into the world is, that they may get themselves a <i>garment</i> by the study of the law and good works. See several proofs in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>4. It is plain, also, that by this <i>garment</i> or <i>covering</i> of the soul they mean simply what we understand by acquiring the <i>image of</i> <i>God</i>-being made holy. This image they assert "Adam lost by his fall, and they represent man in a sinful state as being <i>naked</i>." So they represent the Israelites before their making the molten calf, as having received <i>holy garments</i> from Mount Sinai but afterwards, having worshipped the calf, they were stripped of these, and left <i>naked</i>.</p>
<p>5. But notwithstanding they speak of this clothing as implying <i>righteous</i> and <i>holy dispositions</i>, and <i>heavenly qualities</i>, yet they all agree in assigning certain <i>vehicles</i> to separate spirits, in which they act; but of these <i>vehicles</i> they have strange notions; yet they acknowledge that without them, whether they be of <i>light, fire</i>, c., or whatever else, they cannot see and contemplate the Supreme Wisdom. In <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, page 137, we have these words: "When the time draws near in which a man is to depart from this world, the angel of death takes off his <i>mortal</i> <i>garment</i> and <i>clothes</i> him with one from paradise, in which he may see and contemplate the Supreme Wisdom and therefore the angel of death is said to be very kind to man, because he takes off from him the <i>garment</i> of this world, and <i>clothes</i> him with a much more precious one prepared in paradise."</p>
<p>When the apostle says that they earnestly desired <i>to be clothed</i> <i>upon with our house which is from heaven</i>, he certainly means that the great concern of all the genuine followers of God was to be fully <i>prepared</i> to enjoy the beatific vision of their Maker and Redeemer.</p>
