<p>Verse 20. <i><b>We are ambassadors for Christ</b></i> — Ὑπερ Χριστου - πρεσβευομεν. We execute the function of ambassadors in Christ's stead. He came from the Father to mankind on this important embassy. He has left the world, and appointed us in his place.</p>
<p><i>Ambassador</i> is a person sent from one sovereign power to another; and is supposed to represent the person of the sovereign by whom he is deputed. Christ while on earth represented the person of the Sovereign of the world; his <i>apostles</i> and their successors represent the person of Christ. Christ declared the will of the Father to mankind; apostles, c., declare the will of Christ to the world. <i>We are ambassadors for Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>As though God did beseech</b></i> you <i>by us</i>] What we say to you we say on the authority of God our entreaties are his entreaties; our warm love to you, a faint reflection of his infinite love; we pray you to return to God, it is his will that you should do so; we promise you remission of sins, we are authorized to do so by God himself. In Christ's stead we pray you to lay aside your enmity and <i>be reconciled to God</i>; i.e. accept pardon, peace, holiness, and heaven; which are all procured for you by his blood, and offered to you on his own authority.</p>
<p>"What unparalleled condescension and divinely tender mercies are displayed in this verse! Did the <i>judge</i> ever <i>beseech</i> a condemned criminal to accept of pardon? Does the creditor ever beseech a ruined debtor to receive an acquittance in full? Yet our almighty Lord, and our eternal Judge, not only vouchsafes to offer these blessings, but invites us, entreats us, and with the most tender importunity solicits us not to reject them." The Rev. J. Wesley's notes in loc.</p>
<p>This sentiment is farther expressed in the following beautiful poetic version of this place, by the Rev. <i>Charles Wesley</i>:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And proffer'd mercy we embrace;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And, gladly <i>reconciled</i> to thee,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Thy condescending mercy praise.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Poor <i>debtors</i>, by our Lord's request</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> A full <i>acquittance</i> we receive;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And <i>criminals</i>, with pardon blest,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> We, at our Judge's instance, live." </p>
