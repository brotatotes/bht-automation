<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>. <i><b>For he hath made him to be sin for us</b></i> — Τον μη γνοντα ἁμαρτιαν, ὑπερ ἡμων ἁμαρτιαν εποιησεν· <i>He made him who</i> <i>knew no sin</i>, (who was innocent,) <i>a sin-offering for us</i>. The word αμαρτια occurs here <i>twice</i>: in the <i>first place</i> it means <i>sin</i>, i.e. transgression and guilt; and of Christ it is said, <i>He knew</i> <i>no sin</i>, i.e. was <i>innocent</i>; for not to <i>know sin</i> is the same as to be <i>conscious of innocence</i>; so, <i>nil conscire sibi</i>, to be conscious of nothing against one's self, is the same as <i>nulla pallescere</i> <i>culpa</i>, to be unimpeachable.</p>
<p>In the second place, it signifies a <i>sin-offering</i>, or <i>sacrifice</i> <i>for sin</i>, and answers to the <i>chattaah</i> and <i>chattath</i> of the Hebrew text; which signifies both <i>sin</i> and <i>sin-offering</i> in a great variety of places in the Pentateuch. The <i>Septuagint</i> translate the Hebrew word by αμαρτια in ninety-four places in <i>Exodus, Leviticus</i>, and <i>Numbers</i>, where a <i>sin-offering</i> is meant; and where our version translates the word not <i>sin</i>, but an <i>offering for sin</i>. Had our translators attended to their own method of translating the word in other places where it means the <i>same</i> as here, they would not have given this false view of a passage which has been made the foundation of a most blasphemous doctrine; viz. that <i>our sins were imputed to Christ</i>, and that he was a <i>proper object</i> of the <i>indignation of Divine justice</i>, because he was <i>blackened with imputed sin</i>; and some have proceeded so far in this blasphemous career as to say, that <i>Christ may be</i> <i>considered as the greatest of sinners, because all the sins of</i> <i>mankind</i>, or of the <i>elect</i>, as they say, <i>were imputed to him, and</i> <i>reckoned as his own</i>. One of these writers translates the passage thus: <i>Deus Christum pro maximo peccatore habuit, ut nos essemus</i> <i>maxime justi</i>, God accounted Christ the greatest of sinners, that we might be supremely righteous. Thus they have confounded <i>sin</i> with the <i>punishment due to sin</i>. Christ <i>suffered in our stead;</i> <i>died for us; bore our sins</i>, (the <i>punishment</i> due to them,) <i>in his</i> <i>own body upon the tree</i>, for <i>the Lord laid upon him the iniquities</i> <i>of us all</i>; that is, the <i>punishment</i> due to them; explained by <i>making his soul</i>-his life, <i>an offering for sin</i>; and <i>healing us by</i> <i>his stripes</i>.</p>
<p>But that it may be plainly seen that <i>sin-offering</i>, not <i>sin</i>, is the meaning of the word in this verse, I shall set down the places from the <i>Septuagint</i> where the word occurs; and where it answers to the Hebrew words already quoted; and where our translators have rendered correctly what they render here incorrectly.

In all, one hundred and eight places, which, in the course of my own reading in the Septuagint, I have marked.</p>
<p><i><b>That we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</b></i> — <i>The</i> <i>righteousness of God</i> signifies here the <i>salvation</i> of God, as comprehending <i>justification</i> through the blood of Christ, and <i>sanctification</i> through his Spirit or, as the <i>mountains of God</i>, the <i>hail of God</i>, the <i>wind of God</i>, mean <i>exceeding high mountains,</i> <i>extraordinary hail</i>, and <i>most tempestuous wind</i>; so, here, the righteousness of God may mean a <i>thorough righteousness, complete</i> <i>justification, complete sanctification</i>; such as none but <i>God</i> can give, such as the <i>sinful nature and guilty conscience</i> of man require, and such as is <i>worthy</i> of God to impart. And all this <i>righteousness, justification</i>, and <i>holiness</i>, we receive <i>in, by,</i> <i>for</i>, and <i>through</i> HIM, as the grand, sacrificial, procuring, and meritorious cause of these, and every other blessing. Some render the passage: <i>We are justified through him; before God</i>; or, <i>We are</i> <i>justified, according to God's plan of justification, through him</i>.</p>
<p>IN many respects, this is a most important and instructive chapter.</p>
<p>1. The terms <i>house, building, tabernacle</i>, and others connected with them, have already been explained from the Jewish writings. But it has been thought by some that the apostle mentions these as readily offering themselves to him from his own avocation, that of a <i>tentmaker</i>; and it is supposed that he borrows these terms from his own <i>trade</i> in order to illustrate his doctrine; This supposition would be natural enough if we had not full evidence that these terms were used in the <i>Jewish theology</i> precisely in the sense in which the apostle uses them here. Therefore, it is more likely that he borrowed them from that <i>theology</i>, than from his own <i>trade</i>.</p>
<p>2. In the terms <i>tabernacle, building of God</i>, c., he may refer also to the tabernacle in the wilderness, which was a <i>building of</i> <i>God</i>, and a <i>house of God</i>, and as God dwelt in that building, so he will dwell in the souls of those who <i>believe</i> in, <i>love</i>, and <i>obey</i> him. And this will be his <i>transitory temple</i> till mortality is swallowed up of life, and we have a glorified body and soul to be his eternal residence.</p>
<p>3. The doctrines of the resurrection of the same body the witness of the Spirit; the immateriality of the soul; the fall and miserable condition of all mankind; the death of Jesus, as an atonement for the sins of the whole world; the necessity of obedience to the Divine will, and of the total change of the human heart, are all introduced here: and although only a few words are spoken on <i>each</i>, yet these are so <i>plain</i> and so <i>forcible</i> as to set those important doctrines in the most clear and striking point of view.</p>
<p>4. The chapter concludes with such a view of the mercy and goodness of God in the <i>ministry of reconciliation</i>, as is no where else to be found. He has here set forth the Divine mercy in all its heightenings; and who can take this view of it without having his heart melted down with love and gratitude to God, who has called him to such a state of salvation.</p>
<p>5. It is exceedingly remarkable that, through the whole of this chapter, the apostle speaks of himself in the first person <i>plural</i>; and though he may intend other apostles, and the Christians in general, yet it is very evident that he uses this form when only himself can be meant, as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span> and 13, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:13">2 Corinthians 5:13</span> as well as in several places of the following chapter. This may be esteemed rather more curious than important.</p>
