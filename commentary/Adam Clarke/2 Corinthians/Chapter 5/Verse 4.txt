<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>. <i><b>For we that are in</b></i><b> this </b><i><b>tabernacle</b></i> — We who are in this <i>state</i> of trial and difficulty <i>do groan, being burdened</i>; as if he had said: The whole of human life is a state of suffering, and especially <i>our lot</i>; who are <i>troubled on every side, perplexed,</i> <i>persecuted, cast down, bearing about in the body the dying of our</i> <i>Lord Jesus</i>, and <i>being always delivered unto death on the account</i> <i>of Jesus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:8-11">2 Corinthians 4:8-11</span>. These were sufficient <i>burdens</i>, and sufficient causes of <i>groaning</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Not for that we would be unclothed</b></i> — We do not desire <i>death</i>, nor to die, even with the full prospect of eternal glory before our eyes, an hour before that time which God in his wisdom has assigned.</p>
<p><i><b>But clothed upon</b></i> — To have the fullest preparation for eternal glory. We wish not to die, whatever tribulation we may be called to pass through, till the whole will of God is accomplished <i>in</i> us and <i>by</i> us.</p>
<p><i><b>That mortality might be swallowed up of life.</b></i> — Being fully prepared for the eternal state we shall scarcely be said to die, all that is mortal being absorbed and annihilated by immortality and glory.
