<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:5">2 Corinthians 5:5</span>. <i><b>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing</b></i> — God has given us our <i>being</i> and our <i>body</i> for this very purpose, that both might be made immortal, and both be glorified together. Or, God himself has given us this <i>insatiable hungering</i> and <i>thirsting</i> after <i>righteousness</i> and immortality. Mr. Addison has made a beautiful paraphrase of the sense of the apostle, whether he had his words in view or not:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Back on herself, and startles at <i>destruction</i>?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> 'Tis the <i>Divinity</i> that <i>stirs within us</i>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> 'Tis <i>Heaven</i> itself that points out an <i>hereafter</i>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And intimates <i>eternity</i> to man.---</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The soul, secured in her existence, smiles</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The stars shall fade away, the sun himself</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> But thou shalt flourish in <i>immortal youth</i>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Unhurt amidst the war of elements,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds." </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p><i><b>The earnest of the Spirit.</b></i> — See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span>.</p>
