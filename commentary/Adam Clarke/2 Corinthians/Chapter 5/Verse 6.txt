<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:6">2 Corinthians 5:6</span>. <i><b>We are always confident</b></i> — θαρρουντες ουν παντοτε. We are always <i>full of courage</i>; we never despond; we know where our help lies; and, having the <i>earnest of the Spirit</i>, we have the full assurance of hope.</p>
<p><i><b>Whilst we are at home in the body</b></i>, c.] The original words in this sentence are very emphatic: ενδημειν signifies to <i>dwell among</i> <i>one's own people</i> εκδημειν, to be a <i>sojourner</i> among a <i>strange</i> <i>people</i>. Heaven is the <i>home</i> of every genuine Christian, and is claimed by them as such; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>. Yet, while here below, the <i>body</i> is the proper <i>home of the soul</i>; but as the soul is made for <i>eternal glory</i>, that glory is its <i>country</i>; and therefore it is considered as being from its <i>proper home</i> while below in the body. As all human souls are made for this glory, therefore all are considered, while here, to be absent from their own country. And it is not merely heaven that they have in view, but the <i>Lord</i>; without whom, to an immortal spirit possessed of infinite desires, <i>heaven</i> would neither be a <i>home</i> nor a <i>place of rest</i>. We see plainly that the apostle gives no intimation of an intermediate state between <i>being at home</i> in the <i>body</i> and being <i>present</i> with the <i>Lord</i>. There is not the slightest intimation here that the <i>soul sleeps</i>, or rather, that there is no soul; and, when the body is decomposed, that there is no more of the man till the resurrection: I mean, according to the sentiments of those who do condescend to allow us a <i>resurrection</i>, though they deny us a <i>soul</i>. But this is a philosophy in which St. Paul got no lessons, either from Gamaliel, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, or in the third heaven, where he heard even unutterable things.</p>
