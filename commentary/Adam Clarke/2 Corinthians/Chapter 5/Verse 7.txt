<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:7">2 Corinthians 5:7</span>. <i><b>For we walk by faith</b></i> â€” While we are in the present state <i>faith</i> supplies the place of <i>direct vision</i>. In the future world we shall have <i>sight</i>-the utmost <i>evidence</i> of spiritual and eternal things; as we shall be <i>present with them</i>, and live in them. <i>Here</i> we have the testimony of <i>God</i>, and believe in their reality, because we cannot doubt his word. And to make this more convincing he gives us the <i>earnest of his Spirit</i>, which is a foretaste of glory.</p>
