Verse 2 Corinthians 5:7. For we walk by faith â€” While we are in the present state faith supplies the place of direct vision. In the future world we shall have sight-the utmost evidence of spiritual and eternal things; as we shall be present with them, and live in them. Here we have the testimony of God, and believe in their reality, because we cannot doubt his word. And to make this more convincing he gives us the earnest of his Spirit, which is a foretaste of glory.
