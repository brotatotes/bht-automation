<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:8">2 Corinthians 5:8</span>. <i><b>We are confident</b></i> â€” We are of <i>good courage</i>, notwithstanding our many difficulties; because we have this earnest of the Spirit, and the unfailing testimony of God. And notwithstanding this, <i>we are willing rather to be absent from the</i> <i>body</i>-we certainly prefer a state of glory to a state of suffering, and the enjoyment of the beatific vision to even the anticipation of it by faith and hope; but, as Christians, we cannot desire to die before our time.</p>
