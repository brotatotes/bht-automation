<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:9">2 Corinthians 5:9</span>. <i><b>Wherefore we labour</b></i> — φιλοτιμουμεθα. from φιλος, <i>loving</i>, and τιμη, <i>honour</i>; we act at all times on the <i>principles</i> <i>of honour</i>; we are, in the proper sense of the word, ambitious to do and say every thing consistently with our high vocation: and, as we claim kindred to the inhabitants of heaven, to act as they do.</p>
<p><i><b>We may be accepted of him.</b></i> — ευαρεστοι αυτω ειναι <i>To be</i> <i>pleasing to him</i>. Through the love we have to God, we study and labour to please him. This <i>is</i> and <i>will be</i> our heaven, to study to love, please, and serve him from whom we have received both our <i>being</i> and its <i>blessings</i>.</p>
