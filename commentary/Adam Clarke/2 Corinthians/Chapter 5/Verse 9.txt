Verse 2 Corinthians 5:9. Wherefore we labour — φιλοτιμουμεθα. from φιλος, loving, and τιμη, honour; we act at all times on the principles of honour; we are, in the proper sense of the word, ambitious to do and say every thing consistently with our high vocation: and, as we claim kindred to the inhabitants of heaven, to act as they do.We may be accepted of him. — ευαρεστοι αυτω ειναι To be pleasing to him. Through the love we have to God, we study and labour to please him. This is and will be our heaven, to study to love, please, and serve him from whom we have received both our being and its blessings.
