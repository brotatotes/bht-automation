<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>. <i><b>We then, as workers together</b></i><b> with him</b>] συνεργουντες δε και παρακαλουμεν. The two last words, <i>with him</i>, are not in the text, and some supply the place thus: <i>we then, as workers together</i> WITH YOU, and the <i>Armenian</i> version seems to have read it so; but no MS. has this reading, and no other version. For my own part I see nothing wanting in the text if we only suppose the term <i>apostles; we</i>, (i.e. apostles,) <i>being fellow workers, also entreat</i> <i>you not to receive the grace of God in vain</i>.</p>
<p>By the <i>grace of God</i>, την χαριν του θεου, <i>this grace</i> or <i>benefit of God</i>, the apostle certainly means the <i>grand sacrificial</i> <i>offering</i> of Christ for the sin of the world, which he had just before mentioned in speaking of the <i>ministry of reconciliation</i>. We learn, therefore, that it was possible to <i>receive the grace of</i> <i>God</i> and not ultimately benefit by it; or, in other words, to begin in the Spirit and end in the flesh. Should any one say that it is the <i>ministry of reconciliation</i>, that is, the <i>benefit of apostolic</i> preaching, that they might receive in vain; I answer, that the apostolic preaching, and the whole ministry of reconciliation, could be no <i>benefit</i> to any man farther than it might have been a means of conveying to him the salvation of God. And it is most evident that the apostle has in view that grace or benefit that reconciles us to God, and makes us Divinely righteous. And this, and all other benefits of the death of Christ, may be received in vain.</p>
