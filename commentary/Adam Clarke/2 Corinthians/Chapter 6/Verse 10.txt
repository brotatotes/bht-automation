Verse 2 Corinthians 6:10. As sorrowful — Considerate men supposing, from our persecuted state and laborious occupation, (often destitute of the necessaries of life; seldom enjoying its conveniences; and scarcely ever, its comforts,) that we must be the most miserable of all men.Yet alway rejoicing — Having the consolation of God's Spirit at all times, and a glorious prospect of a blessed immortality.As poor — Destitute of all worldly good and secular interest,Yet making many rich — By dispensing to them the treasures of salvation; making them rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom.The Gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition of the poor. It makes them sober; so they save what before they profusely and riotously spent. It makes them diligent; and thus they employ time to useful purposes which they before squandered away. They therefore both save and gain by religion; and these must lead to an increase of property. Therefore they are made rich; at least in comparison with that sinful, profligate state in which they were before they received the truth of the Gospel.As having nothing — Being the most abject of the poor,And yet possessing all things. — That are really necessary to the preservation of our lives. For the wants under which we labour for a time are supplied again by a bountiful Providence. The man who possesses a contented spirit possesses all things; for he is satisfied with every dispensation of the providence of God; and "a contented mind is a continual feast."
