<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:10">2 Corinthians 6:10</span>. <i><b>As sorrowful</b></i> — Considerate men supposing, from our persecuted state and laborious occupation, (often destitute of the necessaries of life; seldom enjoying its conveniences; and scarcely ever, its comforts,) that we must be the most miserable of all men.</p>
<p><i><b>Yet alway rejoicing</b></i> — Having the consolation of God's Spirit at all times, and a glorious prospect of a blessed immortality.</p>
<p><i><b>As poor</b></i> — Destitute of all worldly good and secular interest,</p>
<p><i><b>Yet making many rich</b></i> — By dispensing to them the <i>treasures of</i> <i>salvation</i>; making them <i>rich</i> in <i>faith</i>, and <i>heirs of the kingdom.</i></p>
<p>The Gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, <i>betters the condition of the poor</i>. It makes them <i>sober</i>; so they <i>save</i> what before they <i>profusely</i> and <i>riotously</i> spent. It makes them <i>diligent</i>; and thus they <i>employ time</i> to useful purposes which they before squandered away. They therefore both <i>save</i> and <i>gain</i> by religion; and these must lead to an increase of property. Therefore they are <i>made rich</i>; at least in comparison with that sinful, profligate state in which they were before they received the truth of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>As having nothing</b></i> — Being the most abject of the poor,</p>
<p><i><b>And</b></i><b> yet </b><i><b>possessing all things.</b></i> — That are really necessary to the preservation of our lives. For the wants under which we labour for a time are supplied again by a bountiful Providence. The man who possesses a <i>contented spirit</i> possesses <i>all things</i>; for he is satisfied with every dispensation of the providence of God; and "a contented mind is a continual feast."</p>
