Verse 2 Corinthians 6:12. Ye are not straitened in us — That is, Ye have not a narrow place in our affections: the metaphor here is taken from the case of a person pent up in a small or narrow place, where there is scarcely room to breathe.Ye are straitened in your own bowels. — I have not the same place in your affections which you have in mine. The bowels are used in Scripture to denote the most tender affections. Matthew 9:36; Matthew 9:36.
