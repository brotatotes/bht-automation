<p>Verse 16. <i><b>What agreement hath the temple of God with idols</b></i> — Nothing could appear more abominable to a Jew than an idol in the temple of God: here, then, could be no agreement; the worship of the two is wholly incompatible. An <i>idolater</i> never worships the true God; a <i>Christian</i> never worships an idol. If ye join in idolatrous rites, it is impossible that ye should be <i>Christians</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye are the temple of the living God</b></i> — God intends to make the heart of every believer his own house.</p>
<p><i><b>I will dwell in them, and walk in</b></i><b> them</b>] The words are very emphatic: ενοικησωεναυτοις. <i>I will inhabit in them</i>. I will not be as a <i>wayfaring</i> man, who turns aside to tarry as for a <i>night</i>, but I will take up my <i>constant residence</i> with them; I will dwell <i>in</i> and <i>among</i> them.</p>
<p><i><b>I will be their God</b></i> — They shall have no other God, they shall have none besides me; and if they take me for their God, I will be to them all that an infinite, eternal, and self-sufficient Being can be to his intelligent offspring.</p>
<p><i><b>They shall be my people.</b></i> — If they take me for their GOD, their supreme and eternal GOOD, I will take them for my <i>people</i>; and instruct, enlighten, defend, provide for, support, and bless them, as if I had none else to care for in the creation.</p>
