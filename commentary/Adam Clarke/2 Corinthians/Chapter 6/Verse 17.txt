<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Wherefore come out from among them</b></i> â€” Is it not plain from this and the following verse that God would be their God only on the ground of <i>their taking him for such</i>, and that this depended on their being <i>separated</i> from the works and workers of iniquity? for God could not <i>inhabit in them</i> if they had concord with Belial, a portion with infidels; c. Those who will have the promises of God fulfilled to them must come under the <i>conditions</i> of these promises: if they are not <i>separate</i>-if they <i>touch the unclean</i> <i>thing</i>, God will not receive them and therefore will not be their God, nor shall they be his people.</p>
