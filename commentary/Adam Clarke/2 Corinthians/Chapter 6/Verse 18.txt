<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:18">2 Corinthians 6:18</span>. <i><b>Will be a Father unto you</b></i> — I will act towards you as the most affectionate father can act towards his most tender and best beloved child.</p>
<p><i><b>And ye shall be my sons and daughters</b></i> — Ye shall all be of the <i>household</i> of God, the <i>family</i> of heaven; ye shall be <i>holy, happy</i>, and <i>continually safe</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Saith the Lord Almighty.</b></i> — κυριος παντοκρατωρ The <i>Lord</i>, the <i>Governor of all things</i>.</p>
<p>Earthly fathers, however loving and affectionate, may fail to provide for their children, because every thing is not at <i>their</i> <i>disposal</i>; they may frequently lack both the <i>power</i> and the <i>means</i>, though to <i>will</i> may be present with them; but the Lord who <i>made</i> and who <i>governs all things</i> can never lack <i>will, power</i>, nor <i>means</i>. The promise is sure to the <i>children</i>; and the <i>children</i> are those who <i>take the Almighty for their God</i>. For the promise belongs to no soul that is not <i>separate</i> from sinful ways, works, and men; those who <i>touch the unclean thing</i>, i.e. who <i>do</i> what God <i>forbids</i>, and hold communion with unrighteousness, can never stand in the endearing relation of <i>children</i> to God Almighty: and this is most forcibly stated by God himself, in these verses, and in the beginning of the following chapter, the first verse of which should conclude this.</p>
<p>To the <i>Jews</i> the promises were originally made; they would not have God for their God, but <i>would</i> work iniquity. What was the consequence? God cast them off; and those who were <i>joined to</i> <i>iniquity</i> were <i>separated</i> from <i>him</i>. "Then said God, Call his name <i>Lo-ammi</i>; for <i>ye are not my people</i>, and <i>I will not be your God</i>." <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:9">Hosea 1:9</span>. The <i>Jews</i> were therefore cast off, and the <i>Gentiles</i> taken in their place; but even these, under the new covenant, are taken in expressly under the <i>same conditions</i> as the apostle here most fully states. Those who apply these words in any other way pervert their meaning, and sin against their souls.</p>
