<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>. <i><b>For he saith</b></i> — That is, God hath said it, by the prophet Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:8">Isaiah 49:8</span>; which place the apostle quotes <i>verbatim et literatim</i> from the <i>Septuagint</i>. And from this we may at once see what is the <i>accepted time</i>, and what <i>the day of</i> <i>salvation</i>. The <i>advent of the Messiah</i> was the עת רצון <i>eth</i> <i>ratson</i>, the time of God's pleasure or benevolence, of which all the faithful were in expectation; and the <i>day of salvation</i>, יום שועה yom yeshuah, was the time in which this salvation should be manifested and applied. The apostle therefore informs them that <i>this</i> is the <i>time</i> predicted by the prophet; and the <i>ministry</i> <i>of reconciliation</i> being exercised in full force is a proof that the prophecy is fulfilled; and therefore the apostle confidently asserts, <i>Behold</i>, NOW <i>is this accepted time</i>, NOW the Messiah reigns, NOW is the Gospel dispensation, and therefore NOW <i>is the</i> <i>day of salvation</i>; that is, the very time in which the power of God is present to heal, and in which every sinner believing on the Lord Jesus may be saved.</p>
<p>I rather think that this <i>second verse</i> should be read immediately after the last verse of the preceding chapter; as where it now stands it greatly disturbs the connection between the <i>first</i> and the <i>third</i> verses. I will set down the whole in the order in which I think they should stand. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>: <i>Now then we are ambassadors for Christ; as though God did beseech</i> <i>you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, to be reconciled to God.</i> <i>For he hath made him a sin-offering for us, who knew no sin, that</i> <i>we might be made the righteousness of God in him: for he saith,</i> "I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee." <i>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold,</i> <i>now is the day of salvation.</i> Immediately after this, the sixth chapter will very properly commence, and we shall see that the connection will be then undisturbed:-</p>
<p>We then, <i>as fellow workers, beseech you also, that ye receive</i> <i>not this grace of God in vain, giving no offence in any thing,</i> <i>that this ministry be not blamed.</i> This change of the place of the second verse, which every one allows must, if it stand here, be read in a parenthesis, preserves the whole connection of the apostle's discourse, and certainly sets his argument before us in a stronger light. Let us review the whole:</p>
<p>1. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span>.</p>
<p>2. He appointed the apostles to proclaim to mankind the doctrine of reconciliation, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>.</p>
<p>3. The apostles, in consequence, proclaim this doctrine; and show that Christ was a sacrifice for sin, and that through him we may be perfectly saved, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>.</p>
<p>4. They show also that all this was agreeable to the declaration of God by the prophet Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:8">Isaiah 49:8</span>, where he predicts the days of the Messiah, and the <i>grace</i> then to be communicated, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>.</p>
<p>5. The apostle then, speaking in the person of all his fellow labourers, who had this ministry of reconciliation intrusted to them, exhorts them not to receive such a benefit of God in vain, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>.</p>
<p>6. He exhorts those who had embraced the Gospel not to put a stumbling block in the way of others, by acting irreligiously, lest this ministry of reconciliation should be reproached on their account, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:3">2 Corinthians 6:3</span>.</p>
<p>7. He shows what conscientious and scrupulous care he and his fellow apostles took to preach and walk so that this ministry might have its full effect, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This view of the subject, if I mistake not, shows a beautiful consistency throughout the whole.</p>
