<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>. <i><b>But in all things approving ourselves</b></i> — The apostle now proceeds to show how conscientiously himself and his fellow labourers acted, in order to render the ministry of reconciliation effectual to the salvation of men. They not only gave no offence in any thing, but they laboured to manifest themselves to be the genuine ministers of God, <i>in much patience</i>-bearing calmly up under the most painful and oppressive afflictions.</p>
<p><i><b>In afflictions</b></i> — εν φλιψεσιν. This may signify the <i>series</i> of persecutions and distresses in general; the <i>state</i> of cruel suffering in which the Church of God and the apostles then existed.</p>
<p><i><b>In necessities</b></i> — εν αναγκαις. <i>Straits</i> and <i>difficulties</i>; including all that <i>want</i> and affliction which arose from the <i>impoverished</i> state of the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>In distresses</b></i> — εν στενοχωριαις. Such straits and difficulties as were absolutely <i>unavoidable</i> and <i>insurmountable</i>. The word implies, <i>being reduced to a narrow place, driven to a corner,</i> <i>hemmed in on every side</i>, as the Israelites were at the Red Sea; the sea before them, Pharaoh and his host behind them, and Egyptian fortresses on either hand. God alone could bring them out of such difficulties, when their enemies themselves saw that <i>the wilderness had shut them in</i>. So was it often with the apostles; all human help failed, and their deliverance came from God alone.</p>
