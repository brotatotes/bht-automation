<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:5">2 Corinthians 6:5</span>. <i><b>In stripes, in imprisonments</b></i> — Of these the history of the Acts of the Apostles gives ample testimony; and there were doubtless many instances of persecution in various forms which are not on record.</p>
<p><i><b>In tumults</b></i> — ακαταστασιαις. <i>Insurrections</i> raised against them because of the Gospel. It is more natural to understand the word thus, than of agitations, or tossings to and fro in consequence of their unsettled state of life; or because of persecution, which obliged them to flee from place to place.</p>
<p><i><b>In labours</b></i> — Both with our own <i>hands</i> to provide for ourselves the necessaries of life, that we might not be chargeable to others; and <i>in labours</i> to <i>spread the Gospel</i> of God through all countries where his providence opened our way.</p>
<p><i><b>In watchings</b></i> — Passing many nights without sleep or rest.</p>
<p><i><b>In fastings</b></i> — Partly constrained through want of food; and partly <i>voluntary</i>, as a means of obtaining an increase of grace both for ourselves and for the Churches.</p>
