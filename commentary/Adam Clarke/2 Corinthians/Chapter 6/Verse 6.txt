<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:6">2 Corinthians 6:6</span>. <i><b>By pureness</b></i> — εν αγνοτητι. In <i>simplicity</i> of intention, and <i>purity of affection</i>; together with that <i>chastity</i> and <i>holiness</i> of life which the Gospel enjoins.</p>
<p><i><b>By knowledge</b></i> — Of the Divine mysteries.</p>
<p><i><b>By long-suffering</b></i> — Under all provocations.</p>
<p><i><b>By kindness</b></i> — To our most virulent persecutors, and to all men.</p>
<p><i><b>By the Holy Ghost</b></i> — There are doubts among learned men whether the apostle here means that SPIRIT who is called the <i>third person</i> of the <i>holy</i> TRINITY; or some <i>grace, disposition</i>, or <i>quality</i> of the soul, which was thus denominated, as implying a <i>spirit</i> wholly <i>purified</i>, and fitted to be a <i>habitation</i> of God.</p>
<p><i>Schoettgen</i> quotes a passage from <i>Rabbi Bechai</i>, in which it appears to him to have this latter meaning: "Rabbi Pinchas, the son of Jair, said: <i>Reflection</i> leads to sedulity; <i>sedulity</i> to innocence; <i>innocence</i> to abstinence; <i>abstinence</i> to cleanness; <i>cleanness</i> to sanctity; <i>sanctity</i> to the fear of sin; <i>fear</i> of <i>sin</i> to humility; <i>humility</i> to piety; and <i>piety</i> to the <i>Holy Spirit</i>. Of these <i>ten</i> virtues <i>five</i> are external, or belong to the body; and <i>five</i> internal, or belonging to the soul; but all men prefer the <i>tenth</i>, which is רוח הקדש <i>ruach haktodesh</i>, the <i>Holy Spirit</i>." Even allowing Rabbi Pinchas to be a person on whose judgment we could rely, and whose authority was decisive, there does not appear to me any reason why we should depart from the usual meaning of the term from any thing that is said here. It appears to me plain enough that the rabbi means the constant indwelling of the Holy Spirit; and St. Paul, in this place, may have the same thing in view, and with it the various <i>gifts</i> of the Holy Spirit by which he was enabled to work <i>miracles</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>By love unfeigned</b></i> — εν αγαπη ανυποκριτω. <i>Love without</i> <i>hypocrisy</i>; such as disposed us at all times to lay down our life for the brethren, and to spend and be spent for the glory of God and the good of mankind.</p>
