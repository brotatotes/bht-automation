<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:7">2 Corinthians 6:7</span>. <i><b>By the word of truth</b></i> — The doctrine of truth received immediately from God, and faithfully and affectionately preached to men.</p>
<p><i><b>By the power of God</b></i> — Confirming this doctrine, not only by the miracles which we were enabled to work, but also by the application of that truth to the souls of the people by the energy of God.</p>
<p><i><b>By the armour of righteousness</b></i> — Such as that described by the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13-17">Ephesians 6:13-17</span>, which he calls there <i>the whole armour of God</i>, consisting of the following pieces: the <i>girdle</i> of <i>truth</i>, the <i>breastplate</i> of <i>righteousness</i>, the <i>shoes</i> of the Gospel of <i>peace</i>, the <i>shield</i> of <i>faith</i>, the <i>helmet</i> of <i>salvation</i>, and the <i>sword</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>On the right hand and on the left</b></i> — Particularly, the <i>shield</i> and the <i>sword</i>; the former on the <i>left arm</i>, the latter in the <i>right</i> <i>hand</i>. We have the doctrine of truth, and the power of God, as an armour to protect us on <i>all sides, every where</i>, and <i>on all</i> <i>occasions</i>.</p>
<p>It seems far-fetched to understand the <i>right hand</i> as signifying <i>prosperity</i>, and the <i>left</i> as signifying <i>adversity</i>; as if the apostle had said: We have this armour to defend us both in prosperity and adversity. By the doctrine of the Gospel, and by the power of God, the apostles were furnished with <i>offensive</i> and <i>defensive</i> weapons; they could ever <i>defend themselves</i>, and <i>discomfit</i> their <i>foes</i>.</p>
