Verse 2 Corinthians 6:8. By honour and dishonour — By going through both; sometimes respected, sometimes despised.By evil report and good report — Sometimes praised, at other times calumniated.As deceivers — Said to carry about a false doctrine for our secular emolument.And yet true — Demonstrated by the nature of the doctrine, as well as by our life and conversation, that we are true men; having nothing in view but God's glory and the salvation of the world.
