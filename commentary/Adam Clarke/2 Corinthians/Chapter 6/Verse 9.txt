Verse 2 Corinthians 6:9. As unknown — Persons who are to be suspected as harbouring dark designs; persons of neither birth, parentage, nor respectable connections in life;And yet well known — Proved by our whole conduct to have no such designs, and demonstrated to be holy, upright, and useful, by the whole train of our peregrinations, through which we can be readily traced from place to place; having preached openly, and done nothing in a corner.As dying — Through continual dangers, fatigues, and persecutions;And, behold, we live — We are preserved by the mighty power of God in the greatest dangers and deaths.As chastened — As though we were disobedient children;And not killed — Though we continue in the very same line of conduct that is supposed to bring on us those chastisements, and which, if it were criminal, would justly expose us to death for incorrigible obstinacy; but our preservation is a proof that we please God.
