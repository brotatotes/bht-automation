<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span>. <i><b>Having therefore these promises</b></i> — The promises mentioned in the three last verses of the preceding chapter, to which this verse should certainly be joined.</p>
<p><i><b>Let us cleanse ourselves</b></i> — Let us apply to him for the requisite grace of purification; and avoid every thing in spirit and practice which is opposite to the doctrine of God, and which has a tendency to pollute the soul.</p>
<p><i><b>Filthiness of the flesh</b></i> — The apostle undoubtedly means, <i>drunkenness, fornication, adultery</i>, and all such sins as are done immediately <i>against the body</i>; and by <i>filthiness of the spirit</i>, all impure desires, unholy thoughts, and polluting imaginations. If we avoid and abhor evil inclinations, and turn away our eyes from beholding vanity, incentives to evil being thus lessened, (for the eye affects the heart,) there will be the less danger of our falling into outward sin. And if we avoid all <i>outward</i> occasions of sinning, evil propensities will certainly be lessened. All this is <i>our</i> work under the common aids of the grace of God. We may turn away our eyes and ears from evil, or we may indulge both in what will infallibly beget evil desires and tempers in the soul; and under the same influence we may avoid every <i>act</i> of iniquity; for even Satan himself cannot, by any power he has, <i>constrain</i> us to commit uncleanness, robbery, drunkenness, murder, c. These are things in which both <i>body</i> and <i>soul</i> must consent. But still withholding the eye, the ear, the hand, and the body in general, from <i>sights, reports</i>, and <i>acts</i> of evil, will not purify a fallen spirit it is the grace and Spirit of Christ alone, powerfully applied for this very purpose, that can purify the conscience and the heart from all dead works. But if we do not withhold the food by which the man of sin is nourished and supported, we cannot expect God to purify our hearts. While we are <i>striving against sin</i>, we may expect the Spirit of God to purify us by his inspiration from all unrighteousness, that we may perfectly love and magnify our Maker. How can those expect God to purify their hearts who are continually indulging their <i>eyes,</i> <i>ears</i>, and <i>hands</i> in what is forbidden, and in what tends to increase and bring into action all the evil propensities of the soul?</p>
<p><i><b>Perfecting holiness</b></i> — Getting the whole mind of Christ brought into the soul. This is the grand object of a genuine Christian's pursuit. The means of accomplishing this are,</p>
<p>1. Resisting and avoiding sin, in all its inviting and seducing forms.</p>
<p>2. Setting the <i>fear of God</i> before our eyes, that we may dread his displeasure, and abhor whatever might excite it, and whatever might provoke him to withhold his manna from our mouth. We see, therefore, that there is a strong and orthodox sense in which we may <i>cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and of the</i> <i>spirit</i>, and thus <i>perfect holiness in the fear of God</i>.</p>
