<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:12">2 Corinthians 7:12</span>. <i><b>Not for his cause that had done the wrong</b></i> — viz. the incestuous person.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor for his cause that suffered wrong</b></i> — Some think the apostle means himself; others, that he means the <i>Church</i> at Corinth, the <i>singular</i> being put for the <i>plural</i>; others, the <i>family</i> of the incestuous person; and others, the <i>father</i> of the incestuous person. If this latter opinion be adopted, it would seem to intimate that the father of this person was yet <i>alive</i>, which would make the transgression more flagrant; but these words might be spoken in reference to the father, if <i>dead</i>, whose cause should be vindicated; as his injured honour might be considered, like Abel's blood, to be crying from the earth.</p>
<p><i><b>But that our care for you-might appear</b></i> — It was not to get the delinquent punished, nor merely to do justice to those who had suffered in this business, that the apostle wrote his epistle to them, but that they might have the fullest proof of his fatherly affection for them, and his concern for the honour of God; and that they might thereby see how unnatural their opposition to him was, and what cause they had to prefer him, who was ready to give up his life in their service, to that false apostle or teacher who was corrupting their minds, leading them from the simplicity of the truth, and making a gain of them.</p>
