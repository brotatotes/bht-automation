<p>Verse 14. <i><b>For if I have boasted</b></i> â€” The apostle had given Titus a very high character of this Church, and of their attachment to himself; and doubtless this was the case previously to the evil teacher getting among them, who had succeeded in changing their conduct, and changing in a great measure their character also; but now they return to themselves, resume their lost ground, so that the good character which the apostle gave them before, and which they had for a time forfeited, is now as applicable to them as ever. <i>Therefore his boasting of them is still found a truth</i>.</p>
