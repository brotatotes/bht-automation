Verse 15. And his inward affection — τα σπλαγαγχνα αυτου. Those bowels of his-his most tender affection. For the meaning of this word Matthew 9:36.Whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all — This is a very natural picture; he represents Titus as overjoyed even while he is delivering his account of the Corinthian Church. He expatiated on it with extreme delight, and thereby showed at once both his love for St. Paul and his love for them. He loved them because they so loved the apostle; and he loved them because they had shown such kindness to himself; and he loved them because he found so many excellent and rare gifts, joined to so much humility, producing such an exemplary and holy life.With fear and trembling ye received him. — Ye reverenced his authority; ye were obedient to his directions; and ye dreaded lest any thing should be undone or ill done which he had delivered to you in the name of God.
