<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:2">2 Corinthians 7:2</span>. <i><b>Receive us</b></i> — χωρησατε ημας. This address is variously understood. <i>Receive us</i> into your <i>affections</i>-love us as we love you. <i>Receive us</i> as your <i>apostles</i> and teachers; we have given you full proof that God hath both sent and owned us. <i>Receive, comprehend</i>, what we now say to you, and carefully mark it.</p>
<p><i><b>We have wronged no man</b></i> — We have never acted contrary to the strictest justice.</p>
<p><i><b>We have corrupted no man</b></i> — With any false doctrine or pernicious opinion.</p>
<p><i><b>We have defrauded no man.</b></i> — Of any part of his property. But what have your false teachers done? They <i>have beguiled you from</i> <i>the simplicity of the truth</i>, and thus <i>corrupted your minds</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span>. They have <i>brought you into bondage</i>; they have <i>taken of you;</i> <i>devoured you; axalted themselves against you</i>, and ye have patiently <i>suffered</i> all this. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>. It is plain that he refers here to the false apostle or teacher which they had among them.</p>
