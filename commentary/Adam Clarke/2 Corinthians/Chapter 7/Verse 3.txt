Verse 2 Corinthians 7:3. I speak not this to condemn you — I do not speak to reproach but to correct you. I wish you to open your eyes and see how you are corrupted, spoiled, and impoverished by those whom ye have incautiously preferred to the true apostles of Jesus Christ.I have said before, that ye are in our hearts — He has in effect and substance said this, 2 Corinthians 1:6-8 (note); 2 Corinthians 2:4 (note); 2 Corinthians 2:12 (note); 2 Corinthians 3:2 (note); 2 Corinthians 3:13 (note); where see the passages at length, and the notes.To die and live with you.] An expression which points out the strongest affection, as in cases where love blinds us to the faults of those whom we love, and causes us to prefer them to all others; like that in Horace:-  With thee would live, with thee would die." FRANCIS.  From all appearance there never was a Church less worthy of an apostle's affections than this Church was at this time; and yet no one ever more beloved. The above quotation applies to this case in full force.
