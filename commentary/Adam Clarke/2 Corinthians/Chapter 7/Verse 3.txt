<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:3">2 Corinthians 7:3</span>. <i><b>I speak not</b></i><b> this </b><i><b>to condemn you</b></i> — I do not speak to reproach but to correct you. I wish you to open your eyes and see how you are corrupted, spoiled, and impoverished by those whom ye have incautiously preferred to the true apostles of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>I have said before, that ye are in our hearts</b></i> — He has in effect and substance said this, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6-8">2 Corinthians 1:6-8</span> (note); <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span> (note); <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span> (note); <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:2">2 Corinthians 3:2</span> (note); <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:13">2 Corinthians 3:13</span> (note); where see the passages at length, and the notes.</p>
<p><i><b>To die and live with</b></i> you.] An expression which points out the strongest affection, as in cases where love blinds us to the faults of those whom we love, and causes us to prefer them to all others; like that in <i>Horace</i>:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>With thee would live, with thee would die</i>."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> FRANCIS. </p>
