<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span>. <i><b>Great is my boldness of speech</b></i> — He seems to refer to the manner in which he spoke of them to others.</p>
<p><i><b>Great</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>my glorying of you</b></i> — They had probably been very loving and affectionate previously to the time in which they were perverted by their false apostle. He therefore <i>had</i> boasted of them in all the Churches.</p>
<p><i><b>I am filled with comfort</b></i> — My affection for you has still the most powerful ascendancy in my soul. Here we may see the affection of the most tender father to his children.</p>
<p><i><b>I am exceeding joyful</b></i> — υπερπερισσευομαι. I superabound in joy; I have a joy beyond expression. υπερπερισσευω is an extremely rare verb. I have not met with it in any Greek author; and it occurs no where in the New Testament but here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>In all our tribulation.</b></i> — Perhaps επι here should be rendered <i>under</i> instead of <i>in</i>, as it signifies, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:26">Mark 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>. <i>Under</i> all our <i>tribulations, I feel inexpressible joy on your</i> <i>account</i>.</p>
