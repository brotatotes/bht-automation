Verse 2 Corinthians 7:4. Great is my boldness of speech — He seems to refer to the manner in which he spoke of them to others.Great is my glorying of you — They had probably been very loving and affectionate previously to the time in which they were perverted by their false apostle. He therefore had boasted of them in all the Churches.I am filled with comfort — My affection for you has still the most powerful ascendancy in my soul. Here we may see the affection of the most tender father to his children.I am exceeding joyful — υπερπερισσευομαι. I superabound in joy; I have a joy beyond expression. υπερπερισσευω is an extremely rare verb. I have not met with it in any Greek author; and it occurs no where in the New Testament but here and in Romans 5:20.In all our tribulation. — Perhaps επι here should be rendered under instead of in, as it signifies, Mark 2:26; Luke 3:2; Acts 11:28. Under all our tribulations, I feel inexpressible joy on your account.
