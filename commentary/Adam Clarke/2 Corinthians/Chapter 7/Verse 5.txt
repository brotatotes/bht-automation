Verse 2 Corinthians 7:5. When we were come into Macedonia — St. Paul, having left Ephesus, came to Troas, where he stopped some time; afterwards he came to Macedonia, whence he wrote this epistle,Our flesh had no rest — So exceedingly anxious was he to know the success of his first epistle to them.Without were fightings — The oppositions of pagans, Jews, and false brethren.Within were fears. — Uncertain conjectures relative to the success of his epistle; fears lest the severity of it should alienate their affections utterly from him; fears lest the party of the incestuous person should have prevailed; fears lest the teaching of the false apostle should have perverted their minds from the simplicity of the truth; all was uncertainty, all apprehension; and the Spirit of God did not think proper to remove the causes of these apprehensions in any extraordinary way.
