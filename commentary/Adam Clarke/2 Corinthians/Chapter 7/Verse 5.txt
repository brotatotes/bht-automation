<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:5">2 Corinthians 7:5</span>. <i><b>When we were come into Macedonia</b></i> — St. Paul, having left Ephesus, came to Troas, where he stopped some time; afterwards he came to Macedonia, whence he wrote this epistle,</p>
<p><i><b>Our flesh had no rest</b></i> — So exceedingly anxious was he to know the success of his first epistle to them.</p>
<p><i><b>Without</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>fightings</b></i> — The oppositions of pagans, Jews, and false brethren.</p>
<p><i><b>Within</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>fears.</b></i> — Uncertain conjectures relative to the success of his epistle; fears lest the severity of it should alienate their affections utterly from him; fears lest the party of the incestuous person should have prevailed; fears lest the teaching of the false apostle should have perverted their minds from the simplicity of the truth; all was uncertainty, all apprehension; and the Spirit of God did not think proper to remove the causes of these apprehensions in any extraordinary way.</p>
