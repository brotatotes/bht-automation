<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8">2 Corinthians 7:8</span>. <i><b>I do not repent, though I did repent</b></i> â€” Though I had many doubts in my mind concerning the success of my letter; and though I grieved that I was obliged to write with so much severity, the case absolutely requiring it; yet now I am not sorry that I have written that letter, because I find it has completely answered the end for which it was sent.</p>
