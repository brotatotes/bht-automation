<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:9">2 Corinthians 7:9</span>. <i><b>Ye sorrowed to repentance</b></i> — Ye had such a sorrow as produced a complete change of mind and conduct. We see that a man may <i>sorrow</i>, and yet not <i>repent</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Made sorry after a godly manner</b></i> — It was not a sorrow because ye were found out, and thus solemnly reprehended, but a sorrow because ye had sinned against God, and which consideration caused you to grieve more than the apprehension of any punishment.</p>
<p><i><b>Damage by us in nothing.</b></i> — Your repentance prevented that exercise of my apostolic duty, which would have consigned your bodies to destruction, that your souls might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
