Verse 2 Corinthians 7:9. Ye sorrowed to repentance — Ye had such a sorrow as produced a complete change of mind and conduct. We see that a man may sorrow, and yet not repent.Made sorry after a godly manner — It was not a sorrow because ye were found out, and thus solemnly reprehended, but a sorrow because ye had sinned against God, and which consideration caused you to grieve more than the apprehension of any punishment.Damage by us in nothing. — Your repentance prevented that exercise of my apostolic duty, which would have consigned your bodies to destruction, that your souls might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
