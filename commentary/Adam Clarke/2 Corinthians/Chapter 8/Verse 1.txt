<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span>. <i><b>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit</b></i> — In all our dignified version very few ill-constructed sentences can be found; however here is one, and the worst in the book. <i>We do you to wit</i> is in the original γνωριζομεν δε υμιν, <i>we make known unto you</i>. This is plain and intelligible, the other is not so; and the form is now obsolete.</p>
<p><i><b>The grace of God bestowed</b></i> — Dr. Whitby has made it fully evident that the χαρις θεου signifies the charitable contribution made by the Churches in Macedonia, to which they were excited by the grace or influence of God upon their hearts; and that δεδομενην εν cannot signify <i>bestowed on</i>, but <i>given in</i>. That χαρις means <i>liberality</i>, appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>: <i>We desired Titus that as he had begun, so he would finish</i> την χαριν ταυτην, <i>this charitable contribution</i>. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:7">2 Corinthians 8:7</span>: That ye abound εν ταυτη τη χαριτι, <i>in this liberal contribution</i>. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>: Who was chosen of the Church to travel with us συν τη χαριτι ταυτη, <i>with this charitable contribution, which is</i> <i>administered</i>-which is to be <i>dispensed, by us</i>. So <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8">2 Corinthians 9:8</span>: <i>God is able to make</i> πασαν χαριν, <i>all liberality, to abound</i> <i>towards you</i>. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>: <i>To bring</i> την χαριν, <i>your liberality</i>, to the poor saints. Hence χαρις, is by <i>Hesychius</i> and <i>Phavorinus</i> interpreted a <i>gift</i>, as it is here by the apostle: <i>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable</i> <i>gift</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:15">2 Corinthians 9:15</span>. This charity is styled the <i>grace of God</i>, either from its <i>exceeding</i> <i>greatness</i>, (as the <i>cedars of God</i> and <i>mountains of God</i> signify <i>great cedars</i> and <i>great mountains</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:6">Psalms 36:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+80:10">Psalms 80:10</span>;) or rather, it is called so as proceeding from God, who is the dispenser of all good, and the giver of this disposition; for the motive of charity must come from him. So, in other places, <i>the zeal of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:2">Romans 10:2</span>; <i>the love of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span>; <i>the grace of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Churches of Macedonia</b></i> — These were <i>Philippi, Thessalonica,</i> <i>Berea</i>, &amp;c.</p>
