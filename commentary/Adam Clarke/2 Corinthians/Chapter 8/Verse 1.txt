Verse 2 Corinthians 8:1. Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit — In all our dignified version very few ill-constructed sentences can be found; however here is one, and the worst in the book. We do you to wit is in the original γνωριζομεν δε υμιν, we make known unto you. This is plain and intelligible, the other is not so; and the form is now obsolete.The grace of God bestowed — Dr. Whitby has made it fully evident that the χαρις θεου signifies the charitable contribution made by the Churches in Macedonia, to which they were excited by the grace or influence of God upon their hearts; and that δεδομενην εν cannot signify bestowed on, but given in. That χαρις means liberality, appears from 2 Corinthians 8:6: We desired Titus that as he had begun, so he would finish την χαριν ταυτην, this charitable contribution. And 2 Corinthians 8:7: That ye abound εν ταυτη τη χαριτι, in this liberal contribution. And 2 Corinthians 8:19: Who was chosen of the Church to travel with us συν τη χαριτι ταυτη, with this charitable contribution, which is administered-which is to be dispensed, by us. So 2 Corinthians 9:8: God is able to make πασαν χαριν, all liberality, to abound towards you. And 1 Corinthians 16:3: To bring την χαριν, your liberality, to the poor saints. Hence χαρις, is by Hesychius and Phavorinus interpreted a gift, as it is here by the apostle: Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift, 2 Corinthians 9:15. This charity is styled the grace of God, either from its exceeding greatness, (as the cedars of God and mountains of God signify great cedars and great mountains, Psalms 36:6; Psalms 80:10;) or rather, it is called so as proceeding from God, who is the dispenser of all good, and the giver of this disposition; for the motive of charity must come from him. So, in other places, the zeal of God, Romans 10:2; the love of God, 2 Corinthians 5:14; the grace of God, Titus 2:11.The Churches of Macedonia — These were Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, &c.
