<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:10">2 Corinthians 8:10</span>. <i><b>Herein I give</b></i><b> my </b><i><b>advice</b></i> — For I speak not by way of <i>commandment</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:8">2 Corinthians 8:8</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>For this is expedient for you</b></i> — It is necessary you should do this to preserve a <i>consistency of conduct</i>; for ye began this work a <i>year ago</i>, and it is necessary that ye should complete it as soon as possible.</p>
<p><i><b>Not only to do, but also to be forward</b></i> — το ποιησαι και το θελειν, literally, <i>to do and to will</i>; but as the <i>will</i> must be <i>before</i> the <i>deed</i>, θελειν, must be taken here in the sense of <i>delight</i>, as it frequently means in the Old and New Testaments. See several examples in <i>Whitby</i>.</p>
<p>Some MSS. transpose the words: allowing this, there is no difficulty.</p>
<p><i><b>A year ago.</b></i> — απο περυσι. It was about a year before this that the apostle, in his first epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span>, had exhorted them to make this contribution and there is no doubt that they, in obedience to his directions, had begun to lay up in store for this charitable purpose; he therefore wishes them to complete this good work, and thus show that they were not led to it by the example of the Macedonians, seeing they themselves had been <i>first movers</i> in this business.</p>
