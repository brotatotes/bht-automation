Verse 2 Corinthians 8:10. Herein I give my advice — For I speak not by way of commandment, 2 Corinthians 8:8.For this is expedient for you — It is necessary you should do this to preserve a consistency of conduct; for ye began this work a year ago, and it is necessary that ye should complete it as soon as possible.Not only to do, but also to be forward — το ποιησαι και το θελειν, literally, to do and to will; but as the will must be before the deed, θελειν, must be taken here in the sense of delight, as it frequently means in the Old and New Testaments. See several examples in Whitby.Some MSS. transpose the words: allowing this, there is no difficulty.A year ago. — απο περυσι. It was about a year before this that the apostle, in his first epistle, 1 Corinthians 16:2, had exhorted them to make this contribution and there is no doubt that they, in obedience to his directions, had begun to lay up in store for this charitable purpose; he therefore wishes them to complete this good work, and thus show that they were not led to it by the example of the Macedonians, seeing they themselves had been first movers in this business.
