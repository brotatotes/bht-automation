Verse 2 Corinthians 8:11. A readiness to will, so there may be a performance — Ye have willed and purposed this; now perform it.Out of that which ye have. — Give as God has enabled you; and give as God has disposed you. He requires each man to do as he can; and accepts the will where the means are wanting to perform the deed.
