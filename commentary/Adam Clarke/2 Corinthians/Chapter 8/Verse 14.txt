<p>Verse 14. <i><b>But by an equality</b></i> — That you may do to those who are distressed now, as, on a change of circumstances, you would wish them to do to you. And I only wish that of your <i>abundance</i> you would now minister to their wants; and it may be that <i>there</i> <i>abundance</i> may yet <i>supply your wants</i>; for so liable are all human affairs to <i>change</i>, that it is as possible that you rich Corinthians should need the charitable help of others as it is that those Jews, who once had need of nothing, should now be dependent on your bounty.</p>
<p><i><b>That there may be equality</b></i> — That ye may exert yourselves so in behalf of those poor people that there may be between you an <i>equality</i> in the <i>necessaries</i> of life; your abundance supplying them with that of which they are utterly destitute.</p>
