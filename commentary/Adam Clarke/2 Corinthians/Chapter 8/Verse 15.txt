<p>Verse 15. <i><b>He that</b></i><b> had gathered </b><i><b>much, had nothing over</b></i> â€” On the passage to which the apostle alludes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:18">Exodus 16:18</span>, I have stated that, probably, every man gathered as much manna as he could, and when he brought it home and measured it by the <i>omer</i>, (for this was the measure for each man's eating,) if he had a surplus it went to the supply of some other family that had not been able to collect enough; the family being <i>large</i>, and the time in which the manna might be gathered, before the heat of the day, not being sufficient to collect a supply for so numerous a household; several of whom might be so confined as not to be able to collect for themselves. Thus there was an <i>equality</i> among the Israelites in reference to this thing; and in this light these words of St. Paul lead us to view the passage. To apply this to the present case: the Corinthians, in the course of God's providence, had <i>gathered more</i> than was absolutely necessary for their own support; by giving the surplus to the persecuted and impoverished Christian Jews these would be an <i>equality</i>; both would then possess the <i>necessaries</i> of life, though still the one might have more <i>property</i> than the other.</p>
