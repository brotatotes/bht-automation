<p>Verse 16. <i><b>But thanks</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>to God</b></i> â€” He thanks God who had already disposed the heart of Titus to attend to this business; and, with his usual address, considers all this as done in the behalf of the <i>Corinthian</i> Church; and that though the poor Christians in <i>Judea</i> are to have the <i>immediate benefit</i>, yet God put <i>honour</i> upon them in making them his instruments in supplying the wants of others. He who is an almoner to God Almighty is highly honoured indeed.</p>
