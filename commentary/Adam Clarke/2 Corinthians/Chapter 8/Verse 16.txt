Verse 16. But thanks be to God â€” He thanks God who had already disposed the heart of Titus to attend to this business; and, with his usual address, considers all this as done in the behalf of the Corinthian Church; and that though the poor Christians in Judea are to have the immediate benefit, yet God put honour upon them in making them his instruments in supplying the wants of others. He who is an almoner to God Almighty is highly honoured indeed.
