<p>Verse 18. <i><b>The brother, whose praise is in the Gospel</b></i> â€” Who this <i>brother</i> was we cannot tell; some suppose it was St. Luke, who wrote a gospel, and who was the companion of St. Paul in several of his travels; others think it was <i>Silas</i>; others, <i>Barnabas</i>; others, <i>Mark</i>; and others, <i>Apollos</i>. Neither ancients nor moderns agree in either; but <i>Luke, John</i>, and <i>Mark</i>, seem to have the most probable opinions in their favour. Whoever the person was he was sufficiently known to the Corinthians, as we learn by what the apostle says of him in this place.</p>
