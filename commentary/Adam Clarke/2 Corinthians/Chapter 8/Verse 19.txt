<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Chosen of the Churches to travel with us</b></i> — χειροτονηθεις. Appointed by a <i>show of hands</i>; from χειρ the <i>hand</i>, and τεινω, to <i>extend</i>. This appointment, by the suffrage of the Churches, seems to refer more to St. <i>Luke</i> than any one else; unless we suppose he refers to the transaction, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:40">Acts 15:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:41">Acts 15:41</span>, and then it would appear that <i>Silas</i> is the person intended.</p>
<p><i><b>With this grace</b></i> — Liberal contribution. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Your ready mind.</b></i> — Your willingness to relieve them. But, instead of υμων, <i>your</i>, ημων, <i>our</i>, is the reading of almost all the best MSS. and all the <i>versions</i>. This is, doubtless, the reading.</p>
