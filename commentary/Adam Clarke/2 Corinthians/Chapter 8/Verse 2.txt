<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>. <i><b>In a great trial of affliction</b></i> â€” The sense of this verse is the following: The Macedonians, though both poor and persecuted, rejoiced exceedingly that an opportunity was afforded them of doing good to their <i>more impoverished</i> and <i>more persecuted</i> brethren. We can scarcely ever speak of <i>poverty</i> and <i>affliction</i> in an <i>absolute</i> sense; they are only <i>comparative</i>. Even the <i>poor</i> are called to <i>relieve</i> those who are <i>poorer</i> than themselves; and the <i>afflicted</i>, to <i>comfort</i> those who are <i>more afflicted</i> than they are. The poor and afflicted Churches of Macedonia felt this duty, and therefore came forward to the uttermost of their power to relieve their more impoverished and afflicted brethren in Judea.</p>
