Verse 23. Whether any do inquire of Titus — Should it be asked, Who is this TITUS? I answer, he is my companion, and my fellow labourer in reference to you; 2 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 7:6; 2 Corinthians 7:7. Should any inquire, Who are these brethren, Luke and Apollos? I answer, They are αποστολοι, apostles of the Churches, and intensely bent on promoting the glory of Christ.
