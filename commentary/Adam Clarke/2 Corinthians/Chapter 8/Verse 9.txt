<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>. <i><b>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</b></i> — This was the strongest argument of all; and it is urged home by the apostle with admirable address.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye know</b></i> — Ye are acquainted with God's ineffable love in sending Jesus Christ into the world; and ye know the <i>grace</i>-the infinite benevolence of Christ himself.</p>
<p><i><b>That, though he was rich</b></i> — The possessor, as he was the creator, of the heavens and the earth; <i>for your sakes he became</i> <i>poor</i>-he emptied himself, and made himself of no reputation, and took upon himself the form of a servant, and humbled himself unto death, even the death of the cross; <i>that ye, through his</i> <i>poverty</i>-through his humiliation and death, <i>might be rich</i>-might regain your forfeited inheritance, and be enriched with every grace of his Holy Spirit, and brought at last to his eternal glory.</p>
<p>If Jesus Christ, as some contend, were only a <i>mere man</i>, in what sense could he be said to be <i>rich</i>? His <i>family</i> was <i>poor</i> in Bethlehem; his <i>parents</i> were very poor also; he <i>himself</i> never possessed any <i>property</i> among men from the <i>stable</i> to the <i>cross</i>; nor had he any thing to <i>bequeath</i> at his death but his <i>peace</i>. And in what way could the <i>poverty</i> of one man make a multitude <i>rich</i>? These are questions which, on the Socinian scheme, can never be satisfactorily answered.</p>
