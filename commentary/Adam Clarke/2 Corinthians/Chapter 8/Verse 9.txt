Verse 2 Corinthians 8:9. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ — This was the strongest argument of all; and it is urged home by the apostle with admirable address.Ye know — Ye are acquainted with God's ineffable love in sending Jesus Christ into the world; and ye know the grace-the infinite benevolence of Christ himself.That, though he was rich — The possessor, as he was the creator, of the heavens and the earth; for your sakes he became poor-he emptied himself, and made himself of no reputation, and took upon himself the form of a servant, and humbled himself unto death, even the death of the cross; that ye, through his poverty-through his humiliation and death, might be rich-might regain your forfeited inheritance, and be enriched with every grace of his Holy Spirit, and brought at last to his eternal glory.If Jesus Christ, as some contend, were only a mere man, in what sense could he be said to be rich? His family was poor in Bethlehem; his parents were very poor also; he himself never possessed any property among men from the stable to the cross; nor had he any thing to bequeath at his death but his peace. And in what way could the poverty of one man make a multitude rich? These are questions which, on the Socinian scheme, can never be satisfactorily answered.
