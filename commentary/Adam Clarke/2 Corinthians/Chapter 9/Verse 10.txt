<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>. <i><b>Now he that ministereth seed to the sower</b></i> — The <i>sower</i>, as we have already seen, is he that <i>gives alms</i> of what he hath; and God, who requires him to give these alms, is here represented as <i>providing</i> him with the <i>means</i>. As in the creation, if God had not created the earth <i>with every tree and plant with</i> <i>its seed in itself</i>, so that a <i>harvest</i> came, without a <i>previous</i> <i>ploughing and sowing</i>, there could have been no seed to deposit in the earth; so, if God had not, in the course of his providence, given them the <i>property</i> they had, it would be impossible for them to give <i>alms</i>. And as even the well cultivated and sowed field would be unfruitful if God did not, by his unseen energy and blessing, cause it to bring forth, and bring to maturity; so would it have been with their property: it could not have <i>increased</i>; for without his blessing riches take wings and flee away, as an eagle towards heaven. Therefore, in every sense, it is God who <i>ministers seed to the sower, and multiplies the seed sown</i>. And as all this properly comes from God, and cannot exist without him, he has a right to require that it be dispensed in that way which he judges best.</p>
<p>The word ο επιχορηγων, <i>he that ministereth</i>, is very emphatic; it signifies <i>he who leads up the chorus</i>, from επι, to, and χορηγω to <i>lead the chorus</i>; it means also to <i>join to, associate, to supply</i> or <i>furnish one thing after another</i> so that there be no <i>want</i> or <i>chasm</i>. Thus God is represented, in the course of his providence, <i>associating</i> and <i>connecting causes</i> and <i>effects; keeping every thing</i> in its <i>proper place</i> and <i>state</i> of <i>dependence</i> on another, and all upon himself; so that summer and winter, heat and cold, seed time and harvest, regularly succeed each other. Thus God <i>leads up this</i> <i>grand chorus of causes and effects</i>: provides the <i>seed</i> to the hand of the sower; gives him <i>skill</i> to discern the times when the earth should be prepared for the grain, and when the grain should be sowed; blesses the earth, and causes it to bring forth and bud, so that it may again minister seed to the sower and bread to the eater; and, by a watchful providence, preserves every thing. The figure is beautiful, and shows us the grand system of causes and effects, all directed by and under the immediate guidance and government of God himself.</p>
<p>There is a fine exemplification of this in the same figure thus produced by the prophet. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:21">Hosea 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:22">Hosea 2:22</span>: I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the <i>heavens</i>; and they shall hear the <i>earth</i>; and the <i>earth</i> shall hear the <i>corn</i>, and the <i>wine</i> and the <i>oil</i>; and they shall hear <i>Jezreel</i>. See the note there.</p>
<p><i><b>The fruits of your righteousness</b></i> — Your beneficence; for so δικαιοσυνη is here to be understood. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>, already referred to.</p>
