<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:11">2 Corinthians 9:11</span>. <i><b>Being enriched in every thing</b></i> â€” Observe, Why does God give riches? That they may be applied to his glory, and the good of men. Why does he <i>increase</i> riches? That those who have them may <i>exercise all bountifulness</i>. And if they be <i>enriched in</i> <i>every thing</i>, what will be the consequence if they do not exercise <i>all bountifulness</i>? Why, God will curse their blessings; the rust shall canker them, and the moth shall consume their garments. But if, on the other hand, they do thus apply them, then <i>they cause</i> <i>thanksgiving to God</i>. The 9th and 10th verses should be read in a parenthesis, for this verse connects with the <i>eighth</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8-11">2 Corinthians 9:8-11</span></p>
