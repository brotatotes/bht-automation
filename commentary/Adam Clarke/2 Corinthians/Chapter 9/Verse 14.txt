<p>Verse 14. <i><b>The exceeding grace of God in you.</b></i> — By the υπερβαλλουσαν χαριν, <i>superabounding</i> or <i>transcending grace, of</i> <i>God, which was in them</i>, the apostle most evidently means the <i>merciful</i> and <i>charitable disposition</i> which they had towards the suffering saints. The whole connection, indeed the whole <i>chapter</i>, proves this; and the apostle attributes this to its right source, the grace or goodness of God. They had the <i>means</i> of charity, but God had given these means; they had a <i>feeling</i>, and <i>charitable</i> <i>heart</i>, but God was the author of it. Their charity was <i>superabundant</i>, and God had furnished both the <i>disposition</i>, the <i>occasion</i>, and the <i>means</i> by which that disposition was to be made manifest.</p>
