<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:15">2 Corinthians 9:15</span>. <i><b>Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.</b></i> — Some contend that Christ only is here intended; others, that the almsgiving is meant.</p>
<p>After all the difference of commentators and preachers, it is most evident that the ανεκδιηγητος δωρεα, <i>unspeakable gift</i>, is precisely the same with the υπερβαλλουση χαρις, <i>superabounding</i> <i>grace</i> or <i>benefit</i>, of the preceding verse. If therefore <i>Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i>, the gift of God's unbounded love to man, be the meaning of the <i>unspeakable gift</i> in this verse, he is also intended by the <i>superabounding grace</i> in the preceding. But it is most evident that it is the <i>work of Christ in them</i>, and not Christ <i>himself</i>, which is intended in the 14th verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:14">2 Corinthians 9:14</span>; and consequently, that it is the same <i>work</i>, not the <i>operator</i>, which is referred to in this last verse.</p>
<p>A FEW farther observations may be necessary on the conclusion of this chapter.</p>
<p>1. JESUS CHRIST, <i>the gift of God's love</i> to mankind, is an <i>unspeakable blessing</i>; no man can <i>conceive</i>, much less <i>declare</i>, how great this gift is; for these things the angels desire to look into. Therefore he may be well called the unspeakable gift, as he is the highest God ever gave or can give to man; though this is not the meaning of the last verse.</p>
<p>2. The <i>conversion</i> of a soul from darkness to light, from sin to holiness, from Satan to God, is not less <i>inconceivable</i>. It is called a <i>new creation</i>, and <i>creative energy</i> cannot be <i>comprehended.</i> To have the grace of God to rule the heart, subduing all things to itself and filling the soul with the Divine nature, is an <i>unspeakable blessing</i>; and the energy that produced it is an <i>unspeakable gift</i>. I conclude, therefore, that it is the <i>work of</i> <i>Christ</i> in the soul, and not Christ <i>himself</i>, that the apostle terms the <i>superabounding</i> or <i>exceeding great grace</i>, and the <i>unspeakable</i> <i>gift</i>; and Dr. Whitby's paraphrase may be safely admitted as giving the <i>true sense</i> of the passage. "<i>Thanks</i> be <i>unto God for his</i> <i>unspeakable gift</i>: i.e. this admirable charity (proceeding from the work of Christ in the soul) by which God is so much glorified, the Gospel receives such credit, others are so much benefited, and you will be by God so plentifully rewarded." This is the sober sense of the passage; and no other meaning can comport with it. The passage itself is a grand proof that every <i>good disposition</i> in the soul of man comes from God; and it explodes the notion of <i>natural good</i>, i.e. good which God <i>does not work</i>, which is absurd; for no <i>effect</i> can exist without a <i>cause</i>; and God being the <i>fountain</i> of <i>good</i>, all that can be called good must come immediately from himself.

<p>3. Most men can see the hand of God in the dispensations of his justice, and yet these very seldom appear. How is it that they cannot equally see his hand in the dispensations of his mercy, which are great, striking, and unremitting? Our afflictions we scarcely ever forget; our mercies we scarcely ever remember! Our hearts are alive to <i>complaint</i>, but dead to <i>gratitude</i>. We have had ten thousand mercies for one judgment, and yet our complaints to our thanksgivings have been ten thousand to one! How is it that God endures this, and bears with us? Ask his own eternal clemency; and ask the Mediator before the throne. The mystery of our preservation and salvation can be <i>there alone</i> explained.</p>
