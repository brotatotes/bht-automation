Verse 2 Corinthians 9:3. Yet have I sent the brethren — Titus and his companions, mentioned in the preceding chapter.That, as I said, ye may be ready — And he wished them to be ready, that they might preserve the good character he had given them: this was for their honour; and if they did not take care to do so, he might be reputed a liar; and thus both they and himself be ashamed before the Macedonians, should any of them at this time accompany him to Corinth.
