<p><i><b>That, as I said, ye may be ready</b></i> — And he wished them to be ready, that they might preserve the good character he had given them: this was for their <i>honour</i>; and if they did not take care to do so, he might be reputed a <i>liar</i>; and thus both they and himself be <i>ashamed</i> before the Macedonians, should any of them at this time accompany him to Corinth.</p>
