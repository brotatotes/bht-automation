<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:5">2 Corinthians 9:5</span>. <i><b>Whereof ye had notice before</b></i> — Instead of προκατηγγελμενην, <i>spoken of before</i>, BCDEFG, several others, with the <i>Coptic, Vulgate, Itala</i>, and several of the <i>fathers</i>, have προεπηγγελμενην, <i>what was promised before</i>. The sense is not very different; probably the latter reading was intended to explain the former. See the margin.</p>
<p><i><b>Bounty, and not as</b></i><b> of </b><i><b>covetousness.</b></i> — Had they been <i>backward</i>, strangers might have attributed this to a <i>covetous</i> principle; as it would appear that they were loth to give up their money, and that they parted with it only when they could not for shame keep it any longer. This is the property of a <i>covetous</i> heart; whereas <i>readiness</i> to give is the characteristic of a <i>liberal</i> mind. This makes a sufficiently plain sense; and we need not look, as some have done, for any new sense of πλεονεξια, <i>covetousness</i>, as if it were here to be understood as implying a <i>small gift</i>.</p>
