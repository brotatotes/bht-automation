Verse 2 Corinthians 9:6. He which soweth sparingly â€” This is a plain maxim: no man can expect to reap but in proportion as he has sowed. And here almsgiving is represented as a seed sown, which shall bring forth a crop. If the sowing be liberal, and the seed good, the crop shall be so too.Sowing is used among the Jews to express almsgiving: so they understand Isaiah 32:20: Blessed are ye who sow beside all waters; i.e. who are ready to help every one that is in need. And Hosea 10:12, they interpret: Sow to yourselves almsgiving, and ye shall reap in mercy-if you show mercy to the poor, God will show mercy to you.
