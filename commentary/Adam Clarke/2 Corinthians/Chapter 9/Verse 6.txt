<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:6">2 Corinthians 9:6</span>. <i><b>He which soweth sparingly</b></i> â€” This is a plain maxim: no man can expect to reap but in proportion as he has sowed. And here <i>almsgiving</i> is represented as a <i>seed sown</i>, which shall bring forth a <i>crop</i>. If the sowing be liberal, and the seed good, the crop shall be so too.</p>
<p><i>Sowing</i> is used among the Jews to express <i>almsgiving</i>: so they understand <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+32:20">Isaiah 32:20</span>: <i>Blessed are ye who sow beside all waters</i>; i.e. who are ready to help every one that is in need. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+10:12">Hosea 10:12</span>, they interpret: <i>Sow to yourselves almsgiving, and ye shall reap in mercy</i>-if you show mercy to the poor, God will show mercy to you.</p>
