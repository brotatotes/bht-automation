<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:7">2 Corinthians 9:7</span>. <i><b>Not grudgingly, or of necessity</b></i> — The Jews had in the temple <i>two chests</i> for alms; the one was של תובה of what was <i>necessary</i>, i.e. what the law required, the other was של נרבה of the <i>free-will offerings</i>. To escape perdition some would <i>grudgingly</i> give what <i>necessity</i> obliged them; others would give <i>cheerfully</i>, for the love of God, and through pity to the poor. Of the <i>first</i>, nothing is said; they simply did what the law required. Of the <i>second</i>, much is said; <i>God loves them</i>. The benefit of almsgiving is lost to the giver when he does it with a <i>grumbling</i> <i>heart</i>. And, as he does not do the <i>duty</i> in the <i>spirit</i> of the duty, even the performance of the <i>letter</i> of the law is an abomination in the sight of God.</p>
<p>To these two sorts of alms in the temple the apostle most evidently alludes. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
