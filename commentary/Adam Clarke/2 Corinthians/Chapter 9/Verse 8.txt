<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8">2 Corinthians 9:8</span>. <i><b>God is able to make all grace abound</b></i> — We have already seen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span> that the word χαρις, in the connection in which the apostle uses it in these chapters, signifies a <i>charitable gift</i>; here it certainly has the same meaning: God is able to give you, in his mercy, abundance of temporal good; that, having a sufficiency, ye may abound in every good work. This refers to the <i>sowing plenteously</i>: those who do so shall <i>reap</i> <i>plenteously</i>-they shall have an abundance of God's blessings.</p>
