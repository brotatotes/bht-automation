Verse 2 Corinthians 9:8. God is able to make all grace abound — We have already seen, 2 Corinthians 8:1 that the word χαρις, in the connection in which the apostle uses it in these chapters, signifies a charitable gift; here it certainly has the same meaning: God is able to give you, in his mercy, abundance of temporal good; that, having a sufficiency, ye may abound in every good work. This refers to the sowing plenteously: those who do so shall reap plenteously-they shall have an abundance of God's blessings.
