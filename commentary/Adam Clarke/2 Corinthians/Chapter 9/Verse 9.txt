Verse 2 Corinthians 9:9. He hath dispersed abroad — Here is still the allusion to the sower. He sows much; not at home merely, or among those with whom he is acquainted, but abroad-among the strangers, whether of his own or of another nation. The quotation is taken from Psalms 112:9.He hath given to the poor — This is the interpretation of he hath scattered abroad; and therefore it is said, his righteousness remaineth for ever-his good work is had in remembrance before God. By righteousness we have already seen that the Jews understand almsgiving. Matthew 6:1; Matthew 6:1.
