<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:9">2 Corinthians 9:9</span>. <i><b>He hath dispersed abroad</b></i> — Here is still the allusion to the <i>sower</i>. He <i>sows much</i>; not at <i>home</i> merely, or among those with whom he is <i>acquainted</i>, but <i>abroad</i>-among the <i>strangers</i>, whether of his own or of another nation. The quotation is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalms 112:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>He hath given to the poor</b></i> — This is the interpretation of <i>he</i> <i>hath scattered abroad</i>; and therefore it is said, <i>his righteousness</i> <i>remaineth for ever</i>-his good work is had in remembrance before God. By <i>righteousness</i> we have already seen that the Jews understand <i>almsgiving</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span></span>.</p>
