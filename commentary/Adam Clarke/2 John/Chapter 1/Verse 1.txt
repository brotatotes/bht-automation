<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:1">2 John 1:1</span>. <i><b>The elder</b></i> — John the apostle, who was now a very old man, generally supposed to be about ninety, and therefore he uses the term ο πρεσβυτερος, presbyter or elder, not as the name of an <i>office</i>, but as designating his advanced age. He is allowed to have been the oldest of all the apostles, and to have been the only one who died a natural death.</p>
<p>This title led some of the ancients to attribute this epistle to a person called <i>John the Presbyter</i>, a member of the Church at Ephesus; and not to John the apostle. But this is a groundless supposition.</p>
<p><i><b>The elect lady</b></i> — εκλεκτη κυρια. As κυρια, <i>kuria</i>, may be the feminine of κυριος, <i>kurios</i>, lord, therefore it may signify <i>lady</i>; and so several, both ancients and moderns, have understood it. But others have considered it the <i>proper name</i> of a woman, <i>Kyria</i>; and that this is a very ancient opinion is evident from the <i>Peshito Syriac</i>, the oldest version we have, which uses it as a proper name [Syriac] <i>koureea</i>, as does also the Arabic [Arabic] <i>kooreea</i>.</p>
<p>Some have thought that <i>Eclecta</i> was the name of this matron, from the word εκλεκτη, which we translate <i>elect</i>, and which here signifies the same as <i>excellent, eminent, honourable</i>, or the like. Others think that a particular <i>Church</i> is intended, which some suppose to be the <i>Church at Jerusalem</i>, and that the <i>elect sister</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:13">2 John 1:13</span>, means the <i>Church at Ephesus</i>; but these are conjectures which appear to me to have no good ground. I am satisfied that no <i>metaphor</i> is here intended; that the epistle was sent to some eminent Christian matron, not far from Ephesus, who was probably <i>deaconess</i> of the Church, who, it is likely, had a Church at her house, or at whose house the apostles and travelling evangelists frequently preached, and were entertained. This will appear more probable in the course of the notes.</p>
<p><i><b>Whom I love in the truth</b></i> — Whom I love as the Christian religion requires us to love one another.</p>
<p><i><b>And not I only</b></i> — She was well known in the Churches; many had witnessed or heard of her fidelity, and partook of her hospitality; so that she had a good report of all Christians in that quarter.</p>
