<p>THIS epistle is more remarkable for the spirit of Christian love which it breathes than for any thing else. It contains scarcely any thing that is not found in the preceding; and out of the thirteen verses there are at least <i>eight</i> which are found, either in so many words or in sentiment, precisely the same with those of the first epistle. The most remarkable part of it is the <i>tenth</i> and <i>eleventh</i> verses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:10">2 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:11">2 John 1:11</span> relative to the orders concerning the <i>heretical teacher</i>; and from them we see how such teachers were treated in the apostolic Church. They held no communion with them, afforded them no support, as <i>teachers</i>; but <i>did not persecute</i> them.</p>
<p>On this model the conduct of all Christians should be formed, relative to the teachers of false doctrine in general. To go <i>thus</i> <i>far</i>, we have apostolical authority, to go <i>farther</i>, we have none. And let us still remember, in all cases it is our duty to love even our enemies, and consequently to do them any act of humanity and mercy.</p>
