Verse 2 John 1:13. The children of thy elect sister — Probably her own sister, who lived at Ephesus; and, being acquainted with the apostle's writing, desired to be thus remembered to her. Elect, both in this and the first verse, signifies excellent, eminent, or honourable. See note on 2 John 1:1.Amen is wanting in the most ancient MSS., and in most of the versions; but ηχαριςμετασου and μεθυμων, Grace be with thee, or with you, is found in several MSS. and versions.Subscriptions in the VERSIONS: - The end of the Second Epistle. - Syriac.The Second Epistle of John is ended. - Philox.

It contains scarcely any thing that is not found in the preceding; and out of the thirteen verses there are at least eight which are found, either in so many words or in sentiment, precisely the same with those of the first epistle. The most remarkable part of it is the tenth and eleventh verses, 2 John 1:10; 2 John 1:11 relative to the orders concerning the heretical teacher; and from them we see how such teachers were treated in the apostolic Church. They held no communion with them, afforded them no support, as teachers; but did not persecute them.On this model the conduct of all Christians should be formed, relative to the teachers of false doctrine in general. To go thus far, we have apostolical authority, to go farther, we have none. And let us still remember, in all cases it is our duty to love even our enemies, and consequently to do them any act of humanity and mercy.
