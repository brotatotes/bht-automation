<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:2">2 John 1:2</span>. <i><b>For the truth's sake</b></i> — On account of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Which dwelleth in us</b></i> — By the grace which it has proclaimed.</p>
<p><i><b>And shall be with us</b></i> — For God will preserve not only the Christian religion but its truth, all its essential doctrines for ever. And they that <i>abide in the truth</i> shall go whither that truth leads, <i>i.e.</i> to glory. The <i>Armenian</i> has a strange reading here: "For the truth's sake which dwelleth in us, <i>because it is</i> <i>also with you; and ye shall be with us for ever</i>." But this is supported by no other version, nor by any MS.</p>
