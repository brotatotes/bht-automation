Verse 2 John 1:2. For the truth's sake — On account of the Gospel.Which dwelleth in us — By the grace which it has proclaimed.And shall be with us — For God will preserve not only the Christian religion but its truth, all its essential doctrines for ever. And they that abide in the truth shall go whither that truth leads, i.e. to glory. The Armenian has a strange reading here: "For the truth's sake which dwelleth in us, because it is also with you; and ye shall be with us for ever." But this is supported by no other version, nor by any MS.
