<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:4">2 John 1:4</span>. <i><b>That I found of thy children walking in truth</b></i> — I have already supposed this Christian matron to be <i>mother of a</i> <i>family</i>, probably a <i>widow</i>, for no mention is made of her husband; and that she was also a <i>deaconess</i> in the church, and one in those house the travelling evangelists preached, and there they were entertained. The <i>children</i> mentioned here may either be <i>her own</i> <i>children</i>, or those <i>members of the Church</i> which were under her care, or some of <i>both</i>. The apostle was glad to <i>find</i>, probably by an epistle sent from herself to him, or from the information of some of the itinerant evangelists, that the work of God was prospering in the place where she lived, and also in her own household. He does not say that all were walking in the truth, but εκτωντεκνων, <i>some of her children</i>; there was a growing and spreading work, and there were many adversaries who strove to pervert them who had already believed, and perhaps were successful in drawing several away from their simplicity.</p>
