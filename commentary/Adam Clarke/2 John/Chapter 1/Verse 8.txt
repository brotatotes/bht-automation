<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:8">2 John 1:8</span>. <i><b>Look to yourselves</b></i> — Be on your guard against these seducers; watch, pray, love God and each other, and walk in newness of life.</p>
<p><i><b>That we lose not those things which we have wrought</b></i> — That we apostles, who have been the means of your conversion, may not be deprived of you as our crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Instead of the <i>first person plural</i>, απολεσωμεν, &amp;c., WE <i>lose</i>, &amp;c., many MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers</i>, read the whole clause in the <i>second person</i> plural, απολεσητε, YE <i>lose</i>, &amp;c. <i>Take heed to</i> <i>yourselves that</i> YE <i>lose not the things which</i> YE <i>have wrought, but</i> <i>that</i> YE <i>receive a full reward</i>. This reading is more consistent and likely, and is supported by at least as good evidence as the other. We find that if these persons did not <i>keep on their guard</i> they might lose their salvation, and the apostles their rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jesus. Even this intimation might put them on their guard. Had the apostle said <i>ye cannot finally fall</i>, what a different effect would it have produced! Griesbach has placed these readings in the margin as being very probable.</p>
