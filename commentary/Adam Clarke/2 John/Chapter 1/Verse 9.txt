<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:9">2 John 1:9</span>. <i><b>Whosoever transgresseth</b></i> — παραβαινων. He who <i>passes</i> over the sacred enclosure, or <i>goes beyond</i> the prescribed limits; <i>and abideth not in the doctrine</i>-does not remain <i>within</i> these <i>holy</i> <i>limits</i>, but indulges himself either in excesses of <i>action</i> or <i>passion; hath not God</i> for his Father, nor the love of God in his heart.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath both the father and the Son.</b></i> — He who abideth in the doctrine of Christ, his body is a temple of the Holy Trinity, and he has communion with the Father as his Father, and <i>with the Son</i> as his Saviour and <i>Redeemer</i>.</p>
