<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>. <i><b>Simon Peter</b></i> — <i>Symeon</i>, συμεων, is the reading of almost all the versions, and of all the most important MSS. And this is the more remarkable, as the surname of Peter occurs upwards of seventy times in the New Testament, and is invariably read σιμον, <i>Simon</i>, except here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:14">Acts 15:14</span>, where James gives him the name of <i>Symeon</i>. Of all the versions, only the <i>Armenian</i> and <i>Vulgate</i> have <i>Simon</i>. But the <i>edit. princ</i>., and several of my own MSS. of the Vulgate, write <i>Symon</i>; and Wiclif has <i>Symont</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A servant</b></i> — Employed in his Master's work.</p>
<p><i><b>And an apostle</b></i> — Commissioned immediately by Jesus Christ himself to preach to the Gentiles, and to write these epistles for the edification of the Church. As the writer was an <i>apostle</i>, the epistle is therefore necessarily <i>canonical</i>. All the MSS. agree in the title <i>apostle</i>; and of the <i>versions</i>, only the <i>Syriac</i> omits it.</p>
<p><i><b>Precious faith</b></i> — ισοτιμονπιστιν. <i>Valuable faith</i>; faith worth a great price, and faith which cost a great price. The word precious is used in the <i>low</i> religious phraseology for <i>dear,</i> <i>comfortable, delightful</i>, c. but how much is the dignity of the subject let down by expressions and meanings more proper for the nursery than for the noble science of salvation! It is necessary however to state, that the word <i>precious</i> literally signifies <i>valuable</i>, of <i>great price, costly</i>; and was not used in that <i>low</i> sense in which it is now employed when our translation was made. That <i>faith</i> must be of infinite value, the grace of which Christ purchased by his blood; and it must be of infinite value also when it is the very instrument by which the soul is saved unto eternal life.</p>
<p><i><b>With us</b></i> — God having given to <i>you</i>-believing <i>Gentiles</i>, the same faith and salvation which he had given to <i>us</i>-believing <i>Jews</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Through the righteousness of God</b></i> — Through his <i>method</i> of bringing a lost world, both Jews and Gentiles, to salvation by Jesus Christ; through his gracious impartiality, providing for Gentiles as well as Jews. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21-26">Romans 3:21-26</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ</b></i> — This is not a proper translation of the original τουθεουημωνκαισωτηροςιησου χριστου, which is literally, <i>Of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ</i>; and this reading, which is indicated in the <i>margin</i>, should have been received into the text; and it is an absolute proof that St. Peter calls Jesus Christ GOD, even in the properest sense of the word, with the <i>article</i> prefixed. It is no evidence against this doctrine that one MS. of little authority, and the <i>Syriac</i> and two <i>Arabic</i> versions have κυριου, <i>Lord</i>, instead of θεου, <i>God</i>, as all other MSS. and versions agree in the other reading, as well as the fathers. See in <i>Griesbach</i>.</p>
