<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Wherefore</b></i> — Seeing the danger of apostasy, and the fearful end of them who obey not the Gospel, and thus receive the grace of God in vain; <i>give all diligence</i>, σπουδασατε, hasten, be deeply careful, labour with the most intense purpose of soul.</p>
<p><i><b>To make your calling</b></i> — From deep Gentile darkness into the marvellous light of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>And election</b></i> — Your being <i>chosen</i>, in consequence of obeying the heavenly <i>calling</i>, to be the people and Church of God. Instead of κλησιν, <i>calling</i>, the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> has παρακλησιν, <i>consolation</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Sure</b></i> — βεβαιαν. <i>Firm, solid</i>. For your calling to believe the Gospel, and your <i>election</i> to be members of the Church of Christ, will be ultimately unprofitable to you, unless you hold fast what you have received by adding to your faith virtue, knowledge, temperance, c.</p>
<p><i><b>For if ye do these things</b></i> — If ye be careful and diligent to work out your own salvation, through the grace which ye have already received from God <i>ye shall never fall</i>, ουμηπταισητε ποτε, <i>ye shall at no time stumble</i> or <i>fall</i>; as the Jews have done, and lost their election, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>, where the same word is used, and as apostates do, and lose their peace and salvation. We find, therefore, that they who <i>do not</i> these things <i>shall fall</i>; and thus we see that there is nothing absolute and unconditional in their <i>election</i>. There is an addition here in some MSS. and versions which should not pass unnoticed: the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, nine others, with the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic, Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> with an asterisk, the <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Bede,</i> have ιναδιατωνκαλων (υμων) εργων, THAT BY (<i>your</i>) GOOD WORKS <i>ye may make your calling and election firm</i>. This clause is found in the edition of <i>Colinaeus</i>, Paris, 1534, and has been probably omitted by more recent editors on the supposition that the edition does not make a very <i>orthodox</i> sense. But on this ground there need be no alarm, for it does not state that the good works thus required merit either the <i>calling</i> and <i>election</i>, or the <i>eternal glory</i>, of God. He who does not by good works <i>confirm</i> his <i>calling</i> and <i>election</i>, will soon have <i>neither</i>; and although no good works ever did purchase or ever can purchase the kingdom of God, yet no soul can ever scripturally expect to see God who has them not. <i>I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat; thirsty, and ye</i> <i>gave me no drink: go, ye cursed. I was hungry, and ye gave me</i> <i>meat</i>; c., &amp;c. <i>come, ye blessed</i>.</p>
