<p>Verse 11. <i><b>For so an entrance shall be ministered</b></i> — If ye <i>give</i> <i>diligence</i>; and do <i>not fall</i>, an abundant, free, honourable, and triumphant entrance shall be ministered to you into the everlasting kingdom. There seems to be here an allusion to the <i>triumphs</i> granted by the Romans to their generals who had distinguished themselves by putting an end to a war, or doing some signal military service to the state. (See the whole account of this military pageant in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:14">2 Corinthians 2:14</span><i>"</i>.) "Ye shall have a triumph, in consequence of having conquered your foes, and led captivity captive."</p>
<p>Instead of <i>everlasting kingdom</i>, αιωνιονβασιλειαν, two MSS. have επουρανιον, <i>heavenly kingdom</i>; and several MSS. omit the word καισωτηρος, and <i>Saviour</i>.</p>
