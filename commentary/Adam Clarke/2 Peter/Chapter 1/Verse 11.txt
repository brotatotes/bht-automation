Verse 11. For so an entrance shall be ministered — If ye give diligence; and do not fall, an abundant, free, honourable, and triumphant entrance shall be ministered to you into the everlasting kingdom. There seems to be here an allusion to the triumphs granted by the Romans to their generals who had distinguished themselves by putting an end to a war, or doing some signal military service to the state. (See the whole account of this military pageant in Clarke's note on "2 Corinthians 2:14".) "Ye shall have a triumph, in consequence of having conquered your foes, and led captivity captive."Instead of everlasting kingdom, αιωνιονβασιλειαν, two MSS. have επουρανιον, heavenly kingdom; and several MSS. omit the word καισωτηρος, and Saviour.
