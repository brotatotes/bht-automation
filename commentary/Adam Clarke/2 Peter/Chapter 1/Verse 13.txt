<p>Verse 13. <i><b>As long as I am in this tabernacle</b></i> — By <i>tabernacle</i> we are to understand his <i>body</i>; and hence several of the versions have σωματι, <i>body</i>, instead of σκηνωματι, <i>tabernacle</i>. Peter's mode of speaking is very remarkable: as long as I AM in this <i>tabernacle</i>, so then the <i>body</i> was not <i>Peter</i>, but <i>Peter</i> dwelt in that <i>body</i>. Is not this a proof that St. Peter believed his soul to be very distinct from his body? As a man's house is the place where he dwells, so the body is the house where the soul dwells.</p>
