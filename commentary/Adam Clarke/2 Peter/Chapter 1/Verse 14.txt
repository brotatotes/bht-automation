Verse 14. Knowing that shortly I must put off â€” St. Peter plainly refers to the conversation between our Lord and himself, related John 21:18; John 21:19. And it is likely that he had now a particular intimation that he was shortly to seal the truth with his blood. But as our Lord told him that his death would take place when he should be old, being aged now he might on this ground fairly suppose that his departure was at hand.
