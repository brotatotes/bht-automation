<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Moreover, I will endeavour</b></i> — And is not this endeavour seen in these two epistles? By leaving these among them, even after his decease, they had <i>these things always in</i> <i>remembrance</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>After my decease</b></i> — μετατηνεμηνεξοδον. <i>After my going out</i>, i.e. of his <i>tabernacle</i>. The real Peter was not open to the eye, nor palpable to the touch; he was concealed in that <i>tabernacle</i> vulgarly supposed to be <i>Peter</i>. There is a thought very similar to this in the last conversation of Socrates with his friends. As this great man was about to drink the poison to which he was condemned by the Athenian judges, his friend CRITO said, "But how would you be buried?-SOCRATES: Just as you please, <i>if you can but</i> <i>catch me</i>, and I do not elude your pursuit. Then, gently smiling, he said: I cannot persuade Crito, ωςεγωειμιουτοςοσωκρατηςο νυνιδιαλεγομεςος, that I AM <i>that Socrates who now converses with</i> <i>you</i>; but he thinks that <i>I am he</i>, ονοψεταιολιγονυστεροννεκρον καιερωταπωςεδιμεθαπτειν, <i>whom he shall shortly see dead</i>; and he asks how I would be buried? I have asserted that, after I have drunk the poison, <i>I should no longer remain with you, but shall</i> <i>depart to certain felicities of the blessed</i>."
