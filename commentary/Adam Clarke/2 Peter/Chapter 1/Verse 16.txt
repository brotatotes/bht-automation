<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Cunningly devised fables</b></i> — σεσοφισμενοιςμυθοις. I think, with Macknight and others, from the apostle's using εποπται, <i>eye witnesses</i>, or rather <i>beholders</i>, in the end of the verse, it is probable that he means those <i>cunningly</i> devised <i>fables</i> among the heathens, concerning the <i>appearance of their gods on</i> <i>earth in human form</i>. And to gain the greater credit to these fables, the priests and statesmen instituted what they called the <i>mysteries</i> of the gods, in which the fabulous appearance of the gods was represented in mystic <i>shows</i>. But one particular show none but the fully initiated were permitted to <i>behold</i>; hence they were entitled εποπται, <i>beholders</i>. This show was probably some resplendent image of the god, imitating life, which, by its <i>glory</i>, dazzled the eyes of the beholders, while their ears were ravished by hymns sung in its praise; to this it was natural enough for St. Peter to allude, when speaking about the transfiguration of Christ. Here the indescribably resplendent majesty of the great God was <i>manifested</i>, as far as it could be, in conjunction with that human body in which the fulness of the Divinity dwelt. <i>And</i> <i>we</i>, says the apostle, <i>were</i> εποπται, <i>beholders</i>, τηςεκεινου μεγαλειοτητος, <i>of his own majesty</i>. Here was no <i>trick</i>, no feigned show; we saw him in his glory whom thousands saw before and afterwards; and we have made known to you the <i>power and coming</i>, παρουσιαν, the appearance and presence, of our Lord Jesus; and we call you to feel the exceeding greatness of this power in your conversion, and the glory of this appearance in his revelation by the power of his Spirit to your souls. These things we have witnessed, and these things ye have experienced: and therefore we can confidently say that neither you nor we have followed cunningly devised fables, but that blessed Gospel which is the power of God to the salvation of every one that believes.</p>
