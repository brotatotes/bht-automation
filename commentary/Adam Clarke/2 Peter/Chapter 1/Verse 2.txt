Verse 2 Peter 1:2. Grace — God's favour; peace-the effects of that favour in the communication of spiritual and temporal blessings.Through the knowledge of God — ενεπιγνωσει. By the acknowledging of God, and of Jesus our Lord. For those who acknowledge him in all their ways, he will direct their steps. Those who know Christ; and do not acknowledge him before men, can get no multiplication of grace and peace.
