<p>Verse 4. <i><b>Whereby are given unto us</b></i> — By his own glorious power he hath <i>freely given unto us exceeding great and invaluable</i> <i>promises</i>. The Jews were distinguished in a very particular manner by the <i>promises</i> which they received from God; the promises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and the prophets. God promised to be their God; to protect, support, and save them; to give them what was emphatically called the promised land; and to cause the Messiah to spring from their race. St. Peter intimates to these <i>Gentiles</i> that God had also given unto them exceeding great promises; indeed all that he had given to the Jews, the mere settlement in the promised land excepted; and this also he had given in all its <i>spiritual</i> meaning and force. And besides τα μεγισταεπαγγελματα, these superlatively great promises, which distinguished the Mosaic dispensation, he had given them τατιμια επαγγελματα; the <i>valuable</i> promises, those which came through the great <i>price</i>; enrolment with the Church of God, redemption in and through the blood of the cross, the continual indwelling influence of the Holy Ghost, the resurrection of the body, and eternal rest at the right hand of God. It was of considerable consequence to the comfort of the Gentiles that these promises were made to <i>them</i>, and that salvation was not exclusively of the Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>That by these ye might be partakers</b></i> — The object of all God's promises and dispensations was to bring fallen man back to the <i>image of God</i>, which he had lost. This, indeed, is the sum and substance of the religion of Christ. We have partaken of an <i>earthly, sensual</i>, and <i>devilish</i> nature; the design of God by Christ is to remove this, and to make us <i>partakers of the Divine nature</i>; and save us from all the <i>corruption</i> in principle and fact <i>which is</i> <i>in the world</i>; the source of which is <i>lust</i>, επιθυμια, irregular, unreasonable, in ordinate, and impure desire; desire to have, to do, and to be, what God has prohibited, and what would be ruinous and destructive to us were the desire to be granted.</p>
<p><i>Lust</i>, or irregular, impure desire, is the <i>source</i> whence all the corruption which is in the world springs. Lust conceives and brings forth sin; sin is finished or brought into act, and then brings forth death. This destructive principle is to be rooted out; and love to God and man is to be implanted in its place. This is every Christian's privilege; God has promised to purify our hearts by faith; and that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so shall grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life; that here we are to be delivered out of the hands of all our enemies, and have even "the thoughts of our hearts so cleansed by the inspiration of God's Holy Spirit, that we shall perfectly love him, and worthily magnify his holy name."</p>
<p>This blessing may be expected by those who are continually <i>escaping</i>, αποφυγοντες, <i>flying from</i>, the corruption that is in the world and in themselves. God purifies no heart in which sin is <i>indulged</i>. Get pardon through the blood of the Lamb; feel your need of being purified in heart; seek that with all your soul; plead the exceeding great and invaluable promises that refer to this point; abhor your inward self; abstain from every appearance of evil; flee from self and sin to God; and the very God of peace will sanctify you through body, soul, and spirit, make you burning and shining lights here below, (a proof that he can save to the uttermost ail that come to him by Christ,) and afterwards, having guided you by his counsel through life, will receive you into his eternal glory.</p>
