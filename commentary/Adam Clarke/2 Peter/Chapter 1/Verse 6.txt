<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Temperance</b></i> — A proper and limited use of all earthly enjoyments, keeping every sense under proper restraints, and never permitting the animal part to subjugate the rational.</p>
<p><i><b>Patience</b></i> — Bearing all trials and difficulties with an even mind, enduring in all, and persevering through all.</p>
<p><i><b>Godliness</b></i> — Piety towards God; a deep, reverential, religious fear; not only worshipping God with every becoming <i>outward</i> act, but adoring, loving, and magnifying him in the heart: a disposition indispensably necessary to salvation, but exceedingly rare among professors.</p>
