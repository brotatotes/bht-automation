Verse 7. Brotherly kindness — φιλαδελφιαν. Love of the brotherhood-the strongest attachment to Christ's flock; feeling each as a member of your own body.Charity — αγαπην. Love to the whole human race, even to your persecutors: love to God and the brethren they had; love to all mankind they must also have. True religion is neither selfish nor insulated; where the love of God is, bigotry cannot exist. Narrow, selfish people, and people of a party, who scarcely have any hope of the salvation of those who do not believe as they believe, and who do not follow with them, have scarcely any religion, though in their own apprehension none is so truly orthodox or religious as themselves.After αγαπην, love, one MS. adds these words, ενδετηαγαπη τηνπαρακλησιν, and to this love consolation; but this is an idle and useless addition.
