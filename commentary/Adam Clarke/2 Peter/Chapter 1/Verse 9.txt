<p>Verse 9. <i><b>But he that lacketh these things</b></i> — He, whether Jew or Gentile, who professes to have FAITH in God, and has not added to that FAITH <i>fortitude, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness,</i> <i>brotherly kindness</i>, and universal <i>love</i>; is <i>blind</i>-his understanding is darkened, <i>and cannot see afar off</i>, μυωπαζων, <i>shutting his eyes against the light, winking</i>, not able to look truth in the face, nor to behold that God whom he once knew was reconciled to him: and thus it appears he is <i>wilfully blind</i>, and <i>hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins</i>-has at last, through his nonimprovement of the grace which he received from God, his faith ceasing to work by love, lost the evidence of things not seen; for, having grieved the Holy Spirit by not showing forth the virtues of him who called him into his marvellous light, he has lost the testimony of his sonship; and then, darkness and hardness having taken place of <i>light</i> and <i>filial</i> <i>confidence</i>, he first calls all his former experience into doubt, and questions whether he has not put enthusiasm in the place of religion. By these means his darkness and hardness increase, his memory becomes indistinct and confused, till at length he forgets the work of God on his soul, next denies it, and at last asserts that the knowledge of salvation, by the remission of sins, is impossible, and that no man can be saved from sin in this life. Indeed, some go so far as to deny the Lord that bought them; to renounce Jesus Christ as having made atonement for them; and finish their career of apostasy by utterly denying his Godhead. Many cases of this kind have I known; and they are all the consequence of believers not continuing to be workers together with God, after they had experienced his pardoning love.</p>
<p>Reader, see that the light that is in thee become not darkness; for if it do, <i>how great a darkness</i>!</p>
