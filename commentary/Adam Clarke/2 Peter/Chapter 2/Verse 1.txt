<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>. <i><b>But there were false prophets</b></i> — There were not only holy men of God among the Jews, who prophesied by Divine inspiration, but there were also false prophets, whose prophecies were from their own imagination, and perverted many.</p>
<p><i><b>As there shall be false teachers among you</b></i> — At a very early period of the Christian Church many heresies sprung up; but the chief were those of the Ebionites, Cerinthians, Nicolaitans, Menandrians, and Gnostics, of whom many strange things have been spoken by the primitive fathers, and of whose opinions it is difficult to form any satisfactory view. They were, no doubt, bad enough, and their opponents in general have doubtless made them worse. By what name those were called of whom the apostle here speaks, we cannot tell. They were probably some sort of apostate Jews, or those called the Nicolaitans. See the <i>preface</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Damnable heresies</b></i> — αιρεσεις απωλειας. <i>Heresies of</i> <i>destruction</i>; such as, if followed, would lead a man to perdition. And these παρεισαξουσιν, they will <i>bring in privately</i>-cunningly, without making much noise, and as covertly as possible. It would be better to translate <i>destructive heresies</i> than <i>damnable</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Denying the Lord that bought them</b></i> — It is not certain whether God the Father be intended here, or our Lord Jesus Christ; for God is said to have <i>purchased</i> the Israelites, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:16">Exodus 15:16</span>, and to be the <i>Father that had bought them</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:6">Deuteronomy 32:6</span>, and the words may refer to these or such like passages; or they may point out Jesus Christ, who had <i>bought them with his blood</i>; and the <i>heresies</i>, or <i>dangerous</i> <i>opinions</i>, may mean such as opposed the Divinity of our Lord, or his meritorious and sacrificial death, or such opinions as bring upon those who hold them swift destruction. It seems, however, more natural to understand the Lord that bought them as applying to <i>Christ</i>, than otherwise; and if so, this is another proof, among many, 1. That none can be saved but by Jesus Christ. Z. That through their own wickedness some may perish for whom Christ died.</p>
