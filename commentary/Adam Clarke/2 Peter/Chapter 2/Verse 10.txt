Verse 10. But chiefly them that walk — That is, God will in the most signal manner punish them that walk after the flesh- addict themselves to sodomitical practices, and the lust of pollution; probably alluding to those most abominable practices where men abuse themselves and abuse one another.Despise government. — They brave the power and authority of the civil magistrate, practising their abominations so as to keep out of the reach of the letter of the law; and they speak evil of dignities-they blaspheme civil government, they abhor the restraints laid upon men by the laws, and would wish all governments destroyed that they might live as they list.Presumptuous are they] τολμηται. They are bold and daring, headstrong, regardless of fear.Self-willed — αυθαδεις. Self-sufficient; presuming on themselves; following their own opinions, which no authority can induce them to relinquish.Are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. — They are lawless and disobedient, spurn all human authority, and speak contemptuously of all legal and civil jurisdiction. Those in general despise governments, and speak evil of dignities, who wish to be under no control, that they may act as freebooters in the community.
