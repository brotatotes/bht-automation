<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Whereas angels</b></i>, c.] This is a difficult verse, but the meaning seems to be this: The holy angels, who are represented as bringing an account of the actions of the fallen angels before the Lord in judgment, simply state the facts without exaggeration, and without permitting any thing of a bitter, reviling, or railing spirit, to enter into their accusations. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:1">Zechariah 3:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span> to the former of which St. Peter evidently alludes. But these persons, not only speak of the actions of men which they conceive to be wrong, but do it with untrue colourings, and the greatest malevolence. Michael, the archangel, treated a damned spirit with courtesy; he only said, <i>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan!</i> but these treat the rulers of God's appointment with disrespect and calumny.</p>
<p><i><b>Before the Lord.</b></i> — παρακυριω is wanting in a number of MSS. and most of the <i>versions</i>.</p>
