<p>Verse 12. <i><b>But these, as natural brute beasts</b></i> — ωςαλογαζωα φυσικα. <i>As those natural animals void of reason</i>, following only the gross instinct of nature, being governed neither by reason nor religion.</p>
<p><i><b>Made to be taken and destroyed</b></i> — Intended to be taken with nets and gins, and then destroyed, because of their fierce and destructive nature; so these false teachers and insurgents must be treated; first incarcerated, and then brought to judgment, that they may have the reward of their doings. And thus, by <i>blaspheming what they do not understand</i>, they at last <i>perish in</i> <i>their own corruption</i>; i.e. their corrupt doctrines and vicious practices.</p>
