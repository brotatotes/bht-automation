Verse 13. They that count it pleasure to riot in the day time.] Most sinners, in order to practise their abominable pleasures, seek the secrecy of the night; but these, bidding defiance to all decorum, decency, and shame, take the open day, and thus proclaim their impurities to the sun.Spots - and blemishes — They are a disgrace to the Christian name.Sporting themselves — Forming opinions which give license to sin, and then acting on those opinions; and thus rioting in their own deceits.With their own deceivings — εν ταις απαταις. But instead of this, AB, and almost all the versions and several of the fathers, have εν ταις αγαπαις, in your love feasts, which is probably the true reading.While they feast with you — It appears they held a kind of communion with the Church, and attended sacred festivals, which they desecrated with their own unhallowed opinions and conduct.
