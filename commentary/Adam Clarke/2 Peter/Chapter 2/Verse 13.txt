<p>Verse 13. <i><b>They that count it pleasure to riot in the day</b></i> <i>time.</i>] Most sinners, in order to practise their abominable pleasures, seek the secrecy of the night; but these, bidding defiance to all decorum, decency, and shame, take the open day, and thus proclaim their impurities to the sun.</p>
<p><i><b>Spots - and blemishes</b></i> — They are a disgrace to the Christian name.</p>
<p><i><b>Sporting themselves</b></i> — Forming opinions which give license to sin, and then acting on those opinions; and thus rioting in their own deceits.</p>
<p><i><b>With their own deceivings</b></i> — εν ταις απαταις. But instead of this, AB, and almost all the versions and several of the fathers, have εν ταις αγαπαις, <i>in your love feasts</i>, which is probably the true reading.</p>
<p><i><b>While they feast with you</b></i> — It appears they held a kind of communion with the Church, and attended sacred festivals, which they desecrated with their own unhallowed opinions and conduct.</p>
