Verse 14. Having eyes full of adultery — μοιχαλιδος. Of an adulteress; being ever bent on the gratification of their sensual desires, so that they are represented as having an adulteress constantly before their eyes, and that their eyes can take in no other object but her. But instead of μοιχαλιδος of an adulteress, the Codex Alexandrinus, three others, with the Coptic, Vulgate, and one copy of the Itala, together with several of the fathers, have μοιχαλιας, of adultery.Cannot cease from sin — Which cease not from sin; they might cease from sin, but they do not; they love and practise it. Instead of ακαταπαυστους, which cannot cease, several MSS. and versions have ακαταπαυστου, and this requires the place to be read, Having eyes full of adultery and incessant sin. The images of sinful acts were continually floating before their disordered and impure fancy. This figure of speech is very common in the Greek writers; and Kypke gives many instances of it, which indeed carry the image too far to be here translated.Beguiling unstable souls — The metaphor is taken from adulterers seducing unwary, inexperienced, and light, trifling women; so do those false teachers seduce those who are not established in righteousness.Exercised with covetous practices — The metaphor is taken from the agonistae in the Grecian games, who exercised themselves in those feats, such as wrestling, boxing, running, c., in which they proposed to contend in the public games. These persons had their hearts schooled in nefarious practices they had exercised themselves till they were perfectly expert in all the arts of seduction, overreaching, and every kind of fraud.Cursed children — Such not only live under God's curse here, but they are heirs to it hereafter.
