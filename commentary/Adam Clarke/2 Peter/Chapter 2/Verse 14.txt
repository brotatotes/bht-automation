<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Having eyes full of adultery</b></i> — μοιχαλιδος. <i>Of an</i> <i>adulteress</i>; being ever bent on the gratification of their sensual desires, so that they are represented as having <i>an adulteress</i> <i>constantly before their eyes</i>, and that their eyes can take in no other object but <i>her</i>. But instead of μοιχαλιδος of an <i>adulteress,</i> the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, three others, with the <i>Coptic, Vulgate</i>, and one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, together with several of the <i>fathers</i>, have μοιχαλιας, <i>of adultery</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Cannot cease from sin</b></i> — <i>Which cease not from sin</i>; they might cease from sin, but they do not; they love and practise it. Instead of ακαταπαυστους, <i>which cannot cease</i>, several MSS. and versions have ακαταπαυστου, and this requires the place to be read, <i>Having eyes full of adultery and incessant sin</i>. The images of sinful acts were continually floating before their disordered and impure fancy. This figure of speech is very common in the Greek writers; and <i>Kypke</i> gives many instances of it, which indeed carry the image too far to be here translated.</p>
<p><i><b>Beguiling unstable souls</b></i> — The metaphor is taken from adulterers seducing unwary, inexperienced, and light, trifling women; so do those false teachers seduce those who are not established in righteousness.</p>
<p><i><b>Exercised with covetous practices</b></i> — The metaphor is taken from the <i>agonistae</i> in the Grecian games, who exercised themselves in those feats, such as <i>wrestling, boxing, running</i>, c., in which they proposed to contend in the public games. These persons had their hearts schooled in nefarious practices they had <i>exercised</i> <i>themselves</i> till they were perfectly <i>expert</i> in all the arts of seduction, overreaching, and every kind of fraud.</p>
<p><i><b>Cursed children</b></i> — Such not only live under God's curse here, but they are heirs to it hereafter.</p>
