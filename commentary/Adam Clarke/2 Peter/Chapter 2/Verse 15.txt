<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Which have forsaken the right way</b></i> — As Balaam did, who, although God showed him the right way, took one contrary to it, preferring the reward offered him by Balak to the approbation and blessing of God.</p>
<p><i><b>The way of Balaam</b></i> — Is the <i>counsel</i> of Balaam. He counselled the Moabites to give their most beautiful young women to the Israelitish youth, that they might be enticed by them to commit <i>idolatry</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:5">Numbers 22:5</span>, c., and <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+23:1">Numbers 23:1</span><i>"</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><b>The son </b><i><b>of Bosor</b></i> — Instead of βοσορ, BOSOR two ancient MSS. and some of the versions have βεωρ, <i>Beor</i>, to accommodate the word to the Hebrew text and the Septuagint. The difference in this name seems to have arisen from mistaking one letter for another in the Hebrew name, בעור <i>Beor</i>, for בצור <i>Betsor</i> or <i>Bosor</i> <i>tsaddi</i> צ and <i>ain</i> ע, which are very like each other, being interchanged.</p>
