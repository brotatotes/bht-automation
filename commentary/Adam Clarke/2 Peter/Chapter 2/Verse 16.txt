<p>Verse 16. <i><b>The dumb ass, speaking with man's voice</b></i> — <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:28">Numbers 22:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:28">Numbers 22:28</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The madness of the prophet.</b></i> — Is not this a reference to the speech of the ass, as represented in the Targums of Jonathan ben Uzziel and Jerusalem? "Wo to thee, Balaam, thou sinner, thou madman: there is no wisdom found in thee." These words contain nearly the same expressions as those in St. Peter.</p>
