Verse 16. The dumb ass, speaking with man's voice — Numbers 22:28; Numbers 22:28.The madness of the prophet. — Is not this a reference to the speech of the ass, as represented in the Targums of Jonathan ben Uzziel and Jerusalem? "Wo to thee, Balaam, thou sinner, thou madman: there is no wisdom found in thee." These words contain nearly the same expressions as those in St. Peter.
