<p>Verse 17. <i><b>These are wells without water</b></i> — Persons who, by their profession, should furnish <i>the water of life</i> to souls athirst for salvation; but they have not this water; they are <i>teachers</i> without <i>ability</i> to <i>instruct</i>; they are <i>sowers</i>, and have no <i>seed</i> in their basket. Nothing is more cheering in the deserts of the east than to meet with a <i>well of water</i>; and nothing more distressing, when parched with thirst, than to meet with a well that contains no water.</p>
<p><i><b>Clouds that are carried with a tempest</b></i> — In a time of great <i>drought</i>, to see <i>clouds</i> beginning to cover the face of the heavens raises the expectation of rain; but to see these <i>carried off</i> by a sudden <i>tempest</i> is a dreary disappointment. These false teachers were equally as unprofitable as the empty well, or the light, dissipated cloud.</p>
<p><i><b>To whom the mist of darkness is reserved</b></i> — That is, an eternal separation from the presence of God, and the glory of his power. They shall be thrust into <i>outer darkness</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:12">Matthew 8:12</span>; into the utmost degrees of misery and despair. False and corrupt teachers will be sent into the lowest hell; and be "the most downcast, underfoot vassals of perdition."</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to notice a various reading here, which, though very different in sound, is nearly the same in sense. Instead of νεφελαι, <i>clouds</i>, which is the common reading, καιομιχλαι, <i>and mists</i>, or perhaps more properly <i>thick darkness</i>, from ομου, <i>together</i>, and αχλυς, <i>darkness</i>, is the reading in ABC, sixteen others, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, later <i>Syriac, Coptic,</i> <i>AEthiopic</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>, and several of the <i>fathers</i>. This reading Griesbach has admitted into the text.</p>
