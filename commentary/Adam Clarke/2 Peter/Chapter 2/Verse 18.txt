<p>Verse 18. <i><b>They speak great swelling</b></i><b> words </b><i><b>of vanity</b></i> — The word υπερογκα signifies things of great magnitude, grand, superb, sublime; it sometimes signifies <i>inflated, tumid, bombastic</i>. These false teachers spoke of great and high things, and no doubt promised their disciples the greatest privileges, as they themselves pretended to a high degree of illumination; but they were all false and vain, though they tickled the fancy and excited the desires of the flesh; and indeed this appears to have been their object. And hence some think that the impure sect of the Nicolaitans is meant. See the <i>preface</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Those that were clean escaped</b></i> — Those who, through hearing the doctrines of the Gospel, had been converted, were perverted by those false teachers.</p>
