<p>Verse 19. <i><b>While they promise them liberty</b></i> — Either to live in the highest degrees of spiritual good, or a freedom from the Roman yoke; or from the yoke of the law, or what they might term needless restraints. Their own conduct showed the falsity of their system; for they were slaves to every disgraceful lust.</p>
<p><i><b>For of whom a man is overcome</b></i> — This is an allusion to the ancient custom of selling for slaves those whom they had conquered and captivated in war. The ancient law was, that a man might either kill him whom he overcame in battle, or <i>keep him</i> for a slave. These were called <i>servi</i>, slaves, from the verb <i>servare</i>, to <i>keep</i> or <i>preserve</i>. And they were also called <i>mancipia</i>, from <i>manu capiuntur</i>, they are taken captive by the hand of their enemy. Thus the person who is overcome by his lusts is represented as being the slave of those lusts.
