<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:2">2 Peter 2:2</span>. <i><b>Many shall follow</b></i> — WILL follow, because determined to gratify their sinful propensities.</p>
<p><i><b>Pernicious ways</b></i> — ταις απωλειαις. <i>Their destructions</i>; i.e. the <i>heresies of destruction</i>, or <i>destructive opinions</i>, mentioned above. But instead of απωλειαις, <i>destructions</i>, ασελγειαις, <i>lasciviousnesses</i> or <i>uncleannesses</i>, is the reading of ABC, and upwards of <i>sixty others</i>, most of which are among the most ancient, correct, and authentic. This is the reading also of both the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Slavonic,</i> <i>Vulgate, Chrysostom, Theophylact, OEcumenius</i>, and <i>Jerome</i>. A very few, and those of little repute, have the word in the text.</p>
<p>The word <i>lasciviousnesses</i> is undoubtedly the true reading, and this points out what the nature of the heresies was: it was a sort of Antinomianism; they pampered and indulged the lusts of the flesh; and, if the Nicolaitans are meant, it is very applicable to them, for they taught the community of wives, c. Griesbach has received this reading into the text.</p>
<p><i><b>By reason of whom</b></i> — These were persons who professed <i>Christianity</i> and because they were called Christians, and followed such abominable practices, the <i>way of truth</i>-the Christian religion, βλασφημηθησεται, was <i>blasphemed</i>. Had they called themselves by any name but that of <i>Christ</i>, his religion would not have suffered.</p>
