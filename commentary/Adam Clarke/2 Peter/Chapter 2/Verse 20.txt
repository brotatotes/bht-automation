<p>Verse 20. <i><b>The pollutions of the world</b></i> — <i>Sin</i> in general, and particularly superstition, idolatry, and lasciviousness. These are called μιασματα, <i>miasmata</i>, things that <i>infect, pollute</i>, and <i>defile</i>. The word was anciently used, and is in use at the present day, to express those noxious particles of effluvia proceeding from persons infected with contagious and dangerous diseases; or from dead and corrupt bodies, stagnant and putrid waters, marshes c., by which the sound and healthy may be infected and destroyed.</p>
<p>The world is here represented as one large, putrid marsh, or corrupt body, sending off its destructive <i>miasmata</i> everywhere and in every direction, so that none can escape its contagion, and none can be healed of the great epidemic disease of sin, but by the mighty power and skill of God. St. Augustine has improved on this image: "The whole world," says he, "is one great diseased man, lying extended from east to west, and from north to south and to heal this great sick man, the almighty Physician descended from heaven." Now, it is by the <i>knowledge</i> of <i>the Lord and Saviour</i> <i>Jesus Christ</i>, as says St. Peter, that we <i>escape</i> the destructive influence of these contagious <i>miasmata</i>. But if, <i>after having been</i> healed, and <i>escaped</i> the death to which we were exposed, we get <i>again entangled</i>, εμπλακεντες, <i>enfolded, enveloped</i> with them; then <i>the latter end will be worse than the beginning</i>: forasmuch as we shall have sinned against more light, and the soul, by its conversion to God, having had all its powers and faculties greatly improved, is now, being repolluted, more capable of iniquity than before, and can bear more expressively the image of the earthly.</p>
