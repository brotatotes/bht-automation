<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:3">2 Peter 2:3</span>. <i><b>And through covetousness</b></i> — That they might get money to spend upon their lusts, <i>with feigned words</i>, πλαστοις λογοις, with <i>counterfeit tales, false narrations</i>, of pretended facts, <i>lying miracles, fabulous legends</i>. "In this single sentence," says Dr. Macknight, "there is a clear prediction of the iniquitous practices of those great merchants of souls, the Romish clergy, who have rated all crimes, even the most atrocious, at a fixed price; so that if their doctrine be true, whoever pays the price may commit the crime without hazarding his salvation." How the popish Church has made merchandise of souls, needs no particular explanation here. It was this abominable doctrine that showed to some, then in that Church, the absolute necessity of a reformation.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose judgment now of a long time</b></i> — From the beginning God has condemned sin, and inflicted suitable punishments on transgressors; and has promised in his word, from the earliest ages, to pour out his indignation on the wicked. The punishment, therefore, <i>so long ago predicted</i>, shall fall on these impure and incorrigible sinners; and the <i>condemnation</i> which is denounced against them <i>slumbers not</i>-it is alert, it is on its way, it is hurrying on, and must soon overtake them.</p>
