<p>Verse 4. <i><b>For if God spared not the angels</b></i> — The angels were originally placed in a state of probation; some having fallen and some having stood proves this. How long that probation was to last to them, and what was the particular <i>test</i> of their fidelity, we know not; nor indeed do we know what was their <i>sin</i>; nor <i>when</i> nor <i>how</i> they fell. St. Jude says <i>they kept not their first</i> <i>estate, but left their own habitation</i>; which seems to indicate that they got <i>discontented</i> with their lot, and aspired to higher honours, or perhaps to celestial domination. The tradition of their fall is in all countries and in all religions, but the accounts given are various and contradictory; and no wonder, for we have no direct revelation on the subject. <i>They kept not their</i> <i>first estate</i>, and <i>they sinned</i>, is the sum of what we know on the subject; and here curiosity and conjecture are useless.</p>
<p><i>But cast</i> them <i>down to hell, and delivered</i> them <i>into chains of</i> <i>darkness</i>] Αλλα σειραις ζοφου ταρταρωσας παρεδωκεν εις κρισιν τετηρημενους· <i>But with chains of darkness confining them in</i> <i>Tartarus, delivered them over to be kept to judgment</i>; or, <i>sinking</i> <i>them into Tartarus, delivered them over into custody for</i> <i>punishment, to chains of darkness</i>. <i>Chains of darkness</i> is a highly poetic expression. Darkness binds them on all hands; and so dense and strong is this darkness that it cannot be broken through; they cannot deliver themselves, nor be delivered by others.</p>
<p>As the word <i>Tartarus</i> is found nowhere else in the <i>New</i> <i>Testament</i>, nor does it appear in the <i>Septuagint</i>, we must have recourse to the Greek writers for its meaning. Mr. <i>Parkhurst</i>, under the word ταρταροω, has made some good collections from those writers, which I here subjoin.</p>
<p>"The Scholiast on AESCHYLUS, <i>Eumen</i>., says: <i>Pindar</i> relates that <i>Apollo</i> overcame the <i>Python</i> by force; wherefore the earth endeavoured ταρταρωσαι, <i>to cast</i> him <i>into Tartarus</i>. <i>Tzetzes</i> uses the same word, ταρταροω, for <i>casting</i> or <i>sending into</i> <i>Tartarus</i>; and the compound verb καταταρταρουν, is found in <i>Apollodorus</i>; in <i>Didymus'</i> Scholia on <i>Homer</i>; in <i>Phurnutus</i>, De Nat, Deor., p. 11, edit. <i>Gale</i>; and in the book περι ποταμων, which is extant among the works of <i>Plutarch</i>. And those whom Apollodorus styles καταταρταρωθεντας, he in the same breath calls ριφθεντας εις ταρταρον, <i>cast into Tartarus</i>. Thus the learned <i>Windet</i>, in <i>Pole's</i> Synopsis. We may then, I think, safely assert that ταρταρωσας, in St. Peter, means not, as <i>Mede</i> (Works, fol., p. 23) interprets it, <i>to adjudge to</i>, but <i>to cast into, Tartarus</i>; ριπτειν εις ταρταρον, as in <i>Homer</i>, cited below. And in order to know what was the precise intention of the apostle by this expression, we must inquire what is the accurate import of the term ταρταρος. Now, it appears from a passage of <i>Lucian</i>, that by ταρταρος was meant, in a <i>physical</i> sense, <i>the bounds</i> or <i>verge</i> <i>of this material system</i>; for, addressing himself to ΕΡΩΣ, <i>Cupid</i> or <i>Love</i>, he says: Συ γαρ εξ αφανους και κεχυμενης αμορφιας ΤΟ ΠΑΝ εμορφωσας, κ. τ. λ. 'Thou formedst the <i>universe</i> from its confused and chaotic state; and, after separating and dispersing the circumfused chaos, in which, as in one common sepulchre, the <i>whole</i> <i>world</i> lay buried, thou drovest it to the confines or recesses of outer <i>Tartarus </i>- </p>
<p>By <i>chains of darkness</i> we are to understand a <i>place of darkness</i> and <i>wretchedness</i>, from which it is <i>impossible for them to escape</i>.</p>
