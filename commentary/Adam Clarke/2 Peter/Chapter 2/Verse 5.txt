<p>Verse 5. <i><b>Spared not the old world</b></i> — The apostle's argument is this: If God spared not the rebellious angels, nor the sinful antediluvians, nor the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha, he will not spare those wicked teachers who corrupt the pure doctrines of Christianity.</p>
<p><i><b>Saved Noah the eighth</b></i> — Some think that the words should be translated, <i>Noah the eighth preacher of righteousness</i>; but it seems most evident, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20">1 Peter 3:20</span>, that <i>eight persons</i> are here meant, which were the whole that were saved in the ark, <i>viz</i>. Shem, Ham, Japhet, and their three wives, six; Noah's wife seven; and Noah himself the <i>eighth</i>. The form of expression, ογδοον Νωε, <i>Noah the eighth</i>, i.e. Noah and <i>seven</i> more, is most common in the Greek language. So in APPIAN, <i>Bell</i>. Pun., p. 12, Τριτος δε ποτε εν σπηλαιῳ κρυπτομενος ελαθε, <i>sometimes he the third</i> (i.e. he with two others) <i>lay hid in a</i> <i>cave</i>. ANDOCIDES, Orat. iv. p. 295: Αἱρεθεις επι τουτῳ δεκατος αυτος, <i>he himself the tenth</i> (i.e. he and nine others) <i>were</i> <i>chosen to this</i>. See a number of other examples in <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>World of the ungodly</b></i> — A whole race <i>without God</i>-without any pure <i>worship</i> or rational religion.</p>
