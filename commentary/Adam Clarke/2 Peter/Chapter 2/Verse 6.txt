<p>Verse 6. <i><b>The cities of Sodom and Gomorrha</b></i> — See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:0">Genesis 19:0</span>, for an account of the sin and punishment of these cities.</p>
<p><i><b>Making</b></i><b> them </b><i><b>an ensample</b></i> — These three words, υποδειγμα παραδειγμα, and δειγμα, are used to express the same idea; though the former may signify an <i>example to be shunned</i>, the second an <i>example to be followed</i>, and the third a <i>simple exhibition</i>. But these differences are not always observed.</p>
