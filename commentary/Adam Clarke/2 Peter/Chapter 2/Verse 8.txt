<p>Verse 8. <i><b>That righteous man dwelling among them</b></i> — Lot, after his departure from Abraham, A. M. 2086, lived at Sodom till A. M. 2107, a space of about twenty years; and, as he had a <i>righteous</i> <i>soul</i>, he must have been <i>tormented</i> with the abominations of that people <i>from day to day</i>.</p>
<p>The word εβασανιζεν, <i>tormented</i>, is not less emphatic than the word καταπονουμενον, <i>grievously pained</i>, in the preceding verse, and shows what this man must have felt in dwelling so long among a people so abandoned.</p>
