<p>Verse 9. <i><b>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly</b></i> â€” The preservation and deliverance of Lot gave the apostle occasion to remark, that God knew as well to <i>save</i> as to <i>destroy</i>; and that his <i>goodness</i> led him as forcibly to save righteous Lot, as his <i>justice</i> did to destroy the rebellious in the instances already adduced. And the design of the apostle in producing these examples is to show to the people to whom he was writing that, although God would destroy those false teachers, yet he would powerfully save his faithful servants from their contagion and from their destruction. We should carefully observe, 1. That the godly man is not to be preserved <i>from</i> temptation. 2. That he will be preserved <i>in</i> temptation. 3. That he will be delivered <i>out</i> of it.</p>
