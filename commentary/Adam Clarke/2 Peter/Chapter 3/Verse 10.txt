<p>Verse 10. <i><b>The day of the Lord will come</b></i> — See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:43">Matthew 24:43</span>, to which the apostle seems to allude.</p>
<p><i><b>The heavens shall pass away with a great noise</b></i> — As the <i>heavens</i> mean here, and in the passages above, the whole <i>atmosphere</i>, in which all the terrestrial vapours are lodged; and as <i>water</i> itself is composed of two gases, eighty-five parts <i>in weight</i> of oxygen, and fifteen of hydrogen, or two parts <i>in volume</i> of the latter, and one of the former; (for if these quantities be put together, and several electric sparks passed through them, a chemical union takes place, and water is the product; and, <i>vice versa</i>, if the galvanic spark be made to pass through water, a portion of the fluid is immediately decomposed into its two constituent gases, oxygen and hydrogen;) and as the <i>electric</i> or <i>ethereal fire</i> is that which, in all likelihood, God will use in the general conflagration; the noise occasioned by the application of this fire to such an immense <i>congeries</i> of <i>aqueous</i> particles as float in the atmosphere, must be terrible in the extreme. Put a drop of water on an anvil, place over it a piece of iron red hot, strike the iron with a hammer on the part above the drop of water, and the report will be as loud as a musket; when, then, the whole strength of those opposite agents is brought together into a state of conflict, the <i>noise</i>, the <i>thunderings</i>, the <i>innumerable</i> <i>explosions</i>, (till every particle of water on the earth and in the atmosphere is, by the action of the fire, reduced into its component gaseous parts,) will be <i>frequent, loud, confounding</i>, and <i>terrific</i>, beyond every comprehension but that of God himself.</p>
<p><i><b>The elements shalt melt with fervent heat</b></i> — When the <i>fire</i> has conquered and decomposed the <i>water</i>, the elements, στοιχεια, the <i>hydrogen</i> and <i>oxygen</i> airs or gases, (the former of which is most highly inflammable, and the latter an eminent supporter of all combustion,) will occupy <i>distinct</i> regions of the atmosphere, the hydrogen by its very great levity ascending to the top, while the oxygen from its superior specific gravity will keep <i>upon</i> or <i>near</i> the surface of the earth; and thus, if different substances be once ignited, the fire, which is supported in this case, not only by the oxygen which is one of the constituents of atmospheric air, but also by a great additional quantity of oxygen obtained from the decomposition of all aqueous vapours, will rapidly seize on all other substances, on all terrestrial particles, and the whole frame of nature will be necessarily torn in pieces, and <i>thus the</i> <i>earth and its works be burned up</i>.</p>
