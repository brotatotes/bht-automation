<p>Verse 11. <i><b>All these things shall be dissolved</b></i> — They will all be <i>separated</i>, all <i>decomposed</i>; but none of them <i>destroyed</i>. And as they are the original matter out of which God formed the terraqueous globe, consequently they may enter again into the <i>composition</i> of a <i>new system</i>; and therefore the apostle says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:13">2 Peter 3:13</span>: <i>we look for new heavens and a new earth</i>-the others being <i>decomposed</i>, a new system is to be formed out of their materials. There is a wonderful philosophic propriety in the words of the apostle in describing this most awful event.</p>
<p><i><b>What manner</b></i><b> of persons </b><i><b>ought ye to be</b></i> — Some put the note of interrogation at the end of this clause, and join the remaining part with the 12th verse, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:12">2 Peter 3:12</span> thus: <i>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner</i> <i>of persons ought ye to be? By holy conversation and godliness,</i> <i>expecting and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God</i>, c. Only those who walk in holiness, who live a godly and useful life, can contemplate this most awful time with joy.</p>
<p>The word σπευδοντας, which we translate <i>hasting unto</i>, should be tendered <i>earnestly desiring</i>, or <i>wishing for</i> which is a frequent meaning of the word in the best Greek writers.</p>
