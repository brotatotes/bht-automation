<p><i>Minucius Felix</i> tells us, xxxiv. 2, that it was a common opinion of the Stoics that, the moisture of the earth being consumed, the whole world would catch fire. The <i>Epicureans</i> held the same sentiment; and indeed it appears in various authors, which proves that a tradition of this kind has pretty generally prevailed in the world. But it is remarkable that none have fancied that it will be destroyed by <i>water</i>. The tradition, founded on the declaration of God, was against this; therefore it was not received.</p>
