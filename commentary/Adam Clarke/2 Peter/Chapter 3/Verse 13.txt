<p>Verse 13. <i><b>We, according to his promise, look for new heavens</b></i> â€” The promise to which it is supposed the apostle alludes, is found <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span>: <i>Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall</i> <i>not be remembered, nor come into mind</i>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:22">Isaiah 66:22</span>: <i>For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall</i> <i>remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed</i>, c. Now, although these may be interpreted of the <i>glory of the Gospel</i> <i>dispensation</i>, yet, if St. Peter refer to them, they must have a more <i>extended</i> meaning.</p>
<p>It does appear, from these promises, that the apostle says here, and what is said <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:27">Revelation 21:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:14-15">Revelation 22:14-15</span>, that the present earth, though destined to be burned up, will not be <i>destroyed</i>, but be <i>renewed</i> and <i>refined, purged</i> from all <i>moral</i> and <i>natural imperfection</i>, and made the endless abode of blessed spirits. But this state is certainly to be expected <i>after the day</i> <i>of judgment</i>; for on this the apostle is very express, who says the conflagration and renovation are to take place at <i>the judgment of</i> <i>the great day</i>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:7-8">2 Peter 3:7-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:12">2 Peter 3:12</span>. That such an event <i>may</i> take place is very <i>possible</i>; and, from the terms used by St. Peter, is very <i>probable</i>. And, indeed, it is more <i>reasonable</i> and <i>philosophical</i> to conclude that the earth shall be <i>refined</i> and <i>restored</i>, than finally <i>destroyed</i>. But this has nothing to do with what some call the <i>millennium state</i>; as this shall take place when <i>time</i>, with the present state and order of things, shall be no more.</p>
