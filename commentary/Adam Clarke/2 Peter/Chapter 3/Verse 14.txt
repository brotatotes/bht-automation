Verse 14. Seeing that ye look for such things â€” As ye profess that such a state of things shall take place, and have the expectation of enjoying the blessedness of it, be diligent in the use of every means and influence of grace, that ye may be found of him-the Lord Jesus, the Judge of quick and dead, without spot-any contagion of sin in your souls, and blameless-being not only holy and innocent, but useful in your lives.
