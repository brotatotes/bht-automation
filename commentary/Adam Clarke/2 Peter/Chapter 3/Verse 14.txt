<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Seeing that ye look for such things</b></i> â€” As ye profess that such a state of things shall take place, and have the expectation of enjoying the blessedness of it, <i>be diligent</i> in the use of every means and influence of grace, <i>that ye may be found of</i> <i>him</i>-the Lord Jesus, the Judge of quick and dead, <i>without spot</i>-any contagion of sin in your souls, <i>and blameless</i>-being not only <i>holy</i> and <i>innocent</i>, but <i>useful</i> in your <i>lives</i>.</p>
