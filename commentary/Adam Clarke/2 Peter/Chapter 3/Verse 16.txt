<p><i><b>In which are some things hard to be understood</b></i> — δυσνοητα τινα. That is, if we retain the common reading ενοις, <i>in</i> or <i>among which</i> <i>things</i>, viz., what he says of the day of judgment, the resurrection of the body c., c., there are some things difficult to be comprehended, and from which a wrong or false meaning may be taken. But if we take the reading of AB, twelve others, with both the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, and <i>Theophylact</i>, εναις, the meaning is more general, as εναις must refer to επιστολαις, <i>epistles</i>, for this would intimate that there were difficulties in all the epistles of St. Paul and indeed in what ancient writings are there not difficulties? But the papists say that the decision of all matters relative to the faith is not to be expected from the Scriptures on this very account, but must be received from the Church <i>i.e.</i> the Popish or Romish Church. But what evidence have we that that Church can infallibly solve any of those difficulties? We have none! And till we have an express, unequivocal revelation from heaven that an unerring spirit is given to that Church, I say, for example, to the present Church of Rome, with the pope called <i>Pius VII</i>. at its head, we are not to receive its pretensions. Any Church may pretend the same, or any number of equally learned men as there are of <i>cardinals</i> and <i>pope</i> in the conclave; and, after all, it would be but the opinion of so many men, to which no absolute certainty or infallibility could be attached.</p>
<p>This verse is also made a pretext to deprive the common people of reading the word of God; because the <i>unlearned</i> and <i>unstable</i> have sometimes <i>wrested this word to their own destruction</i>: but if it be human learning, and stability in any system of doctrine, that qualifies men to judge of these difficult things, then we can find many thousands, even in Europe, that have as much learning and stability as the whole college of cardinals, and perhaps ten thousand times more; for that conclave was never very reputable for the learning of its members: and to other learned bodies we may, with as much propriety, look up as infallible guides, as to this <i>conclave</i>.</p>
<p>Besides, as it is only the <i>unlearned</i> and the <i>unestablished</i> (that is, young Christian converts) that are in danger of wresting such portions; the <i>learned</i>, that is, the <i>experienced</i> and the <i>established</i> in the knowledge and life of God, are in no such danger; and to such we may safely go for information: and these abound everywhere, especially in <i>Protestant</i> countries; and by the labours of learned and pious men on the sacred writings there is not one difficulty relative to the things which concern our salvation left unexplained. If the members of the Romish Church have not these advantages, let them go to those who have them; and if their teachers are afraid to trust them to the instruction of the Protestants, then let them who pretend to have <i>infallibly</i> written their exposition of these <i>difficult</i> places, also put them, with a wholesome text in the vulgar language, into the hands of their people, and then the appeal will not lie to <i>Rome</i>, but to the <i>Bible</i>, and those interpretations will be considered according to their worth, being weighed with other scriptures, and the expositions of equally learned and equally <i>infallible</i> men.</p>
<p>We find, lastly, that those who wrest such portions, are those who wrest the <i>other scriptures</i> to their destruction; therefore they are no patterns, nor can such form any precedent for withholding the Scriptures from the common people, most of whom, instead of wresting them to their <i>destruction</i>, would become <i>wise</i> <i>unto salvation</i> by reading them. We may defy the Romish Church to adduce a single instance of any soul that was perverted, destroyed, or damned, by reading of the Bible; and the insinuation that they may is blasphemous. I may just add that the verb στρεβλοω, which the apostle uses here, signifies to <i>distort</i>, to <i>put to the rack</i>, to <i>torture</i>, to <i>overstretch</i> and <i>dislocate the</i> <i>limbs</i>; and hence the persons here intended are those who proceed according to no fair plan of interpretation, but <i>force unnatural</i> and <i>sophistical meanings</i> on the word of God: a practice which the common simple Christian is in no danger of following. I could illustrate this by a multitude of interpretations from popish writers.</p>
