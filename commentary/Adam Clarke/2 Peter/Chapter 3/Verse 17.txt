<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Seeing ye know - before</b></i> — Seeing that by prophets and apostles you have been thus forewarned, <i>beware</i>, φυλασσεσθε, <i>keep</i> <i>watch</i>, be on <i>your guard</i>; cleave to God and the word of his grace, <i>lest ye be led away</i> from the truth delivered by the prophets and apostles, <i>by the error of the wicked</i>, αθεσμων, <i>of the lawless</i>- those who wrest the Scriptures to make them countenance their lusts, exorbitant exactions, and lawless practices.</p>
<p><i><b>Fall from your own steadfastness.</b></i> — From that faith in Christ which has put you in possession of that <i>grace</i> which <i>establishes</i> <i>the heart</i>.</p>
