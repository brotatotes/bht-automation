<p>Verse 5. <i><b>For this they willingly are ignorant of</b></i> — They shut their eyes against the light, and refuse all evidence; what does not answer their purpose <i>they will not know</i>. And the apostle refers to a <i>fact</i> that militates against their hypothesis, with which they refused to acquaint themselves; and their ignorance he attributes to their unwillingness to learn the true state of the case.</p>
<p><i><b>By the word of God the heavens were of old</b></i> — I shall set down the Greek text of this extremely difficult clause: ουπανοιησαν Ουρανοι ησαν εκπαλαι, και γη εξ ὑδατος και δι' ὑδατος συνεστωσα, τῳ του Θεου λογῳ· translated thus by Mr. <i>Wakefield</i>: "A heaven and an earth formed out of water, and by means of water, by the appointment of God, had continued from old time." By Dr. <i>Macknight</i> thus; "The heavens were anciently, and the earth of water: and through water the earth consists by the word of God." By <i>Kypke</i> thus: "The heavens were of old, and the earth, which is framed, by the word of God, from the waters, and between the waters." However we take the words, they seem to refer to the origin of the earth. It was the opinion of the remotest antiquity that the earth was formed out of <i>water</i>, or a primitive moisture which they termed υλη, <i>hule,</i> a <i>first matter</i> or <i>nutriment</i> for all things; but <i>Thales</i> pointedly taught αρχην δε των παντως ὑδωρ ειναι, <i>that all things derive</i> <i>their existence from water</i>, and this very nearly expresses the sentiment of Peter, and nearly in his own terms too. But is this doctrine true? It must be owned that it appears to be the doctrine of Moses: <i>In the beginning</i>, says he, <i>God made the heavens</i> <i>and the earth; and the earth was without form and void; and</i> <i>darkness was upon the face of the deep</i>. Now, these <i>heavens</i> and <i>earth</i> which God made in the beginning, and which he says were at first <i>formless</i> and <i>empty</i>, and which he calls the <i>deep</i>, are in the very next verse called <i>waters</i>; from which it is evident that Moses teaches that the earth was made out of some <i>fluid substance</i>, to which the name of <i>water</i> is properly given. And that the earth was at first in a <i>fluid</i> mass is most evident from its <i>form</i>; it is not <i>round</i>, as has been demonstrated by measuring some <i>degrees</i> near the north <i>pole</i>, and under the <i>equator</i>; the result of which proved that the figure of the earth was that of an <i>oblate spheroid</i>, a figure nearly resembling that of an <i>orange</i>. And this is the form that any <i>soft</i> or elastic body would assume if whirled rapidly round a centre, as the earth is around its axis. The measurement to which I have referred shows the earth to be <i>flatted</i> at the <i>poles</i>, and <i>raised</i> at the <i>equator</i>. And by this measurement it was demonstrated that the diameter of the earth at the <i>equator</i> was <i>greater</i> by about twenty-five miles than at the <i>poles</i>.</p>
<p>Now, considering the earth to be thus formed εξυδατος, <i>of</i> <i>water</i>, we have next to consider what the apostle means by δι υδατος, variously translated by <i>out of, by means of</i>, and <i>between</i>, <i>the water</i>.</p>
<p><i>Standing out of the water</i> gives no sense, and should be abandoned. If we translate <i>between the waters</i>, it will bear some resemblance to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:6-7">Genesis 1:6-7</span>: <i>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of</i>, <i>bethoch</i>, between, <i>the waters; and let it divide the waters from</i> <i>the waters: and God divided the waters which were under the</i> <i>firmament from the waters which were above the firmament</i>; then it may refer to the whole of the <i>atmosphere</i>, with which the earth is everywhere surrounded, and which contains all the <i>vapours</i> which belong to our globe, and without which we could neither have animal nor vegetative life. Thus then the <i>earth</i>, or <i>terraqueous</i> <i>globe</i>, which was originally formed <i>out of water</i>, subsists <i>by</i> <i>water</i>; and by <i>means</i> of that very <i>water</i>, the water compacted with the earth-the <i>fountains of the great deep</i>, and the waters in the atmosphere-<i>the windows of heaven</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+7:11">Genesis 7:11</span>, the antediluvian earth was <i>destroyed</i>, as St. Peter states in the next verse: the terraqueous globe, which was formed originally of water or a fluid substance, the <i>chaos</i> or <i>first matter</i>, and which was suspended in the <i>heavens</i>-the atmosphere, enveloped with water, by means of which water it was preserved; yet, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants, was destroyed by those very same waters out of which it was originally made, and by which it subsisted.</p>
