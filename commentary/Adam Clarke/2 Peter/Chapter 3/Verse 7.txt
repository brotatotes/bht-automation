<p>Verse 7. <i><b>But the heavens and the earth, which are now</b></i> — The present earth and its atmosphere, which are liable to the same destruction, because the same <i>means</i> still exist, (for there is still <i>water</i> enough to drown the earth, and there is <i>iniquity</i> enough to induce God to destroy it and its inhabitants,) are nevertheless <i>kept in store</i>, τεθησαυρισμενοι, <i>treasured up</i>, kept in God's storehouse, to be destroyed, not by <i>water</i>, but by <i>fire</i> at the day of judgment.</p>
<p>From all this it appears that those <i>mockers</i> affected to be ignorant of the <i>Mosaic account</i> of the formation of the earth, and of its destruction by the waters of the deluge; and indeed this is implied in their stating that <i>all things continued as they were</i> <i>from the creation</i>. But St. Peter calls them back to the Mosaic account, to prove that this was false; for the earth, c., which were then formed, had perished by the <i>flood</i> and that the present earth, &amp;c., which were formed out of the preceding, should, at the day of judgment, perish by the <i>fire</i> of God's wrath.</p>
