<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Be not ignorant</b></i> — Though <i>they</i> are wilfully ignorant, neglect not <i>ye</i> the means of instruction.</p>
<p><i><b>One day</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>with the Lord as a thousand years</b></i> — That is: All time is as nothing before him, because in the <i>presence</i> as in the <i>nature</i> of God all is <i>eternity</i>; therefore nothing is <i>long</i>, nothing <i>short</i>, before him; no <i>lapse</i> of ages impairs his purposes, nor need he <i>wait</i> to find convenience to execute those purposes. And when the <i>longest period</i> of time has passed by, it is but as a <i>moment</i> or indivisible <i>point</i> in comparison of <i>eternity</i>. This thought is well expressed by PLUTARCH, <i>Consol. ad Apoll</i>.: "If we compare the time of life with eternity, we shall find no difference between <i>long</i> and <i>short</i>. Τα γαρ χιλια, και τα μυρια ετη, στιγμη τις εστιν αοριστος, μαλλον δε μοριον τι βραχυτατον στιγμης· for a <i>thousand</i> or <i>ten thousand years</i> are but a certain <i>indefinite point</i>, or rather the <i>smallest part of a point</i>." The words of the apostle seem to be a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+90:4">Psalms 90:4</span>.</p>
