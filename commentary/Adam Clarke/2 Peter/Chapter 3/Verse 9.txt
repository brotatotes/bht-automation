<p>Verse 9. <i><b>The Lord is not slack</b></i> — They probably in their <i>mocking</i> said, "Either God had made no such promise to judge the world, destroy the earth, and send ungodly men to perdition; or if he had, he had forgotten to fulfil it, or had not convenient time or leisure." To some such <i>mocking</i> the apostle seems to refer: and he immediately shows the reason why deserved punishment is not inflicted on a guilty world.</p>
<p><i><b>But is long-suffering</b></i> — It is not <i>slackness, remissness</i>, nor want of due <i>displacence</i> at sin, that induced God to prolong the respite of ungodly men; but his long-suffering, his <i>unwillingness</i> that any should perish: and therefore he spared them, that they might have additional offers of grace, and <i>be led to repentance</i>-to deplore their sins, implore God's mercy, and find redemption through the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p>As God is <i>not willing that any should perish</i>, and as he is <i>willing that all should come to repentance</i>, consequently he has never devised nor decreed the damnation of any man, nor has he rendered it impossible for any soul to be saved, either by <i>necessitating</i> him to do evil, that he might die for it, or <i>refusing him</i> the <i>means</i> of recovery, without which he could not be saved.</p>
