Verse 11. We pray - that our God would count you worthy — It is our earnest prayer that God would make you worthy, αξιωση, afford those continual supplies of grace by his Holy Spirit, without which you cannot adorn your holy vocation; you are called into the Christian Church, and, to be proper members of this Church, you must be members of the mystical body of Christ; and this implies that you should be holy, as he who has called you is holy.Fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness —1. The goodness of God-his own innate eternal kindness, has led him to call you into this state of salvation.2. It is the pleasure of that goodness to save you unto eternal life.3. It is the good pleasure; nothing can please God more than your receiving and retaining his utmost salvation.4. It is all the good pleasure of his goodness thus to save you; this he has amply proved by sending his Son to die for you, beyond which gift he has none greater. In this, all the good pleasure of his goodness is astonishingly manifested.5. And if you be faithful to his grace, he will fulfil-completely accomplish, all the good pleasure of his goodness in you; which goodness is to be apprehended and is to work by faith, the power of which must come from him, though the act or exercise of that power must be of yourselves; but the very power to believe affords excitement to the exercise of faith.
