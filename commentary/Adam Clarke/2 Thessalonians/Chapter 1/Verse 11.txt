<p>Verse 11. <i><b>We pray - that our God would count you worthy</b></i> — It is our earnest prayer that God would <i>make you worthy</i>, αξιωση, afford those continual supplies of grace by his Holy Spirit, without which you cannot adorn your holy vocation; you are called into the Christian Church, and, to be proper members of this Church, you must be members of the mystical <i>body</i> of Christ; and this implies that you should be holy, as he who has called you is holy.</p>
<p><i><b>Fulfil all the good pleasure of</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>goodness</b></i> —</p>
<p>1. The <i>goodness</i> of God-his own innate eternal kindness, has led him to call you into this state of salvation.</p>
<p>2. It is the <i>pleasure</i> of that goodness to save you unto eternal life.</p>
<p>3. It is the <i>good</i> <i>pleasure</i>; nothing can please God more than your receiving and retaining his utmost salvation.</p>
<p>4. It is <i>all</i> the good pleasure of his goodness thus to save you; this he has amply proved by sending his Son to die for you, <i>beyond</i> which gift he has none greater. In this, all the good pleasure of his goodness is astonishingly manifested.</p>
<p>5. And if you be faithful to his grace, he will <i>fulfil</i>-completely accomplish, all the good pleasure of his goodness in you; which goodness is to be apprehended and is to work by <i>faith</i>, the <i>power</i> of which must come from him, though the <i>act</i> or exercise of that power must be of yourselves; but the very <i>power</i> to believe affords <i>excitement</i> to the exercise of faith.</p>
