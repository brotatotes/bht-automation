<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:3">2 Thessalonians 1:3</span>. <i><b>Your faith groweth exceedingly</b></i> — The word υπεραυξανει signifies <i>to grow luxuriantly</i>, as a good and healthy tree planted in a good soil; and if a <i>fruit tree</i>, bearing an abundance of fruit to compensate the labour of the husbandman. Faith is one of the <i>seeds</i> of the kingdom; this the apostle had <i>sowed</i> and <i>watered</i>, and God gave an abundant increase. Their faith was <i>multiplied</i>, and their love <i>abounded</i>; and this was not the case with some distinguished characters only, it was the case with <i>every one of</i> <i>them</i>.</p>
