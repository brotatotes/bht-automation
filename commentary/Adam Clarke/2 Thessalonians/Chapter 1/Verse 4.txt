Verse 4. We ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God — We hold you up as an example of what the grace of God, can produce when communicated to honest and faithful hearts.For your patience and faith — From Acts 17:5; Acts 17:13, and from 1 Thessalonians 2:14, we learn, that the people of Thessalonica had suffered much persecution, both from the Jews and their own countrymen; but being thoroughly convinced of the truth of the Gospel, and feeling it to be the power of God unto salvation, no persecution could turn them aside from it. And having suffered for the truth, it was precious to them. Persecution never essentially injured the genuine Church of God.
