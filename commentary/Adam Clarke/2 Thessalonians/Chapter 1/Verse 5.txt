<p>Verse 5. <i><b>A manifest token of the righteousness judgement of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>God</b></i> — The persecutions and tribulations which you endure, are a manifest proof that God has judged righteously in calling you Gentiles into his Church; and these sufferings are also a proof that ye are <i>called in</i>; for they who enter into the kingdom of God go through great tribulation; your going through that tribulation is a proof that ye are entering in, and God sees it <i>right</i> and <i>just</i> that ye should be permitted to <i>suffer</i> before ye enjoy that endless felicity.</p>
<p>The words, however, may be understood in another sense, and will form this maxim: "The sufferings of the just, and the triumphs of the wicked, in this life, are a sure proof that there will be a future judgment, in which the wicked shall be punished and the righteous rewarded. "This maxim is not only true in itself, but it is most likely that this is the apostle's meaning.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye may be counted worthy</b></i> — Your patient endurance of these sufferings is a proof that ye are <i>rendered meet</i> for that glory on account of which ye suffer and, in a true Gospel sense of the word, <i>worthy</i> of that glory; for he who is <i>a child of God</i>, and a <i>partaker of the Divine nature</i>, is worthy of God's kingdom, not because he has done any thing to merit it, but because he bears the <i>image of God</i>; and the <i>image</i> is that which gives the <i>title</i>.</p>
