<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Seeing</b></i><b> it is </b><i><b>a righteous thing</b></i> â€” Though God neither rewards nor punishes in this life in a general way, yet he often gives proofs of his displeasure, especially against those who persecute his followers. They, therefore, who have given you tribulation, shall have tribulation in recompense.</p>
