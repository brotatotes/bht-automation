<p>Verse 7. <i><b>And to you who are troubled, rest with us</b></i> — And while they have <i>tribulation</i>, you shall have that eternal <i>rest</i> which remains for the people of God.</p>
<p><i><b>When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed</b></i> — But this fulness of <i>tribulation</i> to them, and <i>rest</i> to you, shall not take place till the Lord Jesus come to judge the world.</p>
<p><i><b>With his mighty angels</b></i> — The coming of God to judge the world is scarcely ever spoken of in the sacred writings without mentioning the holy angels, who are to accompany him, and to form his court or retinue.
