Verse 7. And to you who are troubled, rest with us — And while they have tribulation, you shall have that eternal rest which remains for the people of God.When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed — But this fulness of tribulation to them, and rest to you, shall not take place till the Lord Jesus come to judge the world.With his mighty angels — The coming of God to judge the world is scarcely ever spoken of in the sacred writings without mentioning the holy angels, who are to accompany him, and to form his court or retinue. See Deuteronomy 33:2; Matthew 25:31; Matthew 16:27; Matthew 26:64; Mark 8:38.
