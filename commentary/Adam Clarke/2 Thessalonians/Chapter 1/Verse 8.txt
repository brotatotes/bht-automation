<p>Verse 8. <i><b>In flaming fire</b></i> — εν φλογι πυρος. In <i>thunder and</i> <i>lightning, taking vengeance</i>-inflicting just punishment <i>on them</i> <i>that know not God</i>-the heathen who do not worship the true God, and will not <i>acknowledge</i> him, but worship idols; and on them <i>that obey</i> <i>not the Gospel</i>-the <i>Jews</i>, particularly who have rejected the Gospel, and persecuted Christ and his messengers; and all nominal Christians who, though they believe the Gospel as a revelation from God, yet do not <i>obey</i> it as a rule of life.</p>
