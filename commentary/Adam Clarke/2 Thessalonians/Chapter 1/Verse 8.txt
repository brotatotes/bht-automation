Verse 8. In flaming fire — εν φλογι πυρος. In thunder and lightning, taking vengeance-inflicting just punishment on them that know not God-the heathen who do not worship the true God, and will not acknowledge him, but worship idols; and on them that obey not the Gospel-the Jews, particularly who have rejected the Gospel, and persecuted Christ and his messengers; and all nominal Christians who, though they believe the Gospel as a revelation from God, yet do not obey it as a rule of life.
