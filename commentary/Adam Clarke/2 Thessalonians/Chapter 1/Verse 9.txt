<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Who shall be punished</b></i> — What this <i>everlasting</i> <i>destruction</i> consists in we cannot tell. It is not <i>annihilation</i>, for their <i>being</i> continues; and as the destruction is <i>everlasting</i>, it is an eternal <i>continuance</i> and <i>presence</i> of <i>substantial evil</i>, and <i>absence of all good</i>; for a part of this punishment consists in being banished from the <i>presence of the Lord</i>-excluded from his <i>approbation</i>, for ever; so that the light of his countenance can be no more enjoyed, as there will be an eternal impossibility of ever being reconciled to him.</p>
<p><i><b>The glory of his power</b></i> — Never to see the face of God throughout eternity is a heart-rending, soul-appalling thought; and to be <i>banished</i> from the <i>glory of his power</i>, that power the <i>glory</i> of which is peculiarly manifested in <i>saving the lost</i> and <i>glorifying the faithful</i>, is what cannot be reflected on without confusion and dismay. But this must be the lot of all <i>who</i> <i>acknowledge not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i>.</p>
