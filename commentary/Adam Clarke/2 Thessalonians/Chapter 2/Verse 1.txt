<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span>. <i><b>We beseech you - by the coming of our Lord</b></i> â€” It is evident that the Thessalonians, incited by deceived or false teachers, had taken a wrong meaning out of the words of the first epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>, c., concerning the <i>day of judgment</i> and were led then to conclude that that day was <i>at hand</i>; and this had produced great confusion in the Church: to correct this mistake, the apostle sent them this second letter, in which he shows that this day must be necessarily <i>distant</i>, because a great work is to be done previously to its appearing.</p>
<p>Of the day of general judgment he had spoken before, and said that it should <i>come as a thief in the night</i>, i.e. when not expected; but he did not attempt to fix the time, nor did he insinuate that it was either <i>near at hand</i>, or <i>far off</i>. Now, however, he shows that it must necessarily be far off, because of the great transactions which must take place before it can come.</p>
