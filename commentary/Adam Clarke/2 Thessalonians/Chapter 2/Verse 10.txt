<p>Verse 10. <i><b>And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness</b></i> — With every art that cunning can invent and unrighteousness suggest, in order to delude and deceive.</p>
<p><i><b>In them that perish</b></i> — Εν τοις απολλυμενοις· <i>Among them that</i> <i>are destroyed</i>; and they are destroyed and perish because they <i>would not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved</i>. So they perish because they obstinately refuse to be saved, and receive a <i>lie</i> in preference to the <i>truth</i>. This has been true of all the Jews from the days of the apostle until now.</p>
