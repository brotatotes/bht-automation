Verse 10. And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness — With every art that cunning can invent and unrighteousness suggest, in order to delude and deceive.In them that perish — Εν τοις απολλυμενοις· Among them that are destroyed; and they are destroyed and perish because they would not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. So they perish because they obstinately refuse to be saved, and receive a lie in preference to the truth. This has been true of all the Jews from the days of the apostle until now.
