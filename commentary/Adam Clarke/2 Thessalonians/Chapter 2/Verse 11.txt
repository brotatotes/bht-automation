<p>Verse 11. <i><b>God shall send them strong delusion</b></i> â€” For this very cause, that they <i>would not receive the love of the truth</i>, but <i>had</i> <i>pleasure in unrighteousness</i>, therefore God permits <i>strong delusion</i> to occupy their minds; so that they believe a <i>lie</i> rather than the truth, prefer false apostles and their erroneous doctrines to the pure truths of the Gospel, brought to them by the well-accredited messengers of God; being ever ready to receive any false Messiah, while they systematically and virulently reject the true one.</p>
