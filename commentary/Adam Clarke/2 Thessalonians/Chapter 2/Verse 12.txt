<p>Verse 12. <i><b>That they all might be damned</b></i> — Ἱνα κριθωσι· <i>So</i> <i>that they may all be condemned who believed not the truth</i> when it was proclaimed to them; <i>but took pleasure in unrighteousness</i>, preferring that to the way of holiness. Their condemnation was the effect of their refusal to believe the truth; and they refused to believe it because they loved their sins. For a farther and more pointed illustration of the preceding verses, see the conclusion of this chapter. <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:17">2 Thessalonians 2:17</span><i>"</i></p>
