<p>Verse 13. 14. <i><b>God hath from the beginning chosen you to</b></i> <i>salvation</i>, &amp;c.] In your <i>calling</i>, God has shown the <i>purpose</i> that he had formed from the <i>beginning</i>, to call the Gentiles to the same privileges with the Jews, not through <i>circumcision</i>, and the observance of the Mosaic law, but by <i>faith</i> in Christ Jesus but this simple way of salvation referred to the same <i>end</i>-holiness, without which no man, whether Jew or Gentile, can see the Lord.</p>
<p>Let us observe the order of Divine grace in this business:</p>
<p>1. They were to hear the <i>truth</i>-the doctrines of the Gospel.</p>
<p>2. They were to <i>believe</i> this <i>truth</i> when they heard it preached.</p>
<p>3. They were to receive the <i>Spirit</i> of God in believing the truth.</p>
<p>4. That Spirit was to <i>sanctify</i> their souls-produce an inward holiness, which was to lead to all outward conformity to God.</p>
<p>5. All this constituted their <i>salvation</i>-their being fitted for the inheritance among the saints in light.</p>
<p>6. They were to <i>obtain the glory of</i> <i>our Lord Jesus Christ</i>-that state of felicity for which they were fitted, by being saved here from their sins, and by being sanctified by the Spirit of God.</p>
