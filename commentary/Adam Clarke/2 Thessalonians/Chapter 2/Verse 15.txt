<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Therefore, brethren, stand fast</b></i> — Their obtaining eternal glory depended on their <i>faithfulness</i> to the grace of God; for this <i>calling</i> did not necessarily and irresistibly lead to faith; nor their faith to the sanctification of the spirit; nor their sanctification of the spirit to the <i>glory</i> of our Lord Jesus. Had they not <i>attended</i> to the <i>calling</i>, they could not have <i>believed</i>; had they not <i>believed</i>, they could not have been <i>sanctified</i>; had they not been <i>sanctified</i> they could not have been <i>glorified</i>. All these things depended on each other; they were <i>stages</i> of the great journey; and at any of these stages they might have halted, and never finished their Christian race.</p>
<p><i><b>Hold the traditions which ye have been taught</b></i> — The word παραδοσις, which we render <i>tradition</i>, signifies any thing <i>delivered</i> in the way of <i>teaching</i>; and here most obviously means the <i>doctrines</i> delivered by the apostle to the Thessalonians; whether in his <i>preaching, private conversation</i>, or by these <i>epistles</i>; and particularly the <i>first epistle</i>, as the apostle here states. Whatever these traditions were, as to their matter, they were a <i>revelation from God</i>; for they came by men who <i>spake</i> and <i>acted</i> under the <i>inspiration of the Holy Spirit</i>; and on this ground the passage here can never with any propriety be brought to support the unapostolical and anti-apostolical traditions of the Romish Church; those being matters which are, confessedly, not taken from either Testament, nor were spoken either by a <i>prophet</i> or an <i>apostle</i>.</p>
