<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Now our Lord Jesus</b></i> — As all your <i>grace</i> came from God through Christ, so the <i>power</i> that is necessary to strengthen and confirm you unto the end must come in the same way.</p>
<p><i><b>Everlasting consolation</b></i> — Παρακλησιν αιωνιαν· The <i>glad tidings</i> of the Gospel, and the <i>comfort</i> which ye have received through believing; a gift which God had in his <i>original</i> purpose, in reference to the Gentiles; a purpose which has respected <i>all times</i> and <i>places</i>, and which shall continue to the <i>conclusion</i> of time; for the Gospel is <i>everlasting</i>, and shall not be superseded by any other dispensation. It is the <i>last</i> and <i>best</i> which God has provided for man; and it is <i>good tidings, everlasting</i> <i>consolation</i>-a complete system of complete peace and happiness. The words may also refer to the happiness which the believing Thessalonians then possessed.</p>
<p><i><b>And good hope through grace</b></i> — The <i>hope</i> of the Gospel was the <i>resurrection of the body</i>, and the final <i>glorification</i> of it and the soul throughout eternity. This was the good hope which the Thessalonians had; not a hope that they <i>should be pardoned</i> or <i>sanctified</i>, c. Pardon and holiness they <i>enjoyed</i>, therefore they were no objects of <i>hope</i> but the resurrection of the body and eternal glory were necessarily <i>future</i>; these they had in expectation; these they hoped for; and, through the <i>grace</i> which they had already received they had a <i>good hope</i>-a well-grounded expectation, of this glorious state.</p>
