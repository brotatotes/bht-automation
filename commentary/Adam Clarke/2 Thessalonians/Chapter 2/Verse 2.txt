<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>. <i><b>Be not soon shaken in mind</b></i> — αποτουνοος. <i>From the</i> <i>mind</i>; i.e. that they should retain the persuasion they had of the truths which he had before delivered to them; that they should still hold the same opinions, and hold fast the doctrines which they had been taught.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither by spirit</b></i> — Any pretended <i>revelation</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor by word</b></i> — Any thing which any person may profess to have heard the apostle speak.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor by letter</b></i> — Either the former one which he had sent, some passages of which have been misconceived and misconstrued; or by any other letter, <i>as from us</i> - pretending to have been written by us, the apostles, containing predictions of this kind. There is a diversity of opinion among critics concerning this last clause, some supposing that it refers simply to the <i>first epistle</i>; others supposing that a <i>forged epistle</i> is intended. I have joined the two senses.</p>
<p>The word σαλευθηναι, <i>to be shaken</i>, signifies to be agitated as a ship at sea in a storm, and strongly marks the confusion and distress which the Thessalonians had felt in their false apprehension of this coming of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>As that the day of Christ is at hand.</b></i> — In the <i>preface</i> to this epistle I have given a general view of the meaning of the phrase <i>the coming of Christ</i>. Now the question is: Whether does the apostle mean, the coming of Christ to execute judgment upon the <i>Jews</i>, and destroy their <i>polity</i>, or his coming at the end of time, to <i>judge the world</i>? There are certainly many expressions in the following verses that may be applied indifferently to <i>either</i>, and some seem to apply to the <i>one</i>, and not to the <i>other</i>; and yet the whole can scarcely be so interpreted as to suit <i>any one</i> of these comings exclusively. This is precisely the case with the predictions of our Lord relative to these great events; one is used to point out and illustrate the other. On this ground I am led to think that the apostle, in the following confessedly obscure words, has both these in view, speaking of none of them exclusively; for it is the custom of the inspired penmen, or rather of that Spirit by which they spoke, to point out as <i>many</i> certain events by one prediction as it was possible to do, and to choose the figures, metaphors, and similes accordingly; and thus, from the beginning, God has pointed out the things that <i>were not</i> by the things that <i>then existed</i>, making the one the types or significations of the other. As the apostle spoke by the same Spirit, he most probably followed the same plan; and thus the following prophecy is to be interpreted and understood.</p>
