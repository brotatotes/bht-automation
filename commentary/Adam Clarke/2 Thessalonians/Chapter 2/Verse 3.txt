<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>. <i><b>Except there come a falling away first</b></i> — We have the original word αποστασια in our word <i>apostasy</i>; and by this term we understand a <i>dereliction of the essential principles of religious</i> <i>truth</i>-either a <i>total abandonment</i> of Christianity itself, or such a <i>corruption</i> of its doctrines as renders the whole system completely inefficient to salvation. But what <i>this</i> apostasy means is a question which has not yet, and perhaps never will be, answered to general satisfaction. At present I shall content myself with making a few literal remarks on this obscure prophecy, and afterwards give the opinions of learned men on its principal parts.</p>
<p><i><b>That man of sin</b></i> — Ὁ ανθρωπος της ἁμαρτιας· The same as the Hebrew expresses by איש און <i>ish aven</i>, and איש בליעל <i>ish</i> <i>beliyaal</i>; the perverse, obstinate, and iniquitous man. It is worthy of remark that, among the rabbins, <i>Samael</i>, or the devil, is called איש בליעל ואיש און <i>ish beliyaal veish aven</i>, the man of Belial, and the man of iniquity; and that these titles are given to <i>Adam</i> after his fall.</p>
<p><i><b>The son of perdition</b></i> — Ὁ υἱος της απωλειας· <i>The son of</i> <i>destruction</i>; the same epithet that is given to Judas Iscariot, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>, where see the note. <i>The son of perdition</i>, and the <i>man of sin</i>, or, as some excellent MSS. and versions, with several of the fathers, read, ανθρωπος της ανομιας, <i>the lawless man</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>, must mean the same person or thing. It is also remarkable that the wicked Jews are styled by Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:4">Isaiah 1:4</span>, <i>benim mashchithim</i>, "children of perdition;" persons who <i>destroy themselves</i> and <i>destroy others</i>.</p>
