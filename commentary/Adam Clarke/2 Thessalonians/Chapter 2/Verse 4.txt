<p>Verse 4. <i><b>Who opposeth and exalteth</b></i> — He <i>stands against</i> and <i>exalts</i> himself <i>above</i> all Divine authority, and above every <i>object</i> <i>of adoration</i>, and every <i>institution</i> relative to Divine worship, σεβασμα, himself being the <i>source</i>, whence must originate all the <i>doctrines</i> of religion, and all its <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i>; so that <i>sitting in the temple of God</i>-having the <i>highest place</i> and <i>authority</i> in the <i>Christian Church</i>, he acts <i>as God</i>taking upon himself God's titles and attributes, and arrogating to himself the authority that belongs to the Most High.</p>
<p>The words ως θεον, <i>as God</i>, are wanting in ABD, many others, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, the <i>Vulgate</i>, some copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and the chief of the Greek <i>fathers</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> has left them out of the text, and <i>Professor</i> <i>White</i> says, <i>Certissime delenda</i>; "They should most certainly be erased." There is indeed no evidence of their being authentic, and the text reads much better with out them: <i>So that he sitteth</i> <i>in the temple of God</i>, &amp;c.</p>
