<p>Verse 5. <i><b>I told you these things</b></i> â€” In several parts of this description of the <i>man of sin</i>, the apostle alludes to a conversation which had taken place between him and the members of this Church when he was at Thessalonica; and this one circumstance will account for much of the <i>obscurity</i> that is in these verses. Besides, the apostle appears to speak with great <i>caution</i>, and does not at all wish to <i>publish</i> what he had communicated to them; the <i>hints</i> which he drops were sufficient to call the whole to their remembrance.</p>
