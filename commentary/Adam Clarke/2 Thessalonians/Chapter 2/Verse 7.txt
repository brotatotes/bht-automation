<p>Verse 7. <i><b>For the mystery of iniquity doth already work</b></i> â€” There is a system of corrupt doctrine, which will lead to the general apostasy, already in existence, but it is a <i>mystery</i>; it is as yet <i>hidden</i>; it dare not show itself, because of that which <i>hindereth</i> or <i>withholdeth</i>. But when that which now <i>restraineth</i> shall be taken out of the way, then shall that wicked one be revealed-it will then be manifest who he is, and what he is. See the observations at the end of this chapter. <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:17">2 Thessalonians 2:17</span><i>"</i></p>
