<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Whom the Lord shall consume</b></i> — He shall <i>blast</i> him so, that he shall <i>wither</i> and <i>die away</i>; and this shall be done by the <i>spirit of his mouth</i>-the <i>words of eternal life</i>, the <i>true doctrine</i> <i>of the Gospel of Jesus</i>; this shall be the instrument used to destroy this man of sin: therefore it is evident his death will not be a <i>sudden</i> but a <i>gradual</i> one; because it is by the <i>preaching</i> <i>of the truth</i> that he is to be exposed, overthrown, and finally destroyed.</p>
<p><i><b>The brightness of his coming</b></i> — This may refer to that full manifestation of the truth which had been obscured and kept under by the <i>exaltation of this man of sin</i>.</p>
