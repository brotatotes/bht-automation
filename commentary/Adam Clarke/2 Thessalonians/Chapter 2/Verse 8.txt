Verse 8. Whom the Lord shall consume — He shall blast him so, that he shall wither and die away; and this shall be done by the spirit of his mouth-the words of eternal life, the true doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus; this shall be the instrument used to destroy this man of sin: therefore it is evident his death will not be a sudden but a gradual one; because it is by the preaching of the truth that he is to be exposed, overthrown, and finally destroyed.The brightness of his coming — This may refer to that full manifestation of the truth which had been obscured and kept under by the exaltation of this man of sin.
