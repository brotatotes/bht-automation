<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Whose coming is after the working of Satan</b></i> — The operation of God's Spirit sends his messengers; the operation of Satan's spirit sends his emissaries. The one comes κατ' ενεργειαν του Θεου, <i>after</i> or <i>according to the energy</i> or inward powerful <i>working of God</i>; the other comes κατ' ενεργειαν του Σατανα, according to the energy or inward working of Satan.</p>
<p><i><b>With all power</b></i> — Πασῃ δυναμει· All kinds of miracles, like the Egyptian magicians; <i>and signs and lying wonders</i>: the word <i>lying</i> may be applied to the whole of these; they were <i>lying</i> miracles, <i>lying</i> signs, and <i>lying</i> wonders; only <i>appearances</i> of what was <i>real</i>, and done to give credit to his presumption and imposture. Whereas God sent his messengers with <i>real</i> miracles, <i>real</i> signs, and <i>real</i> wonders; such Satan cannot produce.</p>
