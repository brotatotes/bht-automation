<p><i><b>May have free course</b></i> — They were to pray that <i>the doctrine of</i> <i>the Lord</i>, ὁ λογος του Κυριου, <i>might run</i>, τρεχη, an allusion to the races in the Olympic games: that, as it had already got into the stadium or race course, and had started fairly, so it might <i>run on</i>, get to the goal, and <i>be glorified</i>; i.e., gain the crown, appointed for him that should get first to the end of the course.</p>
