<p>Verse 10. <i><b>If any would not work, neither should he eat.</b></i> â€” This is a just maxim, and universal nature inculcates it to man. If man <i>will work</i>, he <i>may eat</i>; if he do <i>not work</i>, he <i>neither can</i> <i>eat</i>, nor <i>should he eat</i>. The maxim is founded on these words of the Lord: <i>In the sweat of thy brow thou shall eat bread</i>. Industry is crowned with God's blessing; idleness is loaded with his curse. This maxim was a proverb among the Jews. Men who can work, and will rather support themselves by begging, should not get one morsel of bread. It is a sin to minister to necessities that are merely artificial.</p>
