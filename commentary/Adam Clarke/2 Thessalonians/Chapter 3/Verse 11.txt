<p>Verse 11. <i><b>For we hear that there are some</b></i> — It is very likely that St. Paul kept up some sort of correspondence with the Thessalonian Church; for he had <i>heard</i> every thing that concerned their state, and it was from this information that he wrote his second epistle.</p>
<p><i><b>Disorderly</b></i> — ατακτως. <i>Out of their rank</i>-not keeping their <i>own place</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Working not at all</b></i> — Either lounging at home, or becoming religious gossips; μηδεν εργαζομενους, <i>doing nothing</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Busybodies.</b></i> — περιεργαζομενους. <i>Doing every thing they should</i> <i>not do</i>-impertinent meddlers with other people's business; prying into other people's circumstances and domestic affairs; magnifying or minifying, mistaking or underrating, every thing; newsmongers and telltales; an abominable race, the curse of every neighbourhood where they live, and a pest to religious society. There is a fine <i>paronomasia</i> in the above words, and evidently intended by the apostle.</p>
