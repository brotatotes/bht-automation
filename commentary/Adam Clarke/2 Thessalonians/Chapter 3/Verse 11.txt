Verse 11. For we hear that there are some — It is very likely that St. Paul kept up some sort of correspondence with the Thessalonian Church; for he had heard every thing that concerned their state, and it was from this information that he wrote his second epistle.Disorderly — ατακτως. Out of their rank-not keeping their own place.Working not at all — Either lounging at home, or becoming religious gossips; μηδεν εργαζομενους, doing nothing.Busybodies. — περιεργαζομενους. Doing every thing they should not do-impertinent meddlers with other people's business; prying into other people's circumstances and domestic affairs; magnifying or minifying, mistaking or underrating, every thing; newsmongers and telltales; an abominable race, the curse of every neighbourhood where they live, and a pest to religious society. There is a fine paronomasia in the above words, and evidently intended by the apostle.
