<p>Verse 12. <i><b>With quietness they work</b></i> — μετα ησυχιας. <i>With</i> <i>silence</i>; leaving their tale-bearing and officious intermeddling. <i>Less noise and more work</i>!</p>
<p><i><b>That - they work, and eat their own bread.</b></i> — Their <i>own</i> bread, because earned by their own honest <i>industry</i>. What a degrading thing to live on the <i>bounty</i> or <i>mercy</i> of another, while a man is able to acquire his own livelihood! He who can submit to this has lost the spirit of <i>independence</i>; and has in him a beggar's heart, and is capable of nothing but base and beggarly actions. Witness the great mass of the people of England, who by their dependence on the <i>poor rates</i> are, from being laborious, independent, and respect able, become idle, profligate, and knavish; the propagators and perpetrators of crime; a discredit to the nation, and a curse to society. The apostle's command is a cure for such; and the Church of God should discountenance such, and disown them.</p>
