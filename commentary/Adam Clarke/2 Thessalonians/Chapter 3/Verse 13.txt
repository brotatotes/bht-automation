<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Be not weary in well-doing.</b></i> â€” While ye stretch out no hand of relief to the <i>indolent</i> and <i>lazy</i>, do not forget the <i>real</i> <i>poor</i>-the genuine representatives of an impoverished Christ; and rather relieve a hundred undeserving objects, than pass by one who is a real object of charity.</p>
