<p>Verse 14. <i><b>If any man obey not</b></i> — They had disobeyed his word in the <i>first epistle</i>, and the Church still continued to bear with them; now he tells the Church, if they still continue to disregard what is said to them, and particularly his word by this <i>second</i> <i>epistle</i>, they are to <i>mark them</i> as being totally incorrigible, and have no fellowship with them.</p>
<p>Some construe the words δια της επιστολης with τουτον σημειουσθε. <i>Give me information of that man by a letter</i>-let me hear of his continued obstinacy, and send me his name. This was probably in order to excommunicate him, and deliver him over to Satan for the destruction of the body, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. The words of the original will bear either construction, that in the <i>text</i>, or that given above.</p>
