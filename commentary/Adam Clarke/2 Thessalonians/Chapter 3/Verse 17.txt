Verse 17. The salutation of Paul with mine own hand â€” It is very likely that Paul employed an amanuensis generally, either to write what he dictated, or to make a fair copy of what he wrote. In either case the apostle always subscribed it, and wrote the salutation and benediction with his own hand; and this was what authenticated all his epistles. A measure of this kind would be very necessary if forged epistles were carried about in those times. See note on 1 Corinthians 16:21, and see Colossians 4:18.
