<p>Verse 17. <i><b>The salutation of Paul with mine own hand</b></i> â€” It is very likely that Paul employed an <i>amanuensis</i> generally, either to <i>write</i> what he <i>dictated</i>, or to make a <i>fair copy</i> of what he wrote. In either case the apostle always subscribed it, and wrote the salutation and benediction with his own hand; and this was what <i>authenticated</i> all his epistles. A measure of this kind would be very necessary if forged epistles were carried about in those times.
