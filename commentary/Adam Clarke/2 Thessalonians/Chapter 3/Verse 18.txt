<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:18">2 Thessalonians 3:18</span>. <i><b>The grace</b></i> — The favour, blessing, and influence of our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>be with you all</i> - be your constant companion. May you ever feel his presence, and enjoy his benediction!</p>
<p><i><b>Amen.</b></i> — So let be! God grant it! This word in this place, has more evidence in favour of its genuineness than it has in most other places; and was probably added here by the apostle himself, or by the Church of the Thessalonians.</p>
<p>The <i>subscriptions</i> to this epistle are various in the MSS. and VERSIONS. The latter are as follows: - </p>
<p>The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens. - <i>Common Greek text</i>.</p>
<p>The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, which was written at Laodicea in Pisidia, was sent by the hands of Tychicus. - SYRIAC.</p>
<p>The end of the Epistle; and it was written at Athens. - ARABIC.</p>
<p>To the Thessalonians. - AETHIOPIC.</p>
<p>Written from Athens, and sent by Silvanus and Timotheus. - COPTIC.</p>
<p>No subscription in the VULGATE.</p>
<p><i>Written at Corinth</i>. - Author of the SYNOPSIS.</p>
<p>--------- sent by Titus and Onesimus. - <i>Latin Prologue</i>.</p>
<p>The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, written from <i>Rome</i>. - No. 71, a MS. of the <i>Vatican</i> library, written about the eleventh century.</p>
<p>The chief of the MSS. either have no subscription, or agree with some of the above <i>versions</i>.</p>
<p>That the epistle was neither written at <i>Athens, Laodicea</i>, nor <i>Rome</i>, has been sufficiently proved; and that it was written, as well as the first, at <i>Corinth</i>, is extremely probable. See the preface, and what has been said on the preceding epistle.</p>
<p>I have often had occasion to observe that the <i>subscriptions</i> at the end of the sacred books are not of Divine origin; they are generally false; and yet some have quoted them as making a part of the sacred text, and have adduced them in support of some favourite opinions.</p>
<p><i>Finished correcting this epistle for a new edition, the shortest</i> <i>day in</i> 1831. - A. C.</p>
