<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</span>. <i><b>Unreasonable and wicked men</b></i> — The word ατοπων, which we translate <i>unreasonable</i>, signifies rather <i>disorderly,</i> <i>unmanageable</i>; persons <i>out of their place</i>-under no discipline, regardless of law and restraint, and ever acting agreeably to the disorderly and unreasonable impulse of their own minds.</p>
<p><i><b>For all</b></i><b> men </b><i><b>have not faith.</b></i> — The word πιστις is without doubt, to be taken here for <i>fidelity</i> or <i>trustworthiness</i>, and not for <i>faith</i>; and this is agreeable to the meaning given to it in the very next verse: <i>But the Lord is faithful</i>, πιστος δε εστιν ὁ Κυριος.</p>
<p>There are many, even of those who have received a measure of the Divine light, in whom we cannot <i>confide</i>; they are irregular, disorderly, and cannot be brought under regular discipline: to these we cannot trust either ourselves or any thing that concerns the cause of God. But the Lord is worthy of your whole <i>confidence</i>; doubt him not; he will establish you, and keep you from any evil to which you may be exposed by these or such like persons.</p>
