<p>Verse 5. <i><b>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God</b></i> — The love of God is the grand motive and principle of obedience; this must occupy your hearts: the heart is irregular in all its workings; God alone, by his Spirit, can <i>direct</i> it into his love, and <i>keep it right</i>; κατευθυναι, give a <i>proper direction</i> to all its passions, and keep them in order, regularity and purity.</p>
<p><i><b>The patience of Christ.</b></i> — Such patience, under all your sufferings and persecutions, as Christ manifested under his. He bore meekly the contradiction of sinners against himself; and when he was reviled, he reviled not again.</p>
