<p>Verse 6. <i><b>That ye withdraw yourselves</b></i> — Have no fellowship with those who will not submit to proper discipline; who do not keep their place; ατακτως, such as are out of their <i>rank</i>, and act according to their own wills and caprices; and particularly such as are <i>idle</i> and <i>busybodies</i>. These he had ordered, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:11-12">1 Thessalonians 4:11-12</span>, that they should <i>study to be quiet, mind their own business, and</i> <i>work with their hands</i>; but it appears that they had paid no attention to this order, and now he desires the Church to exclude such from their communion.</p>
<p><i><b>And not after the tradition</b></i> — This evidently refers to the orders contained in the <i>first epistle</i>; and that first epistle was the <i>tradition</i> which they had received from him. It was, therefore, no <i>unwritten word</i>, no <i>uncertain saying</i>, handed about from one to another; but a part of the <i>revelation</i> which God had given, and which they found in the body of his epistle. These are the only <i>traditions</i> which the Church of God is called to regard.</p>
