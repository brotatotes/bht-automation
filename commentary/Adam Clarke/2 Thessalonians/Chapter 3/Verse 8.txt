<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Neither did we eat any man's bread for naught</b></i> — We paid for what we bought, and worked with our hands that we might have money to buy what was necessary.</p>
<p><i><b>Labour and travail night and day</b></i> — We were incessantly employed, either in preaching the Gospel, visiting from house to house, or working at our calling. As it is very evident that the Church at Thessalonica was very pious, and most affectionately attached to the apostle, they must have been <i>very poor</i>, seeing he was obliged to work hard to gain himself the necessaries of life. Had they been able to support him he would not have worked <i>with</i> <i>labour and travail night and day</i>, that he might not be burdensome to them; and, as we may presume that they were very poor, he could not have got his support among them without adding to their burdens. To this his generous mind could not submit; it is no wonder, therefore, that he is so severe against those who would not labour, but were a burden to the poor followers of God.</p>
