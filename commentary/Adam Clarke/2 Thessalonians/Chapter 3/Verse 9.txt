<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Not because we have not power</b></i> — We have the power, εξουσιαν, the <i>right</i>, to be maintained by those in whose behalf we labour. <i>The labourer is worthy of his hire</i>, is a maxim universally acknowledged and respected; and <i>they who preach the</i> <i>Gospel should live by the Gospel</i>: the apostle did not claim his privilege, but laboured for his own support, that he might be an <i>example</i> to those whom he found otherwise disposed, and that he might spare the poor.
