<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span>. <i><b>Paul an apostle</b></i> â€” St. Paul at once shows his <i>office</i>, the <i>authority</i> on which he held it, and the end for which it was given him. He was an <i>apostle</i> - an extraordinary ambassador from heaven. He had his apostleship by the <i>will of God</i> - according to the counsel and design of God's infinite wisdom and goodness. And he was appointed that he might proclaim that <i>eternal life</i> which God had in view for mankind by the incarnation of his Son Jesus Christ, and which was the <i>end</i> of all the <i>promises</i> he had made to men, and the <i>commandments</i> he had delivered to all his prophets since the world began. The mention of this <i>life</i> was peculiarly proper in the apostle, who had now the sentence of death in himself, and who knew that he must shortly seal the truth with his blood. <i>His life</i> was hidden with Christ in God; and he knew that, as soon as he should be <i>absent</i> from the <i>body</i>, he should be <i>present</i> with the <i>Lord</i>. With these words he both comforted himself and his son Timothy.</p>
