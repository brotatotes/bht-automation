<p>Verse 10. <i><b>But is now made manifest.</b></i> — This purpose of God to save the Gentiles as well as the Jews, and call them to the same state of salvation by Jesus Christ, was, previously to the manifestation of Christ, generally hidden; and what was revealed of it, was only through the means of types and ceremonies.</p>
<p><i><b>Who hath abolished death</b></i> — καταργησαντος μεν τον θανατον. Who has <i>counterworked death</i>; operated against his operations, destroyed his batteries, undersunk and destroyed his mines, and rendered all his instruments and principles of attack useless. By death here, we are not to understand merely natural death, but that corruption and decomposition which take place in consequence of it; and which would be naturally endless, but for the work and energy of Christ. By him alone, comes the <i>resurrection</i> of the body; and through him eternal life and glory are given to the souls of believers.</p>
<p><i><b>Brought life and immortality to light</b></i> — The literal translation of the original is, <i>He hath illustrated life and incorruption by</i> <i>the Gospel</i>. Life eternal, or the doctrine of <i>life eternal</i>, even implying the resurrection of the body, was not unknown among the Jews. They expected this, for they found it in their prophets. It abounded among them long before the incarnation: and they certainly never borrowed any notion in it from the Christians; therefore the Gospel could not be stated as <i>bringing to light</i> what certainly was in <i>the light</i> before that time. But this doctrine was never <i>illustrated</i> and <i>demonstrated</i> before; it existed in <i>promise</i>, but had never been <i>practically exhibited</i>. Jesus Christ died, and lay under the empire of death; he arose again from the dead, and thus <i>illustrated</i> the <i>doctrine of the resurrection</i>: he took the same <i>human body</i> up into heaven, in the sight of his disciples; and ever appears in the presence of God for us; and thus, has <i>illustrated</i> the doctrine of <i>incorruption</i>. In his death, resurrection, and ascension, the doctrine of eternal life, and the resurrection of the human body, and its final <i>incorruptibility</i>, are fully illustrated by <i>example</i>, and established by <i>fact</i>.</p>
