<p>Verse 12. <i><b>I am not ashamed.</b></i> — Though I suffer for the Gospel, I am not ashamed of the Gospel; nor am I <i>confounded</i> in my expectation; his grace being at all times sufficient for me.</p>
<p><i><b>For I know whom I have believed</b></i> — I am well acquainted with the goodness, mercy, and power of Christ; and know that I cannot confide in him in vain.</p>
<p><i><b>That which I have committed unto him</b></i> — This is variously understood. Some think he means his <i>life</i>, which he had put, as it were, into the hands of Christ, in order that he might receive it again, in the resurrection, at the great day. Others think he means his <i>soul</i>. This he had also given into the hands of his faithful Creator, knowing that although wicked men might be permitted to take away his life, yet they could not destroy his soul, nor disturb its peace. Others think that he is speaking of the <i>Gospel</i>, which he knows will be carefully preserved by the great Head of the Church; for, though he shall be soon called to seal the truth with his blood, yet he knows that God will take care that the same truth shall be proclaimed to the world by others, whom God shall raise up for that very purpose.</p>
