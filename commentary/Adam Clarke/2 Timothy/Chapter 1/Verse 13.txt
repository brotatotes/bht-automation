<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Hold fast the form of sound words</b></i> — The word υποτυπωσις signifies the <i>sketch, plan</i>, or <i>outline</i> of a building, picture, c. and here refers to the <i>plan of salvation</i> which the apostle had taught Timothy. No man was left to <i>invent a religion</i> for his own use, and after his own mind. God alone knows that with which God can be pleased. If God did not give a revelation of himself, the inventions of man, in religious things, would be endless error, involving itself in contortions of unlimited confusion. God gives, in his mercy to man, a <i>form of sound words</i> or doctrines; a perfect <i>plan</i> and <i>sketch</i> of the original building; fair and well defined outlines of every thing which concerns the present and eternal welfare of man, and his own glory.</p>
<p><i><b>In faith and love</b></i> — <i>Faith</i> credits the Divine doctrines. <i>Love</i> reduces them all to practice. <i>Faith</i> lays hold on Jesus Christ, and obtains that <i>love</i> by which every precept is cheerfully and effectually obeyed.</p>
