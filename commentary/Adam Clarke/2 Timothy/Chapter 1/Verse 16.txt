<p>Verse 16. <i><b>The Lord give mercy</b></i> â€” Onesiphorus had acknowledged him, and continued to do so; <i>he</i>, and his <i>house</i>, or <i>family</i>, ministered to him in prison, and were not ashamed of their imprisoned pastor, nor of the <i>cause</i> for which he was in disgrace and suffering. As <i>he</i> showed mercy to the apostle, the apostle prays the Lord to show mercy to him.</p>
