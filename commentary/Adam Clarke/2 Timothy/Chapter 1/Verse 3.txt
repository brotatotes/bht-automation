<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span>. <i><b>Whom I serve from</b></i><b> my </b><i><b>forefathers</b></i> — Being born a <i>Jew</i>, I was carefully educated in the knowledge of the true God, and the proper manner of worshipping him.</p>
<p><i><b>With pure conscience</b></i> — Ever aiming to please him, even in the time when through ignorance I persecuted the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Without ceasing I have remembrance of thee</b></i> — The apostle thanks God that he has constant remembrance of Timothy in his prayers. It is a very rare thing now in the Christian Church, that a man particularly thanks God <i>that he is enabled to pray for</i> OTHERS. And yet he that can do this most must have an increase of that brotherly love which the second greatest commandment of God requires: <i>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</i>. It is also a great blessing to be able to maintain the spirit of a pure friendship, especially through a considerable lapse of time and absence. He that can do so may well thank God that he is saved from that <i>fickleness</i> and <i>unsteadiness of mind</i> which are the bane of friendships, and the reproach of many once warm-hearted friends.</p>
