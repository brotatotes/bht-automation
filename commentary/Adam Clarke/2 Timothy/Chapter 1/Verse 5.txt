<p>Verse 5. <i><b>The unfeigned faith that is in thee</b></i> — Timothy had given the fullest proof of the sincerity of his conversion, and of the purity of his faith.</p>
<p><i><b>Which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>, we are informed that Paul <i>came to Derbe and Lystra; and behold, a certain</i> <i>disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman,</i> <i>who was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek</i>. Luke, the historian, it appears, was not particularly acquainted with the family; Paul evidently was. Luke mentions the same circumstance which the apostle mentions here; but in the apostle's account there are <i>particulars</i> which argue an intimate acquaintance with the family and its history. Luke says Timothy's father was a <i>Greek</i>, consequently we may believe him to have been then in his <i>heathen</i> state; Paul, in mentioning the <i>grandmother, mother</i>, and <i>son</i>, passes by the <i>father</i> in silence; which intimates that either the father remained in his <i>unconverted</i> state, or was now <i>dead</i>. Lois and Eunice are both Grecian, and indeed heathen names; hence we are led to conclude that, although Timothy's mother was a <i>Jewess</i> according to St. Luke, yet she was a <i>Grecian</i> or <i>Hellenist</i> by birth. <i>Lois</i>, the grandmother, appears to have been the <i>first</i> convert to Christianity: she instructed her daughter <i>Eunice</i>, and both brought up <i>Timothy</i> in the Christian faith; so that he had a general knowledge of it before he met with St. Paul at Lystra. There, it appears the apostle was the instrument of the conversion of his <i>heart</i> to God; for a man may be <i>well instructed</i> in Divine things, have a very orthodox creed, and yet his heart not be changed. Instruction precedes conversion; conversion should follow it. To be brought up in the fear of God is a great blessing; and a truly religious education is an advantage of infinite worth.</p>
