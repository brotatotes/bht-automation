<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Stir up the gift of God, which is in thee</b></i> — The gift which Timothy had received was the Holy Spirit; and through him, a particular power to preach and defend the truth. This gift is represented here, under the notion of a <i>fire</i>, which, if it be not <i>frequently stirred up</i>, and <i>fresh fuel added</i> to it, will go out. This is the precise idea which the apostle had in his mind; hence the term αναζωπυρειν, which signifies to <i>stir up the fire; to add</i> <i>fresh fuel to it</i>. From this it plainly appears, that if Timothy had not continued to be a daily worker with God, he would have received the grace of God in vain. The <i>Latins</i> have a similar metaphor, <i>excitare igniculos ingenii, to stir up the sparks of</i> <i>genius</i>.</p>
