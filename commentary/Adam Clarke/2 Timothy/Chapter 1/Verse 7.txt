<p>Verse 7. <i><b>God hath not given us the spirit of fear</b></i> — Here is an allusion to the giving of the law on mount Sinai. This was communicated with such <i>terrible majesty</i> as to engender fear in all the Israelites: even Moses, on the occasion, <i>did exceedingly fear</i> <i>and tremble</i>. The Gospel was ushered in, in a much milder manner; every thing was placed on a level with the human intellect; and within reach of every human spirit. Nothing was <i>terrific</i>, nothing <i>forbidding</i>; but all was <i>inviting</i>. The very spirit and genius of it was a spirit of power, of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
<p>Instead of δειλιας, <i>fear</i>, some MSS. and versions have δουλειας, <i>servitude</i> or <i>bondage; God hath not given unto us the spirit of</i> BONDAGE-<i>but of power</i>, δυναμεως, to work miracles, to confound enemies, to support us in trials, and enable us to do that which is lawful and right in his sight. <i>And of love</i>, which enables us to hear, believe, hope, and endure all things; and is the incentive to all obedience. <i>Of a sound mind</i>, σωφρονισμου, of <i>self-possession</i> and <i>government</i>, according to some. But a sound mind implies much more; it means a clear understanding, a sound judgment, a rectified will, holy passions, heavenly tempers; in a word, the whole soul harmonized in all its powers and faculties; and completely regulated and influenced so as to think, speak, and act aright in all things. The apostle says, God hath given the <i>spirit</i> of these things; they are not <i>factitious</i>; they are not <i>assumed</i> for <i>times and circumstances</i>; they are <i>radical</i> powers and tempers; each produced by its proper <i>principle</i>.</p>
