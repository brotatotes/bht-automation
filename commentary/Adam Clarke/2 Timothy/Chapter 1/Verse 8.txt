<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Be not - ashamed of the testimony</b></i> — The testimony of Christ is the <i>Gospel</i> in general, which proclaims <i>Christ crucified</i>, and redemption <i>through his blood</i>. In the sight of the <i>world</i>, there appeared to be reason why a man should be ashamed of this; ashamed of him who was crucified as a malefactor; but, when this Gospel became the power of God to the salvation of every one that believed, it was a subject to exult in. Hence the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>, said, <i>I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ</i>; where see the note.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor of me his prisoner</b></i> — When our <i>friends</i> are in power and credit, we can readily acknowledge them, and take opportunities to show that we have such and such connections; but when the person falls into disgrace or discredit, though we cannot pretend <i>not</i> to <i>know</i> him, yet we take care <i>not</i> to <i>acknowledge</i> him. This induced Cicero, in relation to friendships, to give for a maxim - <i>Amicus</i> <i>certus in re incerta cernitur</i>: "A true friend is known in adverse circumstances;" and from this we have borrowed our proverb, <i>A</i> <i>friend in need, is a friend indeed</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel</b></i> — No parent could love a child better than Paul loved Timothy; and, behold! he who could wish him nothing but what was <i>great, honourable</i>, and <i>good</i>, wishes him to be a <i>partaker of the afflictions of the</i> <i>Gospel</i>! Because, to suffer for Christ, and suffer with Christ, was the highest glory to which any human being in this state could arrive. The royal way to the crown of glory, is by the cross of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the power of God.</b></i> — While thou hast no more affliction than thou hast grace to sustain thee under, thou canst have no cause to complain. And God will take care that if a faithful discharge of thy duty shall expose thee to afflictions, his power manifested in thee shall be in proportion to thy necessities. His load cannot be oppressive, who is strengthened to bear it by the <i>power of God</i>.</p>
