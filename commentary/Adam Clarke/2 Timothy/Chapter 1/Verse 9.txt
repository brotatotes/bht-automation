Verse 9. Who hath saved us — From sin; the spirit of bondage, and all tormenting fear. This is the design of the Gospel.And called us with a holy calling — Invited us to holiness and comfort here; and to eternal glory hereafter.Not according to our works — We have not deserved any part of the good we have received; and can never merit one moment of the exceeding great and eternal weight of glory which is promised. See the notes on the parallel passages.Before the world began — προ χρονων αιωνιων. Before the Mosaic dispensation took place, God purposed the salvation of the Gentiles by Christ Jesus; and the Mosaic dispensation was intended only as the introducer of the Gospel. The law was our schoolmaster unto Christ, Galatians 3:24. See the parallel places, and the notes there.
