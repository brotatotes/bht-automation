<p>Verse 11. <i><b>If we be dead with him</b></i> — That is: As surely as Christ rose again from the dead, so surely shall we rise again; and if we die for him, we shall surely live again with him. This, says the apostle, is πιστος ο λογος, <i>a true doctrine</i>. This is properly the import of the word; and we need not seek, as Bp. Tillotson and many others have done, for some <i>saying</i> of Christ which the apostle is supposed to be here quoting, and which he learned from tradition.</p>
