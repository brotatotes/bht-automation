<p>Verse 14. <i><b>That they strive not about words</b></i> — WORDS, not <i>things</i>, have been a most fruitful source of contention in the Christian world; and among religious people, the principal cause of animosity has arisen from the <i>different manner</i> of apprehending the same <i>term</i>, while, in essence, both meant the <i>same thing</i>. All preachers and divines should be very careful, both in speaking and writing, to explain the terms they use, and never employ them in any sense but that in which they have explained them.</p>
<p><i><b>The subverting of the hearers.</b></i> — This is the general tendency of all polemical divinity and controversial preaching, when angry passions are called in to support the doctrines of the Gospel.</p>
