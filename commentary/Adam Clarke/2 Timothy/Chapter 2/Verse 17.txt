<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Their word will eat as doth a canker</b></i> — ως γαγγραινα. <i>As a gangrene</i>; i.e. as a <i>mortification in the flesh</i>, where the circulation is entirely stopped, and putrefaction takes place, which continues to corrupt all the circumjacent flesh, spreading more and more till death takes place, unless stopped by a timely and judicious application of medicine. Such is the influence of <i>false doctrine</i>; it fixes its mortal seed in the soul, which continues to <i>corrupt</i> and <i>assimilate every thing to itself</i>, till, if not prevented by a timely application of the <i>word of</i> <i>life</i>, under the direction of the heavenly <i>Physician</i>, it terminates in the bitter pains of an <i>eternal death</i>. To such a <i>gangrene</i> the apostle compares the corrupt doctrines of <i>Hymeneus</i> and <i>Philetus</i>.</p>
