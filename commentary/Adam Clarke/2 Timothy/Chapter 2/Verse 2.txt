<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2">2 Timothy 2:2</span>. <i><b>The things that thou hast heard of me</b></i> â€” Those doctrines which I have preached the most publicly, and which many persons can attest. But he seems to refer here to the doctrines delivered to him when, in the <i>presence of many witnesses</i>, he laid his hands upon him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>. Then the apostle gave him the proper form of sound words which he was to teach; and now he tells him to commit those truths to faithful men in the same way that they were committed to him, that the truth might be preserved in the Church, and holy men appointed successively to preach it. These truths are still continued in the Church, and still there are faithful men who proclaim them. But where is the <i>uninterrupted</i> apostolical succession! Who can tell? Probably it does not exist on the face of the world. All the pretensions to it by certain Churches are as stupid as they are idle and futile. He who appeals to this for his authority as a Christian minister, had best sit down till he has made it out; and this will be by the next Greek kalends.</p>
