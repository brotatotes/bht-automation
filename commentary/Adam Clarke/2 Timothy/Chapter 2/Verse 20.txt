<p>Verse 20. <i><b>But in a great house</b></i> â€” Here the apostle carries on the allusion introduced in the preceding verse. As the <i>foundation</i> <i>of God</i> refers to God's <i>building</i>, i.e. the whole system of Christianity, so here the <i>great house</i> is to be understood of the same; and the different kinds of vessels mean the different teachers, as well as the different kinds of members. In this sacred house at Ephesus there were <i>vessels of gold and</i> <i>silver</i>-eminent, holy, sincere, and useful teachers and members, and also <i>vessels of wood and of earth</i>-false and heretical teachers, such as Hymeneus and Philetus, and their followers. There are also in such houses vessels employed, some in a more <i>honourable</i>, others in a <i>less honourable, office</i>. To these he seems also to compare the same persons.</p>
