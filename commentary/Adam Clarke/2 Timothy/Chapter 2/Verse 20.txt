Verse 20. But in a great house â€” Here the apostle carries on the allusion introduced in the preceding verse. As the foundation of God refers to God's building, i.e. the whole system of Christianity, so here the great house is to be understood of the same; and the different kinds of vessels mean the different teachers, as well as the different kinds of members. In this sacred house at Ephesus there were vessels of gold and silver-eminent, holy, sincere, and useful teachers and members, and also vessels of wood and of earth-false and heretical teachers, such as Hymeneus and Philetus, and their followers. There are also in such houses vessels employed, some in a more honourable, others in a less honourable, office. To these he seems also to compare the same persons.
