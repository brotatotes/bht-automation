<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Flee also youthful lusts</b></i> — Not only all irregular and sensual desires, but <i>pride, ambition</i>, and, above all, <i>the lust</i> <i>of power</i>, to which most men will sacrifice all other propensities, their ease, pleasure, health, c. This is the most bewitching passion in the human heart. Both in <i>Church</i> and <i>state</i> it is ruinous but particularly so in the former. Timothy was now between thirty and forty years of age, the very age in which <i>ambition</i> and the <i>love of power</i> most generally prevail. <i>Carnal</i> <i>pleasures</i> are the sins of <i>youth; ambition</i> and the <i>love of power</i> the sins of <i>middle age; covetousness</i> and <i>carking cares</i> the crimes of old age.</p>
<p><i><b>Follow righteousness</b></i> — Flee from sin, pursue goodness. <i>Righteousness</i>-whatever is just, holy, and innocent. <i>Faith</i>-fidelity both to God and man, improving that grace by which thy soul may be saved, and faithfully discharging the duties of thy office, that thou mayest save the souls of others. <i>Charity</i>-love to God and man. <i>Peace</i> among all the members of the Church, and as far as possible with all men; but especially among those who invoke the Lord out of a pure desire to glorify his name.</p>
