<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Those that oppose</b></i> — αντιδιατιθεμενους. This seems to refer to those who opposed the apostle's <i>authority</i>; and hence the propriety of the allusion to the <i>rebellion</i> of Korah and his company. See observations at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>If God peradventure</b></i> — He was to use every means which he had reason to believe God might bless; and the apostle intimates that, bad as they were, they were not out of the reach of God's mercy.</p>
