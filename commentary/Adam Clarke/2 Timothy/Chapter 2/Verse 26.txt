<p>I leave these different translations with the reader.</p>
<p>I HAVE referred, in the preceding notes, to <i>inscriptions</i> which appear on the buildings and coins of the Asiatics; such inscriptions are, in general, very curious, and carry with them a considerable show of piety to God, in the acknowledgment of his providence and mercy. I shall quote one merely as a curiosity, without supposing it to be immediately applicable to the illustration of the text.</p>
<p>There is extant a gold circular coin of the Great Mogul <i>Shah</i> <i>Jehan</i>, struck at Delhi, A. H. 1062, A. D. 1651, five inches and a half in diameter; on each side of this coin is a square, the angles of which touch the periphery; within this square, and in the segments, there are the following inscriptions: - </p>
<p><i>Grotius</i> and others have supposed that the apostle alludes to the custom of putting an inscription on the foundation stone of a city or other building, giving an account of the time in which it was founded, built, c. Sometimes engraved stones were placed over the principal gates of cities and fortresses, particularly in the east, specifying the date of erection, repairs, c., and containing some religious sentiment or verse from the Koran. But I do not think it likely that the apostle refers to any thing of this kind. There appears to be an allusion here to the <i>rebellion</i> of Korah and his company against the <i>authority</i> of Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:5">Numbers 16:5</span>, where, it is said: <i>The Lord will show who are his</i>: here the words of the Septuagint are nearly the same that the apostle uses in this verse, εγνω ὁ Θεος τους οντας αὑτου· <i>God knoweth</i> or <i>approveth of them that are his</i>. And the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:26">Numbers 16:26</span>, <i>Depart from the tents of these wicked men</i>, are similar to those of the apostle, <i>Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart</i> <i>from iniquity</i>. We may therefore take it for granted that those false teachers, the chief of whom were <i>Hymeneus</i> and <i>Philetus</i>, had risen up against the <i>authority</i> of St. Paul and he, in effect, informs Timothy here that God will deal with <i>them</i> as he did with Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and their company. And as the true Israelites were to <i>separate themselves from the tents of those</i> <i>wicked men</i>, so he and the believers at Ephesus were to hold no sort of communion with those workers of iniquity. This subject he farther illustrates by a contract between two parties, each of which sets his seal to the instrument, the seal bearing the motto peculiar to the party. This I conceive to be the meaning but the common mode of interpretation will, it is probable, be most commonly followed.</p>
