<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:4">2 Timothy 2:4</span>. <i><b>No man that warreth entangleth</b></i>, &amp;c.] It is well remarked by <i>Grotius</i>, on this passage, that the legionary soldiers among the Romans were not permitted to engage in husbandry, merchandise, mechanical employments, or any thing that might be inconsistent with their calling. Many <i>canons</i>, at different times, have been made to prevent ecclesiastics from intermeddling with secular employments.

He should <i>be wholly in this thing</i>, that his profiting may appear unto all. There are many who sin against this direction. They love the world, and labour for it, and are regardless of the souls committed to their charge. But what are they, either in number or guilt, compared to the immense herd of men professing to be Christian ministers, who neither read nor study, and consequently never improve? These are too conscientious to meddle with secular affairs, and yet have no scruple of conscience to <i>while away time</i>, be among the chief in <i>needless self-indulgence</i>, and, by their burdensome and monotonous ministry, become an incumbrance to the Church!
