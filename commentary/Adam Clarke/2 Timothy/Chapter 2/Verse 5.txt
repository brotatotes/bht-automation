Verse 5. If a man also strive for masteries — εαν δε και αθλη τις. If a man contend in the public games-the Olympic or Isthmian games among the Greeks, so often alluded to and particularly explained in the notes on 1 Corinthians 9:24-26, to which the reader is referred for a full illustration of this verse.Is he not crowned — Though he may have conquered, except he strive lawfully-unless he enter according to the rules of the athletae, and act as these direct. No man, however zealous he may have been, is to expect the Well done, good and faithful servant, from Jesus Christ, unless he have laboured in the word and doctrine, preached the truth as it is in Jesus, and built up the Church upon Him who is its only FOUNDATION.
