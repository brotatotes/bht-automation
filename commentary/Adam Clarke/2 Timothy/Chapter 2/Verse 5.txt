<p>Verse 5. <i><b>If a man also strive for masteries</b></i> — εαν δε και αθλη τις. <i>If a man contend in the public games</i>-the Olympic or Isthmian games among the Greeks, so often alluded to and particularly explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24-26">1 Corinthians 9:24-26</span>, to which the reader is referred for a full illustration of this verse.</p>
<p><i><b>Is he not crowned</b></i> — Though he may have conquered, <i>except he</i> <i>strive lawfully</i>-unless he enter according to the rules of the athletae, and act as these direct. No man, however zealous he may have been, is to expect the <i>Well done, good and faithful servant</i>, from Jesus Christ, unless he have <i>laboured in the word and</i> <i>doctrine</i>, preached the <i>truth as it is in Jesus, and built up the</i> <i>Church upon</i> Him who is its <i>only</i> FOUNDATION.</p>
