<p>Verse 6. <i><b>The husbandman that laboureth</b></i> â€” That is: The <i>husbandman</i> must <i>first</i> till his ground before he can expect a crop; and he must till it according to the proper <i>rules</i> of <i>agriculture</i>, else he cannot have a crop. The <i>combatant</i> must fight and conquer, and fight according to the laws of the <i>agones</i>, before he can be crowned; so the Christian minister must labour in the spiritual vineyard, and labour too under the eye and according to the direction of his Master, before he can expect that crown of righteousness that fadeth not away.</p>
