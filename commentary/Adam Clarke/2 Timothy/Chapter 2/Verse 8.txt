<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Remember that Jesus Christ</b></i> — The apostle seems to say: Whatever tribulations or deaths may befall us, let us remember that Jesus Christ, who was slain by the Jews, rose again from the dead, and his resurrection is the proof and pledge of ours. We also shall rise again to a life of glory and blessedness.</p>
<p><i><b>According to my Gospel</b></i> — The false teaching of Hymeneus and Philetus stated that the resurrection was past already. Paul preached the resurrection from the dead; and founded his doctrine on the resurrection and promise of Christ. This was <i>his Gospel</i>; the other was of a different nature.</p>
