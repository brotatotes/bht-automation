<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Thou hast fully known my doctrine</b></i> â€” And having long had the opportunity of knowing me, the <i>doctrine</i> I preached, my <i>conduct</i> founded on these doctrines, the <i>object</i> I have in view by my preaching, my <i>fidelity</i> to God and to my trust, my <i>long-suffering</i> with those who walked disorderly, and opposed themselves to the truth, and did what they could to lessen my authority and render it suspected, my <i>love</i> to them and to the world in general, and my <i>patience</i> in all my adversities; thou art capable of judging between me and the false teachers, and canst easily discern the difference between their doctrines, conduct, motives, temper, spirit, &amp;c., and mine.</p>
