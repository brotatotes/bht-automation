<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Persecutions - which came unto me at Antioch</b></i> â€” The <i>Antioch</i> mentioned here was Antioch in Pisidia, to which place Paul and Barnabas came in their first apostolic progress, and where Paul delivered that memorable discourse which is preserved in the 13th chapter of Acts, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16-43">Acts 13:16-43</span>. In this city, it is said, <i>the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief</i> <i>men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas,</i> <i>and expelled them out of their coasts; but they shook of the dust</i> <i>of their feet against them, and came to Iconium</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:50-51">Acts 13:50-51</span>. Here <i>there was an assault made both of the Gentiles and also of</i> <i>the Jews with their rulers, to treat them despitefully, and to</i> <i>stone them</i>, and they fled unto <i>Lystra</i> and <i>Derbe</i>; and <i>there came</i> <i>thither certain Jews, who persuaded the people, and having stoned</i> <i>Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead</i>. The historian informs us that his life was miraculously restored, and that he departed thence, and came to <i>Derbe</i>, and afterwards returned to <i>Lystra, Iconium</i>, and <i>Antioch</i>, where they had lately been so grievously persecuted. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5-6">Acts 14:5-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19-21">Acts 14:19-21</span>. These are the persecutions, c., to which the apostle alludes and we find that he mentions them here precisely in the same <i>order</i> in which, according to the relation of St. Luke, they occurred. Now it is said here that Timothy <i>fully knew all these things</i>; and we may naturally suppose they could not be unknown to him, when it is evident he was either a native of, or resided in, those parts; for when the apostle, sometime after the above, visited Derbe and Lystra, <i>behold, a certain disciple was there named Timotheus, well</i> <i>reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1-2">Acts 16:1-2</span>. As these things happened in his own neighbourhood, Timothy must have known them; for a person who had such a religious education as he had could not be unacquainted with these persecutions, especially as we may believe that his mother and grandmother had been converts to Christianity at that time. See several useful remarks in Dr. Paley's <i>Horae Paulinae</i>, on these circumstances, page 312.</p>
