<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Evil men and seducers shall wax worse</b></i> — They will yet get on for a season, deceiving themselves and deceiving others; but, by and by, <i>their folly will become manifest to all</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:9">2 Timothy 3:9</span>. The word γοητες, which we render <i>seducers</i>, signifies <i>jugglers,</i> <i>pretenders to magical arts</i>; probably persons dealing in <i>false</i> <i>miracles</i>, with whom the Church in all ages has been not a little disgraced.</p>
