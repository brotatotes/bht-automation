<p>Verse 15. <i><b>From a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures</b></i> — The early religious education of Timothy has been already sufficiently noticed; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>, and the <i>preface</i> to the first epistle. St. Paul introduces this circumstance again here for the confirmation of Timothy's faith. He had learned the doctrines of Christianity from a genuine apostle; and, as Christianity is founded on the law and the prophets, Timothy was able to compare its doctrines with all that had been <i>typified</i> and <i>predicted</i>, and consequently was <i>assured</i> that the Christian religion was true.</p>
<p><i><b>Able to make thee wise unto salvation</b></i> — The apostle is here evidently speaking of the Jewish Scriptures; and he tells us that <i>they are able to make us wise unto salvation</i> provided we have <i>faith in Jesus Christ</i>. This is the simple use of the <i>Old</i> <i>Testament</i>. No soul of man can be made wise unto salvation by it, but as he refers all to Christ Jesus. The Jews are unsaved though they know these Scriptures, because they believe not in Christ; for Christ is the end of the law for the justification of all that believe.</p>
