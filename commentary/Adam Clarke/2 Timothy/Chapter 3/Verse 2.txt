<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:2">2 Timothy 3:2</span>. <i><b>For men shall be</b></i> — The description in this and the following verses the Papists apply to the Protestants; the Protestants in their turn apply it to the Papists; <i>Schoettgen</i> to the <i>Jews</i>; and others to <i>heretics</i> in general. There have been both teachers and people in every age of the Church, and in every age of the world, to whom these words may be most legitimately applied. Both Catholics and Protestants have been lovers of their own selves, c. but it is probable that the apostle had some particular age in view, in which there should appear some very essential corruption of Christianity.</p>

<p><i><b>Blasphemers</b></i> — βλασφημοι. Those who speak <i>impiously</i> of God and sacred things, and <i>injuriously</i> of men.</p>
