Verse 2 Timothy 3:3. Without natural affection — αστοργοι. Without that affection which parents bear to their young, and which the young bear to their parents. An affection which is common to every class of animals; consequently, men without it are worse than brutes.Truce-breakers — ασπονδοι. From α, negative, and σπονδη, a libation, because in making treaties libations both of blood and wine were poured out. The word means those who are bound by no promise, held by no engagement, obliged by no oath; persons who readily promise any thing, because they never intend to perform.False accusers — διαβολοι. Devils; but properly enough rendered false accusers, for this is a principal work of the devil. Slanderers; striving ever to ruin the characters of others.Incontinent — ακρατεις. From α, negative, and κρατος, power. Those who, having sinned away their power of self-government, want strength to govern their appetites; especially those who are slaves to uncleanness.Fierce — ανημεροι. From α, negative, and ημερος, mild or gentle. Wild, impetuous, whatever is contrary to pliability and gentleness.Despisers of those that are good — αφιλαγαθοι. Not lovers of good men. Here is a remarkable advantage of the Greek over the English tongue, one word of the former expressing five or six of the latter. Those who do not love the good must be radically bad themselves.
