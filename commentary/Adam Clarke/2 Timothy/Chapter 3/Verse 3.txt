<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:3">2 Timothy 3:3</span>. <i><b>Without natural affection</b></i> — αστοργοι. Without that affection which <i>parents</i> bear to their <i>young</i>, and which the <i>young</i> bear to their <i>parents</i>. An affection which is common to every class of <i>animals</i>; consequently, men without it are worse than brutes.</p>
<p><i><b>Truce-breakers</b></i> — ασπονδοι. From α, <i>negative</i>, and σπονδη, a <i>libation</i>, because in making treaties <i>libations</i> both of <i>blood</i> and <i>wine</i> were poured out. The word means those who are bound by no promise, held by no engagement, obliged by no oath; persons who readily promise any thing, because they never intend to perform.</p>
<p><i><b>False accusers</b></i> — διαβολοι. <i>Devils</i>; but properly enough rendered <i>false accusers</i>, for this is a principal work of the devil. Slanderers; striving ever to ruin the characters of others.</p>
<p><i><b>Incontinent</b></i> — ακρατεις. From α, <i>negative</i>, and κρατος, <i>power</i>. Those who, having sinned away their power of self-government, want strength to govern their appetites; especially those who are slaves to uncleanness.</p>
<p><i><b>Fierce</b></i> — ανημεροι. From α, <i>negative</i>, and ημερος, <i>mild</i> or <i>gentle</i>. Wild, impetuous, whatever is contrary to <i>pliability</i> and gentleness.</p>
<p><i><b>Despisers of those that are good</b></i> — αφιλαγαθοι. <i>Not lovers of</i> <i>good men</i>. Here is a remarkable advantage of the <i>Greek</i> over the <i>English</i> tongue, <i>one word</i> of the former expressing five or six of the latter. Those who <i>do not love the good</i> must be radically bad themselves.</p>
