<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:4">2 Timothy 3:4</span>. <i><b>Traitors</b></i> — προδοται. From προ, <i>before</i>, and διδωμι, <i>to deliver up</i>. Those who deliver up to an enemy the person who has put his life in their hands; such as the Scots of 1648, who <i>delivered up</i> into the hands of his enemies their unfortunate <i>countryman</i> and <i>king</i>, Charles the First; a stain which no lapse of ages can wipe out.</p>
<p><i><b>Heady</b></i> — προπετεις. From προ, <i>forwards</i>, and πιπτω, <i>to</i> <i>fall</i>; headstrong, precipitate, rash, inconsiderate.</p>
<p><i><b>High-minded</b></i> — τετυφωμενοι. From τοφος, <i>smoke</i>; the frivolously aspiring; those who are full of themselves, and empty of all good.</p>
<p><i><b>Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God</b></i> — This is nervously and beautifully expressed in the Greek, φιληδονοιμαλλονη φιλοθεοι lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; i.e. pleasure, sensual gratification, is their god; and this they love and serve; God they do not.</p>
