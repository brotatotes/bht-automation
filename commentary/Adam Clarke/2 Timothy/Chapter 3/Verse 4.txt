Verse 2 Timothy 3:4. Traitors — προδοται. From προ, before, and διδωμι, to deliver up. Those who deliver up to an enemy the person who has put his life in their hands; such as the Scots of 1648, who delivered up into the hands of his enemies their unfortunate countryman and king, Charles the First; a stain which no lapse of ages can wipe out.Heady — προπετεις. From προ, forwards, and πιπτω, to fall; headstrong, precipitate, rash, inconsiderate.High-minded — τετυφωμενοι. From τοφος, smoke; the frivolously aspiring; those who are full of themselves, and empty of all good.Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God — This is nervously and beautifully expressed in the Greek, φιληδονοιμαλλονη φιλοθεοι lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; i.e. pleasure, sensual gratification, is their god; and this they love and serve; God they do not.
