<p>Verse 6. <i><b>For of this sort are they</b></i> â€” He here refers to <i>false</i> <i>teachers</i> and their <i>insinuating manners</i>, practising upon weak women, who, seeing in them such a semblance of piety, entertain them with great eagerness, and at last become partakers with them in their impurities. Among the Jews there are remarkable cases of this kind on record, and not a few of them among the full fed monks of the Romish Church. But in what sect or party have not such teachers been occasionally found? yet neither <i>Judaism,</i> <i>Protestantism</i>, nor <i>Roman Catholicism</i> makes any provision for such men.</p>
