<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Ever learning</b></i> â€” From their false teachers, <i>and never</i> <i>able to come to the knowledge of the truth</i>, because that teaching never leads to the <i>truth</i>; for, although there was a <i>form of</i> <i>godliness</i>, which gave them a sort of <i>authority</i> to teach, yet, as they denied the <i>power of godliness</i>, they never could bring their votaries to the knowledge of the saving power of Christianity.</p>
<p>There are many professors of Christianity still who answer the above description. They hear, repeatedly hear, it may be, good sermons; but, as they seldom meditate on what they hear, they derive little profit from the ordinances of God. They have no more grace <i>now</i> than they had <i>several years ago</i>, though hearing all the while, and perhaps not wickedly departing from the Lord. They do not meditate, they do not think, they do not reduce what they hear to practice; therefore, even under the preaching of an apostle, they could not become wise to salvation.</p>
