<p>Verse 9. <i><b>But they shall proceed no farther</b></i> — Such teaching and teachers shall never be able <i>ultimately</i> to prevail against the truth; for the foundation of God standeth sure.</p>
<p><i><b>Their folly shall be manifest</b></i> — As the Scriptures, which are the only rule of morals and doctrine, shall ever be preserved; so, sooner or later, all false doctrines shall be tried by <i>them</i>: and the folly of men, setting up their wisdom against the wisdom of God, must become manifest to all. False doctrine cannot prevail long where the sacred Scriptures are read and studied. Error prevails only where the book of God is withheld from the people. The religion that fears the Bible is not the religion of God. Is <i>Popery</i> or <i>Protestantism</i> this religion?</p>
