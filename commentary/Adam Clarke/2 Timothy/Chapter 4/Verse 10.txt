<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Demas hath forsaken me</b></i> — This is another proof of the posteriority of this epistle: for Demas was with the apostle in his first imprisonment, and joins in the salutations, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span>, which were written when Paul was a prisoner at Rome for the first time.</p>
<p><i><b>Having loved this present world</b></i> — Αγαπησας τον νυν αιωνα Having preferred Judaism to Christianity; or having loved the Jews, and having sought their welfare in preference to that of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>The עולם הזה words <i>olam hazzeh</i>, which answer to the Greek τον νυν αιωνα, are generally to be understood as signifying, either the Jewish people, or the system of Judaism. It was now become doubly dangerous to be a Christian; and those who had not religion enough to enable them to burn, or in any other way to expose life for it, took refuge in that religion which was exposed to no persecution. This is a light in which the conduct of Demas may be viewed. It could not have been the love of <i>secular gain</i> which had induced Demas to abandon St. Paul; he must have counted this cost before he became a Christian. See below.</p>
<p><i><b>Crescens to Galatia</b></i> — Whether the departure of <i>Crescens</i> was similar to that of <i>Demas</i>, as intimated above, or whether he went on an <i>evangelical embassy</i>, we know not. Charity would hope the latter; for we can hardly suppose that <i>Titus</i>, who is here said to have <i>departed to Dalmatia</i>, had abandoned his Cretan Churches, his apostolical office, and especially his <i>aged father and friend</i>, now about to seal the truth with his blood! It is probable that both these persons had gone on sacred missions, and perhaps had been gone some time before the apostle was brought into such imminent danger. Even for <i>Demas</i>, as standing in this connection, something might be said. It is not intimated that he had denied the faith, but simply that he <i>had left the apostle and gone into</i> <i>Thessalonica</i>; for which this reason is given, that <i>he loved the</i> <i>present world</i>. Now, if αγαπησας, <i>having loved</i>, can be applied to a <i>desire to save the souls of the Jews</i>, and that he went <i>into</i> <i>Thessalonica</i>, where they abounded, for this very purpose, then we shall find all three-Demas, Crescens, and Titus, one at Thessalonica, another at Galatia, and the third at Dalmatia, doing the work of evangelists, visiting the Churches, and converting both Jews and Gentiles. This interpretation I leave to the <i>charitable reader</i>, and must own that, with all the presumptive evidences against it, it has some fair show of probability. Demas has received little justice from interpreters and preachers in general. It is even fashionable to hunt him down.</p>
