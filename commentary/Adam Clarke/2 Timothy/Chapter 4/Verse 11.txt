<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Only Luke is with me.</b></i> — This was <i>Luke</i> the evangelist, and writer of the Acts of the Apostles, who was always much attached to St. Paul, and it is supposed continued with him even to his martyrdom.</p>
<p><i><b>Take Mark, and bring him with thee</b></i> — This was <i>John Mark</i>, the sister's son of Barnabas, who, after having wavered a little at first, became a steady, zealous, and useful man; his name and conduct have been often before the reader. See the parallel passages.</p>
<p><i><b>For he is profitable to me for the ministry.</b></i> — εις διακονιαν. <i>For service</i>; that is, he would be very useful to the apostle, to minister to him in his present close confinement. Some think that the apostle means his <i>preaching the Gospel</i>; but at this time, I should suppose, there was very little, if any, public preaching at Rome.</p>
