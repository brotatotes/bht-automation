<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</b></i> â€” For this person, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7">Colossians 4:7</span>. It is rather strange that the apostle should say, <i>I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus</i>, if Timothy was at Ephesus at this time; but it is probable that Tychicus had been sent to Ephesus some time before this, and therefore the apostle might say, though writing now to Ephesus, <i>Tychicus have I sent</i>, &amp;c.</p>
