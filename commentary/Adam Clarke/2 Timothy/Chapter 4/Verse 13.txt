<p>Verse 13. <i><b>The cloak that I left at Troas</b></i> — τον φελονην is by several translated <i>bag</i> or <i>portmanteau</i>; and it is most likely that it was something of this kind, in which he might carry his clothes, books, and travelling necessaries. What the <i>books</i> were we cannot tell, it is most likely they were <i>his own writings</i>; and as to the <i>parchments</i>, they were probably the <i>Jewish Scriptures</i> and a copy of the <i>Septuagint</i>. These he must have had at hand at all times. The books and parchments now sent for could not be for the apostle's own use, as he was now on the eve of his martyrdom. He had probably intended to bequeath them to the faithful, that they might be preserved for the use of the Church.</p>
