<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Alexander the coppersmith</b></i> — We are not to understand this of any <i>tradesman</i>, but of some <i>rabbin</i>; for it was not unusual for the Jews to apply the name of some <i>trade</i> as an epithet to their rabbins and literary men. He is, in all probability, the very same mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:33">Acts 19:33</span>, where see the note; and it is not unlikely that he may have been the same whom the apostle was obliged to excommunicate, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord reward him</b></i> — Αποδῳη αυτῳ ὁ Κυριος· But instead of αποδωη, which has here the power of a solemn <i>imprecation</i>, αποδωσει, <i>he will reward</i>, is the reading of the very best MSS., several of the <i>versions</i>, and some of the chief Greek <i>fathers</i>. This makes the sentence <i>declaratory</i>: <i>The Lord</i> WILL <i>reward him</i> <i>according to his works</i>. This reading is most like the spirit and temper of this heavenly man. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16">2 Timothy 4:16</span>.</p>
