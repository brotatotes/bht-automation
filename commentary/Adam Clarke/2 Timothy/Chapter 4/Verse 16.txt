It is generally allowed that, when St. Paul had been taken this second time by the Romans, he was examined immediately, and required to account for his conduct; and that, so odious was Christianity through the tyranny of Nero, he could procure no person to plead for him. Nero, who had himself set fire to Rome, charged it on the Christians, and they were in consequence persecuted in the most cruel manner; he caused them to be wrapped up in pitched clothes, and then, chaining them to a stake, he ordered them to be set on fire to give light in the streets after night! Tormenti genus! To this Juvenal appears to allude. Sat. i. v. 155.  The streets, and make a dreadful fire by night." DRYDEN.  I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. — How much more simple, elegant, and expressive are the apostle's own words: μη αυτοις λογισθειη. let it not be placed to their account! Let them not have to reckon for it with the supreme Judge at the great day!
