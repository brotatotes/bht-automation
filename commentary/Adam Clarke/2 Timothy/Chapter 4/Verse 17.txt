<p>Verse 17. <i><b>The Lord stood with me</b></i> — When all human help failed, God, in a more remarkable manner, interposed; and thus the excellency plainly appeared to be of God, and not of man.</p>
<p><i><b>That by me the preaching might be fully known</b></i> — When called on to make his defence he took occasion to <i>preach the Gospel</i>, and to show that the great God of heaven and earth had designed to illuminate the Gentile world with the rays of his light and glory. This must have endeared him to some, while others might consider him an opposer of their gods, and be the more incensed against him.</p>
<p><i><b>I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</b></i> — I escaped the imminent danger at that time. Probably he was seized in a tumultuous manner, and expected to be torn to pieces. The words εκ στοματος or εκ βρυγμου λεοντος ῥυεσθαι, <i>to be rescued from</i> <i>the mouth</i> or <i>jaws of the lion</i>, are a proverbial form of speech for deliverance from the most imminent danger. Several writers think <i>Nero</i> to be intended by the <i>lion</i>, because of his rage and oppressive cruelty. But <i>Helius Caesarinus</i> was at this time prefect of the city; Nero being in Greece. He was a bloody tyrant, and Nero had given him the power of life and death in his absence. The apostle may mean him, if the words be not proverbial.</p>
