<p>Verse 18. <i><b>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work</b></i> — None of the evil designs formed against me to make me unfaithful or unsteady, to cause me to save my life at the expense of faith and a good conscience, shall succeed; my life may go, but he will preserve me <i>unto his heavenly kingdom</i>. A continuance on earth the apostle expects not; but he has <i>glory</i> full in view, and therefore he gives God glory for what he had done, and for what he had promised to do.</p>
