<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:2">2 Timothy 4:2</span>. <i><b>Preach the word</b></i> — Κηρυξον τον λογον· <i>Proclaim the</i> <i>doctrine</i>, the doctrine of Christ crucified, for the sins of the whole world; the doctrine, that the Gentiles are invited to be fellow heirs with the Jews, and that for Jews and Gentiles there is no salvation but by faith in Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Be instant in season, out of season</b></i> — Επιστηθι ευκαιρως, ακαιρως. Be urgent whether the times be <i>prosperous</i> or <i>adverse</i>, whenever there is an <i>opportunity</i>; and when there is <i>none</i>, strive to make <i>one</i>. The Judge is at the door, and to every man eternity is at hand! Wherever thou meetest a sinner, speak to him the word of reconciliation. Do not be contented with <i>stated times</i> and <i>accustomed places</i> merely; all <i>time</i> and <i>place</i> belong to God, and are proper for his work. Wherever it can be done, there it should be done. Satan will omit neither time nor place where he can destroy. Omit thou none where thou mayest be the instrument of salvation to any.</p>
