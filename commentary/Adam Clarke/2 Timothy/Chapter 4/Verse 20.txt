Verse 20. Erastus abode at Corinth — He was treasurer of that city, as we learn from Romans 16:23. See the note there. The apostle had sent him and Timothy on a mission to Macedonia, Acts 19:22, whence it is probable he returned to Corinth, and there became finally settled.Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. — Even the apostles could not work miracles when they pleased; that power was but rarely given, and that for very special purposes. Trophimus was an Ephesian. See Acts 20:4, and the note there.Miletus was a maritime town of Ionia, not far from Ephesus; but there was another Miletus, in Crete, which some learned men think to be intended here. It appears that St. Paul went from Macedonia to Corinth, where he left Erastus; from Corinth he proceeded to Troas, where he lodged with Carpus: from Troas he went to Ephesus, where he visited Timothy; from Ephesus he went to Miletus, where he left Trophimus sick; and having embarked at Miletus, he went by sea to Rome. See Calmet. It is most likely, therefore, that the Miletus of Ionia is the place intended.
