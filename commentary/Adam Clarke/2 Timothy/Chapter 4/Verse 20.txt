<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Erastus abode at Corinth</b></i> — He was <i>treasurer</i> of that city, as we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>. See the note there. The apostle had sent him and Timothy on a mission to Macedonia, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>, whence it is probable he returned to Corinth, and there became finally settled.</p>
<p><i><b>Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</b></i> — Even the apostles could not work miracles <i>when they pleased</i>; that power was but rarely given, and that for very special purposes. <i>Trophimus</i> was an Ephesian. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>, and the note there.</p>
<p><i>Miletus</i> was a maritime town of Ionia, not far from Ephesus; but there was another Miletus, in Crete, which some learned men think to be intended here. It appears that St. Paul went from Macedonia to Corinth, where he left Erastus; from Corinth he proceeded to Troas, where he lodged with Carpus: from Troas he went to Ephesus, where he visited Timothy; from Ephesus he went to Miletus, where he left Trophimus sick; and having embarked at Miletus, he went by sea to Rome. See <i>Calmet</i>. It is most likely, therefore, that the <i>Miletus</i> of Ionia is the place intended.</p>
