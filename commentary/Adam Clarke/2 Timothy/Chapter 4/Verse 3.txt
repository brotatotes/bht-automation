<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:3">2 Timothy 4:3</span>. <i><b>For the time will come</b></i> — There is a time coming to the Church when men will not hear the <i>practical</i> truths of the Gospel, when they will prefer speculative opinions, which either do no good to the soul, or corrupt and destroy it, to that wholesome doctrine of "deny thyself, take up thy cross and follow me," which Jesus Christ has left in his Church.</p>
<p><i><b>But after their own lusts</b></i> — For <i>these</i> they will follow, and hate those <i>preachers</i> and that doctrine by which they are opposed.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall they heap to themselves teachers</b></i> — They will add one teacher to another, run and gad about after all, to find out those who insist not on the necessity of bearing the cross, of being crucified to the world, and of having the mind that was in Jesus. In this disposition interested men often find their account; they set up for teachers, "and widen and strew with flowers the way, down to eternal ruin," taking care to soothe the passions and flatter the vices of a trifling, superficial people.</p>
<p><i><b>Having itching ears</b></i> — Endless curiosity, an insatiable desire of <i>variety</i>; and they get their ears tickled with the <i>language</i> and <i>accent</i> of the person, abandoning the <i>good</i> and <i>faithful preacher</i> for the <i>fine speaker</i>.</p>
