<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:4">2 Timothy 4:4</span>. <i><b>And they shall turn away their ears from the truth</b></i> — The truth strips them of their vices, sacrifices their idols, darts its lightnings against their easily besetting sins, and absolutely requires a conformity to a crucified Christ; therefore <i>they turn their ears away from it</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And shall be turned unto fables.</b></i> — Believe any kind of stuff and nonsense; for, as one has justly observed, "Those who reject the truth are abandoned by the just judgment of God to credit the most degrading nonsense." This is remarkably the case with most deists; their creed often exhibits what is grossly absurd.</p>
