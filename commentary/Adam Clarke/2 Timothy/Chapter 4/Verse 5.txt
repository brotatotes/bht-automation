<p>Verse 5. <i><b>But watch thou in all things</b></i> — It is possible to be overtaken in a fault, to neglect one's duty, and to lose one's soul. Watching unto prayer prevents all these evils.</p>
<p><i><b>Endure afflictions</b></i> — Let no sufferings affright thee; nor let the dread of them either cause thee to abandon the truth, or relax in thy zeal for the salvation of men.</p>
<p><i><b>Do the work of an evangelist</b></i> — That is: Preach Christ crucified for the sins of the whole world; for this, and this alone, is doing the work of an evangelist, or preacher of the glad tidings of peace and salvation by Christ. An angel from God was first sent to do the work of an evangelist, and how did <i>he</i> do it? <i>Behold</i>, said he, <i>I bring you good tidings of great joy</i>; Ιδου γαρ, ευαγγελιζομαι ὑμιν χαραν μεγαλην, ἡτις εσται παντι τῳ λαῳ. <i>Behold, I evangelize unto you great joy, which shall be to all</i> <i>people; to you is born a Saviour</i>. Those who do not proclaim Christ as having tasted death for every man, and who do not implicitly show that every human soul may be saved, do not perform the work of <i>evangelists</i>; they, God help them! limit the Holy One of Israel. Yet, <i>as far</i> as they preach the truth in sincerity, <i>so far</i> God acknowledges and blesses them and their labours; they do a <i>part</i> of the work, but not the <i>whole</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Make full proof of thy ministry.</b></i> — Push all thy principles to their utmost power of activity; carry them on to all their consequences; and try what God will do for thee, and by thee. Neglect no part of thy sacred function; perform faithfully all the duties of which it is composed; and do God's work in his own way and in his own spirit.</p>
