<p>Verse 7. <i><b>I have fought a good fight</b></i> — Every reader will perceive that the apostle, as was his very frequent custom, alludes to the contests at the Grecian games: Τον αγυνα τον καλον ηγωνισμαι· <i>I have wrestled that good wrestling</i>-I have struggled hard, and have over come, in a most honourable cause.</p>
<p><i><b>I have finished</b></i><b> my </b><i><b>course</b></i> — I have started for the prize, and have come up to the goal, outstripping all my competitors, and have gained this prize also.</p>
<p><i><b>I have kept the faith</b></i> — As the <i>laws</i> of these games must be most <i>diligently observed</i> and <i>kept</i>, (for though a man overcome, <i>yet is</i> <i>he not crowned, except he strive lawfully</i>,) so I have <i>kept the</i> <i>rules of the spiritual combat</i> and <i>race</i>; and thus, having contended <i>lawfully</i>, and conquered in each exercise, I have a right to expect the prize.</p>
