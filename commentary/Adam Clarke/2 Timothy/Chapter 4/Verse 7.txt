Verse 7. I have fought a good fight — Every reader will perceive that the apostle, as was his very frequent custom, alludes to the contests at the Grecian games: Τον αγυνα τον καλον ηγωνισμαι· I have wrestled that good wrestling-I have struggled hard, and have over come, in a most honourable cause.I have finished my course — I have started for the prize, and have come up to the goal, outstripping all my competitors, and have gained this prize also.I have kept the faith — As the laws of these games must be most diligently observed and kept, (for though a man overcome, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully,) so I have kept the rules of the spiritual combat and race; and thus, having contended lawfully, and conquered in each exercise, I have a right to expect the prize.
