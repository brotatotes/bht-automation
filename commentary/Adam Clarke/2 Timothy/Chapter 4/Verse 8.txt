Verse 8. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown — This I can claim as my due; but the crown I expect is not one of fading leaves, but a crown of righteousness; the reward which God, in his kindness, has promised to them who are faithful to the grace he has bestowed upon them.The Lord, the righteous Judge — He alludes here to the brabeus, or umpire in the Grecian games, whose office it was to declare the victor, and to give the crown.At that day — The day of judgment; the morning of the resurrection from the dead.Unto all them also that love his appearing. — All who live in expectation of the coming of Christ, who anticipate it with joyfulness, having buried the world and laid up all their hopes above. Here is a reward, but it is a reward not of debt but of grace; for it is by the grace of God that even an apostle is fitted for glory. And this reward is common to the faithful; it is given, not only to apostles, but to all them that love his appearing. This crown is laid up-it is in view, but not in possession. We must die first.I have several times noted the allusions of St. Paul to the Greek poets, and such as seemed to argue that he quoted immediately from them. There is a passage in the Alcestis of Euripides, in which the very expressions used here by the apostle are found, and spoken on the occasion of a wife laying down her life for her husband, when both his parents had refused to do it. See Sophocles and AEschylus, quoted 1 Timothy 6:15.The καλοςαγων, good fight, was used among the Greeks to express a contest of the most honourable kind, and in this sense the apostle uses it.
