<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown</b></i> — This I can claim as my due; but the crown I expect is not one of <i>fading</i> <i>leaves</i>, but a <i>crown of righteousness</i>; the reward which God, in his kindness, has promised to them who are faithful to the grace he has bestowed upon them.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord, the righteous Judge</b></i> — He alludes here to the <i>brabeus</i>, or umpire in the Grecian games, whose office it was to declare the victor, and to give the crown.</p>
<p><i><b>At that day</b></i> — The day of judgment; the morning of the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto all them also that love his appearing.</b></i> — All who live in expectation of the coming of Christ, who anticipate it with joyfulness, having buried the world and laid up all their hopes above. Here is a <i>reward</i>, but it is a reward not of <i>debt</i> but of <i>grace</i>; for it is by the <i>grace</i> of God that even an <i>apostle</i> is <i>fitted</i> for glory. And this reward is <i>common to the faithful</i>; it is given, not only to apostles, but <i>to all them that love his</i> <i>appearing</i>. This crown <i>is laid up</i>-it is <i>in view</i>, but not <i>in</i> <i>possession</i>. We must die first.</p>
<p>I have several times noted the allusions of St. Paul to the Greek poets, and such as seemed to argue that he quoted immediately from them. There is a passage in the <i>Alcestis</i> of <i>Euripides</i>, in which the very expressions used here by the apostle are found, and spoken on the occasion of a wife laying down her life for her husband, when both his parents had refused to do it. </p>
<p>See <i>Sophocles</i> and <i>AEschylus</i>, quoted <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span>.</p>
<p>The καλοςαγων, <i>good fight</i>, was used among the Greeks to express a contest of the <i>most honourable kind</i>, and in this sense the apostle uses it.</p>
