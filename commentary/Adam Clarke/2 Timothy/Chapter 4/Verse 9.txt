<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me</b></i> â€” He appears to have wished Timothy to be present at his death, that he might have his faith confirmed by seeing how a Christian could die; and, as he had but a short time to live, he begs Timothy to <i>hasten his</i> <i>visit</i>, and particularly so as he had scarcely now any companions.</p>
