<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:10">3 John 1:10</span>. <i><b>If I come, I will remember</b></i> — I will show him the authority which, as an apostle of Jesus Christ, I possess.</p>
<p><i><b>Prating against us</b></i> — Diotrephes might have been a <i>converted</i> <i>Jew</i>, who was unwilling that the Gentiles should be received into the Church; or a <i>Judaizing Christian</i>, who wished to incorporate the <i>law</i> with the <i>Gospel</i>, and calumniated the apostles who taught otherwise. This haughty and unfeeling man would give no countenance to the converted Gentiles; so far from it, that he would not receive any of them himself, forbade others to do it, and excommunicated those who had been received into the Church by the apostles. This appears to be the meaning of <i>neither doth he</i> <i>himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and</i> <i>casteth them out of the Church</i>. He had the complete <i>dog in the</i> <i>manger</i> principle: he would neither do, nor let do; and when good was done that he did not approve, he endeavoured to undo it.</p>
