<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:11">3 John 1:11</span>. <i><b>Follow not that which is evil</b></i> — Μμ μιμου το κακον· <i>Do not imitate that wicked man</i>, i.e., the conduct of Diotrephes; be merciful, loving, and kind. For whatever profession any man may make, it will ever appear that <i>he who doeth good is of God</i> - he alone is the person who uses rightly the grace received from God, and he alone shall enjoy the Divine approbation;</p>
<p>While <i><b>he that doeth evil</b></i> — He who is unfeeling, unmerciful, unkind, <i>hath not seen God</i> - has no proper knowledge of that God whose NAME is <i>mercy</i>, and whose NATURE is <i>love</i>.</p>
