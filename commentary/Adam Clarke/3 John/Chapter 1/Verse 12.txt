<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:12">3 John 1:12</span>. <i><b>Demetrius hath good report</b></i> â€” Perhaps another member of the Church where Caius was; or he might have been one of those whom the apostle recommends to Caius; or, possibly, the <i>bearer of</i> <i>this letter</i> from John to Caius. He seems to have been an excellent person: <i>all testified</i> of his righteousness; the <i>truth</i> - Christianity, <i>itself bore testimony</i> to him; and the <i>apostles</i> themselves added theirs also.</p>
