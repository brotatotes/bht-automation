<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:14">3 John 1:14</span>. <i><b>Peace</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>to thee.</b></i> — Mayest thou possess every requisite good, both of a spiritual and temporal kind.</p>
<p>Our <i><b>friends salute thee.</b></i> — Desire to be affectionately remembered to thee. <i>Greet the friends by name</i> - remember me to all those with whom I am acquainted, as if I had specified them by <i>name</i>. This is a proof to me that this epistle was not sent to Corinth, where it is not likely John ever was; and where it is not likely he had any particular acquaintances, unless we could suppose he had seen some of them when he was an exile in Patmos, an island in the AEgean Sea.</p>
<p>For other particulars concerning John, the reader is requested to refer to the preface to his gospel.</p>
<p>Instead of φιλοι and φιλους, <i>friends</i>, the Codex Alexandrinus and several others read αδελφοι and αδελφους, <i>brethren</i>. The former (<i>friends</i>) is a very singular appellation, and nowhere else found in Scripture; the latter is of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>I have already shown in the <i>preface</i> to those epistles termed <i>catholic</i>, that the word καθολικος is not to be taken here, and elsewhere in these epistles, as signifying universal, but <i>canonical</i>; for it would be absurd to call an epistle <i>universal</i> that was written to a private individual.</p>
<p>We seldom hear this epistle quoted but in the reproof of lordly tyrants, or prating troublesome fellows in the Church. And yet the epistle contains many excellent sentiments, which, if judiciously handled, might be very useful to the Church of God. But it has been the lot both of the <i>minor prophets</i> and the <i>minor</i> <i>epistles</i> to be generally neglected; for with many readers <i>bulk</i> is every thing; and, no <i>magnitude</i> no goodness.</p>
<p><i>This and the preceding epistle both read over in reference to a</i> <i>new edition, Jan. 3rd</i>, 1832. - A. C.</p>
