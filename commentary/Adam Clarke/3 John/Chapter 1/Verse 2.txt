<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:2">3 John 1:2</span>. <i><b>I wish above all things</b></i> — περι παντων ευχομαι. <i>Above</i> <i>all things I pray that thou mayest prosper, and be in health</i>, και υγιαινειν. to which one MS. adds εν αληθεια, which gives it a different meaning, viz., <i>that thou mayest be sound in the truth</i>. The prayer of St. John for Caius includes <i>three</i> particulars: 1. Health of body; 2. Health of soul; and 3. Prosperity in secular affairs. <i>That thou mayest</i> PROSPER <i>and be in</i> HEALTH, <i>as thy</i> SOUL PROSPERETH. These <i>three</i> things, so necessary to the comfort of life, every Christian may in a certain measure expect, and for them every Christian is authorized to pray; and we should have more of all three if we devoutly prayed for them.</p>
<p>It appears from the last <i>clause</i> that the soul of Caius was in a very prosperous state.</p>
