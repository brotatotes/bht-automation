<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:5">3 John 1:5</span>. <i><b>Thou doest faithfully</b></i> — πιστον ποιεις. <i>Kypke</i> thinks that πιστον is put here for πιστιν, and that the phrase signifies <i>to keep</i> or <i>preserve the faith</i>, or <i>to be bound by the faith</i>, or <i>to keep one's engagements</i>. <i>Thou hast acted as the faith</i>-the Christian religion, <i>required thee to act, in all that thou hast</i> <i>done, both to the brethren</i> at home, <i>and to the strangers</i>-the itinerant evangelists, who, in the course of their travels, have called at thy house. There is not a word here about the <i>pilgrims</i> and <i>penitential journeys</i> which the papists contrive to bring out of this text.</p>
