<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:7">3 John 1:7</span>. <i><b>For his name's sake they went forth</b></i> — For the sake of preaching the Gospel of the grace of God, and making known JESUS to the heathen.</p>
<p><i><b>Taking nothing of the Gentiles.</b></i> — Receiving no emolument for their labour, but in every respect showing themselves to be truly disinterested. Sometimes, and on some special occasions, this may be necessary; but <i>the labourer is worthy of his hire</i> is the maxim of the author of Christianity. And those congregations of Christians are ever found to prize the Gospel most, and profit most by it, who <i>bear all expenses incident to it</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>But some construe εξηλθον, <i>they went out</i>, with αποτωνεθνων, <i>from the Gentiles</i>, or rather <i>by the Gentiles</i>, and give the passage this sense: <i>They went out</i>, i.e., were <i>driven out by the Gentiles,</i> <i>taking nothing with them</i>, i.e., leaving all their property behind, so that they were in a state of great destitution. A curious reading here, εθνικων, <i>heathenish men</i>, for εθνων, Gentiles, which latter might imply those who were converted from among the Gentiles, while the sense of the other term seems to be restrained to those who were still <i>unconverted</i>, may seem to strengthen the above interpretation; and although the construction seems rather harsh, yet it is not, on the whole, unlikely. The reading above referred to is that of the most ancient and reputable MSS. That <i>to be driven out</i> or <i>expelled</i> is one scriptural meaning of the verb εξερχομαι, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:32">Matthew 8:32</span>: <i>And when they were come out</i>, οι δε εξελθοντεςς, <i>and when they were</i> DRIVEN OUT. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:43">Matthew 12:43</span>: <i>When the unclean spirit is gone out</i>, εξελθη, <i>is</i> DRIVEN OUT. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:13">Mark 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:29">Mark 7:29</span>: <i>The devil is gone out of thy daughter</i>, εξεληλυθε, <i>is</i> EXPELLED. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:29">Mark 9:29</span>: <i>This kind can come forth by nothing</i> εν ουδενι δυναται εξελθειν, <i>can be</i> DRIVEN OUT <i>by nothing, but by prayer and fasting</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:2">Luke 8:2</span>: <i>Mary Magdalene; out of whom went</i>, αφ ης δαιμονια επτα εξεληλυθει, <i>out of whom were</i> CAST, <i>seven demons</i>.
