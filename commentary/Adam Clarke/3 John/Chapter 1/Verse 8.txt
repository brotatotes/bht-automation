<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:8">3 John 1:8</span>. <i><b>We therefore ought to receive such</b></i> — Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, and have professed the truth at the hazard of their lives, and the loss of all their worldly substance. Instead of απολαμβανειν, <i>to receive</i>, the most ancient and reputable MSS. have υπολαμβανειν, <i>to take up, undertake for</i>, or <i>kindly receive</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Fellow helpers to the truth</b></i> — And thus encourage the persecuted, and contribute to the spread and maintenance of the Gospel.</p>
