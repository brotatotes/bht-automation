Verse 3 John 1:8. We therefore ought to receive such — Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, and have professed the truth at the hazard of their lives, and the loss of all their worldly substance. Instead of απολαμβανειν, to receive, the most ancient and reputable MSS. have υπολαμβανειν, to take up, undertake for, or kindly receive.Fellow helpers to the truth — And thus encourage the persecuted, and contribute to the spread and maintenance of the Gospel.
