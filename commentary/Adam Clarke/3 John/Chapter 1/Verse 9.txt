<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:9">3 John 1:9</span>. <i><b>I wrote unto the Church.</b></i> — The Church where Caius was; <i>but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence</i>, φιλοπρωτευων, <i>who loves the presidency</i>, or <i>chief place</i> in the Church. He was doubtless an officer in the Church, at least a deacon, probably a bishop; and, being one, he magnified himself in his office; he loved such eminence, and behaved himself haughtily in it.</p>
<p><i><b>Receiveth us not.</b></i> — Does not acknowledge the apostolical authority. As some MSS. supply αν after εγραψα, and several judicious critics believe it is implied, the translation will run thus: <i>I would have written to the Church</i> to receive these men kindly, <i>but Diotrephes, who affects the presidency</i>; and into whose hands, if I wrote to the Church, my letter must come, <i>receiveth us</i> <i>not</i>-would not acknowledge my authority to interfere with any of the matters of his Church; and therefore I have written unto thee, whose love to the brethren and general hospitality are well known, that thou wouldst receive those strangers and persecuted followers of our common Lord.</p>
