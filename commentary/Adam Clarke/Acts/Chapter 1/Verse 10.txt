<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:10">Acts 1:10</span>. <i><b>Looked steadfastly</b></i> — Keeping their eyes intensely fixed on their ascending Lord; continuing to look even after he had ascended above the region of the inferior clouds.</p>
<p><i><b>Two men stood by them</b></i> — Doubtless, <i>angels</i> in human shape.</p>
<p><i><b>In white apparel</b></i> — As emblematical of their <i>purity, happiness</i>, and <i>glory</i>.</p>
