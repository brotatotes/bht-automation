<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>. <i><b>Gazing up into heaven</b></i> — Not to the top of a mountain, to which an unbridled fancy, influenced by infidelity, would intimate he had ascended, and not to heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>This same Jesus</b></i> — Clothed in human nature. <i>shall so come in like</i> <i>manner</i>-with the same body, <i>descending</i> from heaven by his sovereign and all-controlling power, <i>as ye have seen him go into heaven</i>. Thus shall he come again to judge the quick and the dead. It was a very ancient opinion among Christians, that when Christ should come again to judge the world he would make his appearance on Mount <i>Olivet</i>. Some think that his coming again to destroy the Jewish nation is what the angels refer to. See a connected account of the different appearances of Christ at the end of this chapter.</p>
