<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12">Acts 1:12</span>. <i><b>A Sabbath day's journey.</b></i> â€” See the difficulties in this verse explained in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span><i>"</i>. A Sabbath day's journey was <i>seven furlongs and a half</i>. Olivet was but <i>five</i> furlongs from Jerusalem; and Bethany was <i>fifteen</i>. The first region or tract of Mount Olivet, which was called <i>Bethany</i>, was distant from the city a Sabbath day's journey, or seven furlongs and a half; and the same distance did that tract called <i>Bethphage</i> extend from the city. When, therefore; our Lord came to the place where these two tracts touched each other, he there ascended, which place was distant from Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey, as St. Luke here remarks. See the notes referred to above.</p>
