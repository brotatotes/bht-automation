<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:13">Acts 1:13</span>. <i><b>They went up into an upper room</b></i> — This was either a room in the <i>temple</i>, or in the house of one of the disciples, where this holy company was accustomed to meet. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:53">Luke 24:53</span>, it is said that, after their return from Mount Olivet, <i>they were continually</i> <i>in the temple, praising and blessing God</i>: it is probable, therefore, that the <i>upper room</i> mentioned in this verse is that apartment of the temple mentioned above. But still it is not certain that this place should be so understood; as we have the fullest proofs that the <i>upper rooms</i> in private houses were used for the purpose of reading the law, and conferring together on religious matters. See several proofs in <i>Lightfoot</i>. Add to this, that the room here mentioned seems to have been the place where all the apostles lodged, ου ησαν καταμενοντες, and therefore most probably a <i>private house</i>.</p>
