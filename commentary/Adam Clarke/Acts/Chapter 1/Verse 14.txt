<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span>. <i><b>These - continued - in prayer and supplication</b></i> — Waiting for the promise of the Father, according to the direction of our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span>. The words και τη δεησει, <i>and in supplication</i>, are omitted by ABC*DE, both the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala</i>, and some of the primitive fathers. On this evidence, <i>Griesbach</i> has left them out of the text; and others contend for the propriety of this <i>omission</i>, because, say they, τη προσευχη and τη δεησει, <i>prayer and</i> <i>supplication, mean the same thing</i>. Whether the reading be <i>genuine</i> or <i>spurious</i>, this inference is not just. <i>Prayer</i> may simply imply any address to God, in the way of <i>petition</i> or <i>request; supplication</i>, the earnest, affectionate, and continued application to God for the blessing requested from him by prayer. <i>Prayer</i> asks, <i>supplication</i> expostulates, entreats, urges and re-urges the petition.</p>
<p><i><b>With the women</b></i> — Probably those who had been witnesses of his resurrection, with the immediate relatives of the apostles. Peter we know was married, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span>, and so might others of the disciples; and therefore the wives of the apostles, as well as of other pious men, may be here intended.</p>
