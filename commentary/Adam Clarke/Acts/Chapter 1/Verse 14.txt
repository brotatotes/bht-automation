Verse Acts 1:14. These - continued - in prayer and supplication — Waiting for the promise of the Father, according to the direction of our Lord, Luke 24:49. The words και τη δεησει, and in supplication, are omitted by ABC*DE, both the Syriac, the Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala, and some of the primitive fathers. On this evidence, Griesbach has left them out of the text; and others contend for the propriety of this omission, because, say they, τη προσευχη and τη δεησει, prayer and supplication, mean the same thing. Whether the reading be genuine or spurious, this inference is not just. Prayer may simply imply any address to God, in the way of petition or request; supplication, the earnest, affectionate, and continued application to God for the blessing requested from him by prayer. Prayer asks, supplication expostulates, entreats, urges and re-urges the petition.With the women — Probably those who had been witnesses of his resurrection, with the immediate relatives of the apostles. Peter we know was married, Matthew 8:14, and so might others of the disciples; and therefore the wives of the apostles, as well as of other pious men, may be here intended.
