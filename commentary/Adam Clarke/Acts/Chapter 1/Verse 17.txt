Verse Acts 1:17. Obtained part of this ministry. — ελαχε τον κληρον, He obtained the lot of this ministry-not that he or any of the twelve apostles, was chosen to this ministry by lot, but as lot signifies the portion a man has in life, what comes to him in the course of the Divine providence, or as an especial gift of God's goodness, it is used here, as in many other parts of the sacred writings, to signify office or station. On this subject the reader is referred to on Leviticus 16:8, Leviticus 16:9 (note); Joshua 14:2 (note): see also Acts 1:26 (note).
