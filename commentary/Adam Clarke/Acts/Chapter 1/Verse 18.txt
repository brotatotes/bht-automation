<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>. <i><b>Purchased a field with the reward of iniquity</b></i> — Probably Judas did not purchase the field himself, but the money for which he sold his Lord was thus applied, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:6-8">Matthew 27:6-8</span>. It is possible, however, that he might have designed to purchase a field or piece of ground with this reward of his iniquity, and might have been in treaty far it, though he did not close the bargain, as his bringing the money to the treasury proves: the priests, knowing his intentions, might have completed the purchase, and, as Judas was now dead, applied the field thus bought for the burial of <i>strangers</i>, i.e. Jews from foreign parts, or others who, visiting Jerusalem, had died there. Though this case is possible, yet the passage will bear a very consistent interpretation without the assistant of this conjecture; for, in ordinary conversation, we often attribute to a man what is the <i>consequence</i> of his own actions, though such consequence was never designed nor wished for by himself: thus we say of a man embarking in a hazardous enterprise, <i>he is gone to seek his death</i>; of one whose conduct has been ruinous to his reputation, <i>he has disgraced himself</i>; of another who has suffered much in consequence of his crimes, <i>he has</i> <i>purchased repentance at a high price</i>, c., &amp;c. All these, though <i>undesigned</i>, were <i>consequences</i> of certain acts, as the <i>buying of</i> <i>the yield</i> was the consequence of Judas's treason.</p>
