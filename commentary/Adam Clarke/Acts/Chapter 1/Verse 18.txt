Verse Acts 1:18. Purchased a field with the reward of iniquity — Probably Judas did not purchase the field himself, but the money for which he sold his Lord was thus applied, see Matthew 27:6-8. It is possible, however, that he might have designed to purchase a field or piece of ground with this reward of his iniquity, and might have been in treaty far it, though he did not close the bargain, as his bringing the money to the treasury proves: the priests, knowing his intentions, might have completed the purchase, and, as Judas was now dead, applied the field thus bought for the burial of strangers, i.e. Jews from foreign parts, or others who, visiting Jerusalem, had died there. Though this case is possible, yet the passage will bear a very consistent interpretation without the assistant of this conjecture; for, in ordinary conversation, we often attribute to a man what is the consequence of his own actions, though such consequence was never designed nor wished for by himself: thus we say of a man embarking in a hazardous enterprise, he is gone to seek his death; of one whose conduct has been ruinous to his reputation, he has disgraced himself; of another who has suffered much in consequence of his crimes, he has purchased repentance at a high price, c., &c. All these, though undesigned, were consequences of certain acts, as the buying of the yield was the consequence of Judas's treason.And falling headlong, he burst asunder — It is very likely that the 18th and 19th verses Acts 1:18 Acts 1:19 are not the words of Peter, but of the historian, St. Luke, and should be read in a parenthesis, and then the 17th and 20th verses Acts 1:17; Acts 1:20 will make a connected sense. (ln the case of Judas, and the manner of his death, see the observations at the end of this chapter. Acts 1:26; Acts 1:26.
