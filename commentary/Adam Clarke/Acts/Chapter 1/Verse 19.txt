Verse Acts 1:19. It was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem — The repentance of Judas, his dying testimony in behalf of our Lord's innocence, and his tragical death, were publicly known, as was also the transaction about the purchase of the field, and hence arose the name by which at was publicly known. These circumstances must have lessened the credit of the chief priests, and have prepared the public mind to receive the Gospel of the kingdom, when preached to them after the day of pentecost.That field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama — This proper tongue was not the Hebrew; that had long ceased to be the proper tongue in Palestine: it was a sort of Chaldaio-Syriac which was commonly spoken. The word in the Syriac version is [Syriac] chacal-demo, and literally signifies the field of blood; because it was bought by the price of the life or blood of the Lord Jesus.
