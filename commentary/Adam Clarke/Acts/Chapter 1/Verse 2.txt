<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span>. <i><b>After that he, through the Holy Ghost</b></i>, c.] This clause has been variously translated: the simple meaning seems to be this-that Christ communicated the Holy Spirit to his disciples, after his resurrection, as he had not done before. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:45">Luke 24:45</span>, it is said that <i>he opened their understanding, that they might</i> <i>understand the Scriptures</i> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:22">John 20:22</span>, that <i>he breathed on them</i>, and said, <i>receive ye the Holy Ghost</i>. Previously to this, we may suppose that the disciples were only on particular occasions made partakers of the Holy Spirit; but from this time it is probable that they had a measure of this supernatural light and power <i>constantly resident</i> in them. By this they were not only able to proclaim the truth, but to discern the meaning of all the Old Testament Scriptures which referred to Christ; and to appoint whatever rites or ordinances were necessary for the establishment of his Church. There were many things which the apostles <i>said, did</i>, and <i>decreed</i>, for which they had no verbal instructions from our Lord, at least, none that are recorded in the Gospels; we may therefore conclude that these were suggested to them by that Holy Spirit which now became resident in them, and that it is to this that St. Luke refers in this verse, <i>After that</i> <i>he, through the Holy Ghost, had given commandments unto the</i> <i>apostles</i>.</p>
