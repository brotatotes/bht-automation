<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:20">Acts 1:20</span>. <i><b>For it is written in the book of Psalms</b></i> — The places usually referred to are <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:25">Psalms 69:25</span>: <i>Let their habitation be desolate</i>, and <i>let none dwell in their</i> <i>tents</i>. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:8">Psalms 109:8</span>: <i>Let his days be few</i>, and <i>let another take his office</i>, פקדתו pekudato, his <i>overseership</i>, his <i>charge of visitation</i> or <i>superintendence</i>, translated by the SEPTUAGINT, την επισκοπην, VULGATE, <i>episcopatum</i>; and WE, following both, <i>bishopric</i>, but not with sufficient propriety, for surely the office or charge of Judas was widely different from what we call <i>bishopric</i>, the diocess, estate, and emoluments of a bishop. επισκοπος, <i>episcopos</i>, which was corrupted by our Saxon ancestors into [Anglo-Saxon], <i>biscop</i>, and by us into <i>bishop</i>, signifies literally an <i>overseer</i> or <i>superintendent</i>, from επι, <i>over</i>, and σκεπτομαι, <i>I see</i>, a person who had the <i>inspection, overseeing</i>, or <i>superintendence</i> of others. The ancient επισκοποι were persons who had the care of different congregations of the Church of Christ; who travelled, preached, enforced the discipline of the Church, and took care to prevent false doctrines, heresies, c. Those who still deserve this title, and it is an august and noble one, walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing. επισκοπος, <i>episcopus</i>, or <i>bishop</i>, is a scriptural and sacred title was gloriously supported in the primitive Church; and many to the present day are not less ornaments to the title, than the title is ornamental to them.

<p>The words quoted from the <i>Psalms</i> were originally spoken against the enemies of David; and as David, in certain particulars, was a type of Christ, the words are applied to <i>him</i> in an especial manner who had sinned against his own soul and the life of his Master.</p>
