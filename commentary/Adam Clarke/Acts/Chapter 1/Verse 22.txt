<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>. <i><b>Beginning from the baptism of John</b></i> — From the time that Christ was baptized by John in Jordan; for it was at that time that his public ministry properly began.</p>
<p><i><b>Must one be ordained</b></i> — This translation misleads every reader who cannot examine the original text. There is no term for <i>ordained</i> in the Greek: γενεσθαι, <i>to be</i>, is the only word in the verse to which this interpretation can be applied. The New Testament printed at London, by Robert Barker, the king's printer, in 1615, renders this and the preceding verse more faithfully and more clearly than our common version: <i>Wherefore of these men who have companied with</i> <i>us, all the time that the Lord Jesus was conversant among us,</i> <i>beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day he was taken up</i> <i>from us, must one of them BE MADE a witness with us of his</i> <i>resurrection</i>. The word <i>ordained</i> would naturally lead most readers to suppose that some ecclesiastical <i>rite</i> was used on the occasion, such as <i>imposition of hands</i>, &amp;c., although nothing of the kind appears to have been employed.</p>
