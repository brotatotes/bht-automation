<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>. <i><b>Thou Lord, which knowest the hearts</b></i> — Συ, κυριε, καρδιογνωστα. The word καρδιογνωστης, <i>the searcher of hearts</i>, seems to be used here as an <i>attribute</i> of God; he <i>knows the hearts</i>, the most <i>secret purposes, intentions</i>, and <i>dispositions</i> of all men; and because he is the <i>knower of hearts</i>, he knew which of these men he had qualified the best, by <i>natural</i> and <i>gracious dispositions</i> and <i>powers</i>, for the important work to which one of them was now to be appointed.</p>
