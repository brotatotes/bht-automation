<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>. <i><b>That he may take part of this ministry</b></i>, c.] Instead of τον κληρον, <i>the lot</i>, which we translate <i>part</i>, τον τοπον, <i>the place</i>, is the reading of ABC*, <i>Coptic, Vulgate</i>, and the <i>Itala</i> in the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, and from them the verse may be read thus, <i>That he may take the place of this ministry and apostleship,</i> <i>(from which Judas fell) and go to his own place</i> but instead of ιδιον, <i>own</i>, the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, and one of Matthai's MSS., read δικαιον, <i>just</i>-that <i>he might go to his just</i> or proper <i>place</i>.</p>
<p>This verse has been variously expounded:</p>
<p>1. Some suppose that the words, <i>that he might go to his own place</i>, are spoken of Judas, and his punishment in <i>hell</i>, which they say must be the <i>own place</i> of such a person as Judas.</p>
<p>2. Others refer them to the purchase of the field, made by the thirty pieces of silver for which he had sold our Lord. So he abandoned <i>the ministry and apostolate, that he might go to his own</i> <i>place</i>, viz. that which he had purchased.</p>
<p>3. Others, with more seeming propriety, state that his <i>own place</i> means his <i>own house</i>, or <i>former occupation</i>; he left this ministry and apostleship that he might resume his former employment in conjunction with his family, c. This is primarily the meaning of it in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:25">Numbers 24:25</span>: <i>And Balaam returned to HIS OWN PLACE</i>, i.e. to his own country, friends, and employment.</p>
<p>4. Others think it simply means the <i>state of the dead</i> in general, independently of either <i>rewards</i> or <i>punishments</i> as is probably meant by <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ec+3:20">Ecclesiastes 3:20</span>: <i>All go unto ONE PLACE: all are of the dust, and all turn to dust</i> <i>again</i>.</p>
<p>But, 5. Some of the best critics assert that the words (as before hinted) belong to Matthias-<i>his own place</i> being the office to which he was about to be elected. Should any object, this could not be called <i>his own place</i>, because he was not yet <i>appointed</i> to it, but <i>hell</i> might be properly called Judas's own place, because, by treason and covetousness, he was fully prepared for that place of torment, it may be answered, that the <i>own</i> or proper <i>place</i> of a man is that for which he is <i>eligible</i> from being qualified for it, though he may not yet possess such a place: so St. Paul, <i>Every man</i> <i>shall receive HIS OWN reward</i>, τονιδιονμισθον, called there <i>his</i> <i>own</i>, not from his <i>having</i> it already in <i>possession</i>, for that was not to take place until the resurrection of the just; but from his being <i>qualified</i> in this life for the state of glory in the other.
