<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:26">Acts 1:26</span>. <i><b>They gave forth their lots</b></i> — In what manner this or any other question was decided by lot, we cannot precisely say. The most simple form was to put two <i>stones</i>, pieces of <i>board, metal</i>, or <i>slips</i> of <i>parchment</i>, with the names of the persons inscribed on them, into an urn; and after prayer, sacrifice, c., to put in the hand and draw out one of the lots, and then the case was decided. I have considered this subject at large on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:8">Leviticus 16:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:9">Leviticus 16:9</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+14:2">Joshua 14:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>He was numbered with the eleven apostles.</b></i> — The word συγκατεψηφισθη, comes from συν, <i>together with</i>, κατα, <i>according to</i>, and ψηφος, a <i>pebble</i> or <i>small stone</i>, used for <i>lots</i>, and as a means of <i>enumeration</i> among the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians; hence the words <i>calculate, calculation</i>, c., from <i>calculus</i>, a small stone or pebble. From this use of the word, though it signifies in general <i>to sum up, associate</i>, c., we may conjecture that the calculus or pebble was used on this occasion. The brethren agreed that the matter should be determined by lot the lots were cast into the urn God was entreated to direct the choice; one drew out a lot; the person whose name was inscribed on it was thereby declared to be the object of God's choice, and accordingly associated with the disciples. But it is possible that the whole was decided by what we commonly call <i>ballot</i>, God inclining the hearts of the majority to ballot for Matthias. Nothing <i>certain</i> can, however, be stated on this head. Thus the number <i>twelve</i> was made up, that these might be the <i>fountains</i> under God of the whole <i>Christian Church</i>, as the <i>twelve</i> sons of Jacob had been of the <i>Jewish Church</i>. For it has already been remarked that our Lord formed his Church on the model of the Jewish. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span></span>, c. As the Holy Ghost, on the day of pentecost, was to descend upon them and endue them with power from on high, it was necessary that the number <i>twelve</i> should be filled up previously, that the newly elected person might also be made partaker of the heavenly gift. How long it was found necessary to keep up the number twelve, we are not informed: the original number was soon broken by persecution and death.</p>
<p>ON the death of Judas there is a great diversity of opinion among learned men and divines.</p>
<p>1. It is supposed, following the bare letter of the text, that Judas <i>hanged himself</i>, and that, the rope breaking, he fell down, was burst with the fall, and thus <i>his bowels gushed out</i>.</p>
<p>2. That, having hanged himself, he was thrown on the <i>dunghill</i>, and, the carcass becoming putrid, the abdomen, which soonest yields to putrefaction burst, and the bowels were thus shed from the body, and possibly torn out by dogs.</p>
<p>3. That, being filled with horror and despair, he went to the top of the house, or to some eminences and threw himself down and thus, <i>failing headlong</i>, his body was broken by the fall, and <i>his</i> <i>bowels gushed out</i>.</p>
<p>4. That Satan, having entered into him, caught him up in the air, and thence precipitated him to the earth; and thus, his body being broken to pieces, <i>his bowels gushed out</i>. This is Dr. Lightfoot's opinion, and has been noticed on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span>.</p>
<p>5. Others think that he died or was <i>suffocated</i> through excessive <i>grief</i>; and that thus the terms in the text, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span>, are to be understood. The late Mr. <i>Wakefield</i> defends this meaning with great learning and ingenuity.</p>
<p>6. Others suppose the expressions to be figurative: Judas having been <i>highly exalted</i>, in being an apostle, and even the <i>purse-bearer</i> to his Lord and brother disciples, by his treason forfeited this honour, and is represented as <i>falling</i> from a state of the <i>highest dignity</i> into the <i>lowest infamy</i>, and then dying through excessive grief. The Rev. <i>John Jones</i>, in his <i>Illustrations</i> <i>of the four Gospels</i>, sums up this opinion thus: "So sensible became the traitor of the distinguished rank which he forfeited, and of the deep disgrace into which he precipitated himself, by betraying his Master, that he was seized with such violent grief as occasioned the rupture of his bowels, and ended in suffocation and death." P. 571.</p>
<p>After the most mature consideration of this subject, on which I hesitated to form an opinion in the note, <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span></span>, I think the following observations may lead to a proper knowledge of the most probable state of the case. 1. Judas, like many others, thought that the kingdom of the Messiah would be a <i>secular</i> kingdom; and that his own secular interests must be promoted by his attachment to Christ. Of this mind all the disciples seem to have been, previously to the resurrection of Christ. 2. From long observation of his Master's conduct, he was now convinced that he intended to erect no such kingdom; and that consequently the expectations which he had built on the contrary supposition must be ultimately disappointed. 3. Being <i>poor</i> and <i>covetous</i>, and finding there was no likelihood of his profiting by being a disciple of Christ, he formed the resolution (probably at the instigation of the chief priests) of betraying him for a sum of money sufficient to purchase a small inheritance, on which he had already cast his eye. 4. Well knowing the uncontrollable power of his Master, he might take it for granted that, though betrayed, he would extricate himself from their hands; and that they would not be capable of putting him either to <i>pain</i> or <i>death</i>. 5. That having betrayed him, and finding that he did not exert his power to deliver himself out of the hands of the Jews, and seeing, from their implacable malice, that the murder of his most innocent Master was likely to be the consequence, he was struck with deep compunction at his own conduct, went to the chief priests, confessed his own profligacy, proclaimed the innocence of his Master, and returned the money for which he had betrayed him; probably hoping that they might be thus influenced to proceed no farther in this unprincipled business, and immediately dismiss Christ. 8. Finding that this made no impression upon them, from their own words, <i>What is that to us? See thou to that,</i> and that they were determined to put Jesus to death, seized with horror at his crime and its consequences, the remorse and agitation of his mind produced a violent dysentery, attended with powerful inflammation; (which, in a great variety of cases, has been brought on by strong mental agitation;) and while the distressful <i>irritation</i> of his bowels obliged him to withdraw for relief, he was overwhelmed with grief and affliction, and, having fallen from the <i>seat</i>, his bowels were found to have gushed out, through the strong spasmodic affections with which the disease was accompanied. I have known cases of this kind, where the bowels appeared to come literally away by piece meal.</p>
<p>Now; when we consider that the word απηγξατο, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span>, which we translate <i>hanged himself</i>, is by the very best critics thus rendered, <i>was choked</i>, and that the words of the sacred historian in this place, <i>falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst,</i> <i>and all his bowels gushed out</i>, may be no other than a <i>delicate</i> mode of expressing the circumstance to which I have alluded under observation 6, perhaps this way of reconciling and explaining the evangelist and historian will appear, not only probable, but the most likely. To strengthen this interpretation, a few facts may be adduced of deaths brought about in the same way with that in which I suppose Judas to have perished. The death of <i>Jehoram</i> is thus related, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+21:18-19">2 Chronicles 21:18-19</span> : <i>And after all this, the Lord smote him in his bowels with an</i> <i>incurable disease: and it came to pass that, after the end of two</i> <i>years, HIS BOWELS FELL OUT, by reason of his sickness; so he died</i> <i>of sore diseases</i>; בתחלאים bethachaluim, with <i>inflammations</i>, or <i>ulcers</i>. The death of <i>Herod</i> was probably of the same kind, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:23">Acts 12:23</span>. That of <i>Aristobulus</i>, as described by Josephus, WAR, book i. chap. 3, is of a similar nature. Having murdered his mother and brother, his mind was greatly terrified, and his bowels being <i>torn with</i> <i>excruciating torments, he voided much blood</i>, and died in miserable agonies. Again, in his ANTIQ. book xv. chap. 10., sect. 3, he thus describes the death of <i>Zenodorus</i>: "His <i>bowels bursting</i>, and his strength exhausted by the <i>loss of much blood</i>, he died at Antioch in Syria."</p>
<p>Taking it for granted that the death of Judas was <i>probably</i> such as related above, collating all the facts and evidences together, can any hope be formed that he died <i>within the reach of mercy</i>? Let us review the whole of these transactions.</p>
<p>I. It must be allowed that his crime was <i>one</i> of the most inexcusable ever committed by man: nevertheless, it has some <i>alleviations</i>.</p>
<p>1. It is possible that he did not think his Master <i>could be hurt</i> by the Jews.</p>
<p>2. When he found that he did not use his power to extricate himself from their hands, he deeply relented that he had betrayed him.</p>
<p>3. He gave every evidence of the <i>sincerity</i> of his repentance, by going openly to the Jewish rulers:</p>
<p>(1.) Confessing his own guilt;</p>
<p>(2.) asserting the innocence of Christ;</p>
<p>(3.) returning the money which he had received from them; and there</p>
<p>(4.) the genuineness of his regret was proved by its being the cause of his death.</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>II. Judas might have acted a much <i>worse</i> part than he did:</p>
<p>1. By <i>persisting</i> in his wickedness.</p>
<p>2. By slandering the character of our Lord both to the Jewish rulers and to the Romans; and, had he done so, his testimony would have been credited, and our Lord would then have been put to death as a <i>malefactor, on the</i> <i>testimony of one of his own disciples</i>; and thus the character of Christ and his Gospel must have suffered extremely in the sight of the world, and these very circumstances would have been pleaded against the authenticity of the Christian religion by every infidel in all succeeding ages. And,</p>
<p>3. Had he persisted in his evil way, he might have lighted such a flame of persecution against the infant cause of Christianity as must, without the intervention of God, have ended in its total destruction: now, he neither did, nor endeavoured to do, any of these things. In other cases these would be powerful pleadings.</p>
<p>Judas was indisputably a <i>bad man</i>; but he might have been <i>worse</i>: we may plainly see that there were <i>depths of wickedness</i> to which he might have proceeded, and which were prevented by his repentance. Thus things appear to stand previously to his end. But is there any room for <i>hope</i> in his <i>death</i>? In answer to this it must be understood,</p>
<p>1. That there is presumptive evidence that he did not <i>destroy himself</i>; and,</p>
<p>2. That his repentance was sincere.</p>
<p>If so, was it not possible for the mercy of God to extend even to his case? It did so to the murderers of the Son of God; and they were certainly <i>worse</i> men (strange as this assertion may appear) than Judas. Even <i>he</i> gave them the fullest proof of Christ's innocence: their buying the field with the money Judas threw down was the full proof of it; and yet, with every convincing evidence before them, they crucified our Lord. They excited Judas to betray his Master, and crucified him when they had got him into their power; and therefore St. Stephen calls <i>them</i> both the <i>betrayers and</i> <i>murderers of that Just One</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:52">Acts 7:52</span>: in these respects they were more deeply criminal than Judas himself; yet even to those very betrayers and murderers Peter preaches <i>repentance</i>, with the promise of <i>remission of sins</i>, and the gift of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:12-26">Acts 3:12-26</span>.</p>
<p>If, then, <i>these</i> were within the reach of mercy, and we are informed that <i>a</i> <i>great company of the priests became obedient to the faith</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>, then certainly Judas was not in such a state as precluded the <i>possibility</i> of his salvation. Surely the blood of the covenant could wash out even <i>his</i> stain, as it did that more <i>deeply engrained</i> one of the other betrayers and murderers of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Should the 25th verse be urged against this <i>possibility</i>, because it is there said that Judas <i>fell from his ministry and</i> <i>apostleship, that he might go to his own place</i>, and that this <i>place</i> is <i>hell</i>; I answer,</p>
<p>1. It remains to be proved that this <i>place</i> means <i>hell</i>; and,</p>
<p>2. It is not clear that the words are spoken of <i>Judas</i> at all, but of <i>Matthias: his own place</i> meaning that vacancy in the apostolate to which he was then elected. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span></span>.</p>
<p>To say that the repentance of Judas was merely the effect of his <i>horror</i>; that it did not spring from compunction of <i>heart</i>; that it vas <i>legal</i>, and not <i>evangelical</i>, c., c., is saying what none can with propriety say, but God himself, who searches the heart. What renders his case most desperate are the words of our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span>: <i>Wo unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It had been</i> <i>good for that man if he had not been born</i>! I have considered this saying in a <i>general</i> point of view in my note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span> and, were it not a <i>proverbial</i> form of speech among the Jews, to express the state of any <i>flagrant</i> transgressor, I should be led to apply it in all its <i>literal</i> import to the case of Judas, as I have done, in the above note, to the case of <i>any</i> damned soul but when I find that it was a proverbial saying, and that it has been used in many cases where the fixing of the irreversible doom of a sinner is not implied, it may be capable of a more favourable interpretation than what is generally given to it. I shall produce a few of those examples from <i>Schoettgen</i>, to which I have referred in my note, <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span></span>.</p>
<p>In CHAGIGAH, fol. ii. 2, it is said: "Whoever considers these four things, <i>it would have been better for him had he never come</i> <i>into the world</i>, viz. That which is <i>above</i>-that which is <i>below</i>-that which is <i>before</i>-and that which is <i>behind</i>; and whosoever does not attend to the honour of his Creator, <i>it were better for him had he</i> <i>never been born</i>."</p>
<p>In SHEMOTH RABBA, sect. 40, fol. 135, 1, 2, it is said: "Whosoever knows the law, and does not do it, <i>it had been better</i> <i>for him had he never come into the world</i>."</p>
<p>In VIYIKRA RABBA, sect. 36, fol. 179, 4, and MIDRASH COHELETH, fol. 91, 4, it is thus expressed: "<i>It were better for him had he</i> <i>never been created</i>; and <i>it would have been better for him had he</i> <i>been strangled in the womb, and never have seen the light of this</i> <i>world</i>."</p>
<p>In SOHAR GENES. fol. 71, col. 282, it is said: "If any man be parsimonious towards the poor, <i>it had been better for him had he</i> <i>never came into the world</i>." <i>Ibid</i>. fol. 84, col. 333: "If any performs the law, not for the sake of the law, <i>it were good for</i> <i>that man had he never been created</i>." These examples sufficiently prove that this was a common proverb, and is used with a great variety and latitude of meaning, and seems intended to show that the case of such and such persons was not only very deplorable, but extremely dangerous; but does not imply the positive impossibility either of their repentance or salvation.</p>
<p>The utmost that can be said for the case of Judas is this he committed a heinous act of sin and ingratitude; but he repented, and did what he could to undo his wicked act: he had committed the sin unto death, i.e. a sin that involves the death of the body; but who can say (if mercy was offered to Christ's murderers, and the Gospel was first to be preached at Jerusalem that <i>these</i> very murderers might have the first offer of salvation through him whom they had pierced) that the same mercy could not be extended to the wretched Judas? I contend that the chief priests, c., who instigated Judas to deliver up his Master, and who crucified him-and who crucified him too as a <i>malefactor</i>-having at the same time the most indubitable evidence of his <i>innocence</i>, were <i>worse</i> men than Judas Iscariot himself and that, if mercy was extended to those, the wretched penitent traitor did not die out of the reach of the yearning of its bowels. And I contend, farther, that there is no positive evidence of the final damnation of Judas in the sacred text.</p>
<p>I hope it will not displease the <i>humane</i> reader that I have entered so deeply into the consideration of this most deplorable case. I would not set up knowingly any plea against the <i>claims</i> of <i>justice</i>; and God forbid that a <i>sinner</i> should be found capable of pleading against the <i>cries of mercy</i> in behalf of a fellow culprit! Daily, innumerable cases occur of persons who are betraying the cause of God, and selling, in effect, Christ and their souls for money. Every <i>covetous</i> man, who is living for this world alone, is of this stamp. And yet, while they live, we do not despair of their salvation, though they are continually repeating the sin of Judas, with all its guilt and punishment before their eyes! Reader! learn from thy Lord this lesson, <i>Blessed are the merciful,</i> <i>for they shall obtain mercy</i>. The case is before the Judge, and the Judge of all the earth will do right.</p>
