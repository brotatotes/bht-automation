Verse Acts 1:3. To whom - he showed himself alive - by many infallible proofs] πολλοιςτεκμηριοις; by many proofs of such a nature, and connected with such circumstances, as to render them indubitable; for this is the import of the Greek word τεκμηριον. The proofs were such as these:1. Appearing to several different persons at different times.2. His eating and drinking with them.3. His meeting them in Galilee according to his own appointment.4. His subjecting his body to be touched and handled by them.5. His instructing them in the nature and doctrines of his kingdom.6. His appearing to upwards of five hundred persons at once, 1 Corinthians 15:6. And,7. Continuing these public manifestations of himself for forty days.The several appearances of Jesus Christ, during the forty days of his sojourning with his disciples, between his resurrection and ascension, are thus enumerated by Bishop Pearce: The first was to Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, Matthew 28:1-9. The second, to the two disciples on their way to Emmaus, Luke 24:15. The third, to Simon Peter, Luke 24:34. The fourth, to ten of the apostles, Thomas being absent, Luke 24:36, and John 20:19. (All these four appearances took place on the day of his resurrection.) The fifth was to the eleven disciples, Thomas being then with them, John 20:26. The sixth, to seven of the apostles in Galilee, at the sea of Tiberias, John 21:4. The seventh, to James, 1 Corinthians 15:7, most probably in Jerusalem, and when Jesus gave an order for all his apostles to assemble together, as in Acts 1:4. The eighth, when they were assembled together, and when he led them unto Bethany, Luke 24:50, from whence he ascended to heaven. But John 21:14, for farther particulars.Pertaining to the kingdom of God — Whatever concerned the doctrine, discipline, and establishment of the Christian Church.
