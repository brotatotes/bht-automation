<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>. <i><b>And, being assembled together</b></i> — Instead of συναλιζομενος, <i>being assembled together</i>, several good MSS. and versions read συναυλιζομενος, <i>living</i> or <i>eating together</i>, which refers the conversation reported here to some particular time, when he <i>sat at meat</i>, with his disciples. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:41-44">Luke 24:41-44</span>. See the <i>margin</i>.

<p><i><b>The promise of the Father</b></i> — The HOLY SPIRIT, which indeed was the grand promise of the New Testament, as JESUS CHRIST was of the Old. And as Christ was the grand promise of the Old Testament, during the whole continuance of the old covenant; so is the Holy Ghost, during the whole continuance of the new. As every pious soul that believed in the coming <i>Messiah</i>, through the medium of the <i>sacrifices</i> offered up under the law, was made a partaker of the merit of his death, so every pious soul that believes in Christ crucified is made a partaker of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>. Thus, as the benefit of the death of Christ extended from the foundation of the world till his coming in the flesh, as well as after, so the <i>inspiration</i> of the <i>Holy Spirit</i> has been, and will be continued through the whole lapse of time, till his coming again to judge the world. It is by this Spirit that sin is made known, and by it the blood of the covenant is applied; and indeed, without this, the <i>want</i> of salvation cannot be discovered, nor the <i>value</i> of the blood of the covenant duly estimated. How properly do we still pray, and how necessary is the prayer, "<i>Cleanse</i> the <i>thoughts</i> of our hearts by the <i>inspiration</i> of thy Holy Spirit, that we may <i>perfectly</i> love thee, and <i>worthily magnify</i> thy name, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Amen." <i>Communion Service</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye have heard of me.</b></i> — In his particular conversations with his disciples, such as those related <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16-26">John 14:16-26</span> (note); <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span> (note); <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7-15">John 16:7-15</span> (note) to which passages, and the notes on them the reader is requested to refer: but it is likely that our Lord alludes more particularly to the conversation he had with them on one of the mountains of Galilee.</p>
