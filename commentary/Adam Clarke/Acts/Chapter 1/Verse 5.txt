<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>. <i><b>Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days</b></i><b> </b><i><b>hence.</b></i> â€” This must refer to some conversation that is not distinctly related by the evangelists; as these identical words do not occur in any of the preceding histories. The <i>Codex Bezae</i> reads this passage thus: <i>but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost</i>, which ye shall receive <i>not many days hence</i>. John baptized with water, which was a sign of penitence, in reference to the remission of sin; but Christ baptizes with the Holy Ghost, for the destruction of sin, the illumination of the mind, and the consolation of the heart. John's baptism was <i>in reference</i> to the spiritual kingdom; but Christ's baptism <i>established</i> and <i>maintained</i> that kingdom. From this passage we may also learn that baptism does not always mean being <i>plunged</i> or <i>immersed</i> in water; for as this promise most evidently refers to the communication of the Holy Spirit on the following pentecost, and then he <i>sat upon each</i> <i>as a cloven tongue of fire</i>, this certainly has more affinity to <i>sprinkling</i> than to <i>plunging</i>. However, the mode of administering the sign is of very little consequence; and which is the best mode is exceedingly dubious: the stress should be laid on receiving the <i>thing</i> signified-the Holy Ghost, to <i>illuminate, regenerate, refine</i>, and <i>purify</i> the heart. With this, sprinkling or immersion are equally efficient: without this, both are worth nothing.</p>
