<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span>. <i><b>When they therefore were come together</b></i> — It is very likely that this is to be understood of their assembling on one of the mountains of Galilee, and there meeting our Lord.</p>
<p><i><b>At this time restore again the kingdom</b></i> — That the disciples, in common with the Jews, expected the Messiah's kingdom to be at least in part <i>secular</i>, I have often had occasion to note. In this opinion they continued less or more till the day of pentecost; when the mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit taught them the spiritual nature of the kingdom of Christ. The kingdom had now for a considerable time been taken away from Israel; the Romans, not the Israelites, had the government. The object of the disciples' question seems to have been this: to gain information, from their all-knowing Master, whether the time was now fully come, in which the Romans should be thrust out, and Israel made, as formerly, an independent kingdom. But though the verb αποκαθιστανειν signifies to <i>reinstate</i>, to <i>renew</i>, to <i>restore</i> to a <i>former state</i> or <i>master</i>, of which numerous examples occur in the best Greek writers, yet it has also another meaning, as <i>Schoettgen</i> has here remarked, viz. of <i>ending, abolishing, blotting out</i>: so <i>Hesychius</i> says, αποκαταστασις is the same as τελειωσις, <i>finishing, making an</i> <i>end</i> of a thing. And <i>Hippocrates</i>, Aph. vi. 49, uses it to signify the <i>termination</i> of a disease. On this interpretation the disciples may be supposed to ask, having recollected our Lord's prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem, and the whole Jewish commonwealth, Lord, <i>Wilt thou at this time destroy the Jewish</i> <i>commonwealth</i>, which opposes thy truth, that thy kingdom may be set up over all the land? This interpretation agrees well with all the parts of our Lord's answer, and with all circumstances of the <i>disciples</i>, of <i>time</i>, and of <i>place</i>; but, still, the first is most probable.</p>
