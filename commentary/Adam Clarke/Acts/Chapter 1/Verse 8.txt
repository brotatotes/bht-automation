<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>. <i><b>But ye shall receive power</b></i> — ληψεσθε δυναμιν. Translating different terms of the original by the <i>same</i> English word is a source of misapprehension and error. We must not understand δυναμις which we translate <i>power</i> in this verse, as we do εξουσια, translated by the same word in the preceding verse. In the one, God's infinite <i>authority</i> over all times and seasons, and his uncompellable liberty of acting or not acting in any given case, are particularly pointed out: in the other, the <i>energy</i> communicated by him to his disciples, through which they were enabled to <i>work miracles</i>, is particularly intended; and δυναμις, in general, signifies such power, and is sometimes put for <i>that</i> of which it is the <i>cause</i>, viz. a <i>miracle</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22">Matthew 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:20-23">Matthew 11:20-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:54">Matthew 13:54</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:58">Matthew 13:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:5">Mark 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>. The disciples were to be made instruments in the establishment of the kingdom of Christ; but this must be by the <i>energy</i> of the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; nevertheless, this energy would be given in such times and seasons, and in such measures, as should appear best to the infinite wisdom of God. Christ does not immediately answer the question of the disciples, as it was a point savouring too much of mere curiosity; but he gave them such information as was calculated to bring both their faith and hope into action. St. Chrysostom has well observed, "that it is the prerogative of an instructer to teach his disciple, not what <i>he</i> wishes to learn, but what his <i>master</i> sees best for him:" Διδασκαλου τουτο εστι μη ἁ βουλεται ὁ μαθητης, αλλ' ἁ συμφερει μαθειν, διδασκειν.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye shall be witnesses - in all Judea</b></i>, c.] Though the word <i>earth</i>, η γη, is often used to denote Judea alone, yet here, it is probable, it is to be taken in its largest extent. All the inhabitants of the globe might at that period be considered divisible into three classes.</p>
<p>1. The JEWS, who adhered to the law of Moses, and the prophetic writings, worshipping the true God only, and keeping up the temple service, as prescribed in their law.</p>
<p>2. The SAMARITANS, a mongrel people, who worshipped the God of Israel in connection with other gods, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:5">2 Kings 17:5</span>, &amp;c., and who had no kind of religious connection with the Jews. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span>. And,</p>
<p>3. The GENTILES, the <i>heathens</i> through all other parts of the world, who were addicted to <i>idolatry</i> alone, and had no knowledge of the true God. By the terms in the text we may see the extent to which this commission of instruction and salvation was designed to reach: to the <i>Jews</i> to the <i>Samaritans</i>, and the <i>uttermost part of the earth</i>, i.e. to the <i>Gentile</i> nations, thus, to the <i>whole human race</i> the Gospel of the kingdom was to be proclaimed. When the twelve disciples were sent out to preach, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span>, their commission was very <i>limited</i>-they were not to <i>go in the way of the Gentiles</i>, nor <i>enter into any city of the Samaritans</i>, but preach the Gospel to <i>the lost sheep of the house of Israel</i>: but here their commission is <i>enlarged</i>, for they are to go into <i>all the world, and preach the</i> <i>Gospel to every creature</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>.</p>
