<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>. <i><b>He was taken up</b></i> â€” He was speaking face to face with them, and <i>while they beheld</i> he was taken up; he began to ascend to heaven, and they continued to look after him till <i>a cloud received</i> <i>him out of their sight</i>-till he had ascended above the region of the clouds, by the density of which all farther distinct vision was prevented. These circumstances are very remarkable, and should be carefully noted. They render insupportable the theory that states, "that our Lord did not ascend to heaven; that his being <i>taken up</i> signifies his going into some mountain, the top of which was covered with clouds, or thick vapours; and that the <i>two</i> <i>men in white garments</i> were two <i>priests</i>, or <i>Levites</i>, who simply informed the disciples of his revisiting them again at some future time." One would suppose that an opinion of this kind could hardly ever obtain credit among people professing <i>Christianity</i>; and yet it is espoused by some men of considerable learning and ingenuity. But the mere letter of the text will be ever sufficient for its total confutation. He that believes the text cannot receive such a miserable comment. <i>Foreign</i> critics and divines take a most sinful <i>latitude</i> on subjects of this kind.</p>
