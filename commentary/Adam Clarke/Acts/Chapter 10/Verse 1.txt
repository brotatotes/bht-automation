<p>I have already observed (see the conclusion of the preceding chapter) that hitherto the apostles confined their labours among the <i>Jews</i> and circumcised <i>proselytes</i>, not making any offer of salvation to the <i>Gentiles</i>; for they had fully imbibed the opinion that none could enter into the kingdom of God, and be finally saved, unless they were circumcised, and became obedient to the law of Moses. This prejudice would have operated so as finally to prevent them from preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles, had not God, by a particular interposition of his mercy and goodness, convinced Peter, and through him all the other apostles, that he had accepted the <i>Gentiles</i> as well as the <i>Jews</i>, and would put no difference between the one and the other, purifying their hearts by faith, and giving the Gentiles the Holy Ghost, as he had before given it to the Jews. The means which he used to produce this conviction in the minds of the apostles are detailed at length in the following chapter.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>. <i><b>There was a certain man in Caesarea</b></i> — This was <i>Caesarea</i> of <i>Palestine</i>, called also <i>Strato's Tower</i>, as has been already noted, and the residence of the Roman procurator.</p>
<p><i><b>A centurion</b></i> — εκατονταρχης, The chief or captain of 100 men, as both the Greek and Latin words imply. How the Roman armies were formed, divided, and marshalled, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span>. A <i>centurion</i> among the Romans was about the same rank as a <i>captain</i> among us.</p>
<p><i><b>The band called the Italian band</b></i> — The word σπειρα, which we translate <i>band</i>, signifies the same as <i>cohort</i> or <i>regiment</i>, which sometimes consisted of 555 infantry, and 66 cavalry; but the <i>cohors prima</i>, or first cohort, consisted of 1105 infantry, and l32 cavalry, in the time of <i>Vegetius</i>. But the cavalry are not to be considered as part of the cohort, but rather a company joined to it. A Roman <i>legion</i> consisted of <i>ten</i> cohorts; the first of which surpassed all the others, both in numbers and in dignity. When in former times the Roman legion contained 6000, each cohort consisted of 600, and was divided into three <i>manipuli</i>; but both the legions and cohorts were afterwards various in the numbers they contained. As there were doubtless many <i>Syrian auxiliaries</i>, the regiment in question was distinguished from them as consisting of <i>Italian</i>, i.e. <i>Roman</i>, soldiers. The <i>Italian cohort</i> is not unknown among the Roman writers: <i>Gruter</i> gives an inscription, which was found in the <i>Forum Sempronii</i>, on a fine table of marble, nine feet long, four feet broad, and four inches thick; on which are the following words:- </p>
<p>This was probably the same cohort as that mentioned here by St. Luke; for the <i>tenth</i> legion mentioned in the above inscription was certainly in Judea, A.D. 69. <i>Tacitus</i> also mentions the <i>Italica</i> <i>legio</i>, the Italic legion, lib. i. c. 59, which <i>Junius Blaesus</i> had under his command in the province of Lyons. We learn, from the Roman historians, that the <i>fifth, tenth</i>, and <i>fifteenth</i> legions were stationed in Judea; and the <i>third, fourth, sixth</i>, and <i>twelfth</i> in <i>Syria</i>. The <i>Italic</i> legion was in the battle of Bedriacum, fought, A.D. 69, between the troops of Vitellius and Otho; and performed essential services to the Vitellian army. See <i>Tacitus</i>, Hist. lib. ii. cap. 41. The issue of this battle was the defeat of the Othonians, on which Otho slew himself, and the empire was confirmed to Vitellius.</p>
<p>Wherever he sees it necessary, St. Luke carefully gives <i>dates</i> and <i>facts</i>, to which any might have recourse who might be disposed to doubt his statements: we have had several proofs of this in his Gospel. See especially <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>, &amp;c., and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1">Luke 3:1</span>, &amp;c., and the notes there.</p>
