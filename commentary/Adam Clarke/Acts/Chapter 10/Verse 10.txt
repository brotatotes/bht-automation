<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:10">Acts 10:10</span>. <i><b>He became very hungry</b></i> — It seems that this happened about dinner-time; for it appears that they were <i>making ready</i>, παρασκευαζοντων, <i>dressing the victuals</i> for the family. The <i>dinner</i> among the ancients was a very slight meal; and they had no <i>breakfast</i>: their <i>supper</i> was their principal meal. And, in very ancient times, they ate only <i>once</i> in the day. Supper was the meal at which they saw their friends, the business of the day being then finished.</p>
<p><i><b>He fell into a trance</b></i> — επεπεσεν επ αυτον εκστασις, <i>An ecstasy</i> <i>fell upon him</i>. A person may be said to be in an ecstasy when transported with <i>joy</i> or <i>admiration</i>, so that he is <i>insensible</i> to every object but that on which he is engaged. Peter's ecstasy is easily accounted for: he went up to the house-top to pray: at first he felt keen hunger; but, being earnestly engaged with God, all natural appetites became absorbed in the intense application of his soul to his Maker. While every passion and appetite was under this Divine influence, and the soul, without let or hinderance, freely conversing with God, then the visionary and symbolical representation mentioned here took place.</p>
