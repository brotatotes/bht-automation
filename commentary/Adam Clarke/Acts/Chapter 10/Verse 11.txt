<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:11">Acts 10:11</span>. <i><b>And saw heaven opened</b></i> — His mind now entirely spiritualized, and absorbed in heavenly contemplation, was capable of discoveries of the spiritual world; a world which, with its πληρωμα, or <i>plenitude</i> of inhabitants, surrounds us at all times; but which we are incapable of seeing through the dense medium of <i>flesh</i> and <i>blood</i>, and their necessarily concomitant <i>earthly</i> <i>passions</i>. Much, however, of such a world and its economy may be apprehended by him who is purified from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and who has perfected holiness in the fear of God. But this is a subject to which the <i>enthusiast</i> in vain attempts to ascend. The <i>turbulent working</i> of his imagination, and the gross earthly crudities which he wishes to obtrude on the world as revelations from God, afford a sufficient refutation of their own blasphemous pretensions.</p>
<p><i><b>A great sheet, knit at the four corners</b></i> — Perhaps intended to be an emblem of the <i>universe</i>, and its <i>various nations</i>, to the four corners of which the Gospel was to extend, and to offer its blessings to all the inhabitants, without distinction of nation, &amp;c.</p>
