<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:13">Acts 10:13</span>. <i><b>Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</b></i> — θυσον και φαγε, <i>Sacrifice</i> <i>and eat</i>. Though this verb is sometimes used to signify the <i>slaying</i> of animals for <i>food</i>, yet, as the proper notion is to <i>slay</i> for the purpose of <i>sacrifice</i>, it appears to me to be better to preserve that meaning here. Animals that were offered in sacrifice were considered as <i>given to God</i>; and, when he received the <i>life</i>, the flesh was given to those who offered the sacrifice, that they might feed upon it; and every sacrifice had in it the nature of a <i>covenant</i>; and covenants were usually made by <i>eating together</i> on the flesh of the sacrifice offered on the occasion, God being supposed to be invisibly present with them, and partaking of the feast. The <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i> are certainly represented by the clean and unclean animals in this large vessel: these, by the ministry of the Gospel, were to be offered up a spiritual sacrifice to God. Peter was to be a prime instrument in this work; he was to offer them to God, and rejoice in the work of his hands. The spirit of the heavenly direction seems to be this: "The middle wall of partition is now to be pulled down; the Jews and Gentiles are called to become one flock, under one shepherd and bishop of souls. Thou, Peter, shalt open the door of faith to the <i>Gentiles</i>, and be also the minister of the circumcision. Rise up; already a blessed sacrifice is prepared: go and offer it to God; and let thy soul feed on the fruits of his mercy and goodness, in thus showing his gracious design of saving both Jews and Gentiles by Christ crucified."</p>
