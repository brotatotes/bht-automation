<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:14">Acts 10:14</span>. <i><b>Common or unclean.</b></i> — By <i>common</i>, κοινον, whatever was in <i>general use</i> among the <i>Gentiles</i> is to be understood; by ακαθαρτον, <i>unclean</i>, every thing that was <i>forbidden</i> by the Mosaic law. However, the one word may be considered as explanatory of the other. The rabbins themselves, and many of the primitive fathers, believed that by the <i>unclean</i> animals forbidden by the law the <i>Gentiles</i> were meant.</p>
