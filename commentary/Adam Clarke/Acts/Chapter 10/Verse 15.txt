<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:15">Acts 10:15</span>. <i><b>What God hath cleansed</b></i> â€” God, who made at first the distinction between Jews and Gentiles, has a right to remove it, whenever and by whatever means he pleases: he, therefore, who made the distinction, for wise purposes, between the clean and the unclean, now pronounces all to be <i>clean</i>. He had authority to do the first; he has authority to do the last. God has purposed that the Gentiles shall have the Gospel preached to them: <i>what</i> he therefore has <i>cleansed</i>, "that call not thou <i>common</i>."</p>
