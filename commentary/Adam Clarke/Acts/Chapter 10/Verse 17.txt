<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:17">Acts 10:17</span>. <i><b>While Peter doubted - the men - stood before the gate</b></i> â€” In all this we find an admirable display of the economy of Providence. Cornelius prays, and has a vision which prepares him to receive instruction from Peter: Peter prays, and has a vision which prepares and disposes him to give instruction to Cornelius. While he is in doubts and perplexity what the full meaning of the vision might be, the messengers, who had been despatched under the guidance of an especial Providence, came to the door; and the Holy Spirit gives him information that his doubts should be all cleared up by accompanying the men who were now inquiring for him. How exactly does every thing in the conduct of Providence occur; and how completely is every thing adapted to <i>time, place</i>, and <i>occasion</i>! All is in weight, measure, and number. Those simple occurrences which men snatch at, and press into the service of their own <i>wishes</i>, and call them <i>providential openings</i> may, indeed, be links of a providential chain, in reference to <i>some other</i> <i>matter</i>; but unless they be found to speak the <i>same language</i> in all their <i>parts</i>, occurrence corresponding with occurrence, they are not to be construed as indications of the Divine will in reference to the claimants. Many persons, through these misapprehensions, miscarrying, have been led to charge God foolishly for the unsuccessful issue of some business in which their passions, not his providence, prompted them to engage.</p>
