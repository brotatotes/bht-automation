<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:2">Acts 10:2</span>. <b>A </b><i><b>devout</b></i><b> man</b>] ευσεβης, from ευ, <i>well</i>, and σεβομαι, <i>I worship</i>. A person who <i>worships the true God</i>, and is no <i>idolater</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>One that feared God</b></i> — φοβουμενος τον θεον, One who was acquainted with the true God, by means of his word and laws; who respected these laws, and would not dare to offend his Maker and his Judge. This is necessarily implied in <i>the fear of God</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>With all his house</b></i> — He took care to instruct his family in the knowledge which he himself had received; and to establish the worship of God in his house.</p>
<p><i><b>Gave much alms</b></i> — His love to God led him to love men; and this love proved its sincerity by acts of beneficence and charity.</p>
<p><i><b>Prayed to God alway.</b></i> — Felt himself a dependent creature; knew he had no good but what he had received; and considered God to be the fountain whence he was to derive all his blessings. <i>He prayed to</i> <i>God alway</i>; was ever in the <i>spirit</i> of prayer, and frequently in the <i>act</i>. What an excellent character is this! And yet the man was a <i>Gentile</i>! He was what a <i>Jew</i> would repute <i>common</i> and <i>unclean</i>: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>. He was, therefore, not circumcised; but, as he worshipped the true God, without any idolatrous mixtures, and was in <i>good report among all the nation of the Jews</i>, he was undoubtedly what was called a <i>proselyte of the gate</i>, though not a <i>proselyte of justice</i>, because he had not entered into the <i>bond</i> <i>of the covenant</i> by <i>circumcision</i>. This was a proper person, being so much of a Jew and so much of a Gentile, to form the connecting link between both people; and God chose him that the salvation of the Jews might with as little observation as possible be transmitted to the Gentiles. The choice of such a person, through whom the door of faith was opened to the <i>heathen</i> world, was a proof of the wisdom and goodness of God. The man who was chosen to this honour was not a <i>profligate</i> Gentile; nor yet a circumcised proselyte. He was a <i>Gentile</i>, amiable and pure in his manners; and, for his piety and charitableness, held in high estimation among all the nation of the <i>Jews</i>. Against such a person they could not, with any grace, be envious, though God should pour out upon <i>him</i> the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
