Verse Acts 10:24. His kinsmen and near friends. — συγγενεις, His, relatives, and αναγκαιους φιλους, his necessary friends; but the Syriac makes αναγκαιους an epithet as well as συγγενεις, and thus the passage may be read, his kinsmen, his domestics, and his friends. It appears that he had collected the whole circle of his intimate acquaintance, that they also might profit by a revelation which he expected to come immediately from heaven; and these amounted to many persons; see Acts 10:27.
