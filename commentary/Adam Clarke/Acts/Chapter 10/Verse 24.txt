<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:24">Acts 10:24</span>. <i><b>His kinsmen and near friends.</b></i> — συγγενεις, His, <i>relatives</i>, and αναγκαιους φιλους, his <i>necessary friends</i>; but the Syriac makes αναγκαιους an epithet as well as συγγενεις, and thus the passage may be read, <i>his kinsmen, his domestics</i>, and <i>his</i> <i>friends</i>. It appears that he had collected the whole circle of his intimate acquaintance, that they also might profit by a revelation which he expected to come immediately from heaven; and these amounted to many persons; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:27">Acts 10:27</span>.</p>
