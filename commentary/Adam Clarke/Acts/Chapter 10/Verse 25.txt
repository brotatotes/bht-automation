<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:25">Acts 10:25</span>. <i><b>Fell down at his feet, and worshipped</b></i><b> him.</b>] As Peter's coming was announced by an <i>angel</i>, Cornelius might have supposed that Peter himself was an angel, and of a superior order; seeing he came to announce what the first angel was not employed to declare: it was, probably, in consequence of this thought that he prostrated himself before Peter, offering him the highest act of <i>civil</i> respect; for there was nothing in the act, as performed by Cornelius, which belonged to the worship of the true God. <i>Prostrations</i> to superiors were common in all Asiatic countries. The <i>Codex Bezae</i>, and the later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin reads this verse differently from all other MSS. and versions; thus, <i>But as</i> <i>Peter drew nigh to Caesarea, one of the servants ran before, and</i> <i>told that he was come: then Cornelius leaped up, and met him, and,</i> <i>falling at his feet, he worshipped him</i>. This is a very remarkable addition, and relates circumstances that we may naturally suppose did actually take place.</p>
