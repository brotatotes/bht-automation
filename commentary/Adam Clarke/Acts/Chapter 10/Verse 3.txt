Verse Acts 10:3. He saw in a vision evidently — The text is as plain as it can be, that an angel of God did appear to Cornelius. This was in a vision, i.e. a supernatural representation; and it was φανερως, manifestly, evidently made; and at such a time too as precluded the possibility of his being asleep; for it was about the ninth hour of the day, answering to our three o'clock in the afternoon, (Acts 3:1; Acts 3:1,) the time of public prayer, according to the custom of the Jews, and while Peter was engaged in that sacred duty. The angelic appearance to Cornelius was something similar to that made to Daniel, Daniel 9:20-23, and that especially to Zachariah, the father of John Baptist, Luke 1:11, &c.
