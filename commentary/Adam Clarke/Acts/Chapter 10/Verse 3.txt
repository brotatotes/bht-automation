<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>. <i><b>He saw in a vision evidently</b></i> — The text is as plain as it can be, that an angel of God <i>did appear</i> to Cornelius. This was in a <i>vision</i>, i.e. <i>a supernatural</i> representation; and it was φανερως, <i>manifestly, evidently made</i>; and at such a time too as precluded the possibility of his being asleep; for it was <i>about</i> <i>the ninth hour of the day</i>, answering to our three o'clock in the afternoon, (<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span></span>,) the time of <i>public prayer</i>, according to the custom of the Jews, and while Peter was engaged in that sacred duty. The angelic appearance to Cornelius was something similar to that made to Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:20-23">Daniel 9:20-23</span>, and that especially to Zachariah, the father of John Baptist, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:11">Luke 1:11</span>, &amp;c.</p>
