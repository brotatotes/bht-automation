<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Four days ago I was fasting until this hour</b></i> — It was then about three o'clock in the afternoon; and it appears that Cornelius had continued his fasts from three o'clock the preceding day to three o'clock the day following; not that he had fasted four days together, as some supposes for even if he did fast four days consecutively, he ate one meal on each day. It is however necessary to remark that the word νηστευων, <i>fasting</i> is wanting in ABC, <i>one</i> other; the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>; but it has not been omitted in any <i>edition</i> of the Greek Testament.</p>
