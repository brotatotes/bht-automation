<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Thy prayer is heard</b></i> â€” <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:4">Acts 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:4">Acts 10:4</span></span>. Cornelius <i>prayed, fasted</i>, and gave <i>alms</i>. It was in this <i>way</i> he looked for salvation; not to <i>purchase</i> it: a thought of this kind does not appear to have entered into his mind; but these were the <i>means</i> he used to get his soul brought to the knowledge of the truth. The reader must recollect that in the case of Cornelius there was no <i>open vision</i>; he used the light and power which God had already given; and behold how mightily God increased his gifts! He that <i>hath</i>, i.e., that uses what he has, shall receive; and no man can expect any increase of light or life, who does not improve the grace already given.</p>
