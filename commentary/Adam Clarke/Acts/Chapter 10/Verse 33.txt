<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Are we all here present before God</b></i> â€” Instead of <i>before</i> <i>GOD</i>, the <i>Codex Bezae, Syriac, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>, read <i>before THEE</i>. The people were all waiting for the preacher, and every heart was filled with expectation; they waited as <i>before</i> <i>God</i>, from whose messenger they were about to hear the words of life.</p>
