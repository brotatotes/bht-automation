<p>Verse 34. <i><b>God is no respecter of persons</b></i> â€” He does God esteem a <i>Jew</i>, because he is a <i>Jew</i>; nor does he detest a <i>Gentile</i> because he is a <i>Gentile</i>. It was a long and deeply rooted opinion among the Jews, that God never would extend his favour to the <i>Gentiles</i>; and that the descendants of Jacob only should enjoy his peculiar favour and benediction. Of this opinion was St. Peter, previously to the heavenly vision mentioned in this chapter. He was now convinced that <i>God was no respecter of persons</i>; that as all must stand before his judgment seat, to be judged according to the deeds done in the body, so no one nation, or people, or individual, could expect to find a more favourable decision than another who was precisely in the <i>same</i> moral state; for the phrase, <i>respect of persons</i>, is used in reference to <i>unjust decisions</i> in a <i>court</i> of <i>justice</i>, where, through favour, or interest, or bribe, a culprit is acquitted, and a righteous or innocent person condemned. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+19:15">Leviticus 19:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:16-17">Deuteronomy 1:16-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+16:19">Deuteronomy 16:19</span>. And as <i>there is no iniquity</i> (decisions contrary to equity) <i>with God</i>, so he could not shut out the pious <i>prayers</i>, sincere <i>fasting</i>, and benevolent <i>alms-giving</i> of Cornelius; because the very spring whence they proceeded was his own grace and mercy. Therefore he could not receive even a <i>Jew</i> into his favour (in preference to such a person) who had either abused his grace, or made a less godly use of it than this Gentile had done.</p>
