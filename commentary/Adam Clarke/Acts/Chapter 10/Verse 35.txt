<p>Verse 35. <i><b>But in every nation he that feared him</b></i>, c.] <i>In every</i> <i>nation he</i> who, according to his light and privileges, <i>fears</i> God, worships him alone, (for this is the true meaning of the word,) <i>and worketh righteousness</i>, abstains from all evil, gives to all their due, injures neither the body, soul, nor reputation of his neighbour, <i>is accepted with him</i>. It is not therefore the nation, kindred, profession, mode or form of worship, that the just God regards but the <i>character</i>, the <i>state of heart</i>, and the <i>moral</i> <i>deportment</i>. For what are <i>professions</i>, c., in the sight of that God who trieth spirits, and by whom actions are weighed! He looks for the grace he has given, the advantages he has afforded, and the improvement of all these. Let it be observed farther, that no man can be accepted with this just God who does not <i>live up to the</i> <i>advantages of the state in which providence has placed him</i>. Why was Cornelius accepted with God while thousands of his countrymen were passed by? Because <i>he</i> did not receive the grace of God in vain he <i>watched, fasted, prayed</i>, and <i>gave alms</i>, which they did not. Had he not done so, would <i>he</i> have been accepted? Certainly not; because it would then appear that he had received the grace of God in vain, and had not been a worker together with him. Many irreligious men, in order to get rid of the duties and obligations of Christianity, quote this verse in their own favour, while they reject all the Gospel besides; and roundly assert, as they think on the authority of this text, that they need neither believe in Jesus Christ, attend to his Gospel, nor use his ordinances; for, if they fear God and work righteousness, they shall be infallibly accepted with him. Let such know that if they had been born and still were living in a land where the light of the Gospel had never shone, and were there conscientiously following the glimmering ray of celestial light which God had granted, they might, with some show of reason, speak in this way; but, as they are born and live under the Gospel of Jesus Christ, God, the just Judge, will require that <i>they fear him</i>, and <i>work righteousness,</i> <i>ACCORDING to the LIGHT afforded by that very GOSPEL</i>. The sincerity, watching, praying, fastings and alms-giving of Cornelius will not be sufficient for them who, as it may be justly said, live in splendours of Christianity. In such a state, God requires that a man shall love him with all his heart, soul, mind, and strength; and his neighbour as himself. In the face of such a requisition as this, how will the poor <i>heathen virtue</i> of one born in the <i>pale of Christianity</i> appear? And if God requires all this, will not a man need all the grace that has been brought to light by the revelation of Jesus Christ to enable him to do it?</p>
