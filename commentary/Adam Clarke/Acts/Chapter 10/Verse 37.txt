<p>Verse 37. <i><b>That word - ye know</b></i> â€” This account of Jesus of Nazareth ye cannot be unacquainted with; because it has been proclaimed throughout all Judea and Galilee, from the time that John began to preach. Ye have heard how he was anointed with the Holy Ghost, and of the miracles which he performed; how he went about doing good, and healing all kinds of demoniacs and, by these mighty and beneficent acts, giving the fullest proof that God was with him. This was the exordium of Peter's discourse; and thus he begins, from what they knew, to teach them what they did not know.</p>
<p>St. Peter does not intimate that any miracle was wrought by Christ previously to his being baptized by John. <i>Beginning at</i> <i>Galilee</i>. Let us review the mode of Christ's manifestation.</p>
<p>1. After he had been baptized by John, he went into the desert, and remained there forty days.</p>
<p>2. He then returned to the Baptist, who was exercising his ministry at that time at Bethany or Bethabara; and there he made certain disciples, viz., Andrew, Bartholomew, Peter, and Philip.</p>
<p>3. Thence he went to the marriage at Cana, in Galilee, where he wrought his first miracle.</p>
<p>4. And afterwards he went to Capernaum in the same country, by the sea of Galilee, where he wrought many others. This was the <i>manner</i> in which Christ manifested himself; and these are the <i>facts</i> of which Peter presumes they had a perfect knowledge, because they had been for a long time notorious through all the land.</p>
