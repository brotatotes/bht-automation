<p>Verse 38. <i><b>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth</b></i> â€” Here the apostle refers to Christ as the promised <i>Messiah</i>; for, as Messiah signifies <i>the anointed one</i>, and <i>Christ</i> has the same signification in Greek, and the Messiah, according to the prophets, and the expectation of the Jews, was to work miracles, Peter proclaims Jesus as the <i>Messiah</i>, and refers to the miracles which he wrought as the <i>proof</i> of it. This delicate, but forcible allusion is lost by most readers.</p>
