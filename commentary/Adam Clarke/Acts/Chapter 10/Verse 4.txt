Verse Acts 10:4. Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial — Being all performed in simplicity and godly sincerity, they were acceptable to the Most High.Come up for a memorial: This form of speech is evidently borrowed from the sacrificial system of the Jews. Pious and sincere prayers are high in God's estimation; and therefore are said to ascend to him, as the smoke and flame of the burnt-offering appeared to ascend to heaven.These prayers and alms came up for a memorial before God: this is a manifest allusion to the meat-offering, which, in Leviticus 2:16, is said to be אזכרה azkerah, a memorial, (speaking after the manner of men,) to put God in remembrance that such a person was his worshipper, and needed his protection and help. So the prayers and alms of Cornelius ascended before God as an acceptable sacrifice, and were recorded in the kingdom of heaven, that the answers might be given in their due season.
