<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:4">Acts 10:4</span>. <i><b>Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial</b></i> — Being all performed in simplicity and godly sincerity, they were acceptable to the Most High.</p>
<p><i>Come up for a memorial</i>: This form of speech is evidently borrowed from the sacrificial system of the Jews. Pious and sincere prayers are high in God's estimation; and therefore are said to <i>ascend</i> to him, as the <i>smoke</i> and <i>flame</i> of the burnt-offering appeared to ascend to heaven.</p>
<p>These prayers and alms came up for a <i>memorial</i> before God: this is a manifest allusion to the meat-offering, which, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+2:16">Leviticus 2:16</span>, is said to be אזכרה <i>azkerah</i>, a memorial, (speaking after the manner of men,) to put God in remembrance that such a person was his worshipper, and needed his protection and help. So the prayers and alms of Cornelius ascended before God as an acceptable sacrifice, and were <i>recorded</i> in the kingdom of heaven, that the answers might be given in their due season.</p>
