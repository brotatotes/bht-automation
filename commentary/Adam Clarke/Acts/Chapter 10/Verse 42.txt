<p>Verse 42. <i><b>And he commanded us to preach</b></i> — By thus assuring them that Jesus Christ was appointed to <i>judge the world</i>, he at once showed them the necessity of <i>subjection</i> to him, that they might stand in the day of his appearing.</p>
<p><i><b>The Judge of quick and dead.</b></i> — The word <i>quick</i> we retain from our ancient mother tongue, the Saxon [Anglo-Saxon], <i>to live</i>, hence [A.S.] and [A.S.], <i>life</i>, and [A.S.], <i>grass</i>; and from this our <i>quicks, quick</i>-set hedges, fences made of <i>living</i> thorns, c. By <i>quick and dead</i> we are to understand:</p>
<p>1. All that had lived from the foundation of the world till that time and all that were then alive.</p>
<p>2. All that should be found alive at the day of judgment, as well as all that had died previously.</p>
