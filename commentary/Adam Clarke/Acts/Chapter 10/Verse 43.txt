Verse 43. To him give all the prophets witness — See Isaiah 9:6; Isaiah 52:7; Isaiah 53:5-6; Isaiah 59:20; Jeremiah 31:34; Daniel 9:24; Micah 7:18, c. and Zechariah 13:1. As Jesus Christ was the sum and substance of the law and the Mosaic dispensation, so all the prophets bore testimony, either directly or indirectly, to him; and, indeed, without him and the salvation he has promised, there is scarcely any meaning in the Mosaic economy, nor in most of the allusions of the prophets.Remission of sins. — The phrase, αφεσις αμαρτιων, means simply the taking away of sins; and this does not refer to the guilt of sin merely, but also to its power, nature, and consequences. All that is implied in pardon of sin, destruction of its tyranny, and purification from its pollution, is here intended; and it is wrong to restrict such operations of mercy to pardon alone.
