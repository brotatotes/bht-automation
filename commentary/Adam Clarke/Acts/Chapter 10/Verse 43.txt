<p>Verse 43. <i><b>To him give all the prophets witness</b></i> — See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:7">Isaiah 52:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:5-6">Isaiah 53:5-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:20">Isaiah 59:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:34">Jeremiah 31:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+7:18">Micah 7:18</span>, c. and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:1">Zechariah 13:1</span>. As Jesus Christ was the <i>sum</i> and <i>substance</i> of the law and the Mosaic dispensation, so all the prophets bore testimony, either <i>directly</i> or <i>indirectly</i>, to him; and, indeed, without him and the salvation he has promised, there is scarcely any meaning in the Mosaic economy, nor in most of the allusions of the prophets.</p>
<p><i><b>Remission of sins.</b></i> — The phrase, αφεσις αμαρτιων, means simply the <i>taking away of sins</i>; and this does not refer to the <i>guilt</i> of sin merely, but also to its <i>power, nature</i>, and <i>consequences</i>. All that is implied in <i>pardon of sin, destruction</i> of its <i>tyranny</i>, and <i>purification</i> from its <i>pollution</i>, is here intended; and it is wrong to restrict such operations of mercy to <i>pardon alone</i>.</p>
