<p>Verse 44. <i><b>While Peter yet spake</b></i> â€” It in not very likely that the words recorded by St. Luke are <i>all</i> that the apostle spoke on this occasion; but, while he continued to discourse with them on this subject, <i>the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word</i>; and his descent was known by their being enabled to speak with different kinds of tongues. In what manner this gift was bestowed we cannot tell; probably it was in the same way in which it had been given on the day of pentecost; for as they spake with tongues, which was the effect of the descent of the Spirit as flaming tongues on the heads of the disciples on the day of pentecost, it is very likely that the same appearance now took place.</p>
