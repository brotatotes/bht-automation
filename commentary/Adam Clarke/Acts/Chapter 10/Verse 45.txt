<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:45">Acts 10:45</span>. <i><b>They of the circumcision - were astonished</b></i> â€” Because it was a maxim with them that the <i>Shechinah</i> or Divine influence could not be revealed to any person who dwelt beyond the precincts of the promised land. Nor did any of them believe that the Divine Spirit could be communicated to any <i>Gentile</i>. It is no wonder, therefore, that they were amazed when they saw the Spirit of God so liberally given as it was on this occasion.</p>
