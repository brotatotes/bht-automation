<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:47">Acts 10:47</span>. <i><b>Can any man forbid water</b></i> â€” These had evidently received the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, and consequently were become members of the mystical body of Christ; and yet St. Peter requires that they shall receive baptism by <i>water</i>, that they might become members of the Christian Church. In other cases, they received baptism first, and the Spirit afterwards by the imposition of hands: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:4-6">Acts 19:4-6</span>, where the disciples who had received only the baptism of John were baptized again with <i>water</i> in the name of the Lord Jesus; and, after even this, the apostles <i>prayed</i>, and <i>laid</i> <i>their hands on them</i>, before they were made partakers of the Holy Ghost. So we find that Jesus Christ had his <i>water baptism</i> as well as John; and that even he who gave the baptism of the <i>Holy Ghost</i> required the administration of <i>water baptism</i> also. Therefore the <i>baptism of the Spirit</i> did not <i>supersede</i> the <i>baptism by water</i>; nor indeed can it; as <i>baptism</i>, as well as the <i>supper of our Lord</i>, were intended, not only to be means of grace, but standing, <i>irrefragable proofs</i> of the truth of Christianity.</p>
