<p><i><b>What thou oughtest to do.</b></i> — From this it appears that matters of great moment had occupied the mind of Cornelius. He was not satisfied with the state of his own soul, nor with the degree he possessed of religious knowledge; and he set apart a particular time for extraordinary fasting and prayer, that God might farther reveal to him the knowledge of his will. Perhaps he had heard of Jesus, and had been perplexed with the different opinions that prevailed concerning him, and now prayed to God that he might know what part he should take; and the answer to this prayer is, "Send to Joppa for Simon Peter, <i>he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to</i> <i>do</i>." This clause, so explanatory, is wanting in almost every MS. and version of note. Griesbach and some others have left it out of the text. But see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:14">Acts 11:14</span>, where it stands in substance.</p>
