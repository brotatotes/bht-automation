Verse Acts 11:14. Thou and all thy house shall be saved. â€” This is an additional circumstance: before, it was said, Acts 10:6, Peter shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do; and, in Acts 10:32, who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. But, in Peter's relation, the matter is more explicitly declared, he shall tell thee words whereby thou and thy house shall be saved. He shall announce to you all the doctrine of salvation.
