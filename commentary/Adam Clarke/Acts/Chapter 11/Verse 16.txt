<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:16">Acts 11:16</span>. <i><b>Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</b></i> â€” These words are very remarkable. The words of our Lord, as quoted <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>, to which St. Peter refers here, have been supposed by many to be referred to the <i>apostles</i> alone; but here it is evident that St. Peter believed they were a promise made to all Christians, i.e. to all, whether Jews or Gentiles, who should believe on Jesus Christ. Therefore, when he saw that the Holy Ghost fell upon those Gentiles, he considered it a fulfilment of our Lord's promise: <i>ye</i>, that is, all that will believe on me, <i>shall be baptized with the</i> <i>Holy Ghost-not many days hence</i>, i.e. in a short time this Spirit shall be given, which is to abide with you for ever. Hence we learn that the promise of the Holy Spirit is given to the whole body of Christians-to all that believe on Christ as dying for their sins, and rising for their justification.</p>
