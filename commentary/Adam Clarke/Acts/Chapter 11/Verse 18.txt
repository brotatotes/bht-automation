As the word μετανοια, which we translate <i>repentance</i>, signifies literally <i>a change of</i> <i>mind</i>, it may be here referred to a change of religious views, c. And as <i>repentance</i> signifies a change of <i>life</i> and <i>conduct</i>, from evil to good, so the word μετανοια may be used here to signify a change from a false religion to the true one from idolatry, to the worship of the true God. <i>Rosenmuller</i> thinks that, in several cases, where it is spoken of the Jews, it signifies their change from a <i>contempt of the Messiah</i> to <i>reverence for him</i>, and the consequent embracing of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>The Christians who were present were all satisfied with St. Peter's account and apology; but it does not appear that all were ultimately satisfied, as we know there were serious disputes in the Church <i>afterwards</i> on this very subject: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:5">Acts 15:5</span>, &amp;c., where Christian believers, from among the Pharisees, insisted that it was necessary to circumcise the converted Gentiles, and cause them to keep the law of Moses. This opinion was carried much farther in the Church at Jerusalem afterwards, as may be seen at large in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>, &amp;c.</p>
