<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:2">Acts 11:2</span>. <i><b>Contended with him</b></i> â€” A manifest proof this that the <i>primitive</i> Church at Jerusalem (and no Church can ever deserve this name but the Jerusalem Church) had no conception of St. Peter's <i>supremacy</i>, or of his being <i>prince of the apostles</i>. He is now called to account for his conduct, which they judged to be reprehensible; and which they would not have attempted to do had they believed him to be Christ's <i>vicar</i> upon earth, and the infallible Head of the Church. But this absurd dream is every where refuted in the New Testament.</p>
