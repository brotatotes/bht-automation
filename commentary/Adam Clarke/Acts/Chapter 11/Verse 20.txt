<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:20">Acts 11:20</span>. <i><b>Men of - Cyrene</b></i> — The metropolis of the Cyrenaica; a country of Africa, bounded on the east by Marmarica, on the west by the Regio Syrtica, on the north by the Mediterranean, and on the south by the Sahara. Cyrene is now called Cairoan. This city, according to Eusebius, was built in the 37th Olympiad, about 630 years before Christ. In consequence of a revolt of its inhabitants, it was destroyed by the Romans; but they afterwards rebuilt it. It was for a long time subject to the <i>Arabs</i>, but is now in the hands of the <i>Turks</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Spake unto the Grecians</b></i> — ελληνιστας, <i>The Hellenists</i>. Who these were, we have already seen <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:0">Acts 6:0</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:29">Acts 9:29</span>, viz. Jews living in Greek cities and speaking the Greek language. But, instead of ελληνιστας, <i>Grecians</i>, ελληνας, <i>Greeks</i>, is the reading of AD*, <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Vulgate</i>, some copies of the <i>Itala, Eusebius, Chrysostom,</i> <i>Theophylact</i>, and <i>OEcumenius</i>. On this evidence, Griesbach has admitted it into the text; and few critics entertain any doubt of the genuineness of the reading. This intimates that, besides preaching the Gospel to the <i>Hellenistic Jews</i>, some of them preached it to <i>heathen Greeks</i>; for, were we to adopt the common reading, it would be a sort of <i>actum agere</i>; for it is certain that the Hellenistic Jews had already received the Gospel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>. And it is likely that these Cyprians and Cyrenians had heard of Peter's mission to Caesarea, and they followed his example by offering the Christian faith to the heathen. It is worthy of remark that the Jews generally called all nations of the world <i>Greeks</i>; as the Asiatics, to the present day, call all the nations of Europe <i>Franks</i>.</p>
