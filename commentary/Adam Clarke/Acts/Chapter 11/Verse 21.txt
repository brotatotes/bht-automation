<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:21">Acts 11:21</span>. <i><b>The hand of the Lord was with them</b></i> — By the <i>hand, arm</i>, and, <i>finger</i> of God, in the Scripture, different displays or exertions of his power are intended. Here it means that the energy of God accompanied them, and applied their preaching to the souls of all attentive hearers. Without this accompanying influence, even an <i>apostle</i> could do no good; and can <i>inferior</i> men hope to be able to convince and convert sinners without this? Ministers of the word of God, so called, who dispute the necessity and deny the being of this influence, show thereby that they are intruders into God's heritage; that they are not sent by <i>him</i>, and shall not profit the people at all.</p>
<p><i><b>A great number believed</b></i> — That Jesus was the Christ; and that he had died for their offenses, and risen again for their justification. Because the apostles preached the truth, and the <i>hand of God</i> was with them, therefore, <i>a great number believed,</i> <i>and turned unto the Lord</i>, becoming his disciples, and taking him for their portion.</p>
