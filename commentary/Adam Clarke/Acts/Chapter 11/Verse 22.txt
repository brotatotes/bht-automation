<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:22">Acts 11:22</span>. <i><b>The Church which was in Jerusalem</b></i> — This was the <i>original</i>, the <i>mother Church</i> of Christianity; not the <i>Church</i> of <i>Rome</i>; there were Christian Churches founded in many places, which exist to the present day, before Rome heard the Gospel of the kingdom. A Christian Church means a company of believers in Christ Jesus, united for the purposes of Christian fellowship, and edification in righteousness.</p>
<p><i><b>They sent forth Barnabas</b></i> — It seems, then, that the Church collectively had power to commission and send forth any of its own members, whom it saw God had qualified for a particular work. There must have been, even at that time, an acknowledged superiority of some members of the Church beyond others. The <i>apostles</i> held the <i>first</i> rank; the <i>deacons</i> (probably the same as those called prophets, as being next chosen) the <i>second</i>; and perhaps those called <i>evangelists</i>, simply preachers of the truth, the <i>third</i> rank. Those who knew most of God and sacred things, who were most zealous, most holy, and most useful, undoubtedly had the <i>pre-eminence</i>.</p>
