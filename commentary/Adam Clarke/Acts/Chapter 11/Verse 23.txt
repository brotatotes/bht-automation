<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:23">Acts 11:23</span>. <i><b>Had seen the grace of God</b></i> — That is, had seen the <i>effects</i> produced by the grace of God. By the grace of God, we are to understand:</p>
<p>1. His favour.</p>
<p>2. The manifestations of that favour in the communication of spiritual blessings. And,</p>
<p>3. Principles of light, life, holiness, c., producing effects demonstrative of the causes from which they sprung.</p>
<p>Barnabas saw that these people were objects of the Divine approbation that they were abundantly blessed and edified together as a Christian Church; and that they had received especial influences from God, by his indwelling Spirit, which were to them <i>incentives</i> to faith, hope, and love, and also <i>principles</i> of conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>Was glad,</b></i> — Not envious because God had blessed the labours of <i>others</i> of his Master's servants, but rejoiced to find that the work of salvation was carried on by such instruments as God chose, and condescended to use. They who cannot rejoice in the conversion of sinners, because <i>they</i> have not been the <i>means</i> of it, or because such converts or their ministers have not precisely the same views of certain doctrines which they have themselves, show that they have little, if any thing, of the mind that was in Christ, in them.</p>
<p><i><b>With purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</b></i> — These converts had begun well; they must <i>continue</i> and <i>persevere</i>: God gave them the <i>grace</i>, the <i>principle</i> of life and action; it was their business to <i>use</i> this. If they did not, the gift would be resumed. Barnabas well knew that they must have the <i>grace of God</i> <i>in them</i> to enable them to do any good; but he knew, also, that its being in them did not necessarily imply that it <i>must continue</i> there. God had taught him that if they were not workers together with that grace they would receive it in vain; i.e., the end for which it was given would not be answered. He therefore exhorted them, τηπροθεσειτηςκαρδιας, with <i>determination</i> of heart, with <i>set, fixed purpose</i> and <i>resolution</i>, that they would cleave unto the Lord, προσμενειντωκυριω, <i>to remain with the Lord</i>; to <i>continue</i> in union and fellowship with him; to be faithful in keeping his truth, and obedient in the practice of it. To be a Christian is to be united to Christ, to be of one spirit with him: to continue to be a Christian is to continue in that union. It is absurd to talk of being children of God, and of absolute, final perseverance, when the soul has lost its spiritual union. There is no perseverance but <i>in cleaving to the Lord</i>: he who in his <i>works</i> denies him does not <i>cleave</i> to him. Such a one is not of God; if he ever had the salvation of God, he has lost it; he is fallen from grace; nor is there a word in the book of God, fairly and honestly understood, that says such a person shall <i>absolutely and</i> <i>unavoidably arise</i> from his fall.</p>
