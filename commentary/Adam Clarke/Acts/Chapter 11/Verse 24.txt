<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:24">Acts 11:24</span>. <i><b>For he was a good man</b></i> — Here is a proper character of a minister of the Gospel.</p>
<p>1. <i>He is a good man</i>: his <i>bad heart</i> is changed; his <i>evil</i> <i>dispositions</i> rooted out; and the mind that was in Christ implanted in him.</p>
<p>2. <i>He is full of the Holy Ghost</i>. He is holy, because the Spirit of holiness dwells in him: he has not a few transient visitations or drawings from that Spirit; it is a <i>resident</i> in his soul, and it fills his heart. It is <i>light</i> in his <i>understanding</i>; it is <i>discrimination</i> in his <i>judgment</i>; it is <i>fixed purpose</i> and <i>determination</i> in righteousness in his <i>will</i>; it is <i>purity</i>, it is love, joy, peace, gentleness, goodness, meekness, temperance, and fidelity in his <i>affections</i> and <i>passions</i>. In a word, it has sovereign sway in his heart; it governs all passions, and is the <i>motive</i> and <i>principle</i> of every righteous <i>action</i>.</p>
<p>3. He was full <i>of faith</i>. He implicitly credited his Lord; he knew that he could not lie-that his word could not fail; he expected, not only the fulfilment of all promises, but also every degree of help, light, life, and comfort, which God might at any time see necessary for his Church, he prayed for the Divine blessing, and he believed that he should not pray in vain. His faith never failed, because it laid hold on that God who could not change. Behold, ye preachers of the Gospel! an original minister of Christ. Emulate his piety, his faith, and his usefulness.</p>
<p><i><b>Much people was added unto the Lord.</b></i> — No wonder, when they had <i>such a minister</i>, preaching by the power of the Holy Ghost, <i>such</i> <i>a Gospel</i> as that of Jesus Christ.</p>
