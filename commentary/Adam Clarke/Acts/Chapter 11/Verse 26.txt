<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>. <i><b>He brought him unto Antioch</b></i> — As this city was the metropolis of Syria, and the third city for importance in the whole Roman empire, Rome and Alexandria alone being more eminent, Barnabas might think it expedient to have for his assistance a person of such eminent talents as Saul; and who was especially appointed by Christ to proclaim the Gospel to the <i>Gentiles</i>. Saul appears also to have been a thorough master of the Greek tongue, and, consequently, the better qualified to explain the Gospel to the Greek philosophers, and to defend it against their cavils. Barnabas, also being a native of <i>Cyprus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span>, where the Greek language was spoken, was judged to be proper for this mission, perhaps on this account, as well as on account of his disinterestedness, holiness, and zeal.</p>
<p><i><b>And the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</b></i> — It is evident they had the name <i>Christians</i> from CHRIST their master; as the <i>Platonists</i> and <i>Pythagoreans</i> had their name from their masters, <i>Plato</i> and <i>Pythagoras</i>. Now, as these had their name from those great masters because they attended their teaching, and credited their doctrines, so the disciples were called <i>Christians</i> because they took Christ for their teacher, crediting his doctrines, and following the <i>rule of life</i> laid down by him. It has been a question, by whom was this name given to the disciples? Some think <i>they</i> assumed it; others, that the <i>inhabitants</i> of Antioch gave it to them; and others, that it was given by <i>Saul</i> and <i>Barnabas</i>. This later opinion is favoured by the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, which reads the 25th and 26th verses thus: <i>And hearing that Saul was at</i> <i>Tarsus, he departed, seeking for him; and having found him, he</i> <i>besought him to come to Antioch; who, when they were come,</i> <i>assembled with the Church a whole year, and instructed a great</i> <i>number; and there they first called the disciples at Antioch</i> <i>Christians</i>.</p>
<p>The word χρηματισαι in our common text, which we translate <i>were</i> <i>called</i>, signifies in the New Testament, to <i>appoint, warn</i>, or <i>nominate</i>, by <i>Divine direction</i>. In this sense, the word is used, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:12">Matthew 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:26">Luke 2:26</span>; and in the preceding chapter of this book, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:22">Acts 10:22</span>. If, therefore, the name was given by <i>Divine appointment</i>, it as most likely that Saul and Barnabas were directed to give it; and that, therefore, the name <i>Christian</i> is from God, as well as that grace and holiness which are so essentially required and implied in the character. Before this time. the Jewish converts were simply called, among themselves, <i>disciples</i>, i.e. scholars; <i>believers, saints, the Church</i>, or <i>assembly</i>; and, by their enemies, <i>Nazarenes, Galileans</i>, the <i>men</i> <i>of this way</i> or <i>sect</i>; and perhaps lay other names which are not come down to us. They considered themselves as <i>one family</i>; and hence the appellation of <i>brethren</i> was frequent among them. It was the design of God to make all who believed of one <i>heart</i> and <i>one</i> <i>soul</i>, that they might consider him as their Father, and live and love like children of the same household. A <i>Christian</i>, therefore, is the highest character which any human being can bear upon earth; and to receive it from God, as those appear to have done-how glorious the title! It is however worthy of remark that this name occurs in only three places in the New Testament: here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:28">Acts 26:28</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span>.</p>
