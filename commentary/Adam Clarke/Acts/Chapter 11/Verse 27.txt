Verse Acts 11:27. Came prophets from Jerusalem â€” Though the term prophet is used in the New Testament simply to signify a teacher, (Genesis 20:7; Genesis 20:7, where the subject is largely explained,) yet here it evidently means also such as are under Divine inspiration, and foretold future events. This was certainly the case with Agabus, Acts 11:28, though, perhaps, his ordinary character was that of a teacher or preacher. It seems from various scriptures, Romans 12:4, c., Acts 13:2-40, that the prophets of the New Testament were:1. Teachers or preachers in general.2. Persons who, on special occasions, were under the influence of the Divine Spirit, and then foretold certain future events.3. Persons who recited hymns to the honour of God in the public assemblies of the Christians.4. Persons who prayed in those assemblies, having sometimes the gift of tongues, at other times not.From Ephesians 2:20; Ephesians 3:5, we learn that the prophets of the Christian Church were inferior to the apostles; but, from Ephesians 4:11, we see that they were superior to all other teachers, even to evangelists and pastors.
