<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:27">Acts 11:27</span>. <i><b>Came prophets from Jerusalem</b></i> â€” Though the term <i>prophet</i> is used in the New Testament simply to signify a <i>teacher</i>, (<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:7">Genesis 20:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:7">Genesis 20:7</span></span>, where the subject is largely explained,) yet here it evidently means also such as are under <i>Divine inspiration</i>, and foretold future events. This was certainly the case with Agabus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>, though, perhaps, his ordinary character was that of a <i>teacher</i> or <i>preacher</i>. It seems from various scriptures, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:4">Romans 12:4</span>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2-40">Acts 13:2-40</span>, that the prophets of the New Testament were:</p>
<p>1. <i>Teachers</i> or <i>preachers</i> in general.</p>
<p>2. Persons who, on <i>special occasions</i>, were under the influence of the Divine Spirit, and then foretold certain future events.</p>
<p>3. Persons who recited hymns to the honour of God in the public assemblies of the Christians.</p>
<p>4. Persons who prayed in those assemblies, having sometimes the gift of tongues, at other times not.</p>
<p>From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>, we learn that the <i>prophets</i> of the Christian Church were <i>inferior</i> to the <i>apostles</i>; but, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>, we see that they were <i>superior</i> to all other teachers, even to <i>evangelists</i> and <i>pastors</i>.</p>
