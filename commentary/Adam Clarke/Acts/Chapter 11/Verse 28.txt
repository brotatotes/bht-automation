<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>. <i><b>Agabus</b></i> — This prophet, of whom we know nothing, is once more mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:10">Acts 21:10</span>. He was probably a <i>Jew</i>, but whether converted now to Christianity we cannot tell.</p>
<p><i><b>Great dearth throughout all the world</b></i> — The words εφ ολην την οικουμενην probably here mean <i>the land of Judea</i>; though sometimes by this phrase the whole <i>Roman empire</i> is intended. In the former sense the disciples appear to have understood it, as the next verse informs us; for they determined to send relief to their brethren in <i>Judea</i>, which they could not have done had the famine been <i>general</i>. It does not appear that they expected it to extend even to <i>Antioch</i> in Syria, where they then were, else they would have thought of making provision for <i>themselves</i>.</p>
<p>It is well known from history that there were <i>several famines</i> in the reign of Claudius. <i>Dion Cassius</i>, lib. lx., mentions a severe famine in the <i>first</i> and <i>second</i> year of the reign of Claudius, which was sorely felt ln Rome itself. This famine, it is supposed, induced Claudius to build a port at <i>Ostia</i>, for the more regular supply of Rome with provisions.</p>
<p>A <i>second</i> famine happened about the fourth year of this reign, which continued for several years, and greatly afflicted the land of Judea. Several authors notice this, but particularly Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. lib. xx. cap. 5, sect. 2, where, having mentioned <i>Tiberius</i> <i>Alexander</i> as succeeding to the procuratorship in the place of <i>Cuspius Fadus</i>, he says that, "during the government of these procurators, a great famine afflicted Judea." Επι τουτοις δη και τον μεγαν λιμον κατα την Ιουδαιαν συνεβη γενεσθαι.</p>
<p>A <i>third</i> famine is mentioned by Eusebius, in <i>An. Abrahami</i>, which commences with the calends of October, A.D. 48, which was so powerful "in Greece that a modius (about <i>half a bushel</i> of grain) was sold for six drachms," about three shillings and sixpence English. Vid. <i>Euseb</i>. in Chron. edit. <i>Scalig</i>. The same author mentions another famine in Rome, in the tenth year of Claudius, of which <i>Orosius</i> gives the details, lib. vii.</p>
<p>A <i>fourth</i> famine, which took place in the <i>eleventh</i> year of Claudius, is mentioned by <i>Tacitus</i>, Annal. lib. xii. sect. 43, in which there was so great a dearth of provisions, and famine in consequence, that it was esteemed a Divine judgment. <i>Frugrum</i> <i>quoque egestas, et orta ex ea fames, in prodigium accipiebatur</i>. At this time, the same author tells us, that in all the stores of Rome there were no more than fifteen days' provision; and, had not the winter been uncommonly mild, the utmost distress and misery must have prevailed.</p>
<p>It may now be inquired, to which of these famines in the reign of Claudius does the prophecy of Agabus refer? Most learned men are of opinion that the famine of which Agabus prophesied was that mentioned above, which took place in the <i>fourth</i> year of this emperor. A.D. 47. This famine is particularly mentioned by Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. lib xx. cap. 2, sect. 5, who describes it as "a very great famine, in which many died for want of food." - "That Helena, queen of Adiabene, who had embraced the Jewish religion, sent some of her servants to Alexandria, to buy a great quantity of corn; and others of them to Cyprus, to buy a cargo of dried figs, which she distributed to those who were in want." And in cap. 5, sect. 2, he says that this happened" when Tiberius Alexander succeeded Cuspids Fadus; and that under <i>these</i> <i>procurators</i> the famine happened in which Queen Helena, at a vast expense, procured relief to the Jews." Dr. Hudson's note on this passage in Josephus deserves to be copied: "This," says he, "is that famine foretold by Agabus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>, which happened when Claudius was consul the <i>fourth</i> time, (A.D. 47,) and not that which happened when Claudius was consul the second time, and Caecina was his colleague, (A.D. 42,) as Scaliger says, upon Eusebius, p. 174. Now when Josephus had said, a little after, cap. 5, sect. 2, that Tiberius Alexander succeeded Cuspius Fadus as procurator, he immediately subjoins, <i>under these procurators there happened a</i> <i>great famine in Judea</i>." From this it is evident that this famine must have continued several years, as it existed under <i>both</i> these <i>procurators</i>. Fadus, says Mr. Whiston, was not sent into Judea till after the death of Agrippa, i.e. towards the end of the fourth year of Claudius, in the end of A.D. 44, or beginning of 45. So that this famine, foretold by Agabus, happened on the fifth, sixth, and seventh years of Claudius, A.D. 45, 46, and 47. See <i>Whiston's</i> Josephus; and see <i>Krebs'</i> Observat. in Nov. Test. on this place.</p>
