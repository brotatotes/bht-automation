<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:11">Acts 12:11</span>. <i><b>When Peter was come to himself</b></i> — Every thing he saw astonished him; he could scarcely credit his eyes; he was in a sort of ecstasy; and it was only when the angel left him that he was fully convinced that all was real.</p>
<p><i><b>Now I know - that the Lord hath sent his angel</b></i> — The poor German divine is worthy of pity, who endeavoured to persuade himself and his countrymen that all this talk about the angel was mere illusion; that Peter was delivered in a way which he could not comprehend, and therefore was led to attribute to a particular providence of God what probably was done by the prefect of the prison, who favoured him! But it is the study of this writer to banish from the word of God all supernatural influence; and to reduce even the miracles of Christ to simple operations of nature, or to the workings of imagination and the prejudices of a weak and credulous people. Such men should at once cast off the mask which so thinly covers their infidelity, and honestly avow themselves to be, what they are, the enemies of revelation in general, and of the Christian religion in particular. Peter could say, <i>Now I know</i> <i>of a certainty that the Lord hath sent his angel, and delivered</i> <i>me</i>, c. No such thing, says Mr. E., Peter was <i>deceived</i> it was not the <i>Lord</i>, it was the <i>prefect</i> or some other person. Now we know that Peter spoke by the Holy Ghost; but we have no much testimony of Mr. E. nor of any of his associates.</p>
<p><i><b>And all the expectation of the - Jews.</b></i> — It seems they had built much on the prospect of having him sacrificed, as they already had James.</p>
