<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:13">Acts 12:13</span>. <i><b>As Peter knocked</b></i> — The door was probably shut for fear of the Jews; and, as most of the houses in the east have an area before the door, it might have been at this outer gate that Peter stood knocking.</p>
<p><i><b>A damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</b></i> — She came to inquire who was there. Rhoda signifies a <i>rose</i>; and it appears to have been customary with he Jews, as Grotius and others remark, to give the names of flowers and trees to their daughters: thus <i>Susannah</i> signifies a <i>lily, Hadassah</i>, a <i>myrtle, Tamar</i>, a <i>palm tree</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
