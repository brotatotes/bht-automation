<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:17">Acts 12:17</span>. <i><b>Declared-how the Lord had brought him out of the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>prison.</b></i> — He still persisted in the belief that his deliverance was purely supernatural. It seems that some modern critics could have informed him of his mistake. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:11">Acts 12:11</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Show these things unto James, and to the brethren</b></i> — That is, in one word, show them to the Church, at the <i>head</i> of which James undoubtedly was; as we may clearly understand by the part he took in the famous council held at Jerusalem, relative to certain differences between the believing Jews and Gentiles. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:13-21">Acts 15:13-21</span>. There is still no <i>supremacy</i> for Peter. He who was bishop or overseer of the Church at Jerusalem was certainly at the head of the whole Church of God at this time; but James was then bishop or inspector of the Church at Jerusalem, and, consequently, was the only <i>visible head</i> then upon earth.</p>
<p><i><b>He departed - into another place.</b></i> — Some popish writers say that he went to Rome, and founded a Christian Church there. Those who can believe any thing may believe this. <i>Where</i> he went we know not; but it is probable that he withdrew for the present into a place of privacy, till the heat of the inquiry was over relative to his escape from the prison; for he saw that Herod was intent on his death.</p>
