<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>. <i><b>He killed James the brother of John with the sword.</b></i> â€” This was <i>James</i> the <i>greater</i>, son of Zebedee, and must be distinguished from <i>James</i> the <i>less</i>, son of Alpheus. This latter was put to death by Ananias the high priest, during the reign of Nero. This James with his brother John were those who requested to sit on the right and left hand of our Lord, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>; and our Lord's prediction was now fulfilled in one of them, who by his martyrdom drank of our Lord's cup, and was baptized with his baptism. By the death of James, the number of the apostles was reduced to <i>eleven</i>; and we do not find that ever it was filled up. The apostles never had any <i>successors</i>: God has continued their <i>doctrine</i>, but not their <i>order</i>.</p>
<p>By <i>killing with the sword</i> we are to understand <i>beheading</i>. Among the Jews there were <i>four</i> kinds of deaths:</p>
<p>1. <i>Stoning</i>;</p>
<p>2. <i>burning;</i></p>
<p>3. <i>killing with the sword</i>, or <i>beheading</i>; and,</p>
<p>4. <i>strangling</i>.</p>
<p>The third was a Roman as well as a Jewish mode of punishment. <i>Killing</i> <i>with the sword</i> was the punishment which, according to the Talmud, was inflicted on those who drew away the people to any strange worship, <i>Sanhedr</i>. fol. iii. James was probably accused of this, and hence the punishment mentioned in the text.</p>
