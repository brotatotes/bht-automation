<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:20">Acts 12:20</span>. <i><b>Highly displeased with them of Tyre</b></i> — On what account Herod was thus displeased is not related by any historian, as far as I have been able to ascertain. Josephus, who speaks of this journey of Herod to Caesarea, says nothing of it; and it is useless for us to conjecture.</p>
<p><i><b>Having made Blastus-their friend</b></i> — Blastus was probably a eunuch, and had considerable influence over his master Herod; and, to reach the master, it is likely they <i>bribed</i> the chamberlain.</p>
<p><i><b>Desired peace</b></i> — The Tyrians and Sidonians being equally subjects of the Roman government with the inhabitants of Galilee, Herod could not go to war with them; but, being irritated against them, he might prevent their supplies: they therefore endeavoured to be on <i>peaceable</i>, i.e. friendly, terms with him.</p>
<p><i><b>Their country was nourished by the king's</b></i> country.] That is, they had all their supplies from Galilee; for Tyre and Sidon, being places of trade and commerce, with little territory, were obliged to have all their provisions from the countries under Herod's jurisdiction. This had been the case even from the days of Solomon, as we learn <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+5:11">1 Kings 5:11</span>; where it is said that <i>Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat, for food</i> <i>to his household; and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave</i> <i>Solomon to Hiram year by year</i>.
