<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:23">Acts 12:23</span>. <i><b>The angel of the Lord smote him</b></i> — His death was most evidently a judgment from God.</p>
<p><i><b>Because he gave not God the glory</b></i> — He did not rebuke his flatterers, but permitted them to give him that honour that was due to God alone. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:21">Acts 12:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:21">Acts 12:21</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And was eaten of worms</b></i> — Whether this was the <i>morbus pedicularis</i>, or whether a violent inflammation of his bowels, terminating in putrefaction, did not actually produce <i>worms</i>, which, for several days, swarmed in his infected entrails, we cannot tell. It is most likely that this latter was the case; and this is at once more agreeable to the <i>letter</i> of the text, and to the circumstances of the case as related by Josephus.</p>
<p><i><b>And gave up the ghost.</b></i> — That is, he died of the disorder by which he was then seized, after having lingered, in excruciating torments, for <i>five days</i>, as Josephus has stated. Antiochus Epiphanes and Herod the Great died of the same kind of disease. See the observations at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:26">Acts 1:26</span> relative to the death of Judas.</p>
