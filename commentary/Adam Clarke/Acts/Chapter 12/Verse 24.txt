Verse Acts 12:24. But the word of God — The Christian doctrine preached by the apostles grew and multiplied-became more evident, and had daily accessions; for the spirit of revelation rested on those men, and God was daily adding to that word as circumstances required, in order to complete that testimony of his which we now find contained in the New Testament. As there is in the original an allusion to the vegetation of grain, (ηυξανε, it grew, as corn grows, the stalk and the ear; και επληθυνετο, it was multiplied, as the corn is in the full ear,) there is probably a reference to the parable of the SOWER and his seed; for the seed is the word of God, and the doctrine of the kingdom. It was liberally sown; it grew vigorously, and became greatly multiplied. And why? Because it was the word, the doctrine of God-there was no corruption in it; and because God watered it with the dew of heaven from on high.
