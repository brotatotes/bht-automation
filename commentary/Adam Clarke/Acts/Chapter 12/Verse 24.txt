<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:24">Acts 12:24</span>. <i><b>But the word of God</b></i> — The Christian doctrine preached by the apostles <i>grew</i> and <i>multiplied</i>-became more <i>evident</i>, and had daily <i>accessions</i>; for the spirit of <i>revelation</i> rested on those men, and God was daily <i>adding</i> to that <i>word</i> as circumstances required, in order to complete that testimony of his which we now find contained in the New Testament. As there is in the original an allusion to the <i>vegetation</i> of grain, (ηυξανε, <i>it grew</i>, as corn grows, the <i>stalk</i> and <i>the ear</i>; και επληθυνετο, <i>it was</i> <i>multiplied</i>, as the corn is in the <i>full ear</i>,) there is probably a reference to the <i>parable of the SOWER and his seed</i>; for the <i>seed</i> <i>is the word of God</i>, and the <i>doctrine of the kingdom</i>. It was <i>liberally</i> sown; it grew <i>vigorously</i>, and became <i>greatly</i> <i>multiplied</i>. And why? Because it was the <i>word</i>, the <i>doctrine of</i> <i>God</i>-there was no <i>corruption</i> in it; and because God <i>watered</i> it with the <i>dew of heaven</i> from on high.</p>
