<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:4">Acts 12:4</span>. <i><b>Four quaternions of soldiers</b></i> — That is, <i>sixteen</i>, or four companies of <i>four men</i> each, who had the care of the prison, each company taking in turn one of the four watches of the night.</p>
<p><i><b>Intending after Easter to bring him forth</b></i> — μετα το τασχα, <i>After</i> <i>the passover</i>. Perhaps there never was a more unhappy, not to say absurd, translation than that in our text. But, before I come to explain the word, it is necessary to observe that our term called Easter is not exactly the same with the Jewish passover. This festival is always held on the fourteenth day of the first vernal full moon; but the Easter of the Christians, never till the <i>next</i> Sabbath after said full moon; and, to avoid all conformity with the Jews in this matter, if the fourteenth day of the first vernal full moon happen on a Sabbath, then the festival of Easter is deferred till the Sabbath following. The first vernal moon is that whose fourteenth day is either on the day of the vernal equinox, or the next fourteenth day after it. The vernal equinox, according to a decree of the council of <i>Nice</i>, is fixed to the 21st day of March; and therefore the first vernal moon is that whose fourteenth day falls upon the 21st of March, or the first fourteenth day after. Hence it appears that the next Sabbath after the fourteenth day of the vernal moon, which is called the <i>Paschal</i> <i>term</i>, is always <i>Easter day</i>. And, therefore, the earliest <i>Paschal</i> <i>term</i> being the 21st of March, the 22d of March is the <i>earliest</i> Easter possible; and the 18th of April being the latest <i>Paschal</i> <i>term</i>, the seventh day after, that is the 25th of April, is the <i>latest</i> Easter possible.</p>
<p>The term <i>Easter</i>, inserted here by our translators, they borrowed from the ancient Anglo-Saxon service-books, or from the version of the Gospels, which always translates the το πασχα of the Greek by this term; e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:2">Matthew 26:2</span>: <i>Ye know that after two days is the</i> feast of the <i>passover</i>. [Anglo-Saxon] <i>Wite ye that aefter twam dagum beoth Eastro</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>: <i>And they made ready the passover</i>. [Anglo-Saxon] <i>And hig</i> <i>gegearwodon hym Easter thenunga</i> (i.e. the <i>paschal supper</i>.) Prefixed to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span>, are these words: [Anglo-Saxon] <i>This part to be read on Easter even</i>. And, before <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:8">Matthew 28:8</span>, these words: [Anglo-Saxon] <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:12">Mark 14:12</span>: <i>And the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the</i> <i>passover</i>. [Anglo-Saxon] <i>And tham forman daegeazimorum, tha hi</i> <i>Eastron offrodon</i>. Other examples occur in this version. <i>Wiclif</i> used the word <i>paske</i>, i.e. passover; but <i>Tindal, Coverdale, Becke</i>, and <i>Cardmarden</i>, following the old Saxon mode of translation, insert <i>Easter</i>: the <i>Geneva</i> Bible very properly renders it the <i>passover</i>. The Saxon [Anglo-Saxon] are different modes of spelling the name of the goddess Easter, whose festival was celebrated by our pagan forefathers on the month of April; hence that month, in the Saxon calendar, is called [Anglo-Saxon] <i>Easter</i> <i>month</i>. Every view we can take of this subject shows the gross impropriety of retaining a name every way exceptionable, and palpably absurd.</p>
