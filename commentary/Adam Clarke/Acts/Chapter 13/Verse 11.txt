<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span>. <i><b>The hand of the Lord</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>upon thee</b></i> — The <i>power</i> of God is now about to deal with thee in the way of <i>justice</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou shalt be blind</b></i> — Every word here proves the immediate inspiration of Paul. He was full of the Holy Ghost when he began this address: by the light of that Spirit he discerned the state of Elymas, and exposed his real character; and, by the prophetic influence of that same Spirit, he predicted the calamity that was about to fall upon him, while as yet <i>there was no sign of his</i> <i>blindness</i>! Mark this!</p>
<p><i><b>Not seeing the sun for a season.</b></i> — In the midst of judgment God remembers mercy. This blindness was not to be <i>perpetual</i>: it was intended to be the means of awakening and softening the hard heart of this poor sinner. There is an ancient tradition, and it is mentioned both by <i>Origen</i> and <i>Chrysostom</i>, that Elymas, in consequence of this became a sincere convert to the religion of Christ. Origen says: "And Paul by a word striking him blind, who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paul, δια των πονων επιστρεφει αυτον εις θεοσεβειαν, by anguish converted him to godliness." And, commenting on-<i>Thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun</i>, αχρι καιρου, <i>for a season</i>, asks, "And why for a <i>season</i>? That, being smitten on account of his transgressions, and brought to repentance, he might at last be deemed worthy to see the sun, not only with his <i>body</i>, but with his <i>mind</i>; that the Divine virtue might be proclaimed in restoring him to sight, and his soul, believing, might receive godliness." Com. in Exod., vol. i. p. 117, edit. de la Rue, Par. 1733.</p>
<p><i><b>There fell on him a mist and darkness</b></i> — αχλυς, <i>achlus</i>, is a disordered state of the eye, in which the patient sees through a <i>thick mist</i>. This thick mist, or perturbed state of the eye, took place first: it increased, and σκοτος, <i>thick</i>, positive <i>darkness</i>, was the issue.</p>
<p><i><b>He went about</b></i> — πεπιαγων. Not knowing how to take a right step, he <i>groped</i> about in great uncertainty; and, not being able to find his way, he sought for some persons to lead him by the hand. This state of Elymas is inimitably expressed in one of the cartoons of Raphael, now at Hampton-court, (and lately engraved, in the true spirit of the original, by Mr. Thomas Holloway,) in which his whole figure expresses the depth of <i>distress, concern,</i> <i>uncertainty</i>, and <i>confusion</i>; and, to use a word common in exhibiting this matchless piece of painting, <i>he is blind from head</i> <i>to foot</i>. In this manner the text authorizes the painter to express the state of this miserable culprit.</p>
