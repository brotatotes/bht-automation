<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:12">Acts 13:12</span>. <i><b>The deputy - believed</b></i> — This was a proof that the doctrine was true; and that the power of God, from which nothing could be concealed, and which nothing could resist, was with these preachers.</p>
<p><i><b>Being astonished</b></i> — εκπλησσομενος, Being struck with astonishment, as Elymas was struck with blindness. Thus the word of God is a two-edged sword: it smites the sinner with judgment or compunction; and the sincere inquirer after truth, with conviction of its own worth and excellence.</p>
