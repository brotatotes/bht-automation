<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13">Acts 13:13</span>. <i><b>Paul and his company loosed from Paphos</b></i> — They sailed away from this island, leaving, it may be presumed, Elymas a sincere and deeply humbled <i>penitent</i>; and Sergius Paul, a thorough and happy <i>believer</i> in the doctrine of Christ.</p>
<p>Previously to this time, St. Luke always mentions Barnabas <i>before</i> Paul; but after this he mentions Paul always <i>first</i>; probably after seeing how God had distinguished him in the late proceedings at Cyprus; as much of the Holy Spirit now rested upon him.</p>
<p><i><b>They came to Perga in Pamphylia</b></i> — As Perga was not a maritime town, it is conjectured that the apostles sailed up the river <i>Cestrus</i>, in order to come to this place, which, according to <i>Strabo</i>, was situated about sixty leagues up this river, and near to which was a famous temple dedicated to <i>Diana</i>. For Pamphylia, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:10">Acts 2:10</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And John departing from them</b></i> — Why John Mark left his brethren at this place we are not informed; probably he went to visit his pious mother Mary at Jerusalem, and to see Peter, to whom he is supposed to have been much attached. It certainly was not with the approbation of Paul that he left them at this place, as we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span>; yet his departure does not seem to have merited the displeasure of Barnabas; for John Mark having met these apostles at Antioch, when Paul purposed to revisit the various places where they had planted the word of God, Barnabas was willing to take him with them; but Paul would not consent, because he had <i>departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them</i> <i>to the work</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:35-39">Acts 15:35-39</span>, and this occasioned a separation between Barnabas and Paul. It does not appear that John Mark was under any obligation to accompany them any longer or any farther than he pleased. He seems to have been little else than their <i>servant</i>, and certainly was not divinely appointed to this work, as <i>they</i> were; and consequently might leave them <i>innocently</i>, though not <i>kindly</i>, if they could not readily supply his place. In this respect John Mark might be to blame; but Barnabas, whose <i>nephew</i> he was, could look over this fault more easily than Paul, who could not find those motives to pass by what was reprehensible in his conduct which natural affection might furnish to his brother apostle.</p>
