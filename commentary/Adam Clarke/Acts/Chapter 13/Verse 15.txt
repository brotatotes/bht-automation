<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:15">Acts 13:15</span>. <i><b>After the reading of the law and the prophets</b></i> — A certain portion of the <i>law</i> and another of the <i>prophets</i>, was read every Sabbath; and the law was so divided as to be read over once every year. In the notes at the conclusion of Deuteronomy, I have considered this subject at large, and given a complete table of the <i>Parashoth</i>, sections of the law, and <i>Haphtaroth</i>, sections of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath in the year in the Jewish synagogues. To have an exact view of every part of the Jewish ecclesiastical economy, the reader will do well to consult the above mentioned <i>table</i>, and those which follow it: they have been drawn up with great care, attention, and indescribable labour.</p>
<p>It has been a question, in what language were the law and prophets read in a synagogue of <i>Pisidia</i>, for in that district Strabo informs us that <i>four</i> languages were spoken, viz. the <i>Pisidian</i>, the <i>Solyman</i>, the <i>Greek</i>, and the <i>Lydian</i>. Dr. Lightfoot conjectures, with great probability, that the Scriptures were read in the original <i>Hebrew</i>; and that an interpreter tendered the reading to the people in their mother tongue. There is no doubt that the Jews and proselytes understood the Greek tongue well; and they certainly had the <i>Septuagint</i> version among them.</p>
<p><i><b>The rulers of the synagogue</b></i> — These were the persons whose business it was to read the appointed sections, and to take care of the synagogue and its concerns; and to see that all was done decently and in order.</p>
<p><i><b>Sent unto them</b></i> — Seeing them to be Jews, they wished them to give some suitable address to the people, i.e. to the Jews who were then engaged in Divine worship; for the whole of the following discourse, which greatly resembles that of St. Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:1-53">Acts 7:1-53</span>, is directed to the <i>Jews</i> alone; and this was probably spoken either in <i>Hebrew</i> or <i>Greek</i>.</p>
<p><b>Ye </b><i><b>men</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>brethren</b></i> — ανδρες αδελφοι, <i>Men brethren</i>, a Hebraism for, "Ye men who are our brethren," i.e. <i>Jews</i>, as we ourselves are; but ανδρες is often an expletive, as we have already seen. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>If ye have any word of exhortation</b></i> — ει εστι λογος εν υμιν παρακλησεως. <i>If ye have any subject of consolation</i>, any word of <i>comfort</i> to us, who are sojourners in this strange land, speak it. The <i>Consolation of Israel</i> was an epithet of the Messiah among the Jews; and it is probable that it was in reference to him that the rulers of the synagogue spoke. That παρακλησις is to be understood here as meaning <i>consolation</i>, and this in reference to the Messiah, the whole of the following discourse will prove to the attentive reader; in which Paul shows the care and protection of God towards his people Israel, and the abundant provision he had made for their salvation by Jesus Christ. They wished for <i>consolation</i>, and he declared unto them <i>glad tidings</i>, and many felt the power and comfort of the doctrine of the cross.</p>
