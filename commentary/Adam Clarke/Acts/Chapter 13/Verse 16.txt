<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16">Acts 13:16</span>. <i><b>Men of Israel</b></i> â€” Ye that are <i>Jews by birth</i>; and <i>ye that</i> <i>fear God</i>-ye that are <i>proselytes</i> to the Jewish religion. In this discourse Paul proves that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, sent from God, not only for the salvation of the <i>Jews</i>, but of the <i>whole</i> <i>human race</i>. And this he does, not with the rhetorician's arts, but in a plain, simple detail of the history of Christ, and the most remarkable transactions of the people of God, which referred to his manifestation in the flesh. <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
