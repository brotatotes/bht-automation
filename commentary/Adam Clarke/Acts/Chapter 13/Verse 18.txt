<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:18">Acts 13:18</span>. <i><b>About the time of forty years</b></i> — The space of time between their coming out of Egypt, and going into the promised land.</p>
<p><i><b>Suffered he their manners</b></i> — ετροποφορησεναυτους; He dealt indulgently with them: howsoever they behaved towards him, he mercifully bore with, and kindly treated them. But instead of ετροποφορησεν, ACE, some others, with the <i>Syriac, Arabic,</i> <i>Coptic, AEthiopic</i>, and some of the fathers, read ετροφοφορησεν, which signifies, he <i>nourished</i> and <i>fed them</i>, or <i>bore them about in</i> <i>his arms as a tender nurse does her child</i>. This reading confirms the <i>marginal</i> conjecture, and agrees excellently with the scope of the place, and is a reading at least of equal value with that in the commonly received text. Griesbach has admitted it, and excluded the other. Both, when rightly understood, speak nearly the same sense; but the latter is the most expressive, and agrees best with Paul's discourse, and the history to which he alludes.
