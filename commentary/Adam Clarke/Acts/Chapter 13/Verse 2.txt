<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>. <i><b>As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted</b></i> — On Mondays and Thursdays it was usual with the more pious Jews to attend the public service in their synagogues, and to fast: the former is what we are to understand by <i>ministering to the Lord</i>. On the Sabbaths they attended the service in the synagogue, but did not fast. The Greek word, λειτουργουντων, signifies <i>performing the</i> <i>office</i> of <i>praying, supplicating, rendering thanks</i>, c.: hence the word λειτουργια, <i>liturgy, the work of prayer</i>, c., from λιτη, <i>supplication</i>, according to some or rather from λειτος, <i>common</i>, and εργον, <i>work</i>, the <i>common</i> or <i>public work</i>, in which all the people were engaged.</p>
<p><i><b>The Holy Ghost said</b></i> — A revelation of the Divine will was made to some person then present probably to either <i>Simeon</i>, or <i>Lucius</i>, or <i>Manaen</i>, mentioned before.</p>
<p><i><b>Separate me Barnabas and Saul.</b></i> — Consecrate, or set them apart, for the particular work whereunto I have called them. <i>How</i> this was done, we find in the next verse.</p>
