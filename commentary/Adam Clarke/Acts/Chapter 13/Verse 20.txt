<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:20">Acts 13:20</span>. <i><b>And after that he gave unto them judges about the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>space of four hundred and fifty years</b></i> — This is a most difficult passage, and has been termed by Scaliger, <i>Crux Chronologorum</i>. The apostle seems here to contradict the account in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:1">1 Kings 6:1</span>: <i>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after</i> <i>the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the</i> <i>fourth year of Solomon's reign, he began to build the house of the</i> <i>Lord</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sir Norton Knatchbull</i>, in his annotations upon difficult texts, has considered the various solutions proposed by learned men of the difficulty before us; and concludes that the words of the apostle should not be understood as meaning <i>how long</i> God gave them judges, but <i>when</i> he gave them; and therefore proposes that the first words of this verse, Και μετα ταυτα, ὡς ετεσι τετρακοσιοις και πεντηκοντα, should be referred to the words going <i>before</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:17">Acts 13:17</span>, that is, to the <i>time WHEN the God of the children of Israel chose their fathers</i>.</p>
<p>"Now this time wherein God may properly be said to have chosen their fathers, about 450 years before he gave them judges, is to be computed from the birth of Isaac, in whom God may properly be said to have chosen their fathers; for God, who had chosen Abraham out of all the people of the earth, chose Isaac at this time out of the children of Abraham, in whose family the covenant was to rest. To make this computation evident, let us observe that from the birth of Isaac to the birth of Jacob are 60 years; from thence to their going into Egypt, 130; from thence to the exodus, 210; from thence to their entrance into Canaan, 40; from that to the division of the land (about which time it is probable they began to settle their government by <i>judges</i>) 7 years; which sums make 447: viz. 60 + 130 + 210 + 40 + 7 = 447. And should this be reckoned from the year <i>before</i> the birth of Isaac, when God established his covenant between himself and Abraham, <i>and all his</i> <i>seed after him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:19">Genesis 17:19</span>, at which time God <i>properly chose their fathers</i>, then there will be 448 years, which brings it to within <i>two</i> years of the 450, which is sufficiently exact to bring it within the apostle's ως, <i>about</i>, or <i>nearly</i>.</p>
<p>"Some have made the period 452 years; which, though <i>two</i> years <i>more</i> than the apostle's round number, is still sufficiently reconcilable with his qualifying particle ως, <i>about</i>. And it may be added that the most correct writers often express a sum <i>totally</i>, but not <i>exactly</i>: so, with <i>Demosthenes</i> and <i>Plautus</i>, we find that called a <i>talent</i> where some <i>drachms</i> were either <i>wanting</i> or <i>abounding</i>."</p>
<p>The sacred writers often express themselves in the same way: e.g. <i>He made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the</i> <i>other; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it about</i>. Now we know that the circumference of any circle is only in <i>round</i> numbers to its diameter as <i>three</i> to <i>one</i>; but, correctly, is considerably more, nearly as 22 to 7. But even the Spirit of God does not see it necessary to enter into such niceties, which would only puzzle, and not instruct the common reader.</p>
<p>Calmet has paraphrased these passages nearly to the same sense: the text may be thus connected; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:19">Acts 13:19</span>. <i>And having destroyed; seven nations in the land of Canaan, he</i> <i>divided their land to them by lot, about one hundred and fifty</i> <i>years after. And afterwards he gave them judges, to the time of</i> <i>Samuel the prophet</i>. The paraphrase of Calmet is the following: "<i>The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers</i> in the person of Abraham; he promised him the land of Canaan; and four hundred and fifty years after this promise, and the birth of Isaac, who was the son and heir of the promise, he put them in possession of that land which he had promised so long before." As this view of the subject removes all the principal difficulties, I shall not trouble my reader with other modes of interpretation.</p>
