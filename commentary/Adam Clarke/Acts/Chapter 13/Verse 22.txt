<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:22">Acts 13:22</span>. <i><b>David - a man after mine own heart</b></i> â€” That is, a man who would rule the kingdom according to God's will. Dr. Benson's observation on this point is very judicious: "When it is said that David was <i>a man after God's own heart</i>, it should be understood, not of his <i>private</i>, but of his <i>public</i>, character. He was <i>a man</i> <i>after God's own heart</i>, because he ruled the people according to the Divine will. He did not allow of <i>idolatry</i>; he did not set up for <i>absolute power</i>. He was guided in the government of the nation by the <i>law of Moses</i>, as the standing rule of government, and by the <i>prophet</i>, or the <i>Divine oracle</i>, whereby God gave directions upon particular emergencies. Whatever Saul's private character was, he was not <i>a good king in Israel</i>. He did not follow the <i>law</i>, the <i>oracle</i>, and the <i>prophet</i>; but attempted to be <i>absolute</i>, and thereby to subvert the <i>constitution</i> of the kingdom. That this was the meaning of David's being <i>a man after God's own heart</i> will easily appear by comparing <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:28">1 Samuel 15:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+28:17-18">1 Samuel 28:17-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+10:13-14">1 Chronicles 10:13-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:70">Psalms 78:70</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:20">Psalms 89:20</span>, &amp;c."</p>
