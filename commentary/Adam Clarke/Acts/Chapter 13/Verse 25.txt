It has been supposed that the word δρομον, <i>course</i>, or <i>race</i>, is used here to point out the <i>short duration</i> of the Baptist's ministry, and the fervent zeal with which he performed it. It signifies properly his <i>ministry</i>, or <i>life</i>. A man's work, employment, function, c., is his <i>race, course</i>, or <i>way of</i> <i>life</i>. John had a <i>ministry</i> from God and he discharged the duties of it with zeal and diligence bore the fatigues of it with patience and resignation; and was gloriously successful in it, because the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
