<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:27">Acts 13:27</span>. <i><b>Because they knew him not</b></i> â€” A gentle excuse for the persecuting high priests, c. They did not know that Jesus was the Christ, because they did not know the prophets: and <i>why</i> did they not know the prophets, <i>which were read every Sabbath day</i>? Because they did <i>not desire to know his will</i> and therefore they knew not the <i>doctrine of God</i>: nor did they know that, in condemning Christ, they fulfilled those very Scriptures which were read every Sabbath day in their synagogues.</p>
