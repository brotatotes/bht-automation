<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:28">Acts 13:28</span>. <i><b>They found no cause of death in him</b></i> â€” No reason why he should be condemned. Though they accused him of several things, yet they could not substantiate the most trifling charge against him; and yet, in opposition to all justice and equity, desired Pilate to put him to death! This points their perfidy in the strongest light.</p>
