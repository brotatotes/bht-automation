<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>. <i><b>And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid</b></i><b> their </b><i><b>hands on them</b></i> â€”</p>
<p>1. <i>They fasted</i>: this was probably done by the whole Church.</p>
<p>2. <i>They prayed</i>, that God would bless and prosper them in their work.</p>
<p>3. <i>They land hands upon them</i>; thus solemnly appointing them to that particular work.</p>
<p>But was it by this fasting, praying, and imposition of hands that these men were qualified for this work? No. God had already <i>called</i> them to it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>, and he who called them had qualified them. Both their call and their qualification came from God; but he chose that they should have also the sanction of that Church of which they had been members; and therefore he said, <i>Separate me</i>, c. The ordination of elders among the Jews was by <i>three persons</i> and here we find three, <i>Simeon, Lucius</i>, and <i>Manaen</i>, ordaining two others, <i>Barnabas</i> and <i>Saul</i>. But how did the Jews ordain? Not by imposition of hands: this is strictly forbidden, see Maimon. Sanh. chap. 4. "After what manner is the ordaining of elders for ever? Not that they should lay their hands on the head of an elder; but only that they should call him <i>Rabbi</i>, and say to him, Behold, thou art ordained, and hast power of judging, c." It is remarkable that the imposition of hands in the ordaining of elders was not used among the ancient Jews, probably never under the <i>first</i> <i>temple</i> and rarely, if ever, under the <i>second</i>. See Lightfoot on this place. The Church at Antioch, however, did depart from this custom: they put their hands on the heads of Barnabas and Saul; thus designating them to be the persons whom they, under the direction of the Holy Spirit, sent to preach the Gospel of Christ to the heathen.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit said, <i>Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the</i> <i>work whereunto I have called them</i>, and the elders of the Church, in consequence, prayed, fasted, and laid their hands upon them, they certainly understood that by acting thus they fulfilled the mind of the Spirit. Hence, is it not evident that, when the elders of the Church of God have good reason to believe that He has called certain persons to the work of the ministry, and qualified them for that work, they should proceed as the elders of the Church of Antioch did; and by <i>fasting, prayer</i>, and <i>imposition of</i> <i>hands</i>, separate those persons for the work whereunto God has called them. Such persons will consider themselves accountable to GOD and his <i>Church</i>, and should take care how they use the gift and authority received from <i>both</i>. Is it not being wise above what is written to say, "When God has called and given authority, there is no need of ordination or appointment from man?" I would just ask the objector, Why, then, when God had called Barnabas and Saul to the work, did he command the Church to <i>separate them</i> to him for that <i>very work</i>? And why did they, in obedience, <i>fast, pray</i>, and <i>lay hands upon them</i>? I shall dispute with no man about the superior excellence of the <i>episcopal</i> or <i>presbyterian</i> form in ordination: if all the preliminaries be right, they may be both equally good, for all that I have ever been able to learn to the contrary; but that there should be <i>some</i> proper scriptural form attended to, I am fully satisfied. Besides, if the plan of the Church at Antioch were regularly and faithfully followed, in sending forth the ministers of the Gospel, no man can prove that God would not own them in an especial manner, and more particularly prosper their work. But, O ye rulers of the Church! be careful, as ye shall answer it to God, never to lay hands on the head of a man whom ye have not just reason to believe God has called to the work; and whose eye is single, and whose heart is pure. Let none be sent to teach Christianity, who have not experienced it to be the power of God to the salvation of their own souls. If ye do, though they have <i>your</i> authority, they never can have the blessing nor the approbation of God. "<i>I sent them</i> <i>not: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the</i> <i>Lord</i>." <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:32">Jeremiah 23:32</span>.</p>
