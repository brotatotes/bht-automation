<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Written in the second Psalm</b></i> — Instead of τω ψαλμω τω δευτερω <i>the second Psalm</i>, πρωτω ψαλμω, <i>the first Psalm</i>, is the reading of D, and its <i>Itala</i> version, and several of the primitive fathers. Griesbach has received it into the text; but not, in my opinion, on sufficient evidence. The reason of these various readings is sufficiently evident to those who are acquainted with Hebrew MSS. In many of these, <i>two</i> Psalms are often written as <i>one</i>; and the <i>first</i> and <i>second</i> Psalms are written as <i>one</i> in <i>seven</i> of <i>Kennicott's</i> and <i>De Rossi's</i> MSS. Those who possessed such MSS. would say, <i>as it is written in the FIRST</i> <i>Psalm</i>; those who referred to MSS. where the two Psalms were <i>separate</i>, would say, <i>in the SECOND Psalm</i>, as they would find the quotation in question in the first verse of the second Psalm. There is, therefore, neither contradiction nor difficulty here; and it is no matter which reading we prefer, as it depends on the simple circumstance, whether we consider these two Psalms as <i>parts</i> of one and the same, or whether we consider them as two <i>distinct</i> Psalms.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</b></i> — It has been disputed whether this text should be understood of the <i>incarnation</i> or of the <i>resurrection</i> of our Lord. If understood of his <i>incarnation</i>, it can mean no more than this, that the <i>human</i> <i>nature</i> of our blessed Lord was begotten by the energy of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the blessed virgin; for as to his Divine nature, which is allotted to be God, it could neither be <i>created</i> nor <i>begotten</i>. See some reasons offered for this on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>; and, if those be deemed insufficient, a <i>thousand</i> more may be added. But in the above reasons it is demonstrated that the doctrine of the <i>eternal Sonship</i> of Christ is absolutely irreconcilable to reason, and contradictory to itself. ETERNITY is that which has had no <i>beginning</i>, nor stands in any reference to <i>time</i>: SON supposes <i>time, generation</i>, and <i>father</i>; and time also antecedent to such generation: therefore the rational conjunction of these two terms, <i>Son</i> and <i>eternity</i>, is absolutely impossible, as they imply essentially different and <i>opposite</i> ideas.</p>
<p>If the passage in question be understood of the <i>resurrection</i> of Christ, it points out that the human nature, which was produced by the power of God in the womb of the virgin, and which was the <i>Son</i> <i>of God</i>, could see no corruption; and therefore, though it died for sin, must be raised from the dead before it saw corruption. Thus God owned that human nature to be peculiarly his own; and therefore Jesus Christ <i>was declared to be the Son of God with</i> <i>power, by the resurrection from the dead</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>.</p>
