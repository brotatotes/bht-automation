<p>Verse 36. <i><b>David - fell on sleep - and saw corruption</b></i> â€” David died, was buried, and never rose again; therefore, David cannot be the person spoken of here: the words are true of some other person; and they can be applied to Jesus Christ <i>only</i>; and in him they are most exactly fulfilled.
