Verse 36. David - fell on sleep - and saw corruption â€” David died, was buried, and never rose again; therefore, David cannot be the person spoken of here: the words are true of some other person; and they can be applied to Jesus Christ only; and in him they are most exactly fulfilled. See the notes on Acts 2:29-30, &c.
