<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Be it known unto you, therefore</b></i> — This is the legitimate conclusion: seeing the word of God is true, and he has promised an endless succession to the seed of David; seeing David and all his family have failed in reference to the <i>political</i> kingdom, a spiritual kingdom and a spiritual succession must be intended, that the sure covenant and all its blessings may be continued. Again: seeing the person by whom this is to be done is to see no corruption; - seeing David has died, and has seen (fallen under the power of) corruption; - seeing Jesus the Christ has wrought all the miracles which the prophets said he should work;-seeing he has suffered all the indignities which your prophets said he must suffer; - seeing after his death he has most incontestably <i>risen again</i> from the dead, and has not fallen under the power of corruption,-then he must be the very person in whom all the predictions are fulfilled, and the person through whom all the blessings of the covenant must come.</p>
<p><i><b>Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins</b></i> — See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>. Remission of sins, the removal of the <i>power, guilt</i>, and <i>pollution</i> of sin comes alone through this man, whom ye crucified, and who is risen from the dead.</p>
