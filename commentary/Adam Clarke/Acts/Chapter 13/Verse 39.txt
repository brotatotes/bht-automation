<p>Verse 39. <i><b>And by him</b></i> â€” On his account, and through him, <i>all that</i> <i>believe</i> in his Divine mission, and the end for which he has been manifested, namely, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, <i>are justified from all things</i>, from the guilt of all transgressions committed against God; <i>from which ye could not be</i> <i>justified by the law of Moses</i>; because it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, or any other rite or service of this kind, could take away sin from the soul, cancel its guilt in the conscience, or make an atonement to the Divine justice; but <i>this</i> is the sacrifice which God has required; this is every way suited to the end for which it has been instituted; and this is the sacrifice alone which God can accept. Your law says, "Do this, and ye shall live;" and, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them." Ye have not done these things required; ye have not continued in any good thing; ye have not only not done all things commanded, but ye have done <i>none</i>, none as they <i>ought</i> to be done; and therefore ye are under the <i>curse</i>. The Gospel says, Believe on the Lord Jesus; credit his Divine mission; consider his death an <i>atonement</i> for sin; believe in his <i>resurrection</i>, as a proof that the atonement is made, believe that he suffered, died, and rose again for <i>your</i> <i>justification</i>; and that for his sake God, though he be infinitely <i>just</i>, can be the justifier of all who believe in him. By the law of Moses there is neither justification nor salvation: in Jesus Christ there are both, and all the sure mercies of David. Therefore, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and ye shall be <i>justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified</i> <i>by the law of Moses</i>.</p>
