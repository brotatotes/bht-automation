<p>Verse 40. <i><b>Beware - lest that come upon you</b></i>, c.] If you reject these benefits, now freely offered to you in this preaching of Christ crucified, you may expect such judgment from the hand of God as your forefathers experienced, when, for their <i>rebellion</i> and their <i>contempt</i> of his benefits, their <i>city</i> was <i>taken</i>, their <i>temple destroyed</i>, and <i>themselves</i> either <i>slain</i> by the sword, or carried into <i>captivity</i>. It is evident that St. Paul refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hab+1:5-10">Habakkuk 1:5-10</span> and in those verses the desolation by the <i>Chaldeans</i> is foretold. Never was there a prophecy more correctly and pointedly applied. These Jews <i>did continue</i> to slight the benefits offered to them by the Lord; and they persevered in their rebellion: what was the consequence? The <i>Romans</i> came, took their city, burnt their temple, slew upwards of a million of them, and either carried or sold the rest into captivity. How exactly was the prophecy in both cases fulfilled!</p>
