<p>Verse 41. <i><b>Behold, ye despisers</b></i> — There is a remarkable difference here between the Hebrew text in Habakkuk, and that in the Septuagint, which is a little abridged here by St. Paul. I shall exhibit the three texts. Heb:- </p>
<p>Sept. Ιδετε οἱ καταφρονηται, και επιβλεψατε, και θαυμασατε θαυμασια, και αφανισθητε· διοτι εργον εγω εργαζομαι εν ταις ἡμεραις ὑμων, ὁ ου μη πιστευσητε, εαν τις εκδιηγηται ὑμιν.</p>
<p>See, ye despisers, and look attentively, and be astonished, (or hide yourselves,) for I work a work in your days, which, if any one will tell to you, ye will not believe.</p>
<p>St. Luke. Ιδετε οἱ καταφρονηται, [και επιβλεψατε], και θαυμασατε, [θαυμασια], και αφανισθητε· ὁτι εργον εγω εργαζομαι εν ταις ἡμεραις ὑμων, εργον ᾡ ου μη πιστευσητε, εαν τις εκδιηγηται ὑμιν.</p>
<p>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and be astonished, (or <i>hide yourselves</i>,) for I work a work in your days, which, if any one will tell unto you, ye will not believe.</p>
<p>I have taken Luke's quotation from the best MSS., and I have quoted the <i>Septuagint</i> according to the <i>Codex Alerandrinus</i>; and the quotations are exactly the same, not only in words, but almost in letters, with the exception of επιβλεψατε and θαυμασια which the evangelist omits, and which I have included in crotchets in the text of St. Luke, merely that the <i>place</i> of the omission may be the better seen. It may now be necessary to inquire how St. Luke and the Septuagint should substitute <i>ye despisers</i>, for <i>ye among the</i> <i>heathen</i>, in the Hebrew text?</p>
<p>Without troubling myself or my readers with laborious criticisms on these words, with which many learned men have loaded the text, I will simply state my opinion, that the prophet, instead of בגוים <i>bagoyim, among the heathen</i>, wrote בגדים <i>bogadim, despisers</i>, or <i>transgressors</i>: a word which differs only in a <i>single letter</i>, ד daleth, for ו <i>vau</i>; the latter of which might easily be mistaken by a transcriber for the other, especially if the horizontal stroke of the ד <i>daleth</i> happened to be a little <i>faint</i> towards the left; as, in that case, it would wear the appearance of a ו <i>vau</i>; and this is not unfrequently the case, not only in MSS., but even in <i>printed</i> books. It seems as evident as it can well be that this gives the word which the <i>Septuagint</i> found in the copy from which they translated: their evidence, and that of the apostle, joined to the consideration that the interchange of the two letters mentioned above might have been easily made, is quite sufficient to legitimate the reading for which I contend. <i>Houbigant</i> and several others are of the same mind.</p>
<p>The word αφανισθητε, which we translate <i>perish</i>, signifies more properly <i>disappear</i>, or <i>hide yourselves</i>; as people, astonished and alarmed at some coming evil, betake themselves to flight, and <i>hide</i> <i>themselves</i> in order to avoid it.</p>
