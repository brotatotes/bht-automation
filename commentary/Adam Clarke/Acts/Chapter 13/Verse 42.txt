<p>Verse 42. <i><b>When the Jews were gone out</b></i> — That part of them in whom the words of the prophet were fulfilled, viz. those who, though they had the clearest relation of so interesting a history, would not believe it: they shut their eyes against the light, and hardened their hearts against the truth. There were other Jews in the assembly that <i>did</i> believe, and were saved.</p>
<p><i><b>The Gentiles besought</b></i> — There is some doubt whether the original, παρεκαλουν τα εθνη, should be translated <i>the Gentiles besought</i>; or <i>they besought the Gentiles</i>: for the words will bear either, but the latter sense more naturally. When the Jews retired, determining not to credit what was spoken, the apostle, seeing the Gentiles of a better mind, requested them to come and hear those words, or doctrines, the next Sabbath. But, <i>the next</i>, τομεταξυ, as Hiesychius defines it, μετολιγοναναμεσον, <i>shortly</i>, or <i>betwixt</i>, may mean the <i>after part</i> of the same Sabbath, or the <i>course of the ensuing week</i>, between the two Sabbaths; for <i>Mondays</i> and <i>Thursdays</i>, or the second and fifth days of the week, were times in which those who feared God usually met together in the synagogue; for it is a maxim with the rabbins, that no <i>three</i> <i>days</i> should elapse without reading of the law.</p>
<p>On this verse there is a great number of various readings: instead of, <i>when the Jews were going out of the synagogue</i>, ABCDE, several others of great repute, with all the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Coptic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, read, <i>As they were going</i> <i>out, they entreated that these words should be preached unto them</i> <i>in the course of the week</i>, or the next Sabbath. So that, according to this well accredited reading, the words, εκ της συναγωγης των ιουδαιων, are left out in the <i>first</i> clause, αυτων being put in their place; and τα εθνη, <i>the Gentiles</i>, is wholly omitted in the second clause. The most eminent critics approve of this reading; indeed it stands on such authority as to render it almost indubitable. Of the αυτων, <i>them</i>, which is substituted for the first clause, Professor White says, <i>lectio indubie genuina</i>: this reading is undoubtedly genuine; and of the τα εθνη εις, he says, <i>certissime delenda</i>: they should certainly be expunged. We are therefore to understand the words thus: that, "as they were going out on the breaking up of the assembly, some of them desired that they might have these doctrines preached to them on the ensuing week or Sabbath." And thus all the ambiguity of the verse vanishes.</p>
