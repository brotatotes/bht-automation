<p>Verse 43. <i><b>Many of the Jews</b></i> — Direct descendants from some of the twelve tribes; <i>and religious proselytes</i>, heathens who had been converted to Judaism, and, having submitted to circumcision, had become <i>proselytes of the covenant</i>: though some think that the expression means <i>proselytes</i> of the <i>gate</i>-persons who believed in one God, like the Jews, but who had not received circumcision.</p>
<p><i><b>Persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</b></i> — That is, that they should continue to credit the Gospel; to receive the spirit and influence of it; to bring forth the fruits of that spirit; and thus continue under the favour and approbation of God.</p>
