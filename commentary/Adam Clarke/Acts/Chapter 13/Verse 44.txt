<p>Verse 44. <i><b>The next Sabbath day</b></i> — The good news had spread far and wide, by means of the converted Jews and proselytes.</p>
<p><i><b>Almost the whole city</b></i> — <i>Jews, proselytes</i>, and <i>Gentiles</i>, came together to hear τον λογον του θεου, <i>this doctrine of God</i>, this Divine teaching, by which so many of their kindred and acquaintance had become so wise and happy. It is not by <i>public</i> discourses merely that people are converted to God; but by the <i>private</i> teaching and godly conduct of those who have received the truth; for, as these are scattered throughout society, they are a <i>leaven</i> in every place.</p>
