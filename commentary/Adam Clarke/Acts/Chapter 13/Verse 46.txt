<p>Verse 46. <i><b>Waxed bold</b></i> — παρρησιασαμενοι; Having great liberty of speech; a strong, persuasive, and overpowering eloquence. They had eternal <i>truth</i> for the basis of this discourse; a multitude of <i>incontestable facts</i> to support it; an all-persuading eloquence to illustrate and maintain what they had asserted.</p>
<p><i><b>Should first have been spoken to you</b></i> — When our Lord gave his apostles their commission to go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature, he told them they must begin first at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:47">Luke 24:47</span>. In obedience therefore to this command, the apostles (in every place where they preached) made their <i>first offers</i> of the Gospel to the <i>Jews</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye put it from you</b></i> — απωθεισθε αυτον, <i>Ye disdain</i> this doctrine, and consider it <i>contemptible</i>: so the word is frequently used.</p>
<p><i><b>And judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life</b></i> — Was this meant as a strong <i>irony</i>? "Ye have such humbling thoughts of yourselves, that ye think the blessings of the Gospel too good to be bestowed on such worthless wretches as ye are." Or did the apostle mean that, by their <i>words</i> and <i>conduct</i> on this occasion, they had passed <i>sentence</i> on themselves, and, in effect, had decided that they were unworthy of the grace of the Gospel; and God now ratifies that judgment by removing those blessings from <i>them</i>, and sending them to the <i>Gentiles</i>?</p>
