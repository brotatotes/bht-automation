<p>Verse 47. <i><b>For so the Lord commanded us</b></i> — The apostles could quote a pertinent scripture for every thing they did; because the outlines of the whole Gospel dispensation are founded in the <i>law</i> and the <i>prophets</i>; and they were now building the Church of God according to the pattern shown them in the Mount. In the things of God, no <i>man</i> nor <i>minister</i> should go farther than he can say, <i>Thus</i> <i>it is written</i>, and <i>thus it behoves me to do</i>; and let him see that his quotations are fairly made, and not a detached passage or member of a sentence produced, because it seems to look like the system he wishes to establish.</p>
<p><i><b>I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles</b></i> — This quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>, and was most fully in point. The Jews could not resist the testimony of their own prophet; and the Gentiles rejoiced to find that the offers of salvation were to be made so specifically to <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>For salvation unto the ends of the earth.</b></i> — The very name of the Messiah, viz JESUS, announced the <i>design</i> and <i>end</i> of his mission. He is the <i>Saviour</i>, and is to be proclaimed as such to <i>the ends of</i> <i>the earth</i>; to all mankind; to every <i>nation</i>, and <i>people</i>, and <i>tongue</i>; and, wherever the Gospel is preached, there is a free, full, and sincere offer of salvation to every soul that hears it. And the offer is proof sufficient, in itself, that there is a power to receive its blessings given to those to whom the offer is made; as it would be of no use to offer them a salvation which it was designed they either <i>should</i> not or <i>could</i> not receive. A son of Satan might be capable of such dissimulation and bad faith; but the holy God cannot.</p>
