<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:52">Acts 13:52</span>. <i><b>The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Ghost.</b></i> â€” Though in the world they had tribulation, yet in Christ they had peace; and, while engaged in their Master's work, they always had their Master's wages. The happiness of a genuine Christian lies far beyond the reach of earthly disturbances, and is not affected by the changes and chances to which mortal things are exposed. The martyrs were more happy in the <i>flames</i> than their persecutors could be on their beds of down.</p>
<p>St. Paul's sermon at Antioch has been thus analyzed.</p>
<p>1. His prologue, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16">Acts 13:16</span>, addressed to those who fear God.</p>
<p>2. His narrative of God's goodness to Israel: 1. In their deliverance from Egypt. 2. In their support in the wilderness. 3. In his giving them the land of Canaan. 4. In the judges and kings which he had given for their governors, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:7-22">Acts 13:7-22</span>.</p>
<p>3. His proposition, that <i>Jesus</i> was the Christ, the Saviour of the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:23">Acts 13:23</span>.</p>
<p>4. The illustration of this proposition, proving its truth: 1. From Christ's stock and family, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:23">Acts 13:23</span>. 2. From the testimony of his forerunner, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:24">Acts 13:24</span>. 3. From the resurrection of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:30">Acts 13:30</span>; which was corroborated with the testimony of many Galileans, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:31">Acts 13:31</span>, and of the prophets, David, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:35">Acts 13:35</span>, and Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:34">Acts 13:34</span>.</p>
<p>5. He anticipates objections, relative to the unjust condemnation, death and burial of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:27-29">Acts 13:27-29</span>.</p>
<p>6. His epilogue, in which he excites his audience to embrace the Gospel on two considerations: 1. The benefits which they receive who embrace the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:38">Acts 13:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:39">Acts 13:39</span>. 2. The danger to which they were exposed who should despise and reject it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:40">Acts 13:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:41">Acts 13:41</span>.</p>
