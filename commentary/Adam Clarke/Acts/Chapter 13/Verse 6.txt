<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:6">Acts 13:6</span>. <i><b>Gone through the isle</b></i> — ολην, <i>The WHOLE isle</i>, is added here by ABCDE, several others, both the <i>Syrian, Coptic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>; and also by several of the Greek fathers; and this must be the true reading, for it is evident they ran through the whole island from <i>east</i> to <i>west</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto Paphos</b></i> — This town, next in importance to <i>Salamis</i>, was situated on the western part of the isle; and having gone from <i>Salamis</i> to this place is a proof that they had gone through the whole island from east to west, according to the <i>reading</i> noticed above. There was probably no town in the universe more dissolute than <i>Papas</i>. Here Venus had a superb temple: here she was worshipped with <i>all her rites</i>; and from this place she was named the <i>Paphian Venus</i>, the <i>queen of Paphos</i>, c. This temple and whole city were destroyed by an earthquake so that a vestige of either does not now remain. There are two islands which go by this name, both adjoining, and on the west side of the island of Cyprus. One is called <i>Old Paphos</i>, the other <i>New Paphos</i>; the latter is probably the island here mentioned, though they are often confounded. On this island there is a Christian Church, dedicated to St. George, in which service is performed by the Greek ministers. It is a bishop's see, suffragan to the Abp. of <i>Nicosia</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A certain sorcerer</b></i> — τινα μαγον, <i>A magician</i>, one who used magical arts, and pretended to have commerce with supernatural agents. A person who dealt in <i>sleight of hand</i>, or <i>leger-de-main</i>. Such as I have supposed Simon Magus to be. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>A false prophet</b></i> —. A deceiver, one who pretended to have a Divine commission, a fortune teller.</p>
<p><i><b>Bar-Jesus</b></i> — That is, <i>the son of Jesus</i> or <i>Joshua; as Bar-jona</i> is the <i>son of Jonah; Bar-tholomew</i>, the <i>son of Thalmi</i>, &amp;c.</p>
