<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:7">Acts 13:7</span>. <i><b>The deputy of the country</b></i> — ανθυπατω, The <i>proconsul</i>. Rosenmuller and others remark, that in those days the Romans sent two different kinds of governors into the provinces. Some of the provinces were <i>Caesarean</i> or <i>imperial</i>, and into those they sent <i>propretors</i>; others belonged to the <i>senate</i> and <i>people of Rome</i>, and into those they sent <i>proconsuls</i>. Cyprus had formerly been an imperial province; but Augustus, who made the distinction, had given it to the <i>people</i>, whence it was governed by a proconsul. See <i>Dion Cass</i>. Hist. Rom. lib. iv. p. 523. [Edit. <i>Leunclav</i>.]</p>
<p><i><b>Sergius Paulus</b></i> — This proconsul is not mentioned any where else: he became a Christian, had his name written in the book of life, and, probably on that very account, blotted out of the <i>Fasti</i> <i>Consulares</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A prudent man</b></i> — ανδρι συνετω, A man of <i>good sense</i>, of a <i>sound</i> <i>understanding</i>, and therefore wished to hear the doctrine taught by these apostles; he did not persecute the men for their preaching, but sent for them that he might hear for himself.</p>
