Verse Acts 13:8. But Elymas, the sorcerer, (for so is his name by interpretation) — That is, Elymas is the interpretation of the word μαγος, or sorcerer; not of the word Bar-Jesus as some have imagined; and to support which they have been led into strange etymologies on the word βαριησους, Bar-Jesus.
