<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:8">Acts 13:8</span>. <i><b>But Elymas, the sorcerer, (for so is his name by</b></i><b> </b><i><b>interpretation)</b></i> — That is, Elymas is the interpretation of the word μαγος, or <i>sorcerer</i>; not of the word <i>Bar-Jesus</i> as some have imagined; and to support which they have been led into strange etymologies on the word βαριησους, Bar-Jesus. But how is <i>Elymas</i>, ελυμας, the interpretation of the word μαγος, <i>magician</i> or sorcerer? Ans. Both names are <i>Asiatic</i>; but neither Hebrew nor Greek. I have already observed, in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span><i>"</i>, that [Persic] <i>mogh</i> in Persian means an idolater, a worshipper of fire, and sometimes what we term a magician. Elymas is from the Arabic [Arabic] <i>ilm</i>, knowledge, science, doctrine, art; from <i>alama</i>, he was <i>wise, skilled</i>, c. hence [Persic] <i>aleem</i> or <i>alymon</i>, a <i>doctor</i> or <i>learned man</i>, and, with the Greek termination, ελυμας, Elymas, the interpretation of [Persic] <i>mogh</i>, Greek μαγος, <i>magos</i>, a magician, a wise man, <i>doctor</i>, &amp;c.</p>
