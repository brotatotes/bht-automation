<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span>. <i><b>Saul, who also</b></i><b> is - </b><i><b>Paul</b></i> — This is the first time the name Paul occurs, and the last time in which this apostle is called Saul, as his common or general name.</p>
<p><i>Saul</i>, שאול Shaul, was the name of the first Israelitish king, and signifies <i>asked, sought</i>; from שאל <i>shaal</i>, he asked, inquired, c.</p>
<p><i>Paul, Paulus</i>, if derived from the Latin, signifies <i>little,</i> <i>dwarfish</i>: but if from the Hebrew, פלא <i>pala</i>, it signifies <i>extraordinary, wonderful</i> and this appears to have been the derivation assigned to it by <i>St. Jerome</i>, com. in Ep. Pauli ad Philem., who translates it <i>mirabilis</i>, wonderful, and <i>Hesychius</i> must have had the same in view, for he defines it thus, Παυλος, θαυμαστος, ηεκλεκτος, συμβουλος, Paul, wonderful, or elect, counsellor. The lexicographer had probably here in view, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>: <i>his name shall be called</i> (פלא יועיץ pelé yoêts) <i>wonderful,</i> <i>counsellor</i>; which he might corrupt into <i>paulus</i>, and thus make his θαυμαστος συμβουλος out of it by way of explanation. <i>Triller</i>, however, supposes the συμβουλος of Hesychius to be corrupted from συνδουλος <i>fellow servant</i>, which is a term not unfrequently applied to apostles, c., in the New Testament, who are called the <i>servants of God</i> and it is used by Paul himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7">Colossians 4:7</span>. The <i>Latin</i> original is the most probable. It is well known that the Jews in the apostolic age had frequently <i>two</i> names, one <i>Hebrew</i>, the other <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i>. Saul was born of Jewish parents, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; he had therefore his <i>first</i> name from that language, שאול <i>Shaul</i>, asked or begged; as it is possible he might have been a child for whom his parents had addressed their fervent petitions to God. The case of Samuel is one in point. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:9-18">1 Samuel 1:9-18</span>. As he was born in Tarsus, in Cilicia, he was consequently born a free Roman citizen; and hence his parents would naturally give him, for <i>cognomen</i>, some name borrowed from the <i>Latin</i> tongue, and <i>Paulus</i>, which signifies <i>little</i>, might indicate that he was at his birth a <i>small</i> or <i>diminutive</i> child. And it is very likely that he was <i>low</i> in <i>stature</i> all his days; and that it is to this he refers himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>, <i>for his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible</i>. If he were small in stature, his voice would be naturally low and feeble; and the Greeks. who were fond of a <i>thundering eloquence</i>, would despise him on this very account.</p>
<p><i><b>Filled with the Holy Ghost</b></i> — Therefore the sentence he pronounced was not from <i>himself</i>, but from God. And indeed, had he not been under a Divine influence, it is not likely he would have ventured thus to accost this sorcerer in the presence of the governor, who, no doubt, had greatly admired him.</p>
