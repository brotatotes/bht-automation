<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:11">Acts 14:11</span>. <i><b>Saying, in the speech of Lycaonia</b></i> — What this language was has puzzled the learned not a little. <i>Calmet</i> thinks it was a corrupt Greek dialect; as Greek was the general language of Asia Minor. Mr. <i>Paul Ernest Jablonski</i>, who has written a dissertation expressly on the subject, thinks it was the same language with that of the <i>Cappadocians</i>, which was mingled with Syriac. That it was no dialect of the Greek must be evident from the circumstance of its being here distinguished from it. We have sufficient proofs from ancient authors that most of these provinces used different languages; and it is correctly remarked, by Dr. Lightfoot, that the <i>Carians</i>, who dwelt much nearer Greece than the Lycaonians, are called by <i>Homer</i>, βαρβαροφωνοι, people of a barbarous or strange language; and <i>Pausanias</i> also called them <i>Barbari</i>. That the language of <i>Pisidia</i> was distinct from the Greek we have already seen, <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:15">Acts 13:15</span><i>"</i>. We have no light to determine this point; and every search after the language of Lycaonia must be, at this distance of time, fruitless.</p>
<p><i><b>The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</b></i> — From this, and from all heathen antiquity, it is evident:</p>
<p>1. That the heathen did not consider the Divine nature, how low soever they rated it, to be like the human nature.</p>
<p>2. That they imagined that these celestial beings often assumed <i>human forms</i> to visit men, in order to punish the evil and reward the good. The Metamorphoses of Ovid are full of such visitations; and so are <i>Homer, Virgil</i>, and other poets. The angels visiting Abraham, Jacob, Lot, c., might have been the foundation on which most of these heathen fictions were built.</p>

<p>It was a settled belief among the Egyptians, that their gods, sometimes in the likeness of <i>men</i>, and sometimes in that of animals which they held sacred, descended to the earth, and travelled through different provinces, to punish, reward, and protect. The Hindoo <i>Avatars</i>, or incarnations of their gods, prove how generally this opinion had prevailed. Their <i>Poorana</i> are full of accounts of the descent of <i>Brahma, Vishnoo, Shiva, Naradu</i>, and other gods, in <i>human shape</i>. We need not wonder to find it in Lycaonia.</p>
