<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:12">Acts 14:12</span>. <i><b>They called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius</b></i> — The heathens supposed that <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Mercury</i> were the gods who most frequently assumed the human form; and Jupiter was accustomed to take Mercury with him on such expeditions. Jupiter was the <i>supreme god</i> of the heathens; and Mercury was by them considered the <i>god of eloquence</i>. And the ancient fable, from which I have quoted so largely above, represents Jupiter and Mercury coming to this very region, where they were entertained by <i>Lycaon</i>, from whom the <i>Lycaonians</i> derived their name. See the whole fable in the first book of Ovid's Metamorphoses.</p>
<p>As the ancients usually represented Jupiter as rather an aged man, large, noble, and majestic; and Mercury young, light, and active, the conjecture of Chrysostom is very probable, that Barnabas was a large, noble, well-made man, and probably in years; and St. Paul, young, active, and eloquent; on which account, they termed the former <i>Jupiter</i>, and the latter <i>Mercury</i>. That Mercury was eloquent and powerful in his words is allowed by the heathens; and the very epithet that is applied here to Paul, ην ὁ ἡγουμενος του λογου, <i>he was the chief</i> or <i>leader of the discourse</i>, was applied to Mercury. So Jamblichus de Myster. Init. Θεος ὁ των λογων ἡγεμων ὁ Ἑρμης. And Macrobius, Sat. i. 8: <i>Scimus Mercurium</i> <i>vocis et</i> sermonis potentem. <i>We know that Mercury is powerful both</i> <i>in his voice and eloquence</i>. With the Lycaonians, the <i>actions</i> of these apostles proved them to be gods; and the different parts they took appeared to them to fix their character, so that one was judged to be <i>Jupiter</i>, and the other <i>Mercury</i>.</p>
