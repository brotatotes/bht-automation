<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:13">Acts 14:13</span>. <i><b>Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their</b></i> <i>city</i>] There is a meaning here, which ordinary readers will not readily apprehend. Many cities were put under the protection of a particular deity; and the image of that deity placed at the entrance, to signify that he was the guardian and protector. To this St. Luke, every where as accurate as he is circumstantial, refers. Lystra, it appears, was under the guardianship of <i>Jupiter</i> <i>Propulaius</i>, διος προπυλαιου, which St. Luke translates, του διος οντος της πολεως, <i>the Jupiter that was before the city</i>, which is another term for <i>Jupiter Custos</i>, or Jupiter the guardian. All these deities, according to the attributes they sustained, had their peculiar <i>priests, rites</i>, and <i>sacrifices</i>; and each a peculiar service and priest for the office he bore; so that <i>Jupiter</i> <i>Brontes</i>, Jupiter the thunderer, had a different service from <i>Jupiter Custos</i>, Jove the guardian. Hence we can see with what accuracy St. Luke wrote: the person who was going to offer them sacrifices was the priest of <i>Jupiter Custos</i>, under whose guardianship the city of Lystra was, and whom the priest supposed had visited the city in a human form; and Barnabas, probably for the reasons already assigned, he imagined was the person; and as Mercury, the god of eloquence, was the <i>general attendant</i> of Jupiter, the people and the priest supposed that Paul, who had a powerful, commanding eloquence, was <i>that</i> god, also disguised. A beautiful figure of such an image of Jupiter as, I suppose, stood before the gate of Lystra, still remains; and a fine engraving of it may be seen in Gruter's Inscriptions, vol. i. p. xx. Jupiter is represented naked, sitting on a <i>curule</i> or consular <i>chair</i>; in his right hand he holds his <i>thunder</i>, and a long <i>staff</i> in his left; at his right, stands the <i>eagle</i> prepared for flight; and, above, the <i>winged cap</i> and <i>caduceus</i> of Mercury. On the base is the inscription, IUPPITER CUSTOM DOMUS AUG. <i>Jupiter, the guardian of</i> <i>the house of Augustus</i>. As the <i>preserver</i> or <i>guardian</i> of towns, he was generally styled <i>Jupiter Custos, Serenus</i> and <i>Servator</i>. His name, JUPITER, i.e. <i>jurans pater</i>, the helping father, entitled him, in those days of darkness, to general regard. On this false god, who long engrossed the worship of even the most enlightened nations on the earth, much may be seen in Lactantius, <i>Divinar.</i> <i>Institution</i>. lib. i., in the <i>Antiquite expliquee</i> of <i>Montfaucon</i>; and various inscriptions, relative to his character as <i>guardian</i>, c., may be seen in <i>Gruter</i>, as above.</p>
<p><i><b>Oxen and garlands</b></i> — That is, oxen adorned with <i>flowers</i>, their <i>horns gilded</i>, and <i>neck</i> bound about with <i>fillets</i>, as was the custom in sacrificial rites. They also crowned the <i>gods</i> themselves, the <i>priests</i>, and gates of the <i>temples</i>, with flowers. Of this method of adorning the victims, there are numerous examples in the Greek and Latin writers. A few may suffice. Thus OVID:- </p>
<p>At the time of worship, the <i>Hindoo</i> priests place <i>garlands of</i> <i>flowers on the head of the image</i>. Whether the garlands were intended to decorate the <i>oxen</i> or the <i>apostles</i>, we cannot say; but in either case the conduct of the Lycaonians was conformable to that of the modern <i>Hindoos</i>.</p>
