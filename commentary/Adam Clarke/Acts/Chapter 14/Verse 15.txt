<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>. <i><b>We also are men of like passions with you</b></i> — This saying of the apostles has been most strangely perverted. A pious commentator, taking the word <i>passion</i> in its <i>vulgar</i> and most <i>improper</i> sense, (a <i>bad temper</i>, an <i>evil propensity</i>,) and supposing that these holy men wished to confess that they also had many <i>sinful infirmities</i>, and <i>wrong tempers</i>, endeavours to illustrate this sense of the word, by appealing to the <i>contention</i> <i>of Paul and Barnabas</i>, c., c. But the expression means no more than, "we are truly <i>human beings</i>, with the same powers and appetites as your own need food and raiment as you do and are all <i>mortal</i> like yourselves."</p>
<p><i><b>That ye should turn from these vanities</b></i> — That is, from these <i>idols</i> and <i>false gods</i>. How often false gods and idolatry are termed <i>vanity</i> in the Scriptures, no careful reader of the Bible needs to be told. What a bold saying was this in the presence of a <i>heathen</i> mob, intent on performing an act of their superstitious worship, in which they no doubt thought the safety of the state was concerned. The ancient fable related by Ovid, <i>Metam</i>. lib. i. ver. 211-239, to which reference has already been made, will cast some light on the conduct of the Lystrians in this case. The following is its substance:-"Jupiter, having been informed of the great degeneracy of mankind, was determined himself to survey the earth. Coming to this province, (<i>Lycaonia</i>,) disguised in human shape, he took up his residence at the palace of <i>Lycaon</i>, then king of that country: giving a sign of his godhead, the people worship him: Lycaon sneers, doubts his divinity, and is determined to put it to the trial. Some ambassadors from the Molossian state having just arrived, he slew one of them, boiled part of his flesh, and roasted the rest, and set it before Jupiter: the god, indignant at the insult, burnt the palace, and turned the impious king into a <i>wolf</i>." From this time, or, rather, from this fable, the whole province was called <i>Lycaonia</i>. The simple people now seeing such proofs of <i>supernatural</i> power, in the miracles wrought by <i>Barnabas</i> and <i>Paul</i>, thought that Jupiter had <i>again</i> visited them; and fearing lest they should meet with his indignation, should they neglect duly to honour him, they brought <i>oxen and garlands</i>, and would have offered them sacrifice, had they not been prevented by the apostles themselves. This circumstance will account for their whole conduct; and shows the reason why Jupiter was the tutelar god of the place. As, therefore, the people took them for <i>gods</i>, it was necessary for the apostles to show that they were but <i>men</i>; and this is the whole that is meant by the ομοιοπαθειςανθρωποι, <i>men</i> <i>of like passions, fellow mortals</i>, in the text, which has been so pitifully <i>mistaken</i> by some, and <i>abused</i> by others.</p>
<p><i><b>The living God</b></i> — Widely different from those <i>stocks</i> and <i>stones</i>, which were objects of their worship.</p>
<p><i><b>Which made heaven and earth</b></i> — And as all things were <i>made</i> by his <i>power</i>, so all <i>subsist</i> by his <i>providence</i>; and to him alone, all worship, honour, and glory are due.</p>
