Verse Acts 14:16. Who in times past suffered all nations, c.] The words παντα τα εθνη, which we here translate, all nations, should be rendered, all the Gentiles, merely to distinguish them from the Jewish people: who having a revelation, were not left to walk in their own ways but the heathens, who had not a revelation, were suffered to form their creed, and mode of worship, according to their own caprice.
