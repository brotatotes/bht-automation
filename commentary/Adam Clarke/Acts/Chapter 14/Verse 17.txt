<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:17">Acts 14:17</span>. <i><b>He left not himself without witness</b></i> — Though he gave the Gentiles no revelation of his will, yet he continued to govern them by his gracious providence; doing them <i>good</i> in general; <i>giving then rain</i> to fertilize their grounds, and <i>fruitful</i> <i>seasons</i> as the result; so that <i>grass</i> grew for the <i>cattle</i> and <i>corn</i> for the service of <i>man</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Filling our hearts with food</b></i> — Giving as much food as could reasonably be <i>wished</i>, so that <i>gladness</i>, or general happiness, was the result. Such was the gracious provision made for man, at all times, that the <i>economy</i> and <i>bounty</i> of the Divine Being were equally evidenced by it. He never gives <i>less</i> than is <i>necessary</i>, nor <i>more</i> than is <i>sufficient</i>. His <i>economy</i> forbids men to <i>waste,</i> by going them in general no <i>profusion</i>. His <i>bounty</i> forbids them to <i>want</i>, by giving as much as is <i>sufficient</i> for all the <i>natural</i> <i>wants</i> of his creatures. By not giving <i>too much</i>, he prevents <i>luxury</i> and <i>riot</i>: by giving <i>enough</i>, he prevents <i>discontent</i> and <i>misery.</i> Thus he does mankind <i>good</i>, by causing his rain to descend upon the just and the unjust, and his sun to shine upon the evil, and the good. Thus he is said <i>not to have left himself without witness</i>: for his providential dealings are the <i>witnesses</i> of his <i>being</i>, his <i>wisdom</i>, and his <i>bounty</i>; and thus the <i>invisible things of God,</i> <i>even his eternal power and Godhead, were clearly seen, being</i> <i>understood by the things which are made</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>. Therefore those who continued to worship <i>stocks</i> and <i>stones</i> were <i>without excuse</i>. These were great and striking <i>truths</i>; and into what <i>detail</i> the apostles now went, we cannot say; but it is likely that they spoke much more than is here related, as the next verse states that, with all these sayings, they found it difficult to prevent the people from offering them sacrifice.</p>
