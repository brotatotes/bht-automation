Verse Acts 14:19. There came thither certain Jews from Antioch — Those were, no doubt, the same who had raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, at Iconium and Antioch, before: they followed the apostles with implacable malice; and what they could not do themselves they endeavoured to do by others, whose minds they first perverted, and then irritated to deeds of fell purpose.And having stoned Paul — Alas! of what real worth is popular fame? How uncertain, and how unworthy to be counted! These poor heathens acted just like the people of Malta, Acts 28:4-6. When the viper fastened on the hand of Paul, they concluded he was a murderer: when they found it did him no damage, they changed their minds, and said he was a GOD! When the Lycaonians saw the miracles that Paul did, they said he was the god Mercury: when the persecuting Jews came, they persuaded them that he was an impostor; and then they endeavoured to stone him to death.Supposing he had been dead. — They did not leave stoning him till they had the fullest evidence that he was dead; and so, most probably, he was.
