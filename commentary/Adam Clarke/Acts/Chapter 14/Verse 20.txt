<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:20">Acts 14:20</span>. <i><b>The disciples stood round about him</b></i> — No doubt in earnest prayer, entreating the <i>Author of life</i> that his soul might again return to its battered tenement.</p>
<p><i><b>He rose up</b></i> — Miraculously restored, not only to <i>life</i>, but to <i>perfect soundness</i> so that he was able to walk into the city, that his persecutors might see the mighty power of God in his restoration, and the faith of the young converts be confirmed in the truth and goodness of God. It is strange that neither the young converts at Lystra, nor Barnabas, were involved in this persecution! It seems to have had Paul <i>alone</i> for its <i>object</i>; and, when they thought they had despatched him, they did not think of injuring the rest.</p>
