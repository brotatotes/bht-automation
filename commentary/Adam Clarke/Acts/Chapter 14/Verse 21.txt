Verse Acts 14:21. Preached the Gospel to that city — Derbe, a city in the same province. Acts 14:6.They returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium — Behold the courage of these Christian men! They counted not their lives dear to them, and returned to do their Masters work in the very places in which they had been so grievously persecuted, and where one of them had been apparently stoned to death! The man who knows he is God's ambassador, and that his life depends on his fidelity to his Master, knows he has nothing but his God to fear.
