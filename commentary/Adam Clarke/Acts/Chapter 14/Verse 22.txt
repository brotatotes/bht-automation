<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>. <i><b>Confirming the souls of the disciples</b></i> â€” The word <i>disciple</i> signifies literally a <i>scholar</i>. The Church of Christ was a <i>school</i>, in which Christ himself was <i>chief Master</i>; and his apostles <i>subordinate teachers</i>. All the <i>converts</i> were <i>disciples</i> or <i>scholars</i>, who came to this <i>school</i> to be instructed in the knowledge of <i>themselves</i> and of their GOD: of their duty to <i>Him</i>, to the <i>Church</i>, to <i>society</i>, and to <i>themselves</i>. After having been initiated in the principles of the heavenly doctrine, they needed line upon line, and precept upon precept, in order that they might be <i>confirmed</i> and established in the truth. Though it was a great and important thing to have their <i>heads</i>, their <i>understanding</i>, properly informed, yet, if the <i>heart</i> was not disciplined, information in the understanding would be of little avail; therefore they <i>confirmed the SOULS of the disciples</i>. As there must be some particular <i>standard</i> of truth, to which they might continually resort, that their faith might stand in the power of God, it was necessary that they should have such a <i>system of</i> <i>doctrine</i> as they knew came from God. These doctrines were those which contained all the essential principles of Christianity, and this was called THE FAITH; and, as they must have <i>sound</i> <i>principles</i>, in order that they might have <i>righteous practices</i>, so it was necessary that they should <i>continue</i> in that <i>faith</i>, that it might produce that <i>obedience</i>, without which even <i>faith</i> itself, however excellent, must be useless and dead.</p>
<p>Again, as the <i>spirit</i> of the <i>world</i> would be ever opposed to the <i>spirit</i> of <i>Christ</i>, so they must make up their minds to expect persecution and <i>tribulation</i> in various forms, and therefore had need of <i>confirmed souls</i> and <i>strong faith</i>, that, when trials came, they might meet them with becoming fortitude, and stand unmoved in the cloudy and dark day. And as the mind must faint under trouble that sees no prospect of its <i>termination</i>, and no conviction of its <i>use</i>, it was necessary that they should keep in view the <i>kingdom of</i> <i>God</i>, of which they were <i>subjects</i>, and <i>to</i> which, through their <i>adoption</i> into the heavenly family, they had a <i>Divine right</i>. Hence, from the apostles teaching, they not only learned that they should meet with tribulation, <i>much tribulation</i>, but, for their encouragement, they were also informed that these were the very <i>means</i> which God would use to bring them into his own kingdom; so that, if they had <i>tribulation</i> in the <i>way</i>, they had a <i>heaven</i> of <i>eternal glory</i> as the <i>end</i> to which they were continually to direct their views.</p>
