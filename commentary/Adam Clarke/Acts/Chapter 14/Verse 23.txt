<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>. <i><b>When they had ordained them elders</b></i> — <i>Elder</i> seems to be here the name of an <i>office</i>. These were all <i>young</i> or <i>new converts</i>, and yet among <i>them</i> the apostles constitute <i>elders</i>. They appointed persons the most experienced, and the most advanced in the Divine life, to watch over and instruct the rest. But what is the meaning of the word χειροτονησαντες, which we translate <i>ordained</i>? The word <i>ordain</i> we use in an <i>ecclesiastical</i> sense, and signify by it the appointment of a person to an office in the Church, <i>by the</i> <i>imposition of the hands of those who are rulers in that Church</i>. But χειροτονια a signifies the <i>holding up</i> or <i>stretching out</i> the <i>hand</i>, as <i>approving</i> of the <i>choice</i> of any person to a particular work: whereas χειροθεσια signifies the <i>imposition of hands</i>. "<i>Zonaras</i> gives he proper meaning of the word in the text, in his Scholia upon the first canon of the apostles, Νυν μεν χειροτονια καλειται, κ. τ. λ. 'Nowadays, a course of prayers and invocation on the Holy Spirit, when one is initiated into the priesthood, and receives consecration, is called χειροτονια, <i>cheirotonia</i>, so termed because the bishop <i>extends his hand</i> over him whom he blesses, when he is chosen into holy orders. Anciently, the choice or suffrage was called <i>cheirotonia</i>; for, when it was lawful for the multitude in their cities to choose their priests or bishops, they met together, and some chose one man, some another; but, that it might appear whose suffrage won, they say the electors did use εκτεινειν τας χειρας, <i>to stretch forth their hands</i>, and by their hands so <i>stretched forth</i>, or <i>up</i>, they were numbered who chose the one, and who the other; and him who was elected by the most suffrages they placed in the high priesthood. And from hence was the name <i>cheirotonia</i> taken, which the fathers of the councils are found to have used, calling their suffrage <i>cheirotonia</i>.' St. <i>Paul</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>, intimates that St. Luke was thus appointed to travel with him χειροτονηθεις ὑπο των εκκλησιων, <i>who was chosen of the</i> <i>Churches</i>. <i>Ignatius</i>, in his epistle to the Philadelphians, uses the same term, πρεπον εστιν ὑμιν, ὡς εκκλησια Θεου, χειροτονησαι επισκοπον, <i>ye ought, as a Church of God, to choose your bishop</i>." Much more on this subject may be seen in Sir <i>Norton Knatchbull</i>, who contends that <i>cheirotonia</i> implies simply <i>appointment</i> or <i>election</i>, but not what he calls <i>ordination</i> by the <i>imposition of</i> <i>hands</i>. I believe the simple truth to be this, that in ancient times the people chose by the <i>cheirotonia</i> (lifting up of hands) their spiritual pastor; and the <i>rulers</i> of the Church, whether <i>apostles</i> or <i>others</i>, appointed that person to his office by the <i>cheirothesia</i>, or <i>imposition of hands</i>; and perhaps each of these was thought to be equally necessary: the <i>Church agreeing</i> in the <i>election</i> of the person; and the <i>rulers</i> of the Church appointing, by <i>imposition of hands</i>, the person thus elected. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:6">Acts 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:6">Acts 6:6</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And had l prayed with fasting</b></i> — This was to implore God's special assistance; as they well knew that, without his influence, even <i>their</i> appointment could avail nothing.</p>
<p><i><b>Commended them to the Lord</b></i> — To his especial care and protection.</p>
