<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:25">Acts 14:25</span>. <i><b>They went down into Attalia</b></i> â€” This was a sea-port town in Pamphylia. Thus we find the apostles travelled from Derbe to Lystra; from Lystra to Iconium; from Iconium to Antioch of Pisidia; from Antioch to Perga in Pamphylia; and from Perga to Attalia; and it appears that they travelled over three provinces of Asia Minor, <i>Pamphylia, Lycaonia</i>, and <i>Pisidia</i>. See Calmet, and see the <i>map</i>.</p>
