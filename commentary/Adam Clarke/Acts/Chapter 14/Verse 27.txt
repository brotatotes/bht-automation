Verse Acts 14:27. Had gathered the Church together — The Church by which they had been sent on this very important and successful mission.They rehearsed all that God had done with them — Not what they had done themselves; but what GOD made them the instruments of working.And how he had opened the door of faith — How God by his providence and grace had made a way for preaching Christ crucified among the heathen; and how the heathen had received that Gospel which, through faith in Christ Jesus, was able to save their souls.
