<p><i><b>They rehearsed all that God had done with them</b></i> — Not what they had done <i>themselves</i>; but what GOD made them the <i>instruments</i> of working.</p>
<p><i><b>And how he had opened the door of faith</b></i> — How God by his providence and grace had made a way for preaching Christ crucified among the heathen; and how the heathen had received that Gospel which, through faith in Christ Jesus, was able to save their souls.</p>
