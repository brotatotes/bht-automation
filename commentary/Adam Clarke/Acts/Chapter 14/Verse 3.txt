Verse Acts 14:3. Long time therefore abode they — Because they had great success, therefore they continued a long time, gaining many converts, and building up those who had believed, in their most holy faith; notwithstanding the opposition they met with, both from the unbelieving Jews and heathens.Speaking boldly — παρρησιαζομενοι, Having great liberty of speech, a copious and commanding eloquence, springing from a consciousness of the truth which they preached.The word of his grace — The Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the doctrine of God's grace, mercy, or favour to mankind.And granted signs and wonders to be done — For no apostle could work a miracle by himself; nor was any sign or wonder wrought even by the greatest apostle, but by an especial grant or dispensation of God. This power was not resident in them at all times; it was only now and then communicated, when a miracle was necessary for the confirmation of the truth preached.
