<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span>. <i><b>They were ware of</b></i><b> it</b>] They were informed of the scheme, and of the attempt that was about to be made, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe; they did not leave the <i>province</i> of Lycaonia, but went to other towns and cities. Lystra lay to the south and Derbe to the north of Iconium, according to the general opinion. Strabo, Geogr. lib. xii., tells us expressly, that Iconium was within Lycaonia, <i>Thence are the Lycaonian hills plain, cold, naked, and</i> <i>pastures for wild asses. About these places stands Iconium, a town</i> <i>built in a better soil</i>. Ptolemy also, Tab. Asiae, i. cap. 6, places Iconium in Lycaonia. How comes it, then, that St. Luke does not call Iconium a city of Lycaonia, as well as Derbe and Lystra? Pliny, Hist. Nat. lib. v. cap. 27, solves this difficulty, by stating, that <i>there was granted a tetrarchy out of Lycaonia, on</i> <i>that side which borders upon Galatia, consisting of fourteen</i> <i>cities; the most famous of which is Iconium</i>.
