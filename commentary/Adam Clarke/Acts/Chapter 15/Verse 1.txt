<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1">Acts 15:1</span>. <i><b>Except ye be circumcised</b></i>, c.] The persons who taught this doctrine appear to have been converts to Christianity but, supposing that the Christian religion was intended to <i>perfect</i> the Mosaic, and not to supersede it, they insisted on the necessity of circumcision, because, by that, a man was made debtor to the whole law, to observe all its rites and ceremonies. This question produced great disturbance in the apostolic Church; and, notwithstanding the decree mentioned in this chapter, the apostles were frequently obliged to interpose their authority in order to settle it; and we find a whole Church, that at Galatia, drawn aside from the simplicity of the Christian faith by the subtilty of Judaizing teachers among themselves, who insisted on the necessity of the converted Gentiles being circumcised.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye cannot be saved.</b></i> â€” Ye can neither enjoy God's blessing in time, nor his glory in eternity. Such an assertion as this, from any reputable authority, must necessarily shake the confidence of young converts.</p>
