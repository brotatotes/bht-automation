<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:12">Acts 15:12</span>. <i><b>All the multitude kept silence</b></i> — The strong facts stated by St. Peter could not be controverted. His speech may be thus analyzed:</p>
<p>1. Circumcision is a sign of the purification of the heart.</p>
<p>2. That purification can only be effected by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>3. This Holy Spirit was hitherto supposed to be the portion of those only who had received circumcision.</p>
<p>4. But the Gentiles, who were never circumcised, nor kept any part of the law of Moses, have had their hearts purified by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>5. As God, therefore, has given <i>them</i> the thing <i>signified</i>, he evidently does not intend that the <i>sign</i> should be administered.</p>
<p>6. Should we impose this burthensome rite, we should most evidently be provoking God, who plainly shows us that he intends no more to save in this way.</p>
<p>7. Therefore it is evident that both Jews and Gentiles are to be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Gave audience to Barnabas and Paul</b></i> — These apostles came forward next, to corroborate what Peter had said, by showing the miracles and wonders which God had by them wrought among the Gentiles. Peter stated facts: Paul and Barnabas confirmed the statement.</p>
