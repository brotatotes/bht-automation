<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:13">Acts 15:13</span>. <i><b>James answered</b></i> â€” He was evidently <i>president</i> of the council, and is generally called bishop of Jerusalem. The rest either <i>argued</i> on the subject, or gave their <i>opinion</i>; James alone pronounced the <i>definitive sentence</i>. Had Peter been <i>prince</i> and <i>head</i> of the apostles, and of the Church, he would have appeared here in the character of <i>judge</i>, not of mere <i>counsellor</i> or <i>disputant</i>. Thy popish writers say that "James presided because the council was held in his own church." These men forget that there was not then what they term a Church on the face of the earth. The Church, or assembly of believers, then met in private houses; for there was no <i>building</i> for the exclusive purpose of Christian worship then, nor till long after. These writers also forget that the pope pretends to be the head of the catholic or universal Church; and, consequently, no man can <i>preside</i> where he is present, but himself. Peter did not <i>preside</i> here; and this was the first ecclesiastical council, and now, if ever, he should have assumed his character of <i>prince</i> and <i>chief</i>; but he did not; nor did any of the other apostles invite him to it, which they would have done had they thought that Jesus Christ constituted him <i>head</i> of the <i>Church</i>. From this very circumstance there is the most demonstrative evidence that <i>Peter was no pope</i>, and that the <i>right</i> of his pretended successor is a <i>nonentity</i>.</p>
