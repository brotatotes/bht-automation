<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:14">Acts 15:14</span>. <i><b>Simeon hath declared</b></i> — It is remarkable that James does not give him even the <i>title</i> which he received from our Lord at the time in which he is <i>supposed</i> to have been made <i>head</i> of the <i>Church,</i> and <i>vicar</i> of <i>Christ</i> upon earth; so that, it is evident, James did not understand our Lord as giving Peter any such pre-eminence; and, therefore, he does not even call him <i>Peter</i>, but simply <i>Simeon</i>. It is truly surprising that such a vast number of important pretensions should rest on such slight foundations! If <i>tradition</i>, no matter how <i>interrupted</i> or <i>precarious</i>, did not lend its support, feeble as that necessarily must be, the cause tried by plain <i>Scripture</i> would fall to the ground.</p>
<p><i><b>To take out of them a people for his name.</b></i> — To form <i>among</i> the Gentiles, as he had <i>among</i> the Jews, a people called by his name and devoted to his honour.</p>
