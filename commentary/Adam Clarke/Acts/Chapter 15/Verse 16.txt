<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:16">Acts 15:16</span>. <i><b>After this I will return, and will build again</b></i>, c.] These two verses, 16th and 17th, are quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+9:11-12">Amos 9:11-12</span>, nearly as they now stand in the best editions of the <i>Septuagint</i>, and evidently taken from that version, which differs considerably from the Hebrew text. As St. James quoted them as a prophecy of the <i>calling of the Gentiles into the Church of God</i>, it is evident the Jews must have understood them in that sense, otherwise they would have immediately disputed his application of them to the subject in question, and have rejected his conclusion by denying the premises. But that the words were thus understood by the ancient Jews, we have their own testimony. In <i>Sanhedr</i>. fol. 69, we have these remarkable words: "Rabbi Nachman said to Rabbi Isaac, 'Whence art thou taught when <i>Bar Naphli</i> will come?' He saith unto him, 'Who is this <i>Bar Naphli</i>?' The other replied, 'He is the <i>Messiah</i>.' 'Dost thou then call the Messiah <i>Bar Naphli</i>?' 'Yes,' said he, 'for it is written, <i>In that day I will build again the</i> <i>tabernacle of David</i>, הנפלת HANOPHELETH, <i>which is falling down</i>.'" This is evidently a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+9:11">Amos 9:11</span>, and a proof that the Jews understood it to be a prophecy concerning the Messiah. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
