<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:17">Acts 15:17</span>. <i><b>That the residue of men might seek</b></i> — Instead of this, the Hebrew has, <i>That they may possess the remnant of Edom</i>. Now it is evident that, in the copy from which the Seventy translated, they found ידרשו <i>yidreshu, they might seek</i>, instead of יירשו <i>yireshu, they may possess</i>, where the whole difference between the two words is the change of the י <i>yod</i> for a ד <i>daleth</i>, which might be easily done; and they found אדם <i>adam, man</i>, or <i>men</i>, instead of אדום <i>Edom</i>, the <i>Idumeans</i>, which differs from the other only by the insertion of ו <i>vau</i> between the two last letters. None of the MSS. collated by <i>Kennicott</i> and <i>De Rossi</i> confirm these readings, in which the <i>Septuagint, Arabic</i>, and St. <i>James</i> agree. It shows, however, that even in Jerusalem, and in the early part of the apostolic age, the <i>Septuagint</i> version was quoted in preference to the <i>Hebrew</i> text; or, what is tantamount, was quoted in cases where we would have thought the Hebrew text should have been preferred, because better <i>understood</i>. But God was evidently preparing the way of the Gospel by bringing this venerable version into general credit and use; which was to be the means of conveying the truths of Christianity to the whole Gentile world. How precious should this august and most important version be to every <i>Christian</i>, and especially to every Christian <i>minister</i>! A version, without which no man ever did or ever can critically understand the New Testament. And I may add that, without the assistance afforded by this version, there never could have been a correct translation of the Hebrew text, since that language ceased to be vernacular, into any language. Without it, even St. Jerome could have done little in translating the Old Testament into Latin; and how much all the modern versions owe to St. Jerome's Vulgate, which owes so much to the Septuagint, most Biblical scholars know.</p>
