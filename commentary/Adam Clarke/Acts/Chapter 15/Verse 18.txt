<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:18">Acts 15:18</span>. <i><b>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning</b></i> — As if he had said, This is not a new counsel of God: he had purposed, from the time he called the <i>Israelites</i>, to make the <i>Gentiles</i> partakers of the same grace and mercy; and ultimately to destroy those rites and ceremonies which separated them from each other. He therefore has sent the Gospel of his Son, proclaiming equally peace to him that is <i>afar off</i>, the <i>Gentiles</i>, and to him that is <i>nigh</i>, the <i>Jews</i>.</p>
<p>The whole of this verse is very dubious: the principal part of it is omitted by the most ancient MSS., and Griesbach has left γνωϚα απ' αιωνος doubtful, and has thrown εϚι τῳ Θεῳ παντα τα εργα αὑτου out of the text. Of the former clause, Professor <i>White</i>, in his Crisews, says, "<i>forsitan</i> delenda," "<i>probably</i> these words should be blotted out." And of the latter clause he says, "<i>certissime</i> delenda," "<i>most assuredly</i> these should be blotted out." Supposing the whole to be genuine, critics have laboured to find out the sense. Some very learned men, and particularly <i>Schleusner</i>, contend that the word γνωϚα, from γινωσκειν, <i>to</i> <i>know</i>, should be understood here in the same sense in which ידא <i>yada</i> is in many parts of the Old Testament, which not only signifies <i>to know</i>, but <i>to approve, love</i>, c. They therefore would translate the passage thus: <i>All the works of God are ever dear</i> <i>unto him</i>. And, if so, consequently we might naturally expect him to be merciful to the <i>Gentiles</i>, as well as to the <i>Jews</i> and the evidence now afforded of the conversion of the Gentiles is an additional proof that all God's works are equally dear to him.</p>
