<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span>. <i><b>No small dissension and disputation</b></i> — Paul and Barnabas were fully satisfied that God did not design to bring the converted Gentiles under the yoke of circumcision: they knew that Jesus Christ was the end of the law for righteousness (justification) to every one that believed, and therefore they opposed the Judaizing teachers. This was one of the first controversies in the Christian Church; but, though the difference of sentiment was considerable, it led to no breach of Christian charity nor fellowship among themselves.</p>
<p><i><b>They determined that Paul</b></i>, c.] This verse is read very differently in the <i>Codex Bezae</i>: Γενομενης δε εκτασεως και ζητησεως ουκ ολιγης τῳ Παυλῳ και τῳ Βαρναβᾳ συν αυτοις. ελεγεν γαρ ὁ Παυλος μενειν οὑτως, καθως επιϚευσαν, διΐσχυριζομενος. οἱ δε εληλυθοτες απο Ἱερουσαλημ, παρηγγειλαν αυτοις, τῳ Παυλῳ και τῳ Βαρναβᾳ και τισιν αλλοις, αναβαινειν προς τους ΑποϚολους και Πρεσβυτερους εις Ἱερουσαλημ, ὁπως κριθωσιν επ' αυτοις (αυτων) περι του ζητηματος τουτου. <i>But when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and</i> <i>disputation with them, Paul said, with strong assurance, that they</i> <i>should remain so as they had believed. But those who came from</i> <i>Jerusalem charged Paul and Barnabas and certain others to go up to</i> <i>the apostles and elders to Jerusalem, that a determination might</i> <i>be made by them concerning this question</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And certain other of them</b></i> — If this be the journey to which St. Paul alludes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1-5">Galatians 2:1-5</span>, then he had <i>Titus</i> with him and how many elders went from the Church of Antioch we cannot tell. This journey was 14 years after Paul's conversion, and was undertaken by express <i>revelation</i>, as he informs us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>, which revelation appears to have been given to certain persons in the Church of Antioch, as we learn from this verse, and not to Paul and Barnabas themselves.</p>
