<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>. <i><b>But that we write unto them</b></i> — Four things are prohibited in this decree:</p>
<p>1. Pollutions of idols;</p>
<p>2. fornication;</p>
<p>3. things strangled;</p>
<p>4. blood.</p>
<p>By the <i>first</i>, POLLUTIONS <i>of</i> IDOLS, or, as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:25">Acts 15:25</span>, <i>meats offered to idols</i>, not only all <i>idolatry</i> was forbidden, but eating things offered in sacrifice to idols, knowing that they were thus offered, and joining with idolaters in their <i>sacred</i> <i>feasts</i>, which were always an incentive either to <i>idolatry</i> itself, or to the impure acts generally attendant on such festivals.</p>
<p>By the <i>second</i>, FORNICATION, all uncleanness of every kind was prohibited; for πορνεια not only means <i>fornication</i>, but <i>adultery,</i> <i>incestuous mixtures</i>, and especially the <i>prostitution</i> which was so common at the idol temples, viz. in <i>Cyprus</i>, at the worship of <i>Venus</i>; and the shocking disorders exhibited in the <i>Bacchanalia,</i> <i>Lupercalia</i>, and several others.</p>
<p>By the <i>third</i>, THINGS STRANGLED, we are to understand the <i>flesh</i> of those <i>animals</i> which were <i>strangled</i> for the purpose of <i>keeping</i> <i>the blood in the body</i>, as such animals were esteemed a greater delicacy.</p>
<p>By the <i>fourth</i>, BLOOD, we are to understand, not only the thing itself, for the reasons which I have assigned in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:4">Genesis 9:4</span>, and for others detailed at the end of this chapter; but also all <i>cruelty, manslaughter, murder</i>, c., as some of the ancient fathers have understood it.</p>
<p>Instead of τουαιμαρτος, <i>blood</i>, some have conjectured that we should read χοιρειας, <i>swine's flesh</i> for <i>they</i> cannot see, <i>first</i>, that there can be any <i>harm</i> in eating of blood; and, <i>secondly</i>, that, as the other <i>three</i> things neither have nor can have any moral evil in them, it would seem strange that they should be coupled with a thing which, on all hands, is confessed to have much moral turpitude. Answers to such trifling objections will be found at the end of the chapter. It is only necessary to add that this χοιρειας, which is the critical emendation of Dr. <i>Bentley</i>, is not supported by one MS. or <i>version</i> in existence.</p>
<p>At the close of this verse, the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, and several others, add a <i>fifth</i> thing, <i>And not to do to others what they would not</i> <i>have done to themselves</i>. Though this is a very <i>ancient</i> reading, it does not appear to be genuine.</p>
