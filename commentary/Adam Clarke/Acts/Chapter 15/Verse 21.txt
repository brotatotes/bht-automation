<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:21">Acts 15:21</span>. <i><b>Moses of old time hath in every city</b></i> — The sense of this verse seems to be this: As it was necessary to write to the <i>Gentiles</i> what was strictly necessary to be observed by <i>them</i>, relative to these points, it was not so to the converted Jews; for they had <i>Moses</i>, that is, the <i>law, preached to them</i>, κατα πολιν, <i>in the city</i>, that is, <i>Antioch</i>; and, by the reading of the law in the synagogues every Sabbath day, they were kept in remembrance of those institutions which the Gentiles, who had not the law, could not know. Therefore, James thought that a letter to the converted <i>Gentiles</i> would be sufficient, as the converted <i>Jews</i> had already ample instruction on these points.</p>
