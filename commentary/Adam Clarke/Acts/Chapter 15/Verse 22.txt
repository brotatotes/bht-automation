<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>. <i><b>Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>whole Church</b></i> — James determined <i>what</i> ought to be done; and the whole assembly resolved <i>how</i> that should be done.</p>
<p><i><b>Chosen men of their own company</b></i> — Paul and Barnabas were to return: they could have witnessed to the Church at Antioch what was done at the council at Jerusalem; but as it was possible that their testimony might be suspected, from the part they had already taken in this question at Antioch, it was necessary that a deputation from the council should accompany them. Accordingly Judas and Silas are sent to corroborate by their oral testimony what was contained in the letters sent from the council.</p>
