<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>. Send <i><b>greeting unto the brethren - of the Gentiles</b></i> — There was no occasion to send such a letter to the brethren which were of the <i>Jews</i>, because that law which had been so long read in their synagogues taught them all those things; and therefore the epistle is sent exclusively to the <i>Gentiles</i>. The word <i>greeting</i> is in the original χαιρειν, <i>to be well, to be safe</i>; a very usual form in Greek epistles, the word ευχομαι being understood, <i>I wish thee to</i> <i>be well</i>.</p>
