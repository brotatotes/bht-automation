<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span>. <i><b>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us</b></i> — The whole council had met under his <i>direction</i>; had consulted under his <i>influence</i>; and gave forth their decree from his especial <i>inspiration</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Necessary things</b></i> — They were <i>necessary</i>, howsoever burthensome they might appear; and necessary, not only for the time, place, or occasion; but for <i>all times, all places</i>, and <i>all occasions</i>. See this proved in the observations at the end of this chapter.</p>
