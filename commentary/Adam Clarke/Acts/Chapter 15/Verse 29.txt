<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Ye shall do well.</b></i> — But, if they did not keep themselves from these things, they would <i>do ill</i>; that is, they would <i>sin</i> against God, whose Spirit had commanded them to keep from these things. And who can do any of these forbidden things, and keep either a <i>guiltless</i> or a <i>tender</i> conscience?</p>
<p><i><b>Fare-well.</b></i> — An old English form of expressing <i>good wishes</i> and <i>good will</i>. It is compounded of [Anglo-Saxon] <i>to go</i>, and [A.S.], <i>much, well, very much. Go well, go prosperously</i>!-tantamount with <i>good speed</i>! may you succeed well! may God direct you! Like to that other form of sound words, <i>God be with you</i>! corrupted now into <i>good by to ye</i>! And of the same meaning with <i>adieu</i>! a Dieu, <i>to</i> <i>God</i>; that is, <i>I commend you to God</i>. All these terms savour not only of <i>good will</i>, or <i>benevolence</i>, but also of <i>piety</i>. Our pious ancestors believed that nothing was safe, nothing protected, nothing prosperous, over which the shield of God was not extended; and, therefore, in their familiar good wishes, they <i>gave each</i> <i>other to God</i>. The Greek word ερρωσθε, <i>errhosthe</i>, here used, from ρωννυμι, <i>to strengthen, make strong</i>, has nearly the same signification: <i>be strong, courageous, active, be in health</i>, and <i>be</i> <i>prosperous</i>! What a pity that such benevolent and pious wishes should degenerate into <i>cool formalities</i>, or <i>unmeaning compliments</i>!</p>
