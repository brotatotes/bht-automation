<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Let us go - and visit our brethren in every city</b></i> â€” This heavenly man projected a journey to <i>Cyprus, Pamphylia, Pisidia,</i> <i>Lycaonia, Salamis, Paphos, Perga, Iconiam, Lystra, Derbe, Antioch</i> in Pisidia, and elsewhere; for in all these places he had preached and founded Churches in the preceding year. He saw it was necessary to <i>water</i> the seed he had <i>planted</i>; for these were young converts, surrounded with impiety, opposition, and superstition, and had few advantages among themselves.</p>
