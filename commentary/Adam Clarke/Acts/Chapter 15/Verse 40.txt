<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:40">Acts 15:40</span>. <i><b>Being recommended - unto the grace of God.</b></i> â€” Much stress has been laid upon this, to show that Barnabas was in the <i>wrong</i>, and Paul in the <i>right</i>, because "the brethren recommended Paul and Silas to the grace of God; but they did not recommend Barnabas and John Mark: this proves that the Church condemned the conduct of Barnabas, but approved that of Paul." Now, there is no proof that the Church did not recommend Barnabas to the grace of God, as well as Paul; but, as St. Luke had for the present dropped the story of Barnabas, and was now going on with that of Paul and Silas, he begins it at this point, viz. his being recommended by the brethren to the grace of God; and then goes on to tell of his progress in Syria, Derbe, Lystra, c., &amp;c. See the next chapter. And with this verse should the following chapter begin and this is the division followed by the most correct copies of the Greek text.</p>
