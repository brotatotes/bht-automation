<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:41">Acts 15:41</span>. <i><b>Confirming the Churches.</b></i> â€” This was the object of his journey: they were young converts, and had need of establishment; and there is no doubt that, by showing them the decision made at the late council of Jerusalem, their faith was greatly strengthened, their hope confirmed, and their love increased. It was this consideration, no doubt, that led some ancient MSS. and some versions to add here, <i>They delivered them the decrees of the</i> <i>apostles and elders to keep</i>; which clause certainly was not an original part of the text, but seems to have been borrowed from the fourth verse of the following chapter. Some have thought that the fourth and fifth verses of the next chapter really belong to this place; or that the first, second, and third verses of it should be read in a parenthesis; but of this there does not appear to be any particular necessity.</p>
