<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span>. <i><b>When there had been much disputing</b></i> — By those of the sect of the believing Pharisees; for they strongly contended for circumcision, and at the head of these, tradition tells us, was <i>Cerinthus</i>, a name famous in the primitive Church, as one who laboured to unite the law and the Gospel, and to make the salvation promised by the latter dependent on the performance of the rites and ceremonies prescribed by the former. Though the apostles and elders were under the inspiration of the Almighty, and could by this inspiration have immediately determined the question, yet it was highly necessary that the objecting party should be permitted to come forward and allege their reasons for the doctrines they preached, and that these reasons should be fairly met by argument, and the thing proved to be <i>useless</i> in itself, <i>inexpedient</i> in the present case, and <i>unsupported</i> by any express authority from God, and serving no purpose to the Gentiles, who in their uncircumcised state, by believing in Christ Jesus, had been made partakers of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><i><b>Peter rose up, and said</b></i> — This was after the matters in dispute had been fully debated; and now the apostles, like judges, after hearing counsel on both sides, proceed to give judgment on the case.</p>
<p><i><b>A good while ago</b></i> — Αφ' ἡμερων αρχαιων, <i>From the days of old</i>: a phrase which simply signifies <i>some years ago</i>; and, if he here refers to the conversion of Cornelius, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1-48">Acts 10:1-48</span>,) he must mean about <i>ten</i> years before this time; but it is more likely that he refers to that time when Christ gave him <i>the keys of the</i> <i>kingdom of heaven</i>, that be might <i>open the door</i> of faith to the Gentiles.</p>
<p><i><b>God made choice among us</b></i> — That is, he chose me to be the first apostle of the Gentiles.</p>
