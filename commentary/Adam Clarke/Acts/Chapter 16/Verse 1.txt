<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>. <i><b>A certain disciple</b></i> â€” Bishop Pearce would read the latter part of this verse and the beginning of the next thus-<i>A certain</i> <i>disciple named Timotheus, (the son of a certain Jewish woman that</i> <i>believed, but of a father who was a Greek,) who was well reported</i> <i>of by the brethren</i>, c.</p>
<p>This Timothy was the same person to whom St. Paul wrote those two noble epistles which are still extant. His mother's name was <i>Eunice</i>, as we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>. What his father's name was we know not he was either a mere <i>heathen</i>, or, at most, only a <i>proselyte of the gate</i>, who never submitted to circumcision: had he submitted to this rite, he would, no doubt, have circumcised his son; but the son being without it is a proof that the father was so too. Some MSS. state that Timothy's mother was now a <i>widow</i>; but this does not appear to be well founded.</p>
