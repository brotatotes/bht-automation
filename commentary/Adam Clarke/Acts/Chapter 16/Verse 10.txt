<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>. <i><b>We endeavoured to go into Macedonia</b></i> — This is the first place that the historian St. Luke refers to himself: <i>WE</i> <i>endeavoured</i>, c. And, from this, it has been supposed that he joined the company of Paul, for the first time, at Troas.</p>
<p><i><b>Assuredly gathering</b></i> — συμβιβαζοντες, Drawing an inference from the vision that had appeared.</p>
<p><i><b>That the Lord had called us for to preach</b></i> — That is, they inferred that they were called to <i>preach the Gospel</i> in Macedonia, from what the vision had said, <i>come over</i> and <i>help us</i> the <i>help</i> meaning, <i>preach to us the Gospel</i>. Instead of οκυριος, <i>the Lord</i>, meaning JESUS, several MSS., such as ABCE, several others, with the <i>Coptic, Vulgate, Theophylact</i>, and <i>Jerome</i>, have οθεος, GOD. Though this stands on very reputable authority, yet the former seems to be the better reading; for it was the SPIRIT of JESUS, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:7">Acts 16:7</span>, that would not suffer them to go into <i>Bithynia</i>, because he had designed that they should immediately preach the Gospel in Macedonia.</p>
