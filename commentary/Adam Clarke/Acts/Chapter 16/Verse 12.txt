<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:12">Acts 16:12</span>. <i><b>And from thence to Philippi</b></i> — This was a town of Macedonia, in the territory of the <i>Edones</i>, on the confines of Thrace, situated on the side of a steep eminence. It took its name from Philip II., king of Macedon. It is famous for two battles, fought between the imperial army, commanded by <i>Octavianus</i>, afterwards <i>Augustus</i>, and <i>Mark Antony</i>, and the republican army, commanded by <i>Brutus</i> and <i>Cassius</i>, in which these were successful; and a second, between <i>Octavianus</i> and <i>Antony</i> on the one part, and <i>Brutus</i> on the other. In this battle the republican troops were cut to pieces, after which Brutus killed himself. It was to the Church in this city that St. Paul wrote the epistle that still goes under their name. This place is still in being, though much decayed, and is the see of an archbishop.</p>
<p><i><b>The chief city of that part of Macedonia</b></i> — This passage has greatly puzzled both critics and commentators. It is well known that, when <i>Paulus AEmilius</i> had conquered Macedonia, he divided it into four parts, μερη, and that he called the country that lay between the rivers Strymon and Nessus, the <i>first part</i>, and made Amphipolis its <i>chief city</i>, or metropolis; Philippi, therefore, was not its <i>chief city</i>. But Bishop <i>Pearce</i> has, with great show of reason, argued that, though <i>Amphipolis</i> was made the chief city of it by Paulus AEmilius, yet <i>Philippi</i> might have been the chief city in the days of St. Paul, which was two hundred and twenty years after the division by P. AEmilius. Besides, as it was at this place that Augustus gained that victory which put him in possession of the whole Roman empire, might not he have given to <i>it</i> that dignity which was before enjoyed by Amphipolis? This is the most rational way of solving this difficulty; and therefore I shall not trouble the reader with the different modes that have been proposed to <i>alter</i> and <i>amend</i> the Greek <i>text</i>.</p>
<p>And <i><b>a colony</b></i> — That is, a colony of Rome; for it appears that a colony was planted here by Julius Caesar, and afterwards enlarged by Augustus; the people, therefore, were considered as freemen of Rome, and, from this, call themselves <i>Romans</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:21">Acts 16:21</span>. The Jewish definition of קלניא <i>kolonia</i> (for they have the <i>Latin</i> word in <i>Hebrew</i> letters, as St. Luke has it. here, κολωνια, in <i>Greek</i> letters) is, <i>a free city, which does not pay tribute</i>.</p>
