<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>. <i><b>By a river side, where prayer was wont to be made</b></i> — ου Οὑ ενομιζετο προσευχη ειναι, <i>where it was said there was a proseucha</i>. The proseucha was a <i>place</i> of <i>prayer</i>, or a <i>place</i> used for <i>worship</i>, where there was no synagogue. It was a large building uncovered, with seats, as in an amphitheatre. Buildings of this sort the Jews had by the sea side, and by the sides of rivers. See this subject considered at large in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span><i>"</i>. It appears that the apostles had <i>heard</i> from some of the Gentiles, or from some of the Jews themselves, that there was a <i>place of prayer</i> by the river side; and they went out in quest of it, knowing that, as it was the Sabbath, they should find some Jews there.</p>
<p><i><b>Spake unto the women</b></i> — Probably this was before the time of their public worship, and while they were waiting for the assembling of the people in general; and Paul improved the opportunity to speak concerning Christ and salvation to the women that resorted thither.</p>
