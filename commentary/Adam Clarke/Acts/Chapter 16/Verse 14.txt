<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:14">Acts 16:14</span>. <i><b>Lydia, a seller of purple</b></i> — She probably had her name from the province of <i>Lydia</i>, in which the city of <i>Thyatira</i> was situated. The Lydian women have been celebrated for their beautiful purple manufactures.</p>
<p><i><b>Which worshipped God</b></i> — That is, she was a <i>proselyte</i> to the Jewish religion; as were probably all the women that resorted hither.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose heart the Lord opened</b></i> — As she was a sincere worshipper of God, she was prepared to receive the heavenly truths spoken by Paul and his companions; and, as she was <i>faithful</i> to the grace she had received, so God gave her more grace, and gave her now a Divine conviction that what was spoken by Paul was true; and therefore <i>she attended unto the things</i>-she believed them and received them as the doctrines of God; and in this faith she was joined by her whole family, and in it they were all baptized.</p>
