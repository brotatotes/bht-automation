<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:15">Acts 16:15</span>. <i><b>If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord</b></i> — The meaning seems to be this: If my present reception of the Gospel of Christ be a proof to you that I have been faithful to the Lord, in the light previously imparted, and that I am as likely to be faithful to this <i>new grace</i> as I have been to that already received, and, consequently, not likely by light or fickle conduct to bring any discredit on this Divine work, <i>come into my house,</i> <i>and abide there</i>. It is wrong to suppose that this woman had not received a measure of the light of God <i>before</i> this time.</p>
<p><i><b>And she constrained us.</b></i> — She used such entreaties and persuasions that at last they consented to lodge there.</p>
