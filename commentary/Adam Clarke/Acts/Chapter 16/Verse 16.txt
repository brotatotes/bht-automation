<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:16">Acts 16:16</span>. <i><b>As we went to prayer</b></i> — εις προσευχην, <i>Into the</i> <i>proseucha</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span>. The article, την, is added here by ABCE, several others, <i>Origen</i> and <i>Theophylact</i>: thus makes the place more emphatic, and seems to determine the above meaning of προσευχην to be right-not the <i>act</i> <i>of prayer</i> or <i>praying</i> to God, but the <i>place</i>, the <i>oratory</i>, in which these proselytes assembled for the purpose of praying, reading the law and the prophets, and such like exercises of devotion. It appears that the apostles spent dome time here; as it is evident, from this and the following verses, that they often resorted to this place to preach the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Possessed with a spirit of divination</b></i> — εχουσαν πνευμα πυθωνος, <i>Having a spirit of Python</i>, or of <i>Apollo</i>. Pytho was, according to fable, a huge serpent, that had an oracle at Mount Parnassus, famous for predicting future events; Apollo slew this serpent, and hence he was called <i>Pythius</i>, and became celebrated as the foreteller of future events; and all those, who either could or pretended to predict future events, were influenced by the spirit of <i>Apollo Pythius</i>. As often-times the priestesses of this god became greatly agitated, and gave answers apparently from their <i>bellies</i>, when their mouths remained close, πυθων was applied to the εγγαστριμυθοι, or <i>ventriloquists</i>. Hesychius defines πυθων, δαιμονιον μαντικον, a <i>divining demon</i>; and it was evidently such a one that possessed this young woman, and which Paul expelled, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:18">Acts 16:18</span>. See on this subject, <i>Clarke's notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+19:31">Leviticus 19:31</span><i>"</i>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:11">Deuteronomy 18:11</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Brought her masters much gain by soothsaying</b></i> — μαντευουενη, <i>By</i> <i>divination</i>, or what we call <i>telling fortunes</i>. Our term <i>soothsaying</i> coming from the Anglo-Saxon [A.S.], <i>truth</i>; and [A.S.], <i>to say</i>, i.e. <i>truth saying</i>, or <i>saying the truth</i>. For, as it was supposed among the heathen that such persons spoke by the inspiration of their <i>god</i>, consequently what they said must be <i>true</i>. However, our translators might have used a term here that would not have been so creditable to this Pythoness; for, what she said concerning the apostles excepted, she certainly could not be supposed to tell the <i>truth</i>, while her inspiration came from him who is the <i>father of</i> <i>lies</i>. But Satan will sometimes conceal himself under the guise of <i>truth</i>, that he may the more effectually <i>deceive</i>. See below.</p>
