<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:17">Acts 16:17</span>. <i><b>These men are the servants</b></i>, c.] It is astonishing how such a testimony could be given in such a case every syllable of it <i>true</i>, and at the same time full, clear, and distinct. But mark the deep design and artifice of this evil spirit:</p>
<p>1. He well knew that the Jewish law abhorred all <i>magic, incantations, magical</i> <i>rites</i>, and <i>dealings</i> with <i>familiar spirits</i>; he therefore bears what was in itself a true testimony to the apostles, that by it he may destroy their credit, and ruin their usefulness. The Jews, by this testimony, would be led at once to believe that the apostles were in compact with these demons, and that the miracles they wrought were done by the agency of these wicked spirits, and that the whole was the effect of <i>magic</i>; and this, of course, would harden their hearts against the preaching of the Gospel.</p>
<p>2. The GENTILES, finding that their own demon bore testimony to the apostles, would naturally consider that the whole was <i>one system</i>; that <i>they</i> had nothing to learn, nothing to correct; and thus the preaching of the apostles must be useless to <i>them</i>. In such a predicament is this, nothing could have saved the credit of the apostles but their dispossessing this woman of her familiar spirit, and that in the most incontestable manner; for what could have saved the credit of Moses and Aaron, when the magicians of Egypt turned their <i>rods into serpents</i>, had not Aaron's <i>rod</i> <i>devoured theirs</i>? And what could have saved the credit of these apostles but the casting out of this spirit of divination, with which, otherwise, both Jews and Gentiles would have believed them in compact?</p>
