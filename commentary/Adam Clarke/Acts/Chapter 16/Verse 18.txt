<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:18">Acts 16:18</span>. <i><b>Paul, being grieved</b></i> — Probably for the reasons assigned above.</p>
<p><i><b>Turned-to the spirit</b></i> — Not to the <i>woman</i>; she was only the <i>organ</i> by which the spirit acted.</p>
<p><i><b>I command thee, in the name of Jesus</b></i> — Jesus is the <i>Saviour</i>; Satan is <i>Abaddon</i> and <i>Apollyon</i>, the <i>destroyer</i>. The sovereign <i>Saviour</i> says to the <i>destroyer</i>, Come out of her; <i>and he came out</i> <i>in the same hour</i>. Every circumstance of this case proves it to have been a <i>real possession</i>. We have already had several opportunities of remarking the great accuracy of St. Luke in his accounts of demoniacs: his education as a <i>physician</i> gave him advantages to detect imposture of this kind where it subsisted; but he sees none in this case. He speaks of the <i>spirit</i> and the <i>damsel</i> as <i>distinct</i> persons. The <i>damsel</i> had a <i>spirit</i> of divination. Paul turned to the <i>spirit</i>, and said, I command THEE to <i>come out</i> of HER; and <i>he</i> came <i>out</i> in the same hour. Had not St. Luke considered this as a <i>real case of diabolic possession</i>, he has made use of the most improper language he could choose; language and forms of speech calculated to deceive all his readers, and cause them to believe a lie. But it is impossible that the holy apostle could <i>do so</i>, because he was a <i>good man</i>; and it is not likely he could be deceived by a parcel of <i>charlatans</i>, because he was a <i>wise</i> man; and it would be absurd to suppose that, while he was under the influence of the Holy Spirit, he could be imposed on by the <i>cunning</i> of even the <i>devil</i> himself.</p>
