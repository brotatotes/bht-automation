<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>. <i><b>When her masters saw</b></i> — It appears she was maintained by some men, who received a certain pay from every person whose <i>fortune she told</i>, or to whom she made any <i>discovery</i> of <i>stolen</i> <i>goods</i>, c., c.</p>
<p><i><b>The hope of their gains was gone</b></i> — Ἡ ελπις, <i>This hope</i> viz. the <i>spirit</i>. So completely was this spirit cast out that the girl could divine no more and yet she continued a heathen still, for we do not hear a word of <i>her</i> conversion. Had she been converted, got baptized, and been associated with the apostles, the family of Lydia, c., there would have been some show of reason to believe that there had been <i>no possession</i> in the case, and that the <i>spirit</i> <i>of divination</i> coming out of her meant no more than that, through scruple of conscience, she had left off her imposing arts, and would no longer continue to pretend to do what she knew she could not perform. But she still continued with her masters, though now utterly unable to disclose any thing relative to futurity!</p>
<p><i><b>Drew</b></i><b> them </b><i><b>into the market-place</b></i> — This was the place of public resort, and, by bringing them here, they might hope to excite a general clamour against them and probably those who are here called τους αρχοντας, <i>the rulers</i>, were <i>civil magistrates</i>, who kept offices in such public places, for the preservation of the peace of the city. But these words, <i>the rulers</i>, are suspected to be an interpolation by some critics: I think on no good ground.</p>
