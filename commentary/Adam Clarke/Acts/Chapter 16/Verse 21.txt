<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:21">Acts 16:21</span>. <i><b>And teach customs</b></i> — εθη, Religious opinions, and religious rites.</p>
<p><i><b>Which are not lawful for us to receive</b></i> — The Romans were very jealous of their national worship. <i>Servius</i>, on the following lines of Virgil, has given us correct information on this point; and has confirmed what several other writers have advanced:- </p>
<p>"He says two things: we do not worship Hercules because we believe every religion to be true; nor are we ignorant of the ancient gods. Great care was taken, both among the Athenians and Romans, that no one should introduce any <i>new religion</i>. It was on this account that Socrates was condemned, and on this account the Chaldeans and the Jews were banished from Rome."</p>
<p>CICERO, De Legibus, lib. ii. c. 8, says: <i>Separatim nemo habessit</i> <i>deos; neve NOVOS; sed nec ADVENAS, nisi publice ADSCITOS, PRIVATIM</i> <i>colunto</i>. "No person shall have any <i>separate</i> gods, nor <i>new ones</i>; nor shall he privately worship any <i>strange gods</i>, unless they be <i>publicly allowed</i>." The whole chapter is curious. It was on such laws as these that the people of Philippi pleaded against the apostles. These men bring <i>new gods</i>, new worship, new rites; we are Romans, and the laws forbid us to worship any new or strange god, unless publicly allowed.</p>
