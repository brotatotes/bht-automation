<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:22">Acts 16:22</span>. <i><b>The multitude rose up together</b></i> — There was a general outcry against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes, and delivered them to the mob, commanding the lictors, or beadles, to beat them with rods, ραβδιζειν. This was the Roman custom of treating criminals, as <i>Grotius</i> has well remarked.</p>
