<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>. <i><b>Laid many stripes upon them</b></i> — The Jews never gave more than thirty-nine stripes to any criminal; but the Romans had no law relative to this: they gave as many as they chose; and the apostles had, undoubtedly, the fullest measure. And perhaps St. Paul refers to this, where he says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>: εν πληγαις υπερβαλλοντως, <i>in stripes beyond measure</i> or <i>moderation</i>.</p>
