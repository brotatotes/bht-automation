Verse Acts 16:23. Laid many stripes upon them — The Jews never gave more than thirty-nine stripes to any criminal; but the Romans had no law relative to this: they gave as many as they chose; and the apostles had, undoubtedly, the fullest measure. And perhaps St. Paul refers to this, where he says, 2 Corinthians 11:23: εν πληγαις υπερβαλλοντως, in stripes beyond measure or moderation.
