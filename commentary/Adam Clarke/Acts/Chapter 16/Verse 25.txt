<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:25">Acts 16:25</span>. <i><b>At midnight Paul and Silas - sang praises</b></i> â€” Though these holy men felt much, and had reason to fear more, yet they are undismayed, and even happy in their sufferings: they were so fully satisfied that they were right, and had done their duty, that there was no room for regret or self-reproach. At the same times they had such consolations from God as could render any circumstances not only tolerable, but delightful. They <i>prayed</i>, first, for grace to support them, and for pardon and salvation for their persecutors; and then, secondly, <i>sang praises</i> to God, who had called them to such a state of salvation, and had accounted them worthy to suffer shame for the testimony of Jesus. And, although they were in the inner prison, they sang so <i>loud</i> and so <i>heartily</i> that the prisoners heard them.</p>
