<p>Verse 29. <i><b>He called for a light</b></i> — That he might see how things stood, and whether the words of Paul were true; for on this his personal safety depended.</p>
<p><i><b>Came trembling</b></i> — Terrified by the earthquake, and feeling the danger to which his own life was exposed.</p>
<p><i><b>Fell down before Paul and Silas</b></i> — The persons whom a few hours before he, according to his office, treated with so much asperity, if not cruelty, as some have supposed; though, by the way, it does not appear that he exceeded his <i>orders</i> in his treatment of the apostles.</p>
