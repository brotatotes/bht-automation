<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>. <i><b>Took and circumcised him</b></i> â€” For this simple reason, that the Jews would neither have heard him preach, nor would have any connection with him, had he been otherwise. Besides, St. Paul himself could have had no access to the Jews in any place, had they known that he associated with a person who was uncircumcised: they would have considered both to be <i>unclean</i>. The circumcision of Timothy was a merely <i>prudential</i> regulation; one rendered imperiously necessary by the circumstances in which they were then placed; and, as it was done merely in reference to this, Timothy was lain under no necessity to observe the Mosaic ritual, nor could it prejudice his spiritual state, because he did not do it in order to <i>seek justification by the law</i>, for this he had before, through the faith of Christ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:3-5">Galatians 2:3-5</span>, we read that Paul refuses to circumcise <i>Titus</i>, who was a Greek, and his parents <i>Gentiles</i>, notwithstanding the entreaties of some zealous Judaizing Christians, as their object was to bring him under <i>the</i> <i>yoke of the law</i>: here, the case was widely different, and the necessity of the measure indisputable.</p>
