<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Brought them out</b></i> — Of the dungeon in which they were confined.</p>
<p><i><b>What must I do to be saved?</b></i> — Whether this regard personal or eternal safety, it is a question the most interesting to man. But it is not likely that the jailor referred here to his personal safety. He had seen, notwithstanding the prison doors had been miraculously opened, and the bonds of the prisoners all loosed, that not one of them had escaped: hence he could not feel himself in danger of losing his life on <i>this</i> account; and consequently it cannot be his <i>personal safety</i> about which he inquires. He could not but have known that these apostles had been preaching among the people what they called the <i>doctrine of salvation</i>; and he knew that for expelling a demon they were delivered into his custody: the Spirit of God had now convinced his heart that <i>he</i> was <i>lost</i>, and needed <i>salvation</i>; and therefore his earnest inquiry is <i>how</i> he should obtain it. The answer of the apostles to the jailor shows that his inquiry was not about his <i>personal safety</i>; as his <i>believing</i> on Jesus Christ could have had no effect upon that, in his present circumstances. Men who dispute against this sense of the word are not aware that the Spirit of God can teach any thing to a <i>heart</i>, which the head of a person has not previously learned. Therefore, they say it was impossible that a heathen could make such an inquiry in reference to his <i>eternal state</i>, because he could know nothing about it. On this ground, how impertinent would the answer of the apostles have been: <i>Believe on the Lord Jesus</i> <i>Christ, and thou shalt be put in a state of PERSONAL SAFETY, and</i> <i>thy family</i>! I contend that neither <i>he</i> nor <i>his family</i> were in any danger, as long as not one prisoner had escaped; he had, therefore, nothing from this quarter to fear; and, on the ground against which I contend, his own question would have been as impertinent as the apostles' answer.</p>
