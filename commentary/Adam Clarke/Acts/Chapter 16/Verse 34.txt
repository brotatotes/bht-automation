<p>Verse 34. <i><b>He set meat before them</b></i> â€” They were sufficiently exhausted, and needed refreshment; nor had the apostles any such inherent miraculous power as could prevent them from suffering through hunger, or enable them to heal their own grounds. As they were the instruments of bringing <i>health</i> to his <i>soul</i>, he became the instrument of <i>health</i> to their <i>bodies</i>. Genuine <i>faith</i> in Christ will always be accompanied with <i>benevolence</i> and <i>humanity</i>, and every fruit that such dispositions can produce. The jailor <i>believed-brought</i> them into his <i>house-washed their stripes-and</i> <i>set meat before them</i>.</p>
