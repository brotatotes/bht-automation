<p>Verse 35. <i><b>And the magistrates sent the sergeants</b></i> — The original word, παβδουχους, means the <i>lictors</i>, persons who carried before the consul the <i>fasces</i>, which was a hatchet, round the handle of which was a bundle of <i>rods</i> tied. Why the magistrates should have sent an order to dismiss the apostles, whom they had so barbarously used the preceding evening, we cannot tell, unless we receive the reading of the <i>Codex Bezae</i> as genuine, viz. Ἡμερας δε γενομενης, συνηλθον οἱ Ϛρατηγοι επι το αυτο εις την αγοραν, και αναμνησθεντες τον σεισμον τον γεγοντα, εφοβηθησαν, και απεϚειλαν τους ῥαβδουχους κ. τ. λ. <i>And when it was day, the magistrates came</i> <i>together into the court, AND REMEMBERING THE EARTHQUAKE THAT HAD</i> <i>HAPPENED, they were afraid, and they sent the sergeants</i>, c. The <i>Itala</i> version of this same MS. has the same reading: so has also the margin of the later <i>Syriac</i>. If this MS. be correct, the <i>cause</i> of the dismissal of the apostles is at once evident: the earthquake had alarmed the magistrates and, taking it for granted that this was a <i>token</i> of the <i>Divine displeasure</i> against them for their unprincipled conduct towards those good men, they wished to get as quietly rid of the business as they could, and therefore sent to dismiss the apostles. Whether this reading be genuine or not, it is likely that it gives the true cause of the magistrates' conduct.</p>
