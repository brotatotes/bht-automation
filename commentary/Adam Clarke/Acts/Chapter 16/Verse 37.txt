<p>Verse 37. <i><b>They have beaten us openly - being Romans</b></i> — St. Paul well knew the Roman laws; and on their violation by the magistrates he <i>pleads</i>. The <i>Valerian</i> law forbade any Roman citizen to be <i>bound</i>. The <i>Porcian</i> law forbade any to be <i>beaten with rods</i>. "Poreia lex <i>virgas</i> ab omnium civium Romanorum corpore amovit." And by the same law the liberty of a Roman citizen was never put in the power of the <i>lictor</i>. "Porcia lex <i>libertatem</i> civium lictori eripuit." See CICERO, <i>Orat</i>. pro <i>Rabirio</i>. Hence, as the same author observes, <i>In</i> <i>Verrem</i>, Orat. 5: "Facinus est <i>vinciri</i> civem Romanum, scelus <i>verberari</i>." It is a transgression of the law to bind a Roman citizen: it is wickedness to scourge him. And the illegality of the proceedings of these magistrates was farther evident in their condemning and punishing them <i>unheard</i>. This was a gross violation of a common maxim in the Roman law. <i>Causa cognita, possunt multi</i> <i>absolvi; incognita, nemo condemnari potest</i>. Cicero. "Many who are accused of evil may be absolved, when the cause is <i>heard</i>; but <i>unheard</i>, no man can be condemned." Every principle of the law of nature and the law of nations was violated in the treatment these holy men met with from the unprincipled magistrates of this city.</p>
<p><i><b>Let them come themselves and fetch us out.</b></i> — The apostles were determined that the magistrates should be humbled for their illegal proceedings; and that the people at large might see that they had been unjustly condemned, and that the majesty of the Roman people was insulted by the treatment they had received.</p>
