<p>Verse 38. <i><b>They feared when they heard - they were Romans.</b></i> â€” They feared, because the Roman law was so constituted that an insult offered to a citizen was deemed an insult to the whole Roman people. There is a remarkable addition here, both in the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> of the <i>Codex Bezae</i>. It is as follows: "And when they were come with many of their friends to the prison, they besought them to go out, saying: We were ignorant of your circumstances, that ye were righteous men. And, leading them out, they besought them, saying, Depart from this city, lest they again make an insurrection against you, and clamour against you."</p>
