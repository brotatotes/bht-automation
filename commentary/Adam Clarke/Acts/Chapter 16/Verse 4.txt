<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:4">Acts 16:4</span>. <i><b>They delivered them the decrees for to keep</b></i> — Τα δογματα, τα κεκριμενα ὑπο των ΑποϚολων. Bishop Pearce contends that τα δογματα, <i>the decrees</i>, is a gloss which was not in the text originally; and that the τα κεκριμενα, the <i>judgments</i> or <i>determinations</i> of the apostles, was all that was originally written here. He supports his opinion by a reference to the word κρινω, <i>I judge</i>, used by James, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:19">Acts 15:19</span>, whence the whole decision, as it referred -</p>
<p>1. to the inexpediency of circumcising the Gentiles; and,</p>
<p>2. to the necessity of observing the four precepts laid down, was called τα κεκριμενα, the <i>things that were</i> <i>judged</i>, or <i>decided</i> on; <i>the judgments</i> of the apostolic council.</p>
<p>Instead of γεγραμμενα, the Syrian has a word that answers to γεγραμμενα, the <i>decrees that were written</i>. The word δογμα, from δοκεω, to <i>think proper, determine, decree</i>, signifies an ordinance or decree, properly and deliberately made, relative to any important point, and which, in reference to that point, has the force of law. Our term <i>dogma</i>, which we often abuse, is the Greek word in English letters.</p>
