<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:40">Acts 16:40</span>. <i><b>Entered into</b></i><b> the house of </b><i><b>Lydia</b></i> — This was the place of their residence while at Philippi: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:15">Acts 16:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>They comforted them, and departed.</b></i> — The magistrates were sufficiently humbled, and the public at large, hearing of this circumstance, must be satisfied of the innocency of the apostles. They, therefore, after staying a reasonable time at the house of Lydia, and exhorting the brethren, departed; having as yet to go farther into Macedonia, and to preach the Gospel in the most polished city in the world, the city of Athens. See the succeeding chapter.</p>
<p>GREAT and lasting good was done by this visit to Philippi: a Church was there founded, and the members of it did credit to their profession. To them the apostle, who had suffered so much for their sakes, was exceedingly dear; and they evidenced this by their contributions to his support in the times of his necessity. They sent him money <i>twice</i> to Thessalonica, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span>, and once to Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9">2 Corinthians 11:9</span>, and long afterwards, when he was prisoner in Rome, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:9">Philippians 4:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:14">Philippians 4:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span>. About five or six years after this, St. Paul visited Philippi on his way to Jerusalem, and he wrote his epistle to them about ten years after his first journey thither. The first members of the Church of Christ in this place were Lydia and her family; and the next in all probability were the jailor and <i>his</i> family. These doubtless became the instruments of bringing many more to the faith; for the false imprisonment and public acquittal of the apostles by the magistrates must have made their cause popular; and thus the means which were used to prevent the sowing of the seed of life in this city became the means by which it was sown and established. Thus the wrath of man praised God; and the remainder of it he did restrain. Never were these words more exactly fulfilled than on this occasion.</p>
