<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>. <i><b>Were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Asia.</b></i> â€” The Asia mentioned here could not be <i>Asia Minor</i> in general, for Galatia, Phrygia, Pisidia, Lycaonia, and Pamphylia, were provinces of it, and in these the apostles preached; but it was what was called <i>Proconsular Asia</i>, which included only <i>Ionia,</i> <i>AEolia</i>, and <i>Lydia</i>. The apostles were not suffered to visit these places at this time; but they afterwards went thither, and preached the Gospel with success; for it was in this <i>Proconsular</i> <i>Asia</i> that the seven Churches were situated. God chose to send his servants to another place, where he saw that the word would be affectionately received; and probably those in Proconsular Asia were not, as yet, sufficiently prepared to receive and profit by it.</p>
