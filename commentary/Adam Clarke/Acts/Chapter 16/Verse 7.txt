Verse Acts 16:7. After they were come to Mysia — They passed through Phrygia into Mysia, which lay between Bithynia on the north, Phrygia on the east, AEolia on the south, and the Mediterranean on the west.But the Spirit suffered them not — God saw that that was not the most proper time to preach the word at Bithynia; as he willed them to go immediately to Macedonia, the people there being ripe for the word of life. Instead of τοπνευμα, the Spirit merely, το πνευμα ιησου, the Spirit of JESUS, is the reading of ABCDE, several others, with both the Syriac, the Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala, and several of the fathers. The reading is undoubtedly genuine, and should be immediately restored to the text.
