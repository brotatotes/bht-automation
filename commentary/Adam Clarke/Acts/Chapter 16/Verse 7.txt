<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:7">Acts 16:7</span>. <i><b>After they were come to Mysia</b></i> — They passed through Phrygia into Mysia, which lay between Bithynia on the north, Phrygia on the east, AEolia on the south, and the Mediterranean on the west.</p>
<p><i><b>But the Spirit suffered them not</b></i> — God saw that that was not the most proper time to preach the word at Bithynia; as he willed them to go immediately to Macedonia, the people there being ripe for the word of life. Instead of τοπνευμα, <i>the Spirit</i> merely, το πνευμα ιησου, <i>the Spirit of JESUS</i>, is the reading of ABCDE, several others, with both the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Vulgate, Itala</i>, and several of the <i>fathers</i>. The reading is undoubtedly <i>genuine</i>, and should be immediately restored to the text.</p>
