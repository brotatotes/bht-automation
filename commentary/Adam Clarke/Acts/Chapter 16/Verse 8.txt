<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:8">Acts 16:8</span>. <i><b>Came down to Troas.</b></i> â€” The <i>Troad</i>, or part of Phrygia Minor in which the celebrated city of <i>Troy</i> was formerly situated. This city was first built by <i>Dardanus</i>, who was its king, and from whom it was called <i>Dardania</i>; from <i>Tros</i>, his grandson, it was called <i>Troja</i>, or <i>Troy</i>; and from <i>his</i> son, <i>Ilus</i>, it was called <i>Ilium</i>. It has been long so completely destroyed that no ascertainable vestige of it remains; insomuch that some have even doubted of its existence. Those who contend for the reality of the history of Troy suppose it to have stood on the site of the modern village <i>Bounarbachi</i>, about twelve miles from the sea, on an eminence, at the termination of a spacious plain.</p>
