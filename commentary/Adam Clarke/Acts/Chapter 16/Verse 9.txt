<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:9">Acts 16:9</span>. <i><b>A vision appeared to Paul in the night</b></i> â€” Whether this was in a <i>dream</i>, or whether a <i>representation</i> made to the <i>senses</i> of the apostle, we cannot tell. A man of Macedonia appeared to him, and made this simple communication, <i>Come over into Macedonia,</i> <i>and help us</i>.</p>
<p>Some suppose that the <i>guardian angel</i> of Macedonia appeared to St. Paul in a human shape; others, that it was a Divine communication made to his imagination in a dream.</p>
