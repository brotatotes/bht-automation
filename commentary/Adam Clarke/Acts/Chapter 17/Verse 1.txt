<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:1">Acts 17:1</span>. <i><b>Passed through Amphipolis</b></i> — This city was the metropolis of the first division of Macedonia, as made by Paulus AEmilius: see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>. It was builded by Cimon, the Athenian general, who sent 10,000 Athenians thither as a colony. It stood in an island in the river Strymon, and had its name of <i>Amphipolis</i> because included <i>between</i> the two grand branches of that river where they empty themselves into the sea, the river being on <i>both</i> <i>sides of the city</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Apollonia</b></i> — This was another city of Macedonia, between Amphipolis and Thessalonica. It does not appear that St. Paul stopped at any of these cities: and they are only mentioned by the historian as places through which the apostles passed on their way to Thessalonica. It is very likely that in these cities there were no Jews; and that might have been the reason why the apostles did not preach the Gospel there, for we find them almost constantly beginning with the Jews; and the Hellenist Jews, living among the Gentiles, became the <i>medium</i> through which the Gospel of Christ was conveyed to the heathen world.</p>
<p><i><b>Thessalonica</b></i> — This was a celebrated city of Macedonia, situated on what was called the <i>Thermaic</i> Gulf. According to <i>Stephanus</i> <i>Byzantinus</i>, it was embellished and enlarged by Philip, king of Macedon, who called it <i>Thessalonica, the victory of Thessalia</i>, on account of the <i>victory</i> he obtained there over the <i>Thessalians</i>; but, prior to this, it was called <i>Thermae</i>. But Strabo, Tzetzes, and Zonaras, say that it was called <i>Thessalonica</i>, from Thessalonica, wife of Cassander, and daughter of Philip. It is now in possession of the Turks, and is called <i>Salonichi</i>, which is a mere corruption of the original name.</p>
<p><i><b>A synagogue of the Jews.</b></i> — Ἡ συναγωγη, <i>THE synagogue</i>; for the <i>article</i> here must be considered as emphatic, there probably being no other synagogue in any other city in Macedonia. The Jews in different parts had other places of worship called <i>proseuchas</i>. as we have seen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>. At Thessalonica alone they appear to have had a <i>synagogue</i>.</p>
