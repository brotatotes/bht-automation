<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:12">Acts 17:12</span>. <i><b>Therefore many of them believed</b></i> — From the manner in which they heard, received, and examined the word preached to them, it was not likely they could be deceived. And, as it was the <i>truth</i> that was proclaimed to them, it is no wonder that they apprehended, believed, and embraced it.</p>
<p><i><b>Of honourable women which were Greeks</b></i> — Probably mere <i>heathens</i> are meant; and these were some of the chief families in the place. Thus we find that the preaching of Paul at Berea was made the instrument of converting both <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
