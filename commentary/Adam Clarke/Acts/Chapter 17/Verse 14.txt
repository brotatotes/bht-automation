<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>. <i><b>To go as it were to the sea</b></i> — This passage is generally understood to mean that the disciples took Paul towards the sea, <i>as if he had intended to embark, and return to Troas</i>, but with the <i>real design</i> to go to <i>Athens</i>. But it is more likely that his conductors, in order to his greater safety, left the public or more frequented road, and took him <i>coastwise</i> to Athens. Or, by taking a vessel at that part of the sea nearest to <i>Berea</i>, they might have coasted it to Athens, which was quite a possible case; and, as we do not hear of his stopping at any place on his journey to preach, it is very probable that he went by sea to this city. Though sleights and feints may be allowable in cases of life and death, yet there does not appear an absolute necessity for any in this case. And, as the text does not necessarily point any out, so we need not have recourse to any. I take it for granted, therefore, that Paul went by sea to Athens.</p>
<p><i><b>Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</b></i> — The persecution, it seems, was directed principally against Paul. <i>Lo! he stayeth his</i> <i>rough wind on the day of his east wind</i>. Silas and Timotheus, holy men, were left behind to water the seed which Paul had planted.</p>
