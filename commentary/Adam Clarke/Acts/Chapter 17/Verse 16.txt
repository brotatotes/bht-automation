<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:16">Acts 17:16</span>. <i><b>He saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</b></i> — κατειδωλον, <i>Full of idols</i>, as the <i>margin</i> has it, and very properly. Whoever examines the remains of this city, as represented by Mr. Stuart in his <i>Antiquities</i>, already referred to, will be satisfied of the truth of St. Luke's remark: <i>it was full of idols</i>. Bishop Pearce produces a most apposite quotation from <i>Pausanias</i>, which confirms the observation: Ουκ ην αλλαχου τοσαυτα ιδειν ειδωλα. <i>There was no</i> <i>place where so many idols were to be seen</i>. PAUS. <i>in Attic</i>. cap. xvii. 24.</p>
<p>PETRONIUS, who was contemporary with St. Paul, in his <i>Satyr</i>. cap. xvii., makes Quartilla say of Athens: <i>Utique nostra regio tam</i> <i>PRAESENTIBUS PLENA EST NUMINIBUS, ut facilius possis DEUM quam</i> <i>HOMINEM invenire</i>. Our region is so <i>full of deities</i> that you may more frequently meet with a <i>god</i> than a <i>man</i>.</p>
