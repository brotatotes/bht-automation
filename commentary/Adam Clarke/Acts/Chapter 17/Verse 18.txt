<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>. <i><b>Certain philosophers of the Epicureans</b></i> — These were the followers of <i>Epicurus</i>, who acknowledged no gods except in <i>name</i>, and absolutely denied that they exercised any government over the world or its inhabitants; and that the chief good consisted in the gratification of the appetites of sense. These points the Epicureans certainly held; but it is not clear that <i>Epicurus</i> himself maintained such doctrines.</p>
<p><i><b>And of the Stoics</b></i> — These did not deny the existence of the gods; but they held that all human affairs were governed by <i>fate</i>. They did not believe that any good was received from the hands of their gods; and considered, as <i>Seneca</i> asserts, that any good and wise man was equal to Jupiter himself. Both these sects agreed in denying the <i>resurrection</i> of the body; and the former did not believe in the immortality of the soul.</p>
<p>EPICURUS, the founder of the <i>Epicurean</i> sect, was born at <i>Athens</i>, about A.M. 3663, before Christ 341.</p>
<p>ZENO, the founder of the <i>Stoic</i> sect, was born in the isle of <i>Cyprus</i>, about thirty years before Christ. His disciples were called <i>Stoics</i> from the στοα, a famous <i>portico</i> at Athens, where they studied. Besides these two sects, there were two others which were famous at this time; viz. the <i>Academics</i> and the <i>Peripatetics</i>. The founder of the first was the celebrated PLATO; and the founder of the second, the no less famous ARISTOTLE. These sects professed a much purer doctrine than the <i>Epicureans</i> and <i>Stoics</i>; and it does not appear that they opposed the apostles, nor did they enter into public disputations with them. Against the doctrines taught by the Epicureans and Stoics, several parts of St. Paul's discourse, in the following verses, are directly pointed.</p>
<p><i><b>What will this babbler say?</b></i> — The word σπερμολογος, which we translate <i>babbler</i>, signifies, literally, <i>a collector of seeds</i>, and is the "name of a <i>small bird</i> the lives by picking up seeds on the road." The epithet became applied to persons who collected the sayings of others, without <i>order</i> or <i>method</i>, and detailed them among their companions in the same way. The application of the term to <i>prating, empty, impertinent</i> persons, was natural and easy, and hence it was considered a term of <i>reproach</i> and <i>contempt</i>, and was sometimes used to signify the vilest sort of men.</p>
<p><i><b>A setter forth of strange gods</b></i> — ξενωνδαιμονιων, <i>Of strange</i> or <i>foreign demons</i>. That this was strictly forbidden, both at <i>Rome</i> and <i>Athens</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:21">Acts 16:21</span>.</p>
<p>There was a difference, in the heathen theology, between θεος, <i>god</i>, and δαιμων, <i>demon</i>: the θεοι, were such as were <i>gods</i> by <i>nature</i>: the δαιμονια, were <i>men</i> who were <i>deified</i>. This distinction seems to be in the mind of these philosophers when they said that the apostles seemed to be setters forth of <i>strange</i> <i>demons</i>, because they preached unto them <i>Jesus</i>, whom they showed to be a <i>man</i>, suffering and dying, but afterwards raised to the throne of God. This would appear to them tantamount with the deification of <i>heroes</i>, &amp;c., who had been thus honoured for their especial services to mankind. Horace expresses this in two lines, 2 Epist. i. 5:- </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Romulus, father Bacchus, with Castor and Pollux, for their eminent services, have been received into the temples of the gods."</p>
