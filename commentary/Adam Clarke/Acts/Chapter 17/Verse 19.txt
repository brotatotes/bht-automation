<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:19">Acts 17:19</span>. <i><b>They took him, and brought him unto Areopagus</b></i> — The Areopagus was a <i>hill</i> not far from the <i>Acropolis</i>, already described, where the supreme court of justice was held; one of the most sacred and reputable courts that had ever existed in the Gentile world. It had its name, αρειος παγος, <i>Areopagus</i>, or the <i>Hill of Mars</i>, or <i>Ares</i>, from the circumstance, according to poetic fiction, of Mars being tried there, by a court of <i>twelve</i> <i>gods</i>, for the murder of <i>Halirrhothius</i>, son of <i>Neptune</i>: the meaning of which is, that <i>Ares</i>, a Thessalian prince, having slain <i>Halirrhothius</i>, the son of a neighbouring prince, for having violated his daughter <i>Alcippe</i>, was here tried by twelve judges, by whom he was honourably acquitted: in the Athenian laws the death of the <i>ravisher</i> was the regular forfeiture for his crime. The justice administered in this court was so strict and impartial, that, it was generally allowed, both the plaintiff and defendant departed satisfied with the decision. "Innocence, when summoned before it, appeared without apprehension; and the guilty, convicted and condemned, retired with out daring to murmur." The place in which the judges sat was <i>uncovered</i>; and they held their sittings by night, to the end that nothing might distract their minds from the great business on which they were to decide; and that the <i>sight</i> of the accused might not affect them either with pity or aversion. In reference to this, all pleaders were strictly forbidden to <i>use any means whatever to excite either pity or</i> <i>aversion, or to affect the passions</i>; every thing being confined to <i>simple relation</i>, or <i>statement of facts</i>. When the two parties were produced before the court, they were placed between the bleeding members of victims slain on the occasion, and were obliged to take an oath, accompanied by horrible imprecations on themselves and families, that they would testify nothing but truth. These parties called to witness the <i>eumenides</i>, or furies, the punishers of the perjured in the infernal world; and, to make the greater impression on the mind of the party swearing, the temple dedicated to these infernal deities was contiguous to the court, so that <i>they</i> appeared as if witnessing the oaths and recording the appeal made to themselves. When the case was fully heard, the judges gave their decision by throwing down their flint pebbles, on two boards or tables, one of which was for the <i>condemnation</i>, the other for the <i>acquittal</i>, of the person in question.</p>
