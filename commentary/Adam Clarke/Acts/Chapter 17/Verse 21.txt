<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:21">Acts 17:21</span>. <i><b>All the Athenians and strangers which were there</b></i> — As Athens was renovated for its wisdom and learning, it became a place of public resort for philosophers and students from different parts of the then civilized world. The flux of students was in consequence great; and these, having much leisure time, would necessarily be curious to know what was passing in the world, and would frequently assemble together, in places of public resort, to meet with strangers just come to the city; and either, as St. Luke says, to tell or hear some new thing.</p>
<p>"The Athenian writers give the same account of their fellow citizens. DEMOSTHENES, in his reply to <i>Epist. Philippi</i>, represents the Athenians as πυνθανομενοι κατα την αγοραν, ει τι λεγεται νεωτερον; <i>inquiring, in the place of public resort, if there are</i> <i>any NEWS</i>. We find, likewise, that when Thucydides, iii. 38, had said, μετα καινοτητος μεν λογου απατασθαι αριϚοι, <i>Ye are</i> <i>excellent in suffering yourselves to be deceived by NOVELTY of</i> <i>speech</i>, the old scholiast makes this remark upon it, (almost in the words of St. Luke,) ταυτα προς τους. Αθηναιους αινιττεται, ουδεν τι μελετωντας, πλην λεγειν τι και ακουειν καινον; <i>He here</i> <i>blames the Athenians, who made it their only business to tell and</i> <i>hear something that was NEW</i>."-Bp. Pearce. This is a striking feature of the city of London in the present day. The itch for news, which generally argues a worldly, shallow, or unsettled mind, is wonderfully prevalent: even ministers of the Gospel, negligent of their sacred function, are become in this sense Athenians; so that the book of God is neither read nor studied with half the avidity and spirit as a <i>newspaper</i>. These persons, forgetful not only of their calling, but of the very spirit of the Gospel, read the account of a battle with the most violent emotions; and, provided the victory falls to their favourite side, they exult and triumph in proportion to the number of thousands that have been slain! It is no wonder if such become political preachers, and their sermons be no better than husks for swine. To such <i>the hungry sheep look up, and are not fed</i>. God pity such miserable Athenians, and direct them to a more <i>suitable</i> employment!</p>
