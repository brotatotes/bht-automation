<p><i><b>TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.</b></i> — ΑΓΝΩΣΤΩ ΘΕΩ. That there was an altar at Athens thus inscribed, we cannot doubt after such a testimony though St. Jerome questions it in part for he says St. Paul found the inscription in the <i>plural</i> number, but, because he would not appear to acknowledge a <i>plurality of gods</i>, he quoted it in the <i>singular: Verum, quia Paulus non</i> pluribus Diis <i>indigebat</i> ignotis, <i>sed</i> uno <i>tantum</i> ignoto Deo, <i>singulari verbo</i> usus est. Epist. ad <i>Magn</i>. This is a most foolish saying: had Paul done so, how much would such a begging of the question have prejudiced his defence in the minds of his intelligent judges! OEcumenius intimates that St. Paul does not give the <i>whole</i> of the inscription which this famous altar bore; and which he says was the following: Θεοις Ασιας και Ευρωπης και Λιβυης, Θεῳ αγνωϚῳ και ξενῳ, <i>To the</i> <i>gods of Asia, and Europe, and Africa: TO THE UNKNOWN and strange</i> <i>GOD</i>. Several eminent men suppose that this <i>unknown god</i> was the God of the Jews; and, as his name יהוה was considered by the Jews as <i>ineffable</i>, the Θεος αγνωϚος may be considered as the <i>anonymous</i> <i>god</i>; the god whose <i>name</i> was <i>not known</i>, and must not be pronounced. That there was such a god acknowledged at Athens we have full proof. <i>Lucian</i> in his <i>Philopatris</i>, cap. xiii. p. 769, uses this form of an oath: νη τον αγνωϚον τον εν Αθηναις, <i>I swear</i> <i>by the UNKNOWN GOD at ATHENS</i>. And again, cap. xxix. 180: ἡμεις δε τον εν Αθηναις αγνωϚον εφευροντες και προσκυνησαντες, χειρας εις ουρανον εκτειναντες, τουτῳ ευχαριϚησομεν ὡς καταξιωθεντες, c. <i>We have found out the UNKNOWN god at ATHENS-and worshipped him</i> <i>with our hands stretched up to heaven and we will gave thanks</i> <i>unto him, as being thought worthy to be subject to this power</i>. Bp. Pearce properly asks, Is it likely that Lucian, speaking thus, (whether in jest or in earnest,) should not have had some notion of there being at Athens an altar inscribed to <i>the unknown God</i>? <i>Philostratus</i>, in vit. <i>Apollon</i>. vi. 3, notices the same thing, though he appears to refer to several altars thus inscribed: και ταυτα Αθηνῃσι, οὑ και αγνωϚων Θεων βωμοι ἱδρυνται, <i>And this at</i> <i>ATHENS, where there are ALTARS even to the UNKNOWN GODS</i>. <i>Pausanias</i>, in Attic. cap. 1. p. 4, edit. Kuhn., says that <i>at</i> <i>Athens there are</i> βωμοι Θεων των ονομαζομενων αγνωϚων, <i>altars of</i> <i>gods which are called, The UNKNOWN ones</i>. <i>Minutius Felix</i> says of the Romans, <i>Aras extruunt etiam ignotis numinibus</i>. "They even build altars to UNKNOWN DIVINITIES." And <i>Tertullian</i>, contra Marcion, says, <i>Invenio plane</i> Diis ignotis <i>aras prostitutas: sed</i> <i>Attica idolatria est</i>. "I find altars allotted to the worship of <i>unknown gods</i>: but this is an Attic idolatry." Now, though in these last passages, both <i>gods</i> and <i>altars</i> are spoken of in the <i>plural</i> number; yet it is reasonable to suppose that, on each, or upon some one of them, the inscription αγνωϚῳ Θεῳ, <i>To the unknown</i> <i>god</i>, was actually found. The thing had subsisted long and had got from Athens to Rome in the days of <i>Tertullian</i> and <i>Minutius Felix</i>. See Bp. Pearce and Dr. Cudworth, to whose researches this note is much indebted.</p>
<p><i><b>Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship</b></i> — There is here a fine <i>paronomasia</i>, or play on the words. The apostle tells them that (on their system) they were a very religious people-that they had an altar inscribed, αγνωϚῳ Θεῳ, to the <i>unknown</i> God: <i>him</i> <i>therefore</i>, says he, <i>whom</i>, αγνουντες, <i>ye unknowingly</i> worship, I proclaim to you. Assuming it as a truth, that, as the true God was <i>not known</i> by them, and that there was an altar dedicated to the <i>unknown</i> god, his God was that god whose nature and operations he now proceeded to declare. By this fine turn he eluded the force of that law which made it a capital offense to introduce any new god into the state, and of the breach of which he was charged, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>; and thus he showed that he was bringing neither <i>new god</i> nor <i>new worship</i> among them; but only explaining the worship of one already acknowledged by the state, though not as yet <i>known</i>.</p>
