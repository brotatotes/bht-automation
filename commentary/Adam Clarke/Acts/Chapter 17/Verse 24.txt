<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:24">Acts 17:24</span>. <i><b>God that made the world</b></i>, c.] Though the <i>Epicureans</i> held that the world was not made by God, but was the effect of a fortuitous concourse of atoms, yet this opinion was not popular and the <i>Stoics</i> held the contrary:</p>
<p>1. St. Paul assumes, as an acknowledged truth, that there was a God who made the world and all things.</p>
<p>2. That this God could not be <i>confined</i> within temples made with hands, as he was the <i>Lord</i> or governor of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>3. That, by fair consequence, the gods whom they worshipped, which were <i>shut up in their temples</i> could not be <i>this</i> <i>God</i>; and they must be <i>less</i> than the places in which they were contained. This was a strong, decisive stroke against the whole system of the Grecian idolatry.</p>
