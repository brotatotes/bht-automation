Verse Acts 17:24. God that made the world, c.] Though the Epicureans held that the world was not made by God, but was the effect of a fortuitous concourse of atoms, yet this opinion was not popular and the Stoics held the contrary:1. St. Paul assumes, as an acknowledged truth, that there was a God who made the world and all things.2. That this God could not be confined within temples made with hands, as he was the Lord or governor of heaven and earth.3. That, by fair consequence, the gods whom they worshipped, which were shut up in their temples could not be this God; and they must be less than the places in which they were contained. This was a strong, decisive stroke against the whole system of the Grecian idolatry.
