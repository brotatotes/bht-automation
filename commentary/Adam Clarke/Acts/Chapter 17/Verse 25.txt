<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:25">Acts 17:25</span>. <i><b>Neither is worshiped with men's hands</b></i> — This is an indirect stroke against making of images, and offering of sacrifices: he is not worshipped with <i>human hands, as if he needed</i> <i>any thing</i>, or required to be represented under a particular <i>form</i> or <i>attitude</i>; nor has he required victims for his support; for it is impossible that he should need any thing who himself gives <i>being, form</i>, and <i>life</i>, to all creatures.</p>
<p><i><b>Giveth-life, and breath, and all things</b></i> — These words are elegantly introduced by St. Paul: God gives <i>life</i>, because he is the <i>fountain</i> of it: he gives <i>breath</i>, the faculty of breathing or respiration, by which this life is preserved; and though breathing or respiration, be the act of the animal, yet the πνοην, the <i>faculty</i> of breathing, and extracting from the atmosphere what serves as a pabulum of life, is given by the influence of God, and the continued power thus to respire, and extract that pure <i>oxygen</i> <i>gas</i> which is so evident a support of animal life, is as much the <i>continued</i> gift of God as life itself is. But, as much more is necessary to keep the animal machine in a state of repair, God gives the ταπαντα, all the other things which are requisite for this great and important purpose, that the end for which life was given may be fully answered. St. Paul also teaches that Divine worship is not enacted and established <i>for</i> GOD, but <i>for</i> the use of his <i>creatures</i>: he needs nothing that man can give him; for man has nothing but what he has received from the hand of his Maker.</p>
