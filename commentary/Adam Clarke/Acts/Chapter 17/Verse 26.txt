<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:26">Acts 17:26</span>. <i><b>Hath made of one blood</b></i> — In AB, some others, with the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Vulgate, Itala, Clement</i>, and <i>Bede</i>, the word αιματος, <i>blood</i>, is omitted. <i>He hath made of one</i> (meaning Adam) <i>all nations of men</i>; but αιμα, <i>blood</i>, is often used by the best writers for <i>race, stock, kindred</i>: so Homer, Iliad, vi. ver. 211: </p>
<p><i><b>To dwell on all the face of the earth</b></i> — God in his <i>wisdom</i> produced the whole human race from one man; and, having in his <i>providence</i> scattered them over the face of the earth, by showing them that they sprang from one common source, has precluded all those contentious wars and bloodshed which would necessarily have taken place among the nations of the world, as each in its folly might have arrogated to itself a higher and more excellent origin than another.</p>
<p><i><b>And hath determined the times before appointed</b></i> — Instead of προτεταγμενους καιρους, <i>the times before appointed</i>, ABDE, and more than forty others, with both the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic</i>, MS. <i>Slavonian, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, read προστεταγμενους καιρους, <i>the appointed times</i>. The difference between the two words is this: προτασσειν signifies <i>to place</i> <i>before others</i>; but προστασσειν is to <i>command, decree, appoint</i>. The προστεταγμενοι καιροι, are the constituted or decreed times; that is, the times appointed by his providence, on which the several families should go to those countries where his wisdom designed they should dwell. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+10:5-32">Genesis 10:5-32</span>; and see <i>Pearce</i> and <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And the bounds of their habitations</b></i> — Every family being appointed to a particular place, that their posterity might possess it for the purposes for which infinite wisdom and goodness gave them their being, and the place of their abode. Every nation had its lot thus appointed by God, as truly as the Israelites had the land of Canaan. But the removal of the Jews from their own land shows that a people may forfeit their original inheritance, and thus the <i>Canaanites</i> have been supplanted by the Jews; the Jews by the Saracens; the Saracens by the Turks; the Greeks by the Romans; the Romans by the Goths and Vandals; and so of others.
