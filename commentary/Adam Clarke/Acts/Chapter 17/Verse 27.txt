<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:27">Acts 17:27</span>. <i><b>That they should seek the Lord</b></i> — This is a conclusion drawn from the preceding statement. God, who is infinitely great and self-sufficient, has manifested himself as the maker of the world, the creator, preserver, and governor of men. He has assigned them their portion, and dispensed to them their habitations, and the various blessings of his providence, to the end that they should seek him in all his works.</p>
<p><i><b>Feel after him</b></i> — ψηλαφησειαν αυτον, That they might grope after him, as a person does his way who is blind or blindfolded. The Gentiles, who had not a revelation, must grope after God, as the principle of spiritual life, that they might find him to be a Spirit, and the source of all intellectual happiness; and the apostle seems to state that none need despair of finding this fountain of goodness, because <i>he is not far from every one of us</i>.</p>
