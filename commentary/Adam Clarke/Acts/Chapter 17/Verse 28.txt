<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>. <i><b>For in him we live, and move, and have our being</b></i> — He is the very <i>source</i> of our <i>existence</i>: the principle of <i>life</i> comes from him: the principle of <i>motion</i>, also, comes from him; one of the most difficult things in nature to be properly apprehended; and a strong proof of the continual presence and energy of the Deity.</p>
<p><i><b>And have our being</b></i> — καιεσμεν, <i>And we are</i>: we <i>live</i> in <i>him,</i> <i>move</i> in <i>him</i>, and <i>are</i> in him. Without him we not only can do nothing, but without him we are nothing. <i>We are</i>, i.e. we continue <i>to be</i>, because of his continued, present, all-pervading, and supporting energy. There is a remarkable saying in <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, p. 104. "The holy blessed God never does evil to any man. He only withdraws his gracious presence from him, and then he necessarily perisheth." This is philosophical and correct.</p>
<p><i><b>As certain also of your own poets</b></i> — Probably he means not only <i>Aratus</i>, in whose poem, entitled <i>Phaenomena</i>, the words quoted by St. Paul are to be found literatim, του γαρ και γενος εσμεν; but also <i>Cleanthus</i>, in whose <i>Hymn to Jupiter</i> the same words (Εκ σου γαρ γενος εσμεν) occur. But the sentiment is found in several others, being very common among the more enlightened philosophers. By saying <i>your own poets</i>, he does not mean poets born at <i>Athens</i>, but merely <i>Grecian</i> poets, Aratus and Cleanthus being chief.</p>
<p><i><b>We are also his offspring.</b></i> — Του γαρ και γενος εσμεν The <i>Phaenomena</i> of Aratus, in which these words are found, begins thus:- </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> With Jove we must begin; nor from him rove;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Him always praise, for all is full of Jove!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> He fills all places where mankind resort,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The wide-spread sea, with every shelt'ring port.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Jove's presence fills all space, upholds this ball;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> All need his aid; his power sustains us all.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>For we his offspring are</i>; and he in love</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Points out to man his labour from above:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Where signs unerring show when best the soil,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> By well-timed culture, shall repay our toil, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>Aratus was a Cilician, one of St. Paul's own countrymen, and with his writings St. Paul was undoubtedly well acquainted, though he had flourished about 300 years before that time.</p>
