<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span>. <i><b>Opening and alleging</b></i> — παρατιθεμνος, <i>Proving by</i> <i>citations</i>. His method seems to have been this:</p>
<p>1st. He collected the scriptures that spoke of the Messiah.</p>
<p>2d. He applied these to Jesus Christ, showing that in him all these scriptures were fulfilled, and that he was the Saviour of whom they were in expectation. He showed also that the <i>Christ</i>, or Messiah, <i>must</i> <i>needs suffer</i>-that this was predicted, and was an essential mark of the true Messiah.
