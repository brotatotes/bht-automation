<p>Verse 30. <i><b>The times of this ignorance God winked at</b></i> — He who has an indisputable right to demand the worship of all his creatures has mercifully overlooked those acts of idolatry which have disgraced the world and debased man; but <i>now</i>, as he has condescended to give a revelation of himself, he <i>commands</i>, as the sovereign, <i>all men every where</i>, over every part of his dominions, <i>to repent</i>, μετανοειν, to <i>change</i> their <i>views, designs</i>, and <i>practices; because he hath appointed a day in which he will</i> <i>judge the world in righteousness</i>; and, as justice will then be done, no <i>sinner</i>, no persevering <i>idolater</i>, shall escape punishment.</p>
<p>The word υπεριδειν, which we translate, <i>to wink at</i>, signifies simply <i>to look over</i>; and seems to be here used in the sense of <i>passing by</i>, not particularly noticing it. So God overlooked, or passed by, the times of heathenish ignorance: as he had not given them the <i>talent</i> of <i>Divine revelation</i>, so he did not require the improvement of that talent; but now, as he had given them that revelation, he would no longer <i>overlook</i>, or <i>pass by</i>, their ignorance or its fruits.</p>
