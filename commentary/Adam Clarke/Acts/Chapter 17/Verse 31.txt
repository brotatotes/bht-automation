<p>Verse 31. <i><b>He hath appointed a day</b></i> — He has fixed the time in which he will judge the world, though he has not revealed this time to man.</p>
<p><i><b>By</b></i><b> that </b><i><b>man whom he hath ordained</b></i> — He has also appointed the judge, by whom the inhabitants of the earth are to be tried.</p>
<p>Whereof <i><b>he hath given assurance</b></i> — ΠιϚιν παρασχων πασιν, Having given to all this <i>indubitable proof</i>, that Jesus Christ shall judge the world, by raising him from the dead. The sense of the argument is this: "Jesus Christ, whom we preach as the Saviour of men, has repeatedly told his followers that he would judge the world; and has described to us, at large, the whole of the proceedings of that awful time, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>. Though he was put to death by the Jews, and thus he became a victim for sin, yet God raised him from the dead. By raising him from the dead, God has set his seal to the doctrines he has taught: one of these doctrines is, that he <i>shall judge the world</i>; his resurrection, established by the most incontrovertible evidence, is therefore a proof, an incontestable proof, that he shall judge the world, according to his own declaration."</p>
