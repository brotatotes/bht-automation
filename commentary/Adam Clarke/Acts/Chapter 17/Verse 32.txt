<p>Verse 32. <i><b>When they heard of the resurrection</b></i>, c.] Paul undoubtedly had not finished his discourse: it is likely that he was about to have proclaimed salvation through Christ crucified but, on hearing of the <i>resurrection</i> of the body, the assembly instantly broke up; the <i>Epicureans</i> mocking, εχλευαζον, <i>began to</i> <i>laugh</i>; and the <i>Stoics</i> saying they would take another opportunity to hear him on that subject. And thus the assembly became dissolved before the apostle had time to finish his discourse, or to draw all the conclusions he had designed from the premises he had laid down. St. Stephen's discourse was interrupted in a similar manner. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:54">Acts 7:54</span>, and the note there.</p>
