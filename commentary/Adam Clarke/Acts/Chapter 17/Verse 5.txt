<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>. <i><b>The Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto</b></i><b> </b><i><b>them</b></i> — Instead of this sentence, the most correct MSS. and versions read simply, προσλαβομενοι δε οἱ Ιουδαιοι. <i>But the Jews taking</i>, c., leaving out the words, ζηλωσαντες, απειθουντες, <i>which</i> <i>believed not, moved with envy</i>: these words do not appear to be genuine there is the strongest evidence against them, and they should be omitted.</p>
<p><i><b>Certain lewd fellows of the baser sort</b></i> — This is not a very intelligible translation. The original is, των αγοραιων τινας ανδοας πονηρους. The word αγοραιοι, which we translate the <i>baser</i> <i>sort</i>, is by Hesychius explained, οἱ εν αγορᾳ αναϚρεφομενοι, those who transact business in courts of justice. The same word is used by the Jews in Hebrew letters to signify judges; and אגוריאות של גוים <i>agorioth shel goyim</i>, signifies <i>judges of the</i> <i>Gentiles</i>. These were probably a low kind of lawyers, what we would call <i>pettifoggers</i>, or <i>attorneys</i> without principle, who gave advice for a trifle, and fomented disputes and litigations among the people. The <i>Itala</i> version of the <i>Codex Bezae</i> calls them <i>quosdam</i> <i>forenses</i>, certain lawyers. As the Jews, from their small number, could not easily raise up a mob, they cunningly employed those unprincipled men, who probably had a certain degree of juridical credit and authority, to denounce the apostles as <i>seditious men</i>; and this was, very likely, the reason why they employed those in preference to any others. They were such as always attended forensic litigations, waiting for a job, and willing to defend any side of a question for money. They were <i>wicked men of the forensic</i> <i>tribe</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar</b></i> — And, after having made this sedition and disturbance, charged the whole on the peaceable and innocent apostles! This is precisely the same way that persecution against the truth and followers of Christ is still carried on. Some wicked man in the parish gets a wicked attorney and a constable to head a mob, which they themselves have raised; and, having committed a number of outrages, abusing men and women, haul the minister of Christ to some magistrate who knows as little of his office as he cares for the Gospel; they there charge the outrages which <i>themselves</i> have committed on the preacher and his peaceable hearers; and the peacemaker, appointed by a good king, according to the wise and excellent regulations of a sound constitution, forgetting <i>whose minister he is</i>, neither <i>administers justice</i> nor <i>maintains truth</i>; but, espousing the part of the mob, assumes, ex officio, the character of a persecutor. The preacher is imprisoned, his hearers fined for listening to that Gospel which has not only made them wise unto salvation, but also peaceable and orderly citizens, and which would have had the same effect on the unprincipled <i>magistrate</i>, the <i>parish squire</i>, and the <i>mob</i>, had they heard it with the same reverence and respect. Had I not witnessed such scenes, and such prostitution of justice, I could not have described them.</p>
<p><i><b>Assaulted the house of Jason</b></i> — This was the place where the apostles lodged; and therefore his goods were clear spoil, and his person fair game. This is a case which frequently occurs where the Gospel is preached in its spirit and power. And, even in this moat favoured kingdom, the most scandalous excesses of this kind have been committed, and a justice of the peace has been found to sanction the proceedings; and, when an appeal has been made to the laws, a grand jury has been found capable of throwing out the <i>true</i> <i>bill</i>!</p>
