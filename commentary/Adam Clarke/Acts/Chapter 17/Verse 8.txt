But these wicked Jews, by means of the <i>unprincipled, wicked lawyers</i>, those <i>lewd fellows of the</i> <i>baser sort</i>, threw the subject into the form of <i>law</i>, making it a <i>state question</i>, in which form the rulers were obliged to notice it; but they showed their unwillingness to proceed in a matter which they saw proceeded from malice, by letting Jason and his companions go off on <i>bail</i>.</p>
