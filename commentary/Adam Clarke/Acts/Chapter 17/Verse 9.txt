<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:9">Acts 17:9</span>. <i><b>Taken security</b></i> — λαβοντες το ικανον, <i>Having taken what</i> <i>was sufficient</i>, or <i>satisfactory</i>. <i>Sufficient</i> for the present, to prove that the apostles were upright, peaceable, and loyal men; and that Jason and his friends were the like, and would be, at any time, forthcoming to answer for their conduct. Perhaps this is the sense of the phrase in the text.</p>
