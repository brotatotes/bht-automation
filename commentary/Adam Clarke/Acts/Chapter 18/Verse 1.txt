<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1">Acts 18:1</span>. <i><b>Paul departed from Athens</b></i> â€” How long he stayed here, we cannot tell; it is probable it could not be less than three months; but, finding that the Gospel made little progress among the Athenians, he resolved to go to Corinth.</p>
<p>CORINTH was situated on the isthmus that connects Peloponnesus to Attica; and was the capital of all <i>Achaia</i>, or Peloponnesus. It was most advantageously situated for trade; for, by its two ports, the <i>Lecheum</i> and <i>Cenchreae</i>, it commanded the commerce both of the <i>Ionian</i> and <i>AEgean</i> Sea. It was destroyed by the Romans under Mummius, about one hundred and forty-six years before Christ, in their wars with Attica; but was rebuilt by Julius Caesar, and became one of the most considerable cities of Greece. Like other kingdoms and states, it has undergone a variety of revolutions: from the oppressive and destructive government of the Turks it has been lately restored to that of the Greeks; but it is greatly reduced, its whole population amounting only to between thirteen and fourteen thousand souls. It is about 46 miles east of Athens, and 342 S.W. of Constantinople. Its public buildings were very superb; and there the <i>order</i> called the <i>Corinthian Order</i>, in architecture, took its rise.</p>
