<p><i><b>Gallio</b></i> — This deputy, or proconsul, was eldest brother to the celebrated <i>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</i>, the stoic philosopher, preceptor of Nero, and who is so well known among the learned by his works. The name of Gallio, was at first <i>Marcus</i> Annaeus Novatus; but, having been adopted in the family of <i>Gallio</i>, he took the name of <i>Lucius Junius Gallio</i>. He, and Annaeus Mela his brother, father of the poet Lucan, shared in the disgrace of their brother <i>Seneca</i>; and by this tyrant, Nero, whose early years were so promising, the three brothers were put to death; see <i>Tacitus</i>, Annal. lib. xv. 70, and xvi. 17. It was to this <i>Gallio</i> that Seneca dedicates his book <i>De Ira</i>. Seneca describes him as a man of the most amiable mind and manners: "Quem nemo non parum amat, etiam qui amare plus non potent; nemo mortalium uni tam dulcis est, quam hic omnibus: cum interim tanta naturalis boni vis est, uti artem simulationemque non redoleat:" vide Senec. Praefat. ad Natural. Quaest. 4. He was of the sweetest disposition, affable to all, and beloved by every man.</p>
<p><i>Statius</i>, Sylvar. lib. ii. 7. ver. 30, Ode on the <i>Birthday of</i> <i>Lucan</i>, says not a little in his favour, in a very few words:- </p>
<p><i><b>And brought him to the judgment seat</b></i> — They had no power to punish any person in the Roman provinces, and therefore were obliged to bring their complaint before the Roman governor. <i>The</i> <i>powers that be are ordained of God</i>. Had the <i>Jews</i> possessed the <i>power</i> here, Paul had been put to death!</p>
