<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:13">Acts 18:13</span>. <i><b>Persuaded men to worship God contrary to the law.</b></i> â€” This accusation was very insidious. The <i>Jews</i> had permission by the Romans to worship their own God in their own way: this the <i>laws</i> <i>allowed</i>. The <i>Roman</i> worship was also <i>established</i> by the <i>law</i>. The Jews probably intended to accuse Paul of acting contrary to <i>both</i> laws. "He is not a Jew, for he does not admit of circumcision; he is not a Gentile, for he preaches against the worship of the gods. He is setting up a <i>worship of his own</i>, in opposition to <i>all laws</i>, and persuading many people to join with him: he is therefore a most dangerous man, and should be put to death."</p>
