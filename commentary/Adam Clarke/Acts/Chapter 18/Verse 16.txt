<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:16">Acts 18:16</span>. <i><b>And he drave them from the judgment seat.</b></i> — He saw that their accusation was both <i>frivolous</i> and <i>vexatious</i>, and he ordered them to depart, and the assembly to disperse. The word απηλασεν, which we translate <i>he drave</i>, does not signify here any act of violence on the part of Gallio or the Roman officers, but simply an <i>authoritative dismission</i>.</p>
