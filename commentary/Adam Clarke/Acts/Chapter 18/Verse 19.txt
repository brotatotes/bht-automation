It is supposed that Paul left Aquila and Priscilla at this place, and that he went on alone to Jerusalem; for it is certain they were at Ephesus when Apollos arrived there.

<p>EPHESUS was at the time in which St. Paul visited it, one of the most flourishing cities of Asia Minor. It was situated in that part anciently called <i>Ionia</i>, but now <i>Natolia</i>. It abounded with the most eminent orators, philosophers, c., in the world and was adorned with the most splendid buildings. Here was that famous temple of <i>Diana</i>, reputed one of the <i>seven wonders of the world</i>. This city is now under the dominion of the Turks, and is in a state of almost entire ruin. The temple of Minerva, which had long served as a Christian church, is now so completely ruined that its site cannot be easily determined; though some ruins of the walls are still standing, with five or six marble columns, forty feet in length, and seven in diameter, <i>all of one piece</i>. It still has a good harbour, and is about forty miles from Smyrna. In Chandler's Travels in Asia Minor, some curious information is given concerning this once eminent city. His account concludes thus: "The Ephesians are now a few Greek peasants, living in extreme wretchedness, dependence, and insensibility: the representative of an <i>illustrious</i> people, and inhabiting the <i>wrecks</i> of their <i>greatness</i>: some beneath the vaults of the <i>Stadium</i>, once the crowded scene of their diversions; and some live by the abrupt precipice, in the sepulchres which received the ashes of their ancestors. Such are the present citizens of Ephesus; and such is the condition to which that renowned city has been gradually reduced. Its streets are obscured and overgrown; a herd of goats was driven to it for shelter from the sun at noon; and a noisy flight of crows from the quarries seemed to insult its silence. <i>We</i> <i>heard the partridge call in the area of the theatre, and of the</i> <i>Stadium</i>. The glorious pomp of its <i>heathen worship</i> is no longer remembered; and <i>Christianity</i>, which was there nursed by <i>apostles</i>, and fostered by <i>general councils</i>, until it increased to fulness of stature, barely lingers on, in an existence hardly visible." Travels in <i>Asia Minor</i>, p. 130. Reader! This city was once the capital of Asia Minor; and its ruins alone prove that it has existed: and it was one of those <i>seven Churches</i> to which a letter was expressly dictated by Jesus Christ himself! Ephesus is properly no more! and the Church of Ephesus is blotted put of the map of Christianity! Be silent and adore.</p>
