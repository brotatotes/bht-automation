<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>. <i><b>A certain Jew named Aquila</b></i> — Some have supposed that this Aquila was the same with the Onkelos, mentioned by the Jews. See the article in Wolfius, Bibl. Hebr. vol. ii. p. 1147. We have no evidence that this Jew and his wife were at this time converted to the Christian religion. Their conversion was most likely the fruit of St. Paul's lodging with them - <i>Pontus</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome</b></i> — This edict of the Roman emperor is not mentioned by <i>Josephus</i>; but it is probably the same to which <i>Suetonius</i> refers in his life of Claudius; where he says, <i>Judaeos, impulsore Chresto, assidue</i> <i>tumultuantes Roma expulit</i>. "He expelled the Jews from Rome, as they were making continual insurrections, under their leader <i>Chrestus</i>." Who this Chrestus was we cannot tell; probably Suetonius means <i>Christ</i>; but this I confess does not appear to me likely. There might have been a Jew of the name of Chrestus, who had made some disturbances, and, in consequence, Claudius thought proper to banish all Jews from the city. But how could he intend Christ, who was never at Rome? nor did any one ever personate him in that city; and it is evident he could not refer to any spiritual influence exerted by Christ on the minds of the people. Indeed he speaks of Chrestus as being the person who was the cause of the disturbances. It is no fictitious name, no name of an absent person, nor of a <i>sect</i>; but of one who was well known by the disturbances which he occasioned, and for which it is likely he suffered, and those of his nation were expelled. This decree, which was made, not by the <i>senate</i>, but by the emperor himself, continued only in force during his life, if so long; for in a short time after this Rome again abounded with Jews.</p>
