<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:22">Acts 18:22</span>. <i><b>Landed at Caesarea</b></i> — This must have been Caesarea in Palestine.</p>
<p><i><b>Gone up</b></i> — To <i>Jerusalem</i>, though the name is not mentioned: but this is a common form of speech in the evangelists, Jerusalem being always meant when this expression was used; for the word αναβαινω, <i>to go up</i>, is often used absolutely, to signify, <i>to go</i> <i>to Jerusalem</i>: e.g. <i>GO ye UP unto this feast; I GO not UP yet</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:8">John 7:8</span>. <i>But when his brethren were GONE UP, then WENT he also UP unto</i> <i>the feast</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:10">John 7:10</span>. <i>There were certain Greeks-that CAME UP to worship</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:20">John 12:20</span>. St. Paul himself uses a similar form of expression. <i>There are yet</i> <i>but twelve days since I WENT UP to Jerusalem, for to worship</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:11">Acts 24:11</span>. So all parts of England are spoken of as being below London: so we talk of going <i>up</i> to London; and people in London talk of going <i>down</i> to the country.</p>
<p><i><b>Saluted the Church</b></i> — That is, the Church at Jerusalem, called emphatically THE CHURCH, because it was the FIRST Church-the MOTHER, or APOSTOLIC <i>Church</i>; and from it all other Christian Churches proceeded: those in <i>Galatia, Philippi, Thessalonica,</i> <i>Corinth, Ephesus, Rome</i>, &amp;c. Therefore, even this last was only a <i>daughter</i> Church, when in its <i>purest</i> state.</p>
<p><i><b>Went down to Antioch.</b></i> — That is, <i>Antioch</i> in <i>Syria</i>, as the word is generally to be understood when without <i>addition</i>, so <i>Caesarea</i> is always to be understood Caesarea in <i>Palestine</i>, when without the addition of <i>Philippi</i>.</p>
