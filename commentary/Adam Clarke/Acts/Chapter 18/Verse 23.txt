Went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia — Both were provinces of Asia Minor: Acts 2:10.In order — καθεξης, A word peculiar to St. Luke; see his Gospel, Luke 1:3; Luke 8:1; and his history of the Acts, Acts 3:24; Acts 11:4, and the place above; the only places where this word occurs in the New Testament.

If St. Paul went up to Jerusalem at this time, which we are left to infer, for Luke has not expressed it, (Acts 18:22,) it was his fourth journey thither and this is generally supposed to have been the twenty-first year after his conversion. His first journey is mentioned Acts 9:26; his second, Acts 11:30; his third, Acts 15:4; and his fourth, Acts 18:22, the place above.
