<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:24">Acts 18:24</span>. <i><b>A certain Jew named Apollos</b></i> — One MS., with the <i>Coptic</i> and <i>Armenian</i>, calls him <i>Apelles</i>; and the <i>Codex Bezae, Apollonius</i>. It is strange that we should find a Jew, not only with a Roman name, as <i>Aquila</i>, an <i>eagle</i>; but with the name of one of the <i>false</i> gods, as <i>Apollos</i> or <i>Apollo</i> in the text. Query: Whether the parents of this man were not originally <i>Gentiles</i>, but converted to Judaism after their son Apollo (for so we should write the word) had been born and named.</p>
<p><i><b>Born at Alexandria</b></i> — This was a celebrated city of Egypt, built by Alexander the Great, from whom it took its name. It was seated on the Mediterranean Sea, between the Lake Mareotis and the beautiful harbour formed by the Isle of Pharos, about twelve miles west of the Canopic branch of the Nile, in lat. 31°. 10'. N. This city was built under the direction of Dinocrates, the celebrated architect of the temple of Diana at Ephesus. It was in this city that <i>Ptolemy Soter</i> founded the famous academy called the Museum, in which a society of learned men devoted themselves to philosophical studies. Some of the most celebrated schools of antiquity flourished here; and here was the <i>Tower of Pharos</i>, esteemed one of the <i>seven</i> wonders of the world. Alexandria was taken by the French, July 4, 1798, under the command of Bonaparte; and was surrendered to the English under General, now Lord, Hutchinson, in 1801. And, in consequence of the treaty of peace between France and England, it was restored to the Turks. Near this place was the celebrated <i>obelisk</i>, called <i>Cleopatra's Needle</i>; and the no less famous column, called <i>Pompey's Pillar</i>. This city exhibits but very slender remains of its ancient splendour.</p>
<p><i><b>An eloquent man</b></i> — Having strong rhetorical powers; highly cultivated, no doubt, in the Alexandrian schools.</p>
<p><i><b>Mighty in the Scriptures</b></i> — Thoroughly acquainted with the <i>law</i> and <i>prophets</i>; and well skilled in the Jewish method of interpreting them.</p>
