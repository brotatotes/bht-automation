N. This city was built under the direction of Dinocrates, the celebrated architect of the temple of Diana at Ephesus.

Alexandria was taken by the French, July 4, 1798, under the command of Bonaparte; and was surrendered to the English under General, now Lord, Hutchinson, in 1801. And, in consequence of the treaty of peace between France and England, it was restored to the Turks. Near this place was the celebrated obelisk, called Cleopatra's Needle; and the no less famous column, called Pompey's Pillar. This city exhibits but very slender remains of its ancient splendour.An eloquent man — Having strong rhetorical powers; highly cultivated, no doubt, in the Alexandrian schools.Mighty in the Scriptures — Thoroughly acquainted with the law and prophets; and well skilled in the Jewish method of interpreting them.
