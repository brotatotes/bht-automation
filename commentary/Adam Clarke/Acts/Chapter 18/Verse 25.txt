<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</span>. <i><b>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord</b></i> — κατηχημενος; He was <i>catechized, initiated</i>, in <i>the way</i>, the <i>doctrine</i>, of Jesus as the Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Being fervent in the spirit</b></i> — Being full of <i>zeal</i> to propagate the truth of God, he taught <i>diligently</i>, ακριβως <i>accurately</i>, (so the word should be translated,) the things of Christ as far as he could know them through the <i>ministry of John the Baptist</i>; for it appears he knew nothing more of Christ than what John preached. Some suppose we should read ουκ, <i>not</i>, before ακριβως, <i>correctly</i>, or <i>accurately</i>, because it is said that Aquila and Priscilla expounded the way of the Lord, ακριβεστερον, <i>more</i> <i>perfectly</i>, rather <i>more accurately</i>; but of this emendation there is not the slightest necessity; for surely it is possible for a man to teach <i>accurately</i> what he knows; and it is possible that another, who possesses <i>more</i> information on the subject than the former, may teach him <i>more accurately</i>, or give him a larger portion of knowledge. Apollo knew the baptism of John; but he knew nothing farther of Jesus Christ than that baptism taught; but, as far as he knew, he taught <i>accurately</i>. Aquila and Priscilla were acquainted with the whole doctrine of the Gospel: the doctrine of Christ dying for our sins, and rising again for our justification; and in <i>this</i> they instructed Apollo; and this was <i>more accurate</i> information than what he had before received, through the medium of John's ministry.</p>
