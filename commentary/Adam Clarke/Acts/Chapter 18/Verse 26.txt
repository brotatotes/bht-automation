<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:26">Acts 18:26</span>. <i><b>They took him unto</b></i><b> them</b>] This eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, who was even a public teacher, was not ashamed to be indebted to the instructions of a Christian <i>woman</i>, in matters that not only concerned his own salvation, but also the <i>work of the ministry</i>, in which he was engaged. It is disgraceful to a man to be ignorant, when he may acquire wisdom; but it is no disgrace to acquire wisdom from the meanest person or thing. The adage is good: <i>Despise not advice, even of the meanest: the</i> <i>gaggling of geese preserved the Roman state</i>.</p>
