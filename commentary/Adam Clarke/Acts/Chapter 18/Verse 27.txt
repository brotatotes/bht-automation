<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:27">Acts 18:27</span>. <i><b>When he was disposed to pass into Achaia</b></i> — There is a very long and important <i>addition</i> here in the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, of which the following is a translation: <i>But certain Corinthians, who</i> <i>sojourned at Ephesus, and heard him, entreated him to pass over</i> <i>with them to their own country. Then, when he had given his</i> <i>consent, the Ephesians wrote to the disciples at Corinth, that</i> <i>they should receive this man. Who, when he was come</i>, c. The same addition is found in the <i>later Syriac</i>, and in the <i>Itala</i> version in the <i>Codex Bezae</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which had believed through grace.</b></i> — These words may either refer to <i>Apollo</i>, or to the <i>people</i> at Corinth. It was <i>through grace</i> that <i>they</i> had <i>believed</i> and it was <i>through grace</i> that Apollo was enabled to <i>help them much</i>.</p>
<p>The words δια της χαριτος, <i>through grace</i>, are wanting in the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, the later <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Vulgate</i>, one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, and in some of the <i>fathers</i>. But this omission might have been the effect of carelessness in the writers of those copies from which the foregoing were taken: the words convey the same idea that is expressed by St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>: <i>Paul planted, and Apollos watered; but God gave the increase</i>. Though this eminent man became the instrument of mightily helping the believers in Corinth, yet he was also the <i>innocent</i> cause of a sort of <i>schism</i> among them. For some, taken by his commanding eloquence, began to range themselves on his side, and prefer him to all other teachers. This evil St. Paul reprehends and corrects in his first epistle to the Corinthians. St. Jerome says that Apollo became bishop of Corinth.</p>
