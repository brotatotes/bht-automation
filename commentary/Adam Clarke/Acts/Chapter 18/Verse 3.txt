<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span>. <i><b>He abode with them, and wrought</b></i> — Bp. Pearce observes that it was a custom among the Jews, even of such as had a better education than ordinary, which was Paul's case, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span>, to learn a trade, that, wherever they were, they might provide for themselves in case of necessity. And though Paul, in some cases, lived on the bounty of his converts, yet he chose not to do so at Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:34">Acts 20:34</span>; nor at Corinth or other places, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8-9">2 Corinthians 9:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:8">1 Thessalonians 3:8</span>; and this Paul did for a reason which he gives in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9-12">2 Corinthians 11:9-12</span>. While he was at Corinth he was supplied, when his own labour did not procure him enough, "by the brethren which came to him there from Macedonia." It appears that the apostle had his lodging with Aquila and Priscilla; and probably a portion of the profits of the business, after his board was deducted. It was evidently no reproach for a man, at <i>that time</i>, to unite public teaching with an honest useful trade. And why should it be so <i>now</i>? May not a man who has acquired a thorough knowledge of the Gospel way of salvation, explain that way to his less informed neighbours, though he be a tent-maker, (what perhaps we would call a house-carpenter,) or a shoemaker, or any thing else? Even many of those who consider it a cardinal sin for a <i>mechanic</i> to <i>preach</i> the Gospel, are providing for themselves and their families in the same way. How many of the clergy, and other ministers, are farmers, graziers, schoolmasters, and sleeping partners in different <i>trades</i> and <i>commercial</i> concerns! A tent-maker, in his place, is as useful as any of these. Do not ridicule the mechanic because he preaches the Gospel to the salvation of his neighbours, lest some one should say, in a language which you glory to have learned, and which the mechanic has not, <i>Mutato nomine, de TE fabula narrator</i>.</p>
<p>There are different opinions concerning that is meant here by the σκηνοποιος, which we translate <i>tent-maker</i>. Some think it means a maker of those small <i>portable tents</i>, formed of <i>skins</i>, which soldiers and travellers usually carried with them on their journeys; others suppose that these tents mere made of linen cloth. Some think that the trade of St. Paul was making <i>hangings</i> or <i>curtains</i>, such as were used at the theatres; others think the σκηνοποιος was a sort of <i>umbrella-maker</i>; others, a <i>weaver</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c. In short, we know not what the trade was. I have generally preferred the notion of a carpenter, or <i>faber lignarius</i>. Whatever it was, it was an honest, useful calling, and Paul got his bread by it.</p>
