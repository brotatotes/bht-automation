<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span>. <i><b>When Silas and Timotheus were come</b></i> — We have seen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:13">Acts 17:13</span>, that when Paul was obliged to leave Berea, because of the persecution raised up against him in that place, he left Silas and Timotheus behind; to whom he afterwards sent word to rejoin him at Athens with all speed. It appears, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span>, that, on Timothy's coming to Athens, Paul immediately sent him, and probably Silas with him, to comfort and establish the Church at Thessalonica. How long they laboured here is uncertain, but they did not rejoin him till some time after he came to Corinth. It appears that he was greatly rejoiced at the account which Timothy brought of the Church at Thessalonica; and it must have been immediately after this that he wrote his first epistle to that Church, which is probably the <i>first</i>, in order of time, of all his epistles.</p>
<p><i><b>Paul was pressed in spirit</b></i> — συνειχετο τω πνευματι, or he was <i>constrained by the Spirit</i> of God, in an extraordinary manner, to <i>testify to the Jews</i> that <i>Jesus was the Christ</i>. Instead of τω πνευματι, <i>in the spirit</i>, τω λογω, <i>in the word</i> or <i>doctrine,</i> is the reading of ABDE, three others; both the <i>Syriac, Coptic,</i> <i>Vulgate, Basil, Chrysostom</i>, and others. Griesbach has received this reading into the text, and Bp. Pearce thus paraphrases the verse: "And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul set himself, <i>together</i> with them, wholly <i>to the word</i>; i.e. he was fully employed, now that he had their assistance, it preaching the Gospel, called <i>the word</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:4">Acts 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:32">Acts 16:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span>. St. Luke seems to have intended to express here something relating to St. Paul which was the <i>consequence</i> of the coming of Silas and Timotheus; and that was rather labouring with them more abundantly in <i>preaching the word</i> than his being "<i>pressed in spirit</i>." This appears to be the true sense of the word, and that τω λογω is the genuine reading there can be no doubt. συνειχετο, which we translate <i>pressed</i>, and which the Vulgate translates <i>instabat</i>, Bp. Pearce thinks should be translated <i>una cum illis instabat</i>, he earnestly strove together with them, τω λογω, <i>in preaching the</i> <i>word</i>. The true sense is given by Calmet, <i>Paul s'employoit a</i> <i>precher encore avec plus d'ardeur</i>, Paul was employed with more ardour in preaching, and testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. From this time we hear no more of Silas; probably he died in Macedonia.</p>
