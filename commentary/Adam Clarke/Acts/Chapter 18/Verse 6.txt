<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>. <i><b>When they opposed</b></i> — αντιτασσομενων, Systematically opposing, putting themselves in <i>warlike order</i> against him: so the word implies.</p>
<p><i><b>And blasphemed</b></i> — This is precisely the way in which they still act. They have no arguments against Jesus being the Messiah; but, having made a covenant with unbelief, as soon as they are pressed on this point, they rail and blaspheme.-See the <i>Tela ignea</i> <i>Satanae</i>, by <i>Wagenseil</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He shook</b></i> his <i>raiment</i>] This was an action similar to that of <i>shaking the dust of the feet</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:14">Matthew 10:14</span>. See a parallel act, and its signification, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ne+5:13">Nehemiah 5:13</span>: <i>Also I SHOOK MY LAP, and said, So shall God SHAKE every man FROM</i> <i>HIS HOUSE and FROM his LABOUR; even thus shall he be SHAKEN OUT</i> <i>and EMPTIED</i>. St. Paul's act on this occasion seems to have been the same with this of Nehemiah, and with the same signification; and it is likely that he was led by a Divine impulse to do it-thus signifying the shaking and emptying out of this disobedient people, which took place about sixteen years afterwards.</p>
<p><i><b>Your blood</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>upon your own heads</b></i> — That is, ye alone are the cause of the destruction that is coming upon yourselves and upon your country.</p>
<p><i><b>I</b></i><b> am </b><i><b>clean</b></i> — καθαρος εγω, I am <i>pure</i> or <i>innocent</i> of your death and ruin. I have proposed to you the Gospel of Jesus Christ-the only means by which ye can be saved, and ye have utterly rejected it. I shall labour no more with <i>you</i>; and, from henceforth, shall confine my labours to the <i>Gentiles</i>. St. Paul must refer to the Jews and Gentiles of <i>Corinth</i> particularly; for he preached to the Jews occasionally in other places; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:8">Acts 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>; and several were brought to the knowledge of the truth. But it seems as if the Jews from this time <i>systematically</i> opposed the Gospel of Christ; and yet, <i>general tenders</i> of this salvation were made to them wherever the apostles came; and when they rejected them, the word was sent to the Gentiles; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:8">Acts 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>.</p>
<p><i>Pure</i> from blood, or <i>pure</i> from guilt, is commonly expressed by καθαρος; thus <i>Heliodorus</i>, lib. i. p. 49: Εις δευρο διετελεσα καθαραν εμαυτην απο σης ὁμιλιας φυλαττουσα, <i>Until now I have</i> <i>lived, preserving myself</i> pure: and <i>Alciphron</i>, lib. i. epist. 7, ad. fin.: Ουδε μιαναι λυθρῳ τας χειρας, ἁς ἡ θαλαττα εκ παιδος εις δευρο καθαρας αδικηματων εφυλαξε, <i>Nor to stain with pollution the</i> <i>hands which a seafaring life has kept from a child until now</i> pure <i>from iniquity</i>.</p>
