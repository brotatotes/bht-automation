<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:12">Acts 19:12</span>. <i><b>Handkerchiefs or aprons</b></i> — Σουδαρια η σιμικινθια, Probably the <i>sudaria</i> were a sort of handkerchiefs, which, in travelling, were always carried in the hand, for the convenience of wiping the face; and the <i>simikinthia</i> were either the sashes or girdles that went about the loins. These, borrowed from the apostle, and applied to the bodies of the diseased, became the means, in the hand of God, of their restoration to health.</p>
<p><i><b>The diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out</b></i><b> </b><i><b>of them.</b></i> — Here, there is a most evident distinction made between the <i>diseases</i> and the <i>evil spirits</i>: hence they were not <i>one</i> and the <i>same thing</i>.</p>
