<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:17">Acts 19:17</span>. <i><b>The name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</b></i> — They saw that there was a sovereign power in the name of Jesus, which could not be imitated by these lying exorcists: they therefore reverenced this name, and despised those pretenders.</p>
<p><i>Exorcisms</i> or <i>adjurations</i> of evil spirits were very frequent in the primitive Church: the name of JESUS was that alone which was used. The primitive fathers speak strong and decisive words concerning the power of this <i>name</i>; and how demons were tormented and expelled by it, not only from individuals, but from the temples themselves. Exorcists formed a distinct class an the Church; hence we read of <i>presbyters, deacons, exorcists, lectors</i>, and <i>door-keepers</i>. The adjuration was commonly used over the <i>catechumens</i>, before they were admitted to baptism. <i>Gregory</i> of Nazianzen, and <i>Cyril</i> of Jerusalem speak much of this rite. See my <i>Succession of Sacred Literature</i>, under <i>Cyril</i>, and GREGORY <i>Nazianzen</i>; and see <i>Suicer</i>, under εξορκισμος.</p>
