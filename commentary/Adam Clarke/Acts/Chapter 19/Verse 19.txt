<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span>. <i><b>Which used curious arts</b></i> — ταπεριεργα. From the use of this word in the Greek writers, we know that it signified <i>magical</i> arts, <i>sorceries, incantations</i>, c. Ephesus abounded with these. Dio Cassius, speaking of the Emperor Adrian, says, Ὁ Αδριανος περιεργοτατος ην και μαντειαις και μαγγανειαις παντοδαπαις εχρητο. "Adrian was <i>exceedingly addicted to curious arts</i>, and practised <i>divination</i> and <i>magic</i>." These practices prevailed in all nations of the earth.</p>
<p><i><b>Brought their books together</b></i> — The Εφεσια γραμματα, or <i>Ephesian</i> <i>characters</i>, are celebrated in antiquity they appear to have been <i>amulets</i>, inscribed with strange characters, which were carried about the body for the purpose of curing diseases, expelling demons, and preserving from evils of different kinds. The books brought together on this occasion were such as taught the <i>science,</i> <i>manner</i> of formation, <i>use</i>, c., of these charms.</p>
<p><i>Suidas</i>, under Εφεσια γραμματα, <i>Ephesian letters</i>, gives us the following account. "Certain obscure incantations.-When Milesius and Ephesius wrestled at the Olympic games, Milesius could not prevail, because his antagonist had the <i>Ephesian letters</i> bound to his heels when this was discovered, and the letters taken away, it is reported that Milesius threw him thirty times."</p>
<p>The information given by <i>Hesychius</i> is still more curious: Εφεσια γραμματα. ην μεν παλαι Ϛ'· ὑϚερον δε προσεθεσαν τινες απατεωνες και αλλα· φασι δε των πρωτων τα ονοματα, ταδε ΑΣΚΙΟΝ, ΚΑΤΑΣΚΙΟΝ, ΛΙΞ, ΤΕΤΡΑΞ, ΔΑΜΝΑΜΕΝΕΥΣ, ΑΙΣΙΟΝ· Δηλοι δε, το μεν Ασκιον, σκοτος· το δε Κατα σκιον, φως· το δε Λιξ, γη· τετραξ δε, ενιαυτος· Δαμναμενευς δε, ἡλιος· Αισιον δε, αληθες. Ταυτα ουν ἱερα εϚι και ἁγια. "The Ephesian letters or characters were formerly <i>six</i>, but certain deceivers added others afterwards; and their names, according to report, were these: ASKION, KATASKION, LIX, TETRAX, DAMNAMENEUS, and AISlON. It is evident that <i>Askion</i> signifies DARKNESS; <i>Kataskion</i>, LIGHT; <i>Lix</i>, the EARTH; <i>Tetrax</i>, the YEAR; <i>Damnameneus</i>, the SUN; and <i>Aision</i>, TRUTH. These are holy and sacred things." The same account may be seen in <i>Clemens</i> <i>Alexandrinus</i>; Strom. lib. v. cap. 8, where he attempts to give the etymology of these different terms. These words served, no doubt, as the keys to different spells and incantations; and were used in order to the attainment of a great variety of ends. The <i>Abraxas</i> of the <i>Basilidians</i>, in the second century, were formed on the basis of the <i>Ephesian letters</i>; for those instruments of incantation, <i>several of which are now before me</i>, are inscribed with a number of <i>words</i> and <i>characters</i> equally as unintelligible as the above, and in many cases more so.</p>
<p>Then it is said they brought their books together, we are to understand the books which treated of these curious arts; such as the Εφεσια γραμματα, or <i>Ephesian characters</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And burned them before all</b></i> — These must have been thoroughly convinced of the truth of Christianity, and of the unlawfulness of their own arts.</p>
<p><i><b>Fifty thousand</b></i><b> pieces </b><i><b>of silver.</b></i> — Some think that the αργυριον, which we translate <i>piece of silver</i>, means a <i>shekel</i>, as that word is used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:16">Matthew 26:16</span>, where see the note; 50,000 shekels, at 3<i>s</i>., according to Dean Prideaux's valuation, (which is that followed throughout this work,) would amount to 7,500<i>£</i>.</p>
<p>But, as this was a <i>Roman</i> and not a <i>Jewish</i> country, we may rationally suppose that the Jewish coin was not here current; and that the αργυριον, or <i>silver coin</i>, mentioned by St. Luke, must have been either <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i>; and, it is very likely that the <i>sestertius</i> is meant, which was always a <i>silver</i> coin, about the value, according to Arbuthnot, of <i>two-pence</i>, or 1<i>d</i>. 3<i>q</i>3/4., which answers to the <i>fourth</i> part of a <i>denarius</i>, rated by the same author at 7 3/4<i>d</i>. Allowing this to be the coin intended, the 50,000 <i>sestertii</i> would amount to 403<i>£</i>. 12<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The Vulgate reads, <i>denariorum quinquaginta millium</i>, fifty thousand <i>denarii</i>, which, at 7 3/4 <i>d</i>., will amount to 1,614<i>£</i>. 11<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. The reading of the <i>Itala</i> version of the Codex Bezae is very singular, <i>Denariorum sestertia ducenta</i>. "Two hundred sesterces of denarii;" which may signify no more than "two hundred sestertii of <i>Roman</i> money:" for in this sense <i>denarius</i> is certainly used by <i>Cicero, Orat. pro Quint</i>.; where <i>ad denarium solvere</i>, means to pay in Roman money, an expression similar to our word <i>sterling</i>. This sum would amount to no more than 1<i>£</i>. 12<i>s</i>. 3 1/2<i>d</i>. But that which is computed from the sestertius is the most probable amount.</p>
