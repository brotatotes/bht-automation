It appears that the <i>silver shrines</i> mentioned here were small portable representations of this temple, which were bought by strangers as matters of <i>curiosity</i>, and probably of <i>devotion</i>. If we can suppose them to have been <i>exact models</i> of this famous temple, representing the whole exterior of its magnificent workmanship, which is possible, they would be held in high estimation, and probably become a sort of substitute for the temple itself, to worshippers of this goddess who lived in distant parts of Greece. The temple of Diana was raised at the expense of all Asia Minor, and yet was two hundred and twenty years in building, before it was brought to its sum of perfection. It was in length 425 feet, by 220 in breadth; and was beautified by 127 columns, which were made at the expense of so many <i>kings</i>; and was adorned with the most beautiful statues. To procure himself an everlasting fame, Erostratus burned it to the ground the same night on which Alexander the Great was born. It is reported that Alexander offered to make it as magnificent as it was before, provided he might put his name on the front; but this was refused. It was afterwards rebuilt and adorned, but Nero plundered it of all its riches. This grand building remains almost entire to the present day, and is now turned into a Turkish mosque. See an account of it in Montfaucon, Antiq. Expliq. vol. ii., with a beautiful drawing on plate vi., No. 20. See also Stuart's Athens. There were also <i>pieces of silver</i> struck with a representation of the temple of Minerva on one side: many coins occur in the reigns of the first Roman emperors, where temples, with idols in the porch, appear on the reverse; and several may be seen in <i>Muselius</i>, in the reigns of Trajan, Adrian, Antoninus Pius, c. A beautiful representation of the temple of Diana at Ephesus may be seen on a medal engraved by Montfaucon, in his Antiq. Expliq. Suppl. vol. ii. plate 33. It has eight Doric columns in front, which Pliny says were <i>sixty feet</i> in length. In the entrance, the figure of Diana is represented with a sort of tower upon her head her arms are supported by two staves; at her feet are represented two stags with their backs towards each other. The sun is represented on the right side of her head, and the moon as a crescent on the left. On each side and at the bottom of this temple are the words, πρωτων Ασιας Εφεσιων. Some think that the medals here referred to are the same that are meant by the <i>silver shrines</i> made by Demetrius and his craftsmen. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:27">Acts 19:27</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Brought no small gain</b></i> — There were many made, many sold, and probably at considerable prices.</p>
