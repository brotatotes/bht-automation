She is represented in some statues all covered over with <i>breasts</i>, from the shoulders down to the feet; in others she is thus represented, from the breast to the bottom of the abdomen, the thighs and legs being covered with the heads of different animals. From this it is evident that, under this name and form, <i>nature</i>, the nourisher and supporter of all things, was worshipped: the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i>, being grand agents, in all natural productions, were properly introduced as her attributes or symbols. Because she was the representative of universal nature, she was called, in opposition to <i>Diana</i> the <i>huntress</i> and <i>goddess</i> of <i>chastity</i>, the GREAT <i>goddess Diana</i>; not only worshipped in Asia, but throughout the whole world; both the Greeks and the Romans unanimously conjoining in her worship.</p>
<p>Several statues of this Ephesian Diana still remain; and some beautiful ones are represented by <i>Montfaucon</i>, in his <i>Antig.</i> <i>Expliq</i>. vol. i. book iii. cap. 15, plates 46, 47, 48. From this father of antiquaries, much information on this subject may be derived. He observes that the original statue of Diana of Ephesus, which was in that noble temple, esteemed one of the wonders of the world, was made of <i>ivory</i>, as Pliny says; but Vitruvius says it was made of <i>cedar</i>; and others, of the wood of the <i>vine</i>. The images of this goddess are divided into several bands, or compartments; so that they appear swathed from the breasts to the feet. On the <i>head</i> is generally represented a large tower, two stories high. A kind of <i>festoon</i> of flowers and fruit descends from her <i>shoulders</i>; in the void places of the festoon a <i>crab</i> is often represented, and sometimes crowned by two <i>genii</i> or <i>victories</i>. The <i>arms</i> are generally extended, or stretched a little out from the sides; and on each one or two <i>lions</i>. Below the festoon, between the two first bands, there are a great number of <i>paps</i>: hence she has been styled by some of the ancients, <i>Multimammia</i>, and πολυμαστος, the goddess with the <i>multitude of paps</i>: on one figure I count nineteen. Between the second and third bands, <i>birds</i> are represented; between the third and fourth, a <i>human head</i> with <i>tritons</i>; between the fourth and fifth, heads of <i>oxen</i>. Most of the <i>images</i> of this goddess are represented as swathed nearly to the ancles, about which the folds of her robe appear. Though there is a general resemblance in all the images of the Ephesian Diana, yet some have more figures or symbols, some less: these symbols are generally <i>paps, human figures, oxen, lions, stags, griffins, sphinxes,</i> <i>reptiles, bees, branches of trees</i>, and <i>roses</i>.</p>
<p>That nature is intended by this goddess is evident from the inscription on two of those represented by Montfaucon: παναιολος φυσις παντων μητηρ, <i>Nature, full of varied creatures, and mother</i> <i>of all things</i>. It is evident that this Diana was a composition of several deities: her <i>crown</i> of <i>turrets</i> belongs to <i>Cybele</i>, the mother of the gods; the <i>lions</i> were sacred to her also; the <i>fruits</i> and <i>oxen</i> are symbols of <i>Ceres</i>; the <i>griffins</i> were sacred to <i>Apollo</i>; and the <i>deer</i> or <i>stags</i> to <i>Diana</i>. The <i>crab</i> being placed within the festoon of flowers evidently refers to the northern tropic <i>Cancer</i>; and the <i>crab</i> being <i>crowned</i> in that quarter may refer to the sun having <i>accomplished</i> his course, and begun to return with an increase of light, heat, c: The <i>paps</i>, or <i>breasts</i>, as has already been observed, show her to be the <i>nurse</i> <i>of all things</i> and the different <i>animals</i> and <i>vegetables</i> represented on those images point out nature as the supporter of the animal and vegetable world: the <i>moon</i> and <i>tritons</i> show her influence on the <i>sea</i>; and the <i>sun</i> her influence on the <i>earth</i>. All these things considered, it is no wonder that this goddess was called at Ephesus the <i>Great Diana</i>, and that she was worshipped, not only in that city, but in all the world. In the worship of this deity, and in the construction of her images, the heathens seem to have consulted common sense and reason in rather an unusual manner. But we must observe, also, that among the Greeks and Romans they had two classes of deities: the <i>Dii Majores</i>, and the <i>Dii Minores</i>: the great gods, and the minor gods. The latter were innumerable; but the former; among whom was <i>Diana</i>, were only twelve-<i>Jupiter, Neptune, Apollo, Mars, Mercury</i>, and <i>Vulcan; Juno,</i> <i>Vesta, Ceres, Diana, Venus</i>, and <i>Minerva</i>. These twelve were adored through the whole Gentile world, under a variety of names.</p>
