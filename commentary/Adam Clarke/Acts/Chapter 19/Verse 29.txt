<p>Verse 29. <i><b>The whole city was filled with confusion</b></i> — Thus we find the peace of the whole city was disturbed, not by an <i>apostle</i> preaching the Gospel of Christ, but by one interested, unprincipled knave, who did not even plead <i>conscience</i> for what he was doing; but that it was by this craft he and his fellows got their wealth, and he was afraid to lose it.</p>
<p><i><b>Rushed - into the theatre.</b></i> — The theatres, being very spacious and convenient places, were often used for <i>popular</i> assemblies and public deliberation, especially in matters which regarded the safety of the state. There are several proofs of this in ancient authors. So <i>Tacitus</i>, Hist. ii. 80, speaking concerning Vespasian, says: <i>Antiochensium theatrum ingressus, ubi illis consultare mos</i> <i>est, concurrentes et in adulationem effusos alloquitur</i>. "Having entered into the theatre of the Antiochians, where it was the custom to hold consultations, the people running together, and being profuse in flattery, he addressed them." <i>Frontinus</i>, in Stratagem lib. iii. cap. 2, speaking of a public meeting at the <i>theatre</i> at Agrigentum, observes, <i>ubi ex more Graecorum locus</i> <i>consultationi praebebatur</i>; which, according to the custom of the Greeks, is the place for public deliberation. See several examples in <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
