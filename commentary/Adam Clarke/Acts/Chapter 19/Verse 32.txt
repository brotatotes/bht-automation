<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Some - cried one thing, and some another</b></i> — This is an admirable description of a tumultuous mob, gathered together without law or reason; getting their passions inflamed, and looking for an opportunity to commit outrages, without <i>why</i> or <i>wherefore-principle</i> or <i>object</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>For the assembly was confused</b></i> — Ἡ εκκλησια; The same word which we translate <i>church</i>; and thus we find that it signifies any assembly, <i>good</i> or <i>bad, lawful</i>, or <i>unlawful</i>; and that only the circumstances of the case can determine the precise nature of the assembly to which this word is applied.</p>
