<p>Verse 33. <i><b>They drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews</b></i><b> </b><i><b>putting him forward</b></i> — From this and the following verses it is pretty evident that this Alexander was brought forward on this occasion by the Jews, that he might make an oration to the multitude, in order to exculpate the <i>Jews</i>, who were often by the heathens confounded with the <i>Christians</i>; and cast the whole blame of the uproar upon Paul and his party. And he was probably chosen because he was an able <i>speaker</i>; and when he beckoned with his hand; to gain an audience, the Greeks, knowing that he was a <i>Jew</i>, and consequently as much opposed to the worship of Diana as Paul was, would not hear him; and therefore, to drown his apology, τω δημω, <i>for the people</i>, viz. the Jews, they vociferated for the space of two hours, <i>Great is Diana of the Ephesians</i>! There does not seem any just ground from the text to suppose that this Alexander was a <i>Christian</i>; or that he was about to make an apology <i>for the Christians</i>: it is generally believed that he is the same with <i>Alexander</i> the <i>coppersmith</i>, of whom St. Paul speaks, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:14">2 Timothy 4:14</span>, and whom, with <i>Philetus</i>, he was obliged to excommunicate, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>. By <i>the Jews putting him forward</i>, we are to understand their earnestness to get him to undertake <i>their defence</i>, and criminate, as much as possible, St. Paul and his companions, and the Christian cause in general; which he would no doubt have done, without vindicating the worship of Diana, which, as a Jew, he would not dare to attempt.</p>
