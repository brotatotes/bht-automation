<p>Verse 35. <i><b>When the town - clerk</b></i> — ογραμματευς, Literally, the <i>scribe</i>. The Syriac has [Syriac] <i>reisha damedinato</i>, the <i>chief</i> or <i>prince of the city</i>. The later Syriac has, <i>the scribe of the</i> <i>city</i>. Some think that the word <i>recorder</i> would do better here than <i>town-clerk</i>; and indeed it is evident that a magistrate of considerable authority and influence is intended-the <i>mayor</i> or <i>sovereign</i> of the city.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye men of Ephesus</b></i> — The speech of this man may be thus analyzed:</p>
<p>1. He states that there was no need of a public declaration that the Ephesians were worshippers of Diana; this every person knew, and nobody attempted to contest it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:35-36">Acts 19:35-36</span>.</p>
<p>2. That the persons accused were not guilty of any public offence, nor of any breach of the laws of the city, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:37">Acts 19:37</span>.</p>
<p>3. That, if they were, this was not a legal method of prosecuting them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:38-39">Acts 19:38-39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:39">Acts 19:39</span>.</p>
<p>4. That they themselves, by this tumultuous meeting, had exposed themselves to the censure of the law, and were in danger of being called into question for it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:40">Acts 19:40</span>. See <i>Dodd</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana</b></i> — The word νεωκορος, <i>neocoros</i>, which we translate <i>worshipper</i>, signified at first, among the ancient Greeks, no more than <i>sweeper of the temple</i>, and answered nearly to our <i>sexton</i>: in process of time, the care of the temple was intrusted to this person: at length the <i>neocori</i> became persons of great consequence, and were those who offered sacrifices for the life of the emperor. Whole cities took this appellation, as appears on many ancient coins and medals; and <i>Ephesus</i> is supposed to have been the <i>first</i> that assumed this title. At this time, it was commonly known as belonging to this city. "What man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is the <i>Neocoros</i> of the great goddess Diana?" As if he had said: "The whole city is devoted to her worship: it is reputed an honour to our highest characters even to sweep her temple, and open and shut her doors. Besides, we offer to her the highest sacrifices; and are intrusted with the religious service that pertains to the emperor's safety."</p>
<p><i><b>Of the</b></i><b> image </b><i><b>which fell down from Jupiter?</b></i> — The original image of the Ephesian Diana (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:40- :">Acts 19:40- :</span>) was supposed to have descended from heaven; which intimates that it was so <i>old</i> that no person knew either its <i>maker</i> or the <i>time</i> in which it was formed, and it was the interest of the <i>priests</i> to persuade the people that this image had been sent to them as a present from Jupiter himself. Several images and sacred things were supposed, among the heathens, to be presents immediately from heaven. Euripides states the image of Diana of Tauri to be of this kind; and calls it διοπετες αγαλμα, the image fallen from Jupiter. Numa pretended that the <i>ancilia</i>, or sacred shields, had come from heaven. In imitation of these, many of the Italian papists believe that the <i>shrine of our lady of Loretto</i> was also a Divine gift to their country. St. Isidore, of Damietta, says that the heathen, in order to induce the people to believe that such images came from heaven, either banished or slew the artists that had formed them, that there might be no evidence of the <i>time</i> in which, or the <i>persons</i> by whom, they were made: this point secured, it was easy to persuade the credulous multitude that they had been sent from heaven. The story of the <i>Palladium</i>, on which the safety of Troy was said to depend, is well known. It was an image of Minerva, and also supposed to have descended from Jupiter.</p>
