<p>Verse 38. <i><b>If Demetrius - have a matter against any man</b></i> — If it be any breach of law, in reference to Demetrius and the artists, <i>the</i> <i>law is open</i>, αγοραιοι αγονται; these are the terms of law, public courts, times of sessions or assize; or, rather, <i>the judges are</i> <i>mow sitting</i>: so the words may be understood. <i>And there are</i> <i>deputies</i>, ανθυπατοι, <i>proconsuls</i>, appointed to guard the peace of the state, and to support every honest man in his right: <i>let them</i> <i>implead one another</i>; let the one party bring forward his action of assault or trespass, and the other put in his defense: the laws are equal and impartial, and justice will be done to him who is wronged.</p>
