<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:40">Acts 19:40</span>. <i><b>For we are in danger</b></i>, c.] Popular commotions were always dreaded by the Roman government and so they should by all governments; for, when <i>might</i> has nothing to direct its operations but <i>passion</i>, how destructive must these operations be! One of the Roman laws made all such commotions of the people <i>capital</i> offenses against those who raised them. <i>Qui caetum et concursus fecerit,</i> <i>capite puniatur</i>: "He who raises a mob shall forfeit his life." If such a law existed at Ephesus-and it probably did, from this reference to it in the words of the town-clerk or recorder-then Demetrius must feel himself in great personal danger; and that his own life lay now at the mercy of those whom he had accused, concerning whom he had raised such an outcry, and against whom nothing disorderly could be proved.</p>
