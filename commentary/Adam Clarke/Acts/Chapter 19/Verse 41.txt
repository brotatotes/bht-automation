<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:41">Acts 19:41</span>. <i><b>He dismissed the assembly.</b></i> — την εκκλησιαν. Another proof that the word εκκλησια, which we generally translate <i>church</i>, signifies an <i>assembly</i> of any kind, good or bad, legal or illegal.</p>
<p>1. <i>How forcible are right words</i>! From the conduct of this prudent, sensible man, we may learn how much influence persons of this character may have, even over the unbridled multitude. But, where the <i>civil</i> power associates itself with the <i>lawless might</i> of the <i>many</i>, THERE must be confusion and every evil work. What a blessing to the community is the <i>civil law</i>! Were it not for this, the unthinking multitude would destroy others, and at last destroy themselves. <i>Law</i> and <i>justice</i> are from God; and the <i>civil power</i>, by which they are supported and administered, should be respected by all who regard the safety of their persons or property.</p>
<p>2. Though the ministry of St. Paul was greatly blessed at Ephesus, and his preaching appears to have been very popular, yet this sunshine was soon darkened: peace with the world cannot last long; the <i>way of the Lord</i> will always be opposed by those who love their <i>own ways</i>.</p>
<p>3. How few would make an <i>outward</i> profession of religion, were there no <i>gain</i> connected with it! And yet, as one justly observes, religion is rendered <i>gainful</i> only by some <i>external</i> part of it. For this very reason, the <i>external</i> part of religion is always <i>on the</i> <i>increase</i>, and none can find fault with it without raising storms and tempests; while the <i>internal</i> part wastes and decays, no man laying it to heart. Demetrius and his fellows would have made no stir for their <i>worship</i>, had not the apostle's preaching tended to discredit that <i>by which they got their wealth</i>. Most of the outcries that have been made against all revivals of religion-revivals by which the Church has been called back to its primitive principles and purity, have arisen out of <i>self-interest</i>. The cry of, <i>the Church is in danger</i>, has been echoed only by those who found their <i>secular</i> interest at stake; and knew that <i>reformation</i> must unmask them and show that the slothful and wicked servants could no longer be permitted to live on the revenues of that Church which they disgraced by their lives, and corrupted by their false doctrines. He that eats the Church's bread should do the Church's world: and he that will not <i>work</i> should not be permitted to <i>eat</i>.</p>
