<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:5">Acts 19:5</span>. <i><b>When they heard this</b></i>, c.] As there is no evidence in the New Testament of persons being <i>rebaptized</i>, unless this be one, many criticisms have been hazarded to prove that these persons were not <i>rebaptized</i>. I see no need of this. To be a <i>Christian</i>, a man must be baptized in the <i>Christian faith</i>: these persons had not been baptized into that faith, and therefore were not Christians: they felt this, and were immediately baptized <i>into the name of the</i> <i>Lord Jesus</i>. This is a plain case but let one instance be produced of a person being rebaptized, who had <i>before</i> been baptized in the name of the <i>holy Trinity</i>, or even in the <i>name of Jesus</i> alone. In my view, it is an awful thing to <i>iterate baptism</i> when it had been before <i>essentially</i> performed: by "<i>essentially</i> performed," I mean, administered by <i>sprinkling, washing</i>, or <i>plunging</i>, by or in <i>water</i>, in the name of the <i>Father, Son</i>, and <i>Spirit</i>, being invoked at the time. Whoever has had this has the <i>essence</i> of baptism, as far as that can be conferred by <i>man</i>; and it matters not at <i>what period of</i> <i>his life</i> he has had it; it is a substantial baptism, and by it the person has been fully consecrated to the holy and blessed Trinity; and there should not be an <i>iteration</i> of this consecration on any account whatever. It is totally contrary to the canon law; it is contrary to the decisions of the best divines; it is contrary to the practice of the purest ages of the Church of God; it is contrary to the New Testament, and tends to bring this sacred ordinance into disrepute.</p>
