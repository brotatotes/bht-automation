<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>. <i><b>When divers were hardened</b></i> — τινες, When <i>some</i> of them were hardened; several no doubt felt the power of Divine truth, and yielded consent. Our term <i>divers</i>, one of the most <i>bald</i> in our language, has too general a meaning for this place.</p>
<p>Behold the effect of the word of God! It is a savour of life unto life, or death unto death, according as it is received or rejected. The twelve men mentioned above received it affectionately, and <i>they</i> were made partakers of the Holy Ghost; the others were hardened, for they refused to believe; and they calumniated the doctrine, and became Satan's preachers among the multitude, to prejudice them against Christ and his religion.</p>
<p><i><b>Separated the disciples</b></i> — Paul, and those converted under his ministry, had doubtless been in the habit of attending public worship in the <i>synagogue</i>: but, on the persecuting conduct of these Jews; he and his converts wholly withdrew from the synagogue, and took a place for themselves; and constantly afterwards held their own meetings at a school room, which they hired no doubt for the purpose.</p>
<p><i><b>The school of one Tyrannus.</b></i> — For σχολη, <i>the school</i>, one MS. has συναγωγη, <i>the synagogue</i>; and, for <i>Tyrannus</i>, some have <i>Tyrannios</i>. Some have considered the original word as being an epithet, rather than the name of a person; and think that a <i>prince</i> or <i>nobleman</i> is intended, because τυραννος, <i>tyrant</i>, is taken in this sense: but this is a most unlikely conjecture. It appears that the person in question was a <i>schoolmaster</i>, and that he <i>lent</i> or <i>hired</i> his room to the apostles; and that they preached daily in it to as many, both Jews and Gentiles, as chose to attend. It is very likely that Tyrannus was a Jew, and was at least well affected to the Christian cause; for we have many proofs that individuals among them kept <i>schools</i> for the instruction of their youth; besides the schools or academies kept by the more celebrated rabbins. See <i>Schoettgen</i> and <i>Vitringa</i>. The school of Tyrannus might have been such a place as <i>Exeter Hall</i>, and such like places for public and especially for extraordinary religious meetings in London.</p>
