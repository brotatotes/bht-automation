<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span>. <i><b>When the day of pentecost was fully come</b></i> — The feast of <i>pentecost</i> was celebrated <i>fifty</i> days after the passover, and has its name πεντηκοστη from πεντηκοντα, <i>fifty</i>, which is compounded of πεντε, <i>five</i>, and ηκοντα, the <i>decimal</i> termination. It commenced on the <i>fiftieth</i> day reckoned from the <i>first day of</i> <i>unleavened bread</i>, i.e. on the morrow after the paschal lamb was offered. The law relative to this feast is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:15">Acts 23:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:16">Acts 23:16</span>, in these words: <i>And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after</i> <i>the Sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the</i> <i>wave-offering; seven Sabbaths shall be complete: even unto the</i> <i>morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number fifty days</i>. This feast was instituted in commemoration of the giving the law on Mount Sinai; and is therefore sometimes called by the Jews, שמחת תורה <i>shimchath torah, the joy of the law</i>, and frequently <i>the feast of weeks</i>. There is a correspondence between the giving of the law, which is celebrated by this feast of pentecost, together with the crucifixion of our Lord, which took place at the passover, and this descent of the Holy Spirit, which happened at this pentecost.</p>
<p>1. At the passover, the Israelites were delivered from Egyptian bondage: this was a type of the thraldom in which the human race were to Satan and sin.</p>
<p>2. At the passover Jesus Christ, who was typified by the paschal lamb, was sacrificed for the sin of the world, and by this sacrifice redemption from sin and Satan is now procured and proclaimed.</p>
<p>3. On the pentecost, God gave his law on Mount Sinai, accompanied with thunderings and lightnings. On the pentecost, God sent down his Holy Spirit, like a rushing mighty wind; and tongues of fire sat upon each disciple, in order that, by his influence, that <i>new</i> law of <i>light</i> and <i>life</i> might be promulgated and established. Thus, the analogy between the Egyptian bondage and the thraldom occasioned by sin - the deliverance from Egypt, and the redemption from sin - the giving of the law, with all its emblematic accompaniments, and the sending down the Holy Spirit, with its symbols of light, life, and power, has been exactly preserved.</p>
<p>4. At the Jewish passover, Christ was degraded, humbled, and ignominiously put to death: at the following festival, the pentecost, he was highly <i>glorified</i>; and the all conquering and ever during might of his kingdom then commenced. The Holy Spirit seems to have designed all these analogies, to show that, through all preceding ages, God had the dispensation of the Gospel continually in view; and that the <i>old</i> <i>law</i> and its ordinances were only designed as preparatives for the new.</p>
<p><i><b>They were all with one accord in one place.</b></i> — It is probable that the ALL here mentioned means the one hundred and twenty spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span>, who were all together at the election of Matthias. <i>With one accord</i>, ομοθυμαδον; this word is very expressive: it signifies that all their <i>minds</i>, affections, desires, and wishes, were concentred in one object, every man having the same end in view; and, having but one desire, they had but one prayer to God, and every heart uttered it. There was no person <i>uninterested</i> - none <i>unconcerned</i> - none <i>lukewarm</i>; all were in <i>earnest</i>; and the Spirit of God came down to meet their <i>united</i> faith and prayer. When any assembly of God's people meet in the same spirit they may expect every blessing they need.</p>
<p><i>In one place</i>. - Where this place was we cannot tell: it was probably in the temple, as seems to be intimated in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span>, where it is said <i>they were daily</i> ὁμοθυμαδον εν τῳ ἱερῳ, <i>with one</i> <i>accord in the temple</i>; and as this was the <i>third</i> hour of the day, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>, which was the Jewish hour of <i>morning prayer</i>, as the <i>ninth</i> hour was the hour of <i>evening</i> <i>prayer</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span>, it is most probable that the <i>temple</i> was the <i>place</i> in which they were assembled.</p>
