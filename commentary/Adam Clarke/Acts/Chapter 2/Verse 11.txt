<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:11">Acts 2:11</span>. <i><b>Cretes</b></i> — Natives of <i>Crete</i>, a large and noted island in the Levant, or eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, now called <i>Candia</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Arabians</b></i> — Natives of <i>Arabia</i>, a well known country of Asia, having the <i>Red Sea</i> on the <i>west</i>; the <i>Persian Gulf</i> on the <i>east;</i> <i>Judea</i> on the <i>north</i>; and the <i>Indian Ocean</i> on the <i>south</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The wonderful works of God.</b></i> — Such as the incarnation of Christ; his various miracles, preaching, death, resurrection, and ascension; and the design of God to save the world through him. From this one circumstance we may learn that all the people enumerated above were either <i>Jews</i> or <i>proselytes</i>; and that there was probably none that could be, strictly speaking, called <i>heathens</i> among them. It may at first appear strange that there could be found Jews in so many different countries, some of which were very remote from the others; but there is a passage in Philo's Embassy to Caius which throws considerable light on the subject. In a letter sent to Caius by King Agrippa, he speaks of to the holy city of Jerusalem, not merely as the metropolis of Judea, but of many other regions, because of the colonies at different times led out of Judea, not only into <i>neighbouring</i> countries, such as Egypt, Phoenicia, Syria, and Coelosyria, but also into those that are <i>remote</i>, such as Pamphylia, Cilicia, and the chief parts of Asia as far as Bithynia, and the innermost parts of Pontus; also in the regions of Europe, Thessaly, Boeotia, Macedonia, AEtolia, Attica, Argos, Corinth, and the principal parts of Peloponnesus. Not only the continents and provinces (says he) are full of Jewish colonies, but the most celebrated isles also, Euboea, Cyprus, and Crete, not to mention the countries beyond the Euphrates. All these (a small part of Babylon and some other praefectures excepted, which possess fertile territories) are inhabited by Jews. Not only my native city entreats thy clemency, but other cities also, situated in different parts of the world, Asia, Europe, Africa; both islands, sea coasts, and inland countries." PHILONIS <i>Opera</i>, edit. <i>Mangey</i>, vol. ii. p. 587.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that almost all the places and provinces mentioned by St. Luke are mentioned also in this letter of King Agrippa. These, being all <i>Jews</i> or <i>proselytes</i>, could understand in some measure the <i>wonderful works of God</i>, of which mere <i>heathens</i> could have formed no conception. It was wisely ordered that the miraculous descent of the Holy Ghost should take place at this time, when so many from various nations were present to bear witness to what was done, and to be themselves subjects of his mighty working. These, on their return to their respective countries, would naturally proclaim what things they saw and heard; and by this the way of the apostles was made plain; and thus Christianity made a rapid progress over all those parts in a very short time after the resurrection of our Lord.</p>
