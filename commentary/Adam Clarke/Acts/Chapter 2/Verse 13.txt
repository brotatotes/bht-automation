<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:13">Acts 2:13</span>. <i><b>These men are full of new wine.</b></i> — Rather <i>sweet wine</i>, for γλευκους, cannot mean the <i>mustum</i>, or <i>new wine</i>, as there could be none in Judea so early as pentecost. The γλευκος, <i>gleucus</i>, seems to have been a peculiar kind of wine, and is thus described by Hesychius and Suidas: Γλευκος, το αποσταγμα της σταφυλης, πριν πατηθῃ. <i>Gleucus is that which distils from the</i> <i>grape before it is pressed</i>. This must be at once both the strongest and sweetest wine. Calmet observes that the ancients had the secret of preserving wine <i>sweet</i> through the whole year, and were fond of taking <i>morning draughts</i> of it: to this Horace appears to refer, Sat. l. ii. s. iv. ver. 24. </p>
