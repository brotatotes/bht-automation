<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:14">Acts 2:14</span>. <i><b>Peter, standing up with the eleven</b></i> — They probably spoke by turns, not altogether; but Peter began the discourse.</p>
<p><i><b>All ye that dwell at Jerusalem</b></i> — οι κατοικουντες would be better translated by the word <i>sojourn</i>, because these were not <i>inhabitants</i> of Judea, but the <i>strangers</i> mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9-11">Acts 2:9-11</span>, who had come up to the feast.</p>
