<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>. <i><b>In the last days</b></i> — The time of the Messiah; and so the phrase was understood among the Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh</b></i> — Rabbi <i>Tanchum</i> says, "When Moses laid his hands upon Joshua, the holy blessed God said, In the time of the old text, each individual prophet prophesied; but, in the times of the Messiah, all the Israelites shall be prophets." And this they build on the prophecy quoted in this place by Peter.</p>
<p><i><b>Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy</b></i> — The word <i>prophesy</i> is not to be understood here as implying the knowledge and discovery of future events; but signifies to teach and proclaim the great truths of God, especially those which concerned redemption by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Your young men shall see visions</b></i>, c.] These were two of the various ways in which God revealed himself under the Old Testament. Sometimes he revealed himself by a <i>symbol</i>, which was a sufficient proof of the Divine presence: <i>fire</i> was the most ordinary, as it was the most expressive, symbol. Thus he appeared to Moses on Mount Horeb, and afterwards at Sinai to Abraham, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:1-21">Genesis 15:1-21</span>; to Elijah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:11">1 Kings 19:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:12">1 Kings 19:12</span>. At other times he revealed himself by <i>angelic</i> ministry: this was frequent, especially in the days of the patriarchs, of which we find many instances in the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>By <i>dreams</i> he discovered his will in numerous instances: see the remarkable case of Joseph, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:5">Genesis 37:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:9">Genesis 37:9</span>; of Jacob, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+28:1">Genesis 28:1</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:2">Genesis 46:2</span>, c. of Pharaoh, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:1-7">Genesis 41:1-7</span>; of Nebuchadnezzar, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+4:10-17">Daniel 4:10-17</span>.
