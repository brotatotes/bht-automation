<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:18">Acts 2:18</span>. <i><b>On my servants and on my handmaidens</b></i> â€” This properly means persons of the lowest condition, such as <i>male</i> and <i>female</i> <i>slaves</i>. As the Jews asserted that the spirit of prophecy never rested upon a <i>poor</i> man, these words are quoted to show that, under the Gospel dispensation, neither <i>bond</i> nor <i>free, male</i> nor <i>female</i>, is excluded from sharing in the gifts and graces of the Divine Spirit.</p>
