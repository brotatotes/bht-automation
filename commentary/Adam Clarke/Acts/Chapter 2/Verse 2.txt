<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:2">Acts 2:2</span>. <i><b>A sound from heaven</b></i> — Probably thunder is meant, which is the harbinger of the Divine presence.</p>
<p><i><b>Rushing mighty wind</b></i> — The passage of a large portion of electrical fluid over that place would not only occasion the <i>sound</i>, or thunder, but also <i>the rushing mighty wind</i>; as the air would rush suddenly and strongly into the vacuum occasioned by the rarefaction of the atmosphere in that place, through the sudden passage of the electrical fluid; and the wind would follow the direction of the fire. There is a good deal of similarity between this account and that of the appearance of God to Elijah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:11-12">1 Kings 19:11-12</span>, where the <i>strong wind</i>, the <i>earthquake</i>, and the <i>fire</i>, were harbingers of the Almighty's presence, and prepared the heart of Elijah to hear the <i>small still voice</i>; so, this <i>sound</i>, and the <i>mighty rushing</i> <i>wind</i>, prepared the apostles to receive the influences and gifts of the Holy Spirit. In both cases, the <i>sound, strong wind</i>, and <i>fire</i>, although <i>natural</i> agents, were <i>supernaturally</i> employed. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span></span>.</p>
