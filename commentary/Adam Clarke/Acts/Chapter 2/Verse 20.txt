Verse Acts 2:20. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood â€” These are figurative representations of eclipses, intended most probably to point out the fall of the civil and ecclesiastical state in Judea: Matthew 24:29. That the SUN is darkened when a total eclipse takes place, and that the MOON appears of a bloody hue in such circumstances, every person knows.
