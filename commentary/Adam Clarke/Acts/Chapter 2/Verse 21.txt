<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:21">Acts 2:21</span>. <i><b>Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be</b></i><b> </b><i><b>saved.</b></i> â€” The predicted ruin is now impending; and only such as receive the Gospel of the Son of God shall be saved. And that none but the <i>Christians</i> did escape, when God poured out these judgments, is well known; and that ALL the Christians did escape, not one of them perishing in these devastations, stands attested by the most respectable authority. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:13">Matthew 24:13</span>.</p>
