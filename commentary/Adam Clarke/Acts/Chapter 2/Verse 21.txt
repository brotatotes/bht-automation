Verse Acts 2:21. Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. â€” The predicted ruin is now impending; and only such as receive the Gospel of the Son of God shall be saved. And that none but the Christians did escape, when God poured out these judgments, is well known; and that ALL the Christians did escape, not one of them perishing in these devastations, stands attested by the most respectable authority. Matthew 24:13.
