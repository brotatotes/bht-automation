The sense of the verse seems to be this: <i>Jesus of</i> <i>Nazareth, a man</i> sent <i>of God, and celebrated among you by miracles,</i> <i>wonders, and signs</i>; and all these done in such profusion as had never been done by the best of your most accredited prophets. And these signs, &amp;c., were such as demonstrated his Divine mission.</p>
