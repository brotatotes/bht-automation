Verse Acts 2:24. Whom God hath raised up — For, as God alone gave him up to death, so God alone raised him up from death.Having loosed the pains of death — It is generally supposed that this expression means, the dissolving of those bonds or obligations by which those who enter into the region of the dead are detained there till the day of the resurrection; and this is supposed to be the meaning of חבלי מות chebley maveth, in Psalms 116:3, or חבלי שאול chebley sheol, in Psalms 18:5, and in 2 Samuel 22:6, to which, as a parallel, this place has been referred. But Kypke has sufficiently proved that λυειν τας ωδινας θανατου, signifies rather to REMOVE the pains or sufferings of death. So Lucian, De Conscr. Hist., says, "a copious sweat to some, ελυσε τον πυρετον, REMOVES or carries off the fever." So STRABO, speaking of the balm of Jericho, says, λυει δε κεφαλαλγιας θαυμαστως-it wonderfully REMOVES the headache, c. That Christ did suffer the pains and sorrows of death in his passion is sufficiently evident but that these were all removed, previously to his crucifixion, is fully seen in that calm manner in which he met it, with all its attendant terrors. If we take the words as commonly understood, they mean that it was impossible for the Prince of Life to be left in the empire of death: his resurrection, therefore, was a necessary consequence of his own Divine power.Instead of θανατου, of death, the Codex Bezae, Syriac, Coptic, and Vulgate, have αιδου, of hell, or the place of separate spirits; and perhaps it was on no better authority than this various reading, supported but by slender evidence, that, He descended into hell, became an article in what is called the apostles' creed. And on this article many a popish legend has been builded, to the discredit of sober sense and true religion.
