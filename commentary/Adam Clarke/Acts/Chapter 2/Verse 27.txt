<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:27">Acts 2:27</span>. <i><b>Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell</b></i> — εις αιδου, <i>in</i> <i>hades</i>, that is, the state of <i>separate spirits</i>, or the state of the <i>dead</i>. Hades was a general term among the Greek writers, by which they expressed this state; and this HADES was <i>Tartarus</i> to the <i>wicked</i>, and <i>Elysium</i> to the <i>good</i>. See the explanation of the word in the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>To see corruption.</b></i> — <i>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt</i> <i>return</i>, was a sentence pronounced on man <i>after</i> the fall: therefore this sentence could be executed on none but those who were <i>fallen</i>; but Jesus, being conceived without sin, neither partook of human corruption, nor was involved in the condemnation of fallen human nature; consequently, it was impossible for his body to <i>see</i> <i>corruption</i>; and it could not have undergone the <i>temporary</i> death, to which it was not naturally liable, had it not been for the purpose of making an <i>atonement</i>. It was therefore impossible that the human nature of our Lord could be subject to <i>corruption</i>: for though it was possible that the soul and it might be separated for a time, yet, as it had not sinned, it was not liable to dissolution; and its immortality was the necessary consequence of its being pure from transgression.</p>
