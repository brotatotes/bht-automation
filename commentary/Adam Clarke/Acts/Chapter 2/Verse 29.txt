<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Let me speak freely - of the patriarch David</b></i> — In <i>Midris</i> <i>Tillin</i>, it is said, in a paraphrase on the words, <i>my flesh shall</i> <i>rest in hope</i>, "Neither worm nor insect had power over David." It is possible that this opinion prevailed in the time of St. Peter, and, if so, his words are the more pointed and forcible; and therefore thus applied by Dr. Lightfoot: "That this passage, <i>Thou</i> <i>shalt not leave my soul in hell</i>, c., is not to be applied to David himself appears in that I may confidently aver concerning him, that he was <i>dead</i> and <i>buried</i>, and never <i>rose again</i> but his soul was left εις αδου, <i>in the state of the dead</i>, and <i>HE saw</i> <i>corruption</i>; for his sepulchre is with us to this day, under that very notion, that it is the sepulchre of David, who died and was there buried; nor is there one syllable mentioned any where of the resurrection of his body, or the return of his soul εξ αδου <i>from</i> <i>the state of the dead</i>." To this the same author adds the following remarkable note: I cannot slip over that passage, <i>Hieros. Chagig</i>. fol. 78: <i>Rab. Jose</i> saith, <i>David died at pentecost, and all Israel</i> <i>bewailed him, and offered their sacrifices the day following</i>. This is a remarkable coincidence; and may be easily applied to him of whom David was a <i>type</i>.</p>
