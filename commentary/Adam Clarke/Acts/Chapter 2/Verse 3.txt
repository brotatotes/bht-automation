<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:3">Acts 2:3</span>. <i><b>Cloven tongues like as of fire</b></i> — The tongues were the emblem of the <i>languages</i> they were to speak. The <i>cloven tongues</i> pointed out the <i>diversity</i> of those languages; and the <i>fire</i> seemed to intimate that the whole would be a <i>spiritual</i> gift, and be the means of bringing <i>light</i> and <i>life</i> to the souls who should hear them preach the everlasting Gospel in those languages.</p>
<p><i><b>Sat upon each of them.</b></i> — Scintillations, coruscations, or flashes of fire, were probably at first frequent through every part of the room where they were sitting; at last these flashes became <i>defined</i>, and a lambent flame, in the form of a cloven tongue, became stationary on the head of each disciple; a proof that the Spirit of God had made each his temple or residence. That unusual appearances of fire were considered emblems of the presence and influence of God, both the Scriptures and the Jewish writings amply prove. Thus God manifested himself to <i>Moses</i>, when he appointed him to deliver Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:2-3">Exodus 3:2-3</span>; and thus he manifested himself when he delivered the <i>law</i> on Mount Sinai, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:16-20">Exodus 19:16-20</span>. The Jews, in order to support the pretensions of their <i>rabbins</i>, as delivering their instructions by Divine authority and influence, represent them as being <i>surrounded with</i> <i>fire</i> while they were delivering their lectures; and that their words, in consequence, penetrated and exhilarated the souls of their disciples. Some of the <i>Mohammedans</i> represent Divine inspiration in the same way. In a fine copy of a Persian work, entitled <i>Ajaceb al Makhlookat</i>, or <i>Wonders of Creation</i>, now before me, where a marred account of Abraham's sacrifice, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:9-17">Genesis 15:9-17</span>, is given, instead of the <i>burning lamp</i> passing between the divided pieces of the victim, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:17">Genesis 15:17</span>, Abraham is represented standing between four fowls, the <i>cock</i>, the <i>peacock</i>, the <i>duck</i>, and the <i>crow</i>, with his head almost wrapped in a flame of lambent fire, as the emblem of the Divine communication made to him of the future prosperity of his descendants. The painting in which this is represented is most exquisitely finished. This notion of the <i>manner</i> in which Divine intimations were given was not peculiar to the Jews and Arabians; it exists in all countries; and the <i>glories</i> which appear round the heads of <i>Chinese, Hindoo</i>, and <i>Christian saints</i>, real or supposed, were simply intended to signify that they had especial intercourse with God, and that his Spirit, under the emblem of <i>fire</i>, sat upon them and became resident in them. There are numerous proofs of this in several Chinese and Hindoo paintings in my possession; and how frequently this is to be met with in <i>legends, missals</i>, and in the ancient <i>ecclesiastical books</i> of the different Christian nations of Europe, every reader acquainted with ecclesiastical antiquity knows well. See the dedication of Solomon's temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+7:1-3">2 Chronicles 7:1-3</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> heathens had similar notions of the <i>manner</i> in which Divine communications were given: <i>strong wind</i>, loud and repeated <i>peals</i> of <i>thunder, coruscations of lightning</i>, and <i>lambent</i> <i>flames</i> resting on those who were objects of the Deities regard, are all employed by them to point out the <i>mode</i> in which their gods were reported to make their will known to their votaries. Every thing of this kind was probably borrowed from the account given by Moses of the appearance on Mount Sinai; for traditions of this event were carried through almost every part of the habitable world, partly by the expelled <i>Canaanites</i>, partly by the <i>Greek</i> <i>sages</i> travelling through Asiatic countries in quest of philosophic truth: and partly by means of the <i>Greek version</i> of the <i>Septuagint</i>, made nearly three hundred years before the Christian aera.</p>
<p>"A <i>flame of fire</i> seen upon the <i>head</i> of any person was, among the heathens, considered as an <i>omen</i> from their gods that the person was under the peculiar care of a supernatural power, and destined to some extraordinary employment. Many proofs of this occur in the Roman poets and historians. Wetstein, in his note on this place, has made an extensive collection of them. I shall quote but one, which almost every reader of the AEneid of Virgil will recollect: - </p>
<p>It may be just necessary to observe, that <i>tongue of fire</i> may be a Hebraism: for in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:24">Isaiah 5:24</span>, לשון אש leshon esh, which we render simply <i>fire</i>, is literally <i>a tongue of fire</i>, as the margin very properly has it. The Hebrews give the name of <i>tongue</i> to most things which terminate in a blunt point: so a <i>bay</i> is termed in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:2">Joshua 15:2</span>, לשן lashon, a tongue. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:5">Joshua 15:5</span>, what appears to have been a <i>promontory</i> is called לשון הים <i>leshon hayam</i>, a tongue of the sea.</p>
<p><i><b>It sat upon each</b></i> — That is, one of those tongues, like flames, sat upon the head of each disciple; and the <i>continuance</i> of the appearance, which is indicated by the word <i>sat</i>, shows that there could be no illusion in the case. I still think that in all this case the agent was <i>natural</i>, but <i>supernaturally</i> employed.</p>
