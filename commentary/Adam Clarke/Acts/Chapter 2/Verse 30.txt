<p>Verse 30. <i><b>According to the flesh, he would raise up Christ</b></i> â€” This whole clause is wanting in ACD, one of the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Coptic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>; and is variously entered in others. <i>Griesbach</i> rejects it from the text, and Professor <i>White</i> says of the words, "<i>certissime</i> delenda," they should doubtless be expunged. This is a gloss, says <i>Schoettgen</i>, that has crept into the text, which I prove thus:</p>
<p>1. The <i>Syriac</i> and <i>Vulgate</i>, the most ancient of the versions, have not these words.</p>
<p>2. The passage is consistent enough and intelligible without them.</p>
<p>3. They are superfluous, as the mind of the apostle concerning the resurrection of Christ follows immediately in the succeeding verse.</p>
<p>The passage therefore, according to <i>Bp. Pearce</i>, should be read thus: <i>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had</i> <i>sworn with an oath, of the fruit of his loins, to set on his</i> <i>throne; and foreseeing that he</i> (God) <i>would raise up Christ, he</i> <i>spake of the resurrection of Christ</i>, c. "In this transition, the words which Peter quotes for David's are exactly the same with what we read in the psalm above mentioned and the circumstance of David's foreseeing that Christ was to be raised up, and was the person meant, is not represented as a part of the oath; but is only made to be Peter's assertion, that David, as a prophet, did foresee it, and meant it."</p>
