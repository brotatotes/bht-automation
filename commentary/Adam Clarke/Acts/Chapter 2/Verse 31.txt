Verse 31. That his soul was not left in hell — The words η ψυχη αυτου, his soul, are omitted by ABCD, Syriac, Coptic, AEthiopic, and Vulgate. Griesbach has left them out of the text, and Professor White says again, certissime delenda. The passage may be thus read: "He spake of the resurrection of Christ, that he was not left in hades, neither did his flesh see corruption." For the various readings in this and the preceding verse, see Griesbach.
