<p>Verse 31. <i><b>That his soul was not left in hell</b></i> — The words η ψυχη αυτου, <i>his soul</i>, are omitted by ABCD, <i>Syriac, Coptic, AEthiopic</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>. Griesbach has left them out of the text, and Professor White says again, <i>certissime delenda</i>. The passage may be thus read: "He spake of the resurrection of Christ, that he was not left in hades, neither did his flesh see corruption." For the <i>various readings</i> in this and the preceding verse, see <i>Griesbach</i>.</p>
