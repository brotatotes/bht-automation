<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Both Lord and Christ.</b></i> â€” Not only the Messiah, but the supreme Governor of all things and all persons, Jews and Gentiles, angels and men. In the preceding discourse, Peter assumes a fact which none would attempt to deny, viz. that Jesus had been lately crucified by them. He then,</p>
<p>1. Proves his resurrection.</p>
<p>2. His ascension.</p>
<p>3. His exaltation to the right hand of God.</p>
<p>4. The effusion of the Holy Spirit, which was the fruit of his glorification, and which had not only been promised by himself, but foretold by their own prophets: in consequence of which,</p>
<p>5. It was indisputably proved that this same Jesus, whom they had crucified, was the promised Messiah; and if so,</p>
<p>6. The Governor of the universe, from whose power and justice they had every thing to dread, as they refused to receive his proffered mercy and kindness.</p>
