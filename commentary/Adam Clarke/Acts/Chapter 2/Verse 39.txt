<p>Verse 39. <i><b>For the promise is unto you</b></i> — Jews of the land of Judea: not only the fulfilment of the <i>promise</i> which he had lately recited from the prophecy of <i>Joel</i> was made to them, but in this promise was also included the purification from sin, with every gift and grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>To all that are afar off</b></i> — To the Jews wherever <i>dispersed</i>, and to all the <i>Gentile nations</i>; for, though St. Peter had not as yet a formal knowledge of the <i>calling of the Gentiles</i>, yet, the Spirit of God, by which he spoke, had undoubtedly this in view; and therefore the words are added, <i>even as many as the Lord our God</i> <i>shall call</i>, i.e. all to whom, in the course of his providence and grace, he shall send the preaching of Christ crucified.</p>
