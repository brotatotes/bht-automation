<p>Verse 40. <i><b>Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</b></i> — Separate yourselves from them: <i>be ye saved</i>, σωθητε: the power is present with you; make a proper use of it, and ye shall be delivered from their obstinate unbelief, and the punishment that awaits it in the destruction of them and their city by the Romans.</p>
