<p>Verse 42. <i><b>They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine</b></i> — They <i>received</i> it, <i>retained</i> it, and <i>acted</i> on its principles.</p>
<p><i><b>And fellowship</b></i> — κοινωνια, <i>community</i>; meaning <i>association</i> for religious and spiritual purposes, The <i>community of goods</i> cannot be meant; for this is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:44">Acts 2:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:45">Acts 2:45</span>, where it is said, they <i>had all things common</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And in breaking of bread</b></i> — Whether this means the <i>holy eucharist</i>, or their <i>common meals</i>, it is difficult to say. The <i>Syriac</i> understands it of the former. <i>Breaking of bread</i> was that act which preceded a <i>feast</i> or <i>meal</i>, and which was performed by the master of the house, when he pronounced the <i>blessing</i>-what we would call <i>grace before meat</i>. See the form on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And in prayers.</b></i> — In supplications to God for an <i>increase</i> of grace and life in their own souls; for <i>establishment</i> in the truth which they had received, and for the <i>extension</i> of the kingdom of Christ in the salvation of men. Behold the employment of the primitive and apostolic Church.</p>
<p>1. They were builded up on the foundation of the prophets and apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone.</p>
<p>2. They continued steadfastly in that <i>doctrine</i> which they had so evidently received from God.</p>
<p>3. They were <i>separated from the world</i>, and lived in a <i>holy Christian</i> <i>fellowship</i>, strengthening and building up each other in their most holy faith.</p>
<p>4. They were frequent in breaking bread; in remembrance that Jesus Christ died for them.</p>
<p>5. They continued in prayers; knowing that they could be no longer faithful than while they were upheld by their God; and knowing also that they could not expect his grace to support them, unless they humbly and earnestly <i>prayed</i> for its continuance.</p>
