Verse 42. They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine — They received it, retained it, and acted on its principles.And fellowship — κοινωνια, community; meaning association for religious and spiritual purposes, The community of goods cannot be meant; for this is mentioned Acts 2:44; Acts 2:45, where it is said, they had all things common.And in breaking of bread — Whether this means the holy eucharist, or their common meals, it is difficult to say. The Syriac understands it of the former. Breaking of bread was that act which preceded a feast or meal, and which was performed by the master of the house, when he pronounced the blessing-what we would call grace before meat. See the form on Matthew 26:26.And in prayers. — In supplications to God for an increase of grace and life in their own souls; for establishment in the truth which they had received, and for the extension of the kingdom of Christ in the salvation of men. Behold the employment of the primitive and apostolic Church.1. They were builded up on the foundation of the prophets and apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone.2. They continued steadfastly in that doctrine which they had so evidently received from God.3. They were separated from the world, and lived in a holy Christian fellowship, strengthening and building up each other in their most holy faith.4. They were frequent in breaking bread; in remembrance that Jesus Christ died for them.5. They continued in prayers; knowing that they could be no longer faithful than while they were upheld by their God; and knowing also that they could not expect his grace to support them, unless they humbly and earnestly prayed for its continuance.
