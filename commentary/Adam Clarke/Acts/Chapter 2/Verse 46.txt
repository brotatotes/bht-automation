<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span>. <i><b>They, continuing daily with one accord in the temple</b></i> — They were present at all the times of public worship, and joined together in <i>prayers</i> and <i>praises</i> to God; for it in not to be supposed that <i>they</i> continued to offer any of the <i>sacrifices</i> prescribed by the law.</p>
<p><i><b>Breaking bread from house to house</b></i> — This may signify, that select companies, who were contiguous to each other, frequently ate together at their respective lodgings on their return from public worship. But κατ οικον, which we translate <i>from house to</i> <i>house</i>, is repeatedly used by the Greek writers for <i>home, at home</i>, (see <i>margin</i>,) for though they had all things in common, each person lived at his own table. <i>Breaking bread</i> is used to express the act of taking their meals. The bread of the Jews was <i>thin,</i> <i>hard</i>, and <i>dry</i>, and was never <i>cut</i> with the knife as ours is, but was simply broken by the hand.</p>
<p><i><b>With gladness and singleness of heart</b></i> — A true picture of genuine Christian fellowship. <i>They ate their bread</i>: they had no severe <i>fasts</i>; the Holy Spirit had done in their souls, by his refining influence, what others vainly expect from <i>bodily austerities</i>. It may be said also, that, if they had no <i>severe fasts</i>, they had no <i>splendid feasts</i>: all was <i>moderation</i>, and all was contentment. They were full of <i>gladness</i>, spiritual joy and happiness; and <i>singleness of heart</i>, every man worthy of the confidence of his neighbour; and all <i>walking by the same rule</i>, and <i>minding the same</i> thing.</p>
