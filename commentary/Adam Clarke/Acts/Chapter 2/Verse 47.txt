<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:27">Acts 2:27</span>. <i><b>Praising God</b></i> — As the fountain whence they had derived all their spiritual and temporal blessings; seeing him in all things, and magnifying the work of his mercy.</p>
<p><i><b>Having favour with all the people.</b></i> — Every <i>honest, upright</i> Jew would naturally esteem these for the simplicity, purity, and charity of their lives. The scandal of the cross had not yet commenced; for, though they had put Jesus Christ to death, they had not get entered into a systematic opposition to the <i>doctrines</i> he taught.</p>
<p><i><b>And the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved.</b></i> — Though many approved of the life and manners of these primitive Christians, yet they did not become members of this holy Church; God permitting none to be <i>added</i> to it, but τους σωζομενους, <i>those</i> <i>who were saved</i> from their sins and prejudices. The Church of Christ was made up of <i>saints; sinners</i> ware not permitted to incorporate themselves with it.</p>
<p>One MS. and the <i>Armenian</i> version, instead of τους σωζομενους, <i>the saved</i>, have τοις σωζομενοις, <i>to them who were saved</i>; reading the verse thus: <i>And the Lord added daily to those who were saved</i>. He united those who were daily <i>converted</i> under the preaching of the apostles to those who <i>had already been converted</i>. And thus every <i>lost sheep</i> that was <i>found</i> was brought to the <i>flock</i>, that, under the direction of the great Master Shepherd, they might go out and in, and find pasture. The words, <i>to the Church</i>, τη εκκλησια, are omitted by BC, <i>Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>; and several add the words επι το αυτο, <i>at that tine</i>, (which begin the first verse of the next chapter) to the conclusion of this. My old MS. English Bible reads the verse thus: <i>For so the Lord encresed hem that weren maad saaf, eche day, into</i> <i>the same thing</i>. Nearly the same rendering as that in Wiclif. Our translation of τους σωζομενους, <i>such as should be saved</i> is improper and insupportable. The original means simply and solely those who were <i>then saved</i>; those who were redeemed from their sins and baptized into the faith of Jesus Christ. The same as those whom St. Paul addressed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>: <i>By grace ye are saved</i>, εστε σεσωσμενοι; or, <i>ye are those who</i> <i>have been saved by grace</i>. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>: <i>According to his mercy he saved us</i>, εσωσεν ημας, <i>by the washing</i> <i>of regeneration</i>. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span>, we have the words τοις σωζομενοις, <i>them who are saved</i>, to express those who had received the Christian faith; in opposition to τοις απολλυμενοις, <i>to those</i> <i>who are lost</i>, namely the Jews, who obstinately refused to receive salvation on the terms of the Gospel, the only way in which they could be saved; for it was by embracing the Gospel of Christ that they were put in a <i>state of salvation</i>; and, by the grace it imparted, <i>actually saved</i> from the power, guilt, and dominion of sin. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:2">1 Corinthians 15:2</span>: <i>I made known unto you, brethren, the Gospel which I preached</i> <i>unto you, which ye have received, and in which ye stand; and BY</i> <i>WHICH YE ARE SAVED</i>, δι' οὑ και σωζεσθε. Our translation, which indeed existed long before our present authorized version, as may be seen in Cardmarden's Bible, 1566, Beck's Bible, 1549, and Tindall's Testament, printed by Will. Tylle, in 1548, is bad in itself; but it has been rendered worse by the comments put on it, viz. that those whom God adds to the Church shall necessarily and unavoidably be eternally saved; whereas no such thing is hinted by the original text, be the doctrine of the <i>indefectibility of the</i> <i>saints</i> true or false-which shall be examined in its proper place.</p>
<p>ON that awful subject, the <i>foreknowledge</i> of God, something has already been spoken: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>. Though it is a subject which no finite nature can comprehend, yet it is possible so to understand what relates to <i>us</i> in it as to avoid those rocks of <i>presumption</i> and <i>despondency</i> on which multitudes have been shipwrecked. The foreknowledge of God is never spoken of in reference to <i>himself</i>, but in reference to <i>us</i>: in him properly there is neither <i>foreknowledge</i> nor <i>afterknowledge</i>. Omniscience, or the <i>power to</i> <i>know all things</i>, is an attribute of God, and exists in him as <i>omnipotence</i>, or the power to do all things. He can do whatsoever he will; and he does whatsoever is fit or proper to be done. God cannot have <i>foreknowledge</i>, strictly speaking, because this would suppose that there was something <i>coming</i>, in what we call <i>futurity</i>, which had not yet <i>arrived</i> at the <i>presence of the Deity</i>. Neither can he have any <i>afterknowledge</i>, strictly speaking, for this would suppose that something that <i>had taken</i> place, in what we call <i>pretereity</i>, or <i>past time</i>, had now got <i>beyond</i> the <i>presence of</i> <i>the Deity</i>. As God exists in all that can be called <i>eternity</i>, so he is <i>equally</i> every where: nothing can be <i>future</i> to him, because he lives in all <i>futurity</i>; nothing can be <i>past</i> to him, because he equally exists in all <i>past time</i>; futurity and pretereity are relative terms to us; but they can have no relation to that God who dwells in every point of eternity; with whom all that is <i>past</i>, and all that is <i>present</i>, and all that is <i>future</i> to man, exists in one infinite, indivisible, and eternal NOW. As God's omnipotence implies his <i>power to do all things</i>, so God's <i>omniscience</i> implies his <i>power to know all things</i>; but we must take heed that we meddle not with the infinite <i>free agency</i> of this Eternal Being. Though God <i>can</i> do all thinks, he <i>does</i> not all things. Infinite judgment directs the operations of his power, so that though he <i>can</i>, yet he <i>does not</i> do all things, but only such things as are proper to be done. In what is called illimitable space, he <i>can</i> make millions of millions of systems; but he does not see proper to do this. He <i>can</i> destroy the solar system, but he <i>does</i> not <i>do</i> it: he can fashion and order, in endless variety, all the different beings which now exist, whether material, animal, or intellectual; but he does not do this, because he does not see it <i>proper</i> to be done. Therefore it does not follow that, because God <i>can do all things</i>, therefore he <i>must do all things</i>. God is omniscient, and <i>can know</i> all things; but does it follow from this that he must <i>know all things</i>? Is he not as <i>free</i> in the <i>volitions</i> of his <i>wisdom</i>, as he is in the <i>volitions</i> of his <i>power</i>? The contingent as absolute, or the absolute as contingent? God has ordained some things as <i>absolutely</i> <i>certain</i>; these he knows as <i>absolutely certain</i>. He has ordained other things as <i>contingent</i>; these he knows as <i>contingent</i>. It would be absurd to say that he foreknows a thing as only <i>contingent</i> which he has made <i>absolutely certain</i>. And it would be as absurd to say that he foreknows a thing to be <i>absolutely certain</i> which in his own eternal counsel he has made <i>contingent</i>. By <i>absolutely</i> <i>certain</i>, I mean a thing which <i>must</i> be, in that <i>order, time, place,</i> and <i>form</i> in which Divine wisdom has ordained it to be; and that it can be no <i>otherwise</i> than this infinite counsel has ordained. By <i>contingent</i>, I mean such things as the infinite wisdom of God has thought proper to poise on the <i>possibility</i> of <i>being</i> or <i>not being</i>, leaving it to the will of intelligent beings to turn the scale. Or, contingencies are such possibilities, amid the succession of events, as the infinite wisdom of God has left to the will of intelligent beings to determine whether any such event shall take place or not. To deny this would involve the most palpable contradictions, and the most monstrous absurdities. If there be no such things as <i>contingencies</i> in the world, then every thing is <i>fixed</i> and <i>determined</i> by an unalterable decree and purpose of God; and not only all <i>free agency</i> is destroyed, but all <i>agency</i> of <i>every kind</i>, except that of the Creator himself; for on this ground God is the <i>only operator</i>, either in time or eternity: all created beings are only <i>instruments</i>, and do nothing but as impelled and acted upon by this almighty and sole Agent. Consequently, every act is <i>his own</i>; for if he have purposed them all as <i>absolutely certain</i>, having nothing <i>contingent</i> in them, then he has <i>ordained them to be so</i>; and if no <i>contingency</i>, then no <i>free</i> <i>agency</i>, and God alone is the sole actor. Hence the <i>blasphemous</i>, though, from the premises, <i>fair</i> conclusion, that God is the author of all the evil and sin that are in the world; and hence follows that absurdity, that, as God can do nothing that is <i>wrong</i>, WHATEVER IS, <i>is</i> RIGHT. Sin is no more sin; a vicious human action is no crime, if God have <i>decreed it</i>, and by his foreknowledge and will impelled the creature to act it. On this ground there can be no <i>punishment</i> for delinquencies; for if every thing be done as God has <i>predetermined</i>, and his determinations must necessarily be all <i>right</i>, then neither the <i>instrument</i> nor the <i>agent</i> has done <i>wrong</i>. Thus all vice and virtue, praise and blame, merit and demerit, guilt and innocence, are at once <i>confounded</i>, and all distinctions of this kind confounded with them. Now, allowing the doctrine of the contingency of human actions, (and it must be allowed in order to shun the above absurdities and blasphemies,) then we see every intelligent creature accountable for its own works, and for the use it makes of the power with which God has endued it; and, to grant all this consistently, we must also grant that God foresees nothing as <i>absolutely</i> and <i>inevitably certain</i> which he has made <i>contingent</i>; and, because he has designed it to be <i>contingent</i>, therefore he cannot know it as <i>absolutely</i> and <i>inevitably certain</i>. I conclude that God, although omniscient, is not obliged, in consequence of this, <i>to know all that he can know</i>; no more than he is obliged, because he is <i>omnipotent</i>, to <i>do all</i> <i>that he can do</i>.</p>
<p>How many, by confounding the self and free agency of God with a sort of continual impulsive necessity, have raised that necessity into an <i>all-commanding</i> and <i>overruling energy</i>, to which God himself is made subject! Very properly did Milton set his damned spirits about such work as this, and has made it a part of their endless punishment: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Their <i>freedom</i>; they themselves <i>ordained their fall</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Ibid, b. iii. l. 98, 103, 120.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>I shall conclude these observations with a short extract from Mr. Bird's Conferences, where, in answer to the objection, "If many things fall out <i>contingently</i>, or as it were by <i>accident</i>, God's <i>foreknowledge</i> of them can be but <i>contingent</i>, dependent on <i>man's free will</i>," he observes: "It is one thing to know that a thing will be done necessarily; and another, to know necessarily that a thing will be done. God doth necessarily foreknow all that will be done; but he doth not know that those things which shall be done voluntarily will be done necessarily: he knoweth that they will be done; but he knoweth withal that they might have fallen out otherwise, for aught he had ordered to the contrary. So likewise God knew that Adam would fall; and get he knew that he would not fall necessarily, for it was possible for him not to have fallen. And as touching God's preordination going before his prescience as the cause of all events this would be to make God the author of all the sin in the world; his knowledge comprehending that as well as other things. God indeed foreknoweth all things, because they will be done; but things are not (therefore) done, because he foreknoweth them. It is impossible that any man, by his voluntary manner of working, should elude God's foresight; but then this foresight doth not necessitate the will, for this were to take it wholly away. For as the knowledge of things present imports no necessity on that which is done, so the foreknowledge of things future lays no necessity on that which shall be; because whosoever knows and sees things, he knows and sees them as they are, and not as they are not; so that God's knowledge doth not confound things, but reaches to all events, not only which come to pass, but as they come to pass, whether contingency or necessarily. As, for example, when you see a man walking upon the earth, and at the very same instant the sun shining in the heavens, do you not see the first as voluntary, and the second as natural? And though at the instant you see both done, there is a necessity that they be done, (or else you could not see them at all,) yet there was a necessity of one only before they were done, (namely, the sun's shining in the heavens,) but none at all of the other, (viz. the man's walking upon the earth.) The sun could not but shine, as being a natural agent; the man might not have walked, as being a voluntary one." This is a good argument; but I prefer that which states the knowledge of God to be absolutely <i>free</i>, without the <i>contradictions</i> which are mentioned above. "But you deny the omniscience of God."-No, no more than I deny his omnipotence, and you know I do not, though you have asserted the contrary. But take heed how you speak about this infinitely free agent: if you will <i>contradict</i>, take heed that you do not <i>blaspheme</i>. I ask some simple questions on the subject of God's <i>knowledge</i> and <i>power</i>: if you know these things better than your neighbour, be <i>thankful</i>, be <i>humble</i>, and pray to God to give you amiable tempers; for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. May he be merciful to thee and me!</p>
