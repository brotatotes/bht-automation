<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:5">Acts 2:5</span>. <i><b>Devout men, out of every nation</b></i> — Either by these we are simply to understand <i>Jews</i> who were born in different countries, and had now come up to Jerusalem to be present at the passover, and for purposes of traffic, or <i>proselytes</i> to Judaism, who had come up for the same purpose: for I cannot suppose that the term ανδρες ευλαβεις, <i>devout men</i>, can be applied to any other. At this time there was scarcely a commercial <i>nation under heaven</i> where the Jews had not been scattered for the purpose of trade, merchandize, &amp;c., and from all these nations, it is said, there were persons now present at Jerusalem.</p>
