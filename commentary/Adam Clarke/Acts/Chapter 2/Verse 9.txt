<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>. <i><b>Parthians</b></i> — Parthia anciently included the northern part of modern <i>Persia</i>: it was situated between the <i>Caspian Sea</i> and <i>Persian Gulf</i>, rather to the eastward of both.</p>
<p><i><b>Medes</b></i> — Media was a country lying in the vicinity of the <i>Caspian</i> <i>Sea</i>; having <i>Parthia</i> on the east, <i>Assyria</i> on the south, and <i>Mesopotamia</i> on the west.</p>
<p><i><b>Elamites</b></i> — Probably inhabitants of that country now called Persia: both the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Elamites</i> were a neighbouring people, dwelling beyond the <i>Tigris</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Mesopotamia</b></i> — Now <i>Diarbec</i> in Asiatic Turkey; situated between the rivers <i>Tigris</i> and <i>Euphrates</i>; having <i>Assyria</i> on the east, <i>Arabia</i> <i>Deserta</i> with <i>Babylonia</i> on the south, <i>Syria</i> on the west, and <i>Armenia</i> on the north. It was called <i>Padan-aram</i> by the ancient Hebrews, and by the Asiatics is now called <i>Maverannhar</i>, i.e. the country beyond the river.</p>
<p><i><b>Judea</b></i> — This word has exceedingly puzzled commentators and critics; and most suspect that it is not the true reading. Bishop Pearce supposes that ιουδαιαν is an adjective, agreeing with μεσοποταμιαν, and translates the passage thus: <i>the dwellers in</i> <i>Jewish Mesopotamia</i>. He vindicates this translation by showing that great numbers of the Jews were settled in this country: Josephus says that the <i>ten tribes</i> remained in this country till his time; that "there were countless myriads of them there, and that it was impossible to know their numbers." - Μυριαδες απειροι, και αριθμῳ γνωσθηναι μη δυναμεναι. See Ant. lib. xv. c. 2, s. 2, and c. 3, s. 1; Bell. Jud. lib. i. c. 1, 2. This interpretation, however ingenious, does not comport with the present Greek text. Some imagine that ιουδαιαν is not the original reading; and therefore they have corrected it into <i>Syriam</i>, SYRIA; <i>Armeniam</i>, ARMENIA; ινδιαν, INDIA; λυδιαν, LYDIA; ιδουμαιαν, IDUMEA; βιθυνιαν, BITHYNIA; and κιλικιαν, CILICIA: all these stand on very slender authority, as may be seen in Griesbach; and the last is a mere <i>conjecture</i> of Dr. Mangey. If <i>Judea</i> be still considered the genuine reading, we may account for it thus: the men who were speaking were known to be <i>Galileans</i>; now the Galilean dialect was certainly different from that spoken in Judea-the surprise was occasioned by a Jew being able to comprehend the speech of a Galilean, without any interpreter and without difficulty; and yet it is not easy to suppose that there was such a difference between the two dialects as to render these people wholly unintelligible to each other.</p>
<p><i><b>CAPPADOCIA</b></i> — Was an ancient kingdom of Asia comprehending all that country that lies between Mount Taurus and the Euxine Sea.</p>
<p><i><b>PONTUS</b></i> — Was anciently a very powerful kingdom of Asia, originally a part of <i>Cappadocia</i>; bounded on the east by <i>Colchis</i>; on the <i>west</i> by the river <i>Halys</i>; on the <i>north</i> by the <i>Black Sea;</i> and on the <i>south</i> by <i>Armenia Minor</i>. The famous <i>Mithridates</i> was king of this country; and it was one of the last which the Romans were able to subjugate.</p>
<p><i><b>ASIA</b></i> — Meaning probably <i>Asia Minor</i>; it was that part of Turkey in Asia now called <i>Natolia</i>.</p>
