Verse Acts 20:10. And Paul - fell on him — επεπεσεν αυτω, Stretched himself upon him, in the same manner as Elisha did on the Shunammite's son, 2 Kings 4:33-35; though the action of lying on him, in order to communicate warmth to the flesh, might not have been continued so long as in the above instance; nor indeed was it necessary, as the natural warmth had not yet left the body of Eutychus; but the son of the Shunammite had been some time dead.
