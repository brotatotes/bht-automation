<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:10">Acts 20:10</span>. <i><b>And Paul - fell on him</b></i> — επεπεσεν αυτω, Stretched himself upon him, in the same manner as Elisha did on the Shunammite's son, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:33-35">2 Kings 4:33-35</span>; though the action of lying on him, in order to communicate <i>warmth</i> to the flesh, might not have been continued so long as in the above instance; nor indeed was it necessary, as the natural warmth had not yet left the body of Eutychus; but the son of the Shunammite had been some time dead.</p>
