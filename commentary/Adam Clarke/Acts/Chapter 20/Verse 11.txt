Verse Acts 20:11. Had broken bread — Had taken some refreshment, in order to their journey.And talked a long while — ομιλησας, Having familiarly conversed, for this is the import of the word, which is very different from the διελεγετο, of the seventh verse, and the διαλεγομενου, of the ninth; which imply solemn, grave discourse.
