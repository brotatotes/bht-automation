<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:11">Acts 20:11</span>. <i><b>Had broken bread</b></i> — Had taken some refreshment, in order to their journey.</p>
<p><i><b>And talked a long while</b></i> — ομιλησας, Having <i>familiarly conversed</i>, for this is the import of the word, which is very different from the διελεγετο, of the <i>seventh</i> verse, and the διαλεγομενου, of the <i>ninth</i>; which imply solemn, grave discourse.</p>
