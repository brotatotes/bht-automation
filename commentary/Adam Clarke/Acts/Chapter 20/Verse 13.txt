Verse Acts 20:13. Sailed unto Assos — Assos, according to Pausanias, Eliac. ii. 4, and Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxxvi. 27, was a maritime town of Asia, in the Troad. Strabo and Stephanus place it in Mysia. It was also called Apollonia, according to Pliny, Ib. lib. v. 30. The passage by sea to this place was much longer than by land; and therefore St. Paul chose to go by land, while the others went by sea.Intending to take in Paul — αναλαμβανειν, To take him in AGAIN; for it appears he had already been aboard that same vessel: probably the same that had carried them from Philippi to Troas, Acts 20:6.
