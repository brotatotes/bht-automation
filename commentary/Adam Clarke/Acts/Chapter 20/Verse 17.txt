<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>. <i><b>He sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Church.</b></i> — These are called επισκοποι, <i>bishops</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>. By the πρεσβυτεροι, <i>presbyters</i> or <i>elders</i>, here, we are to understand all that were in <i>authority</i> in the Church, whether they were επισκοποι, <i>bishops</i> or <i>overseers</i>, or <i>seniors</i> in <i>years,</i> <i>knowledge</i>, and <i>experience</i>. The πρεσβυτεροι, or <i>elders</i>, were probably the first order in the Church; an order which was not so properly constituted, but which rose out of the state of things. From these <i>presbuteroi</i> the <i>episcopoi</i>, overseers or superintendents, were selected. Those who were <i>eldest</i> in years, Christian knowledge, and experience, would naturally be preferred to all others, as overseers of the Church of Christ. From the Greek word πρεσβυτερος, comes the Latin <i>presbyterus</i>, the English <i>presbyter</i>, the French <i>prestre</i>, and our own term <i>priest</i>; and all, when traced up to their original, signify merely an <i>elderly</i> or <i>aged</i> person; though it soon became the name of an <i>office</i>, rather than of a <i>state</i> of <i>years</i>. Now, as these elders are called επισκοποι, <i>bishops</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>, we may take it for granted that they were the same <i>order</i>; or, rather, that these superintendents of the Church were indifferently called either <i>presbyters</i> or <i>bishops</i>.</p>
<p>As he had not time to call at Ephesus, he thought it best to have a general convocation of the heads of that Church, to meet him at Miletus, that he might give them the instructions mentioned in the succeeding parts of this chapter.</p>
