Verse Acts 20:17. He sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the Church. — These are called επισκοποι, bishops, Acts 20:28. By the πρεσβυτεροι, presbyters or elders, here, we are to understand all that were in authority in the Church, whether they were επισκοποι, bishops or overseers, or seniors in years, knowledge, and experience. The πρεσβυτεροι, or elders, were probably the first order in the Church; an order which was not so properly constituted, but which rose out of the state of things. From these presbuteroi the episcopoi, overseers or superintendents, were selected. Those who were eldest in years, Christian knowledge, and experience, would naturally be preferred to all others, as overseers of the Church of Christ. From the Greek word πρεσβυτερος, comes the Latin presbyterus, the English presbyter, the French prestre, and our own term priest; and all, when traced up to their original, signify merely an elderly or aged person; though it soon became the name of an office, rather than of a state of years. Now, as these elders are called επισκοποι, bishops, in Acts 20:28, we may take it for granted that they were the same order; or, rather, that these superintendents of the Church were indifferently called either presbyters or bishops.As he had not time to call at Ephesus, he thought it best to have a general convocation of the heads of that Church, to meet him at Miletus, that he might give them the instructions mentioned in the succeeding parts of this chapter.
