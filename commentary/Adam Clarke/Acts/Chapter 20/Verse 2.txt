<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2">Acts 20:2</span>. <i><b>He came into Greece</b></i> — εις την ελλαδα, Into <i>Hellas</i>, Greece properly so called, the regions between Thessaly and Propontis, and the country of Achaia. He did not, however, go there immediately: he passed through Macedonia, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:1">Acts 20:1</span>, in which he informs us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:5-7">2 Corinthians 7:5-7</span>, that he suffered much, both from <i>believers</i> and <i>infidels</i>; but was greatly <i>comforted</i> by the <i>arrival of Titus</i>, who gave him a very flattering account of the prosperous state of the Church at Corinth. A short time after this, being still in Macedonia, he sent Titus back to Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:16-17">2 Corinthians 8:16-17</span>, and sent by him the <i>second epistle</i> which he wrote to that Church, as Theodoret and others suppose. Some time after, he visited Corinth himself, according to his promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>. This was his <i>third</i> voyage to that city, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>. What he did there at this time cannot be distinctly known; but, according to St. Augustin, he ordered every thing relative to the holy eucharist, and the proper manner in which it was to be received.
