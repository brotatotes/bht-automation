<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span>. <i><b>I kept back nothing</b></i> â€” Notwithstanding the dangers to which he was exposed, and the temptations he must have had to suppress those truths that were less acceptable to the unrenewed nature of man, or to the particular prejudices of the <i>Jews</i> and the <i>Gentiles</i>, he fully and faithfully, at all hazards, declared what he terms, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:27">Acts 20:27</span>, <i>the whole counsel of God</i>. "Behold here," says the judicious and pious Calmet, "the model of a good shepherd-full of doctrine and zeal: he communicates with profusion, and yet with discretion, without jealousy and without fear, what God had put in his heart, and what charity inspires. A good shepherd, says St. Bernard, should always have abundance of bread in his <i>scrip</i>, and his <i>dog</i> under command. His <i>dog</i> is his <i>zeal</i>, which he must <i>lead, order</i>, and <i>moderate</i>; his <i>scrip</i> full of bread is his <i>mind</i> full of useful knowledge; and he should ever be in readiness to give nourishment to his flock." He who will quarrel with this sentiment, because of the <i>uncouthness</i> of the simile, needs pity, and deserves censure.</p>
