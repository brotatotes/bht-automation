<p><i><b>Repentance toward God</b></i>, c.] As all had sinned against God, so all should humble themselves before him against whom they have sinned but <i>humiliation</i> is no <i>atonement</i> for sin; therefore <i>repentance</i> is insufficient, unless <i>faith</i> in our Lord Jesus Christ accompany it. <i>Repentance</i> disposes and prepares the soul for <i>pardoning mercy</i>; but can never be considered as making compensation for past acts of transgression. This <i>repentance</i> and <i>faith</i> were necessary to the salvation both of <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>; for all had sinned, and come short of God's glory. The <i>Jews</i> must repent, who had sinned so much, and so long, against light and knowledge. The <i>Gentiles</i> must repent, whose scandalous lives were a reproach to man. <i>Faith</i> in Jesus Christ was also indispensably necessary; for a <i>Jew</i> might repent, be sorry for his sin, and suppose that, by a proper discharge of his religious duty, and bringing proper sacrifices, he could conciliate the favour of God: No, this will not do; nothing but <i>faith in Jesus Christ</i>, as the end of the law, and the great and only vicarious sacrifice, will do; hence he testified to them the necessity of faith in this Messiah. The <i>Gentiles</i> might repent of their profligate lives, turn to the true God, and renounce all idolatry: this is well, but it is not sufficient: they also have sinned, and their present amendment and faith can make no atonement for what is past; therefore, they also must believe on the Lord Jesus, who died for their sins, and rose again for their justification.</p>
