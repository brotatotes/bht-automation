<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:22">Acts 20:22</span>. <i><b>I go bound in the spirit</b></i> — Δεδεμενος τῳ πνευματι - Either meaning the <i>strong influence</i> of the <i>Divine Spirit</i> upon his mind, or the <i>strong propensity</i> in his own <i>will, wish</i>, and <i>desire</i>, to visit Jerusalem; and in this sense δεειν, <i>to bind</i>, is sometimes used. But it appears more consistent with the mind of the apostle, and with that influence under which we find that he constantly acted, to refer it to the influence of the Holy Ghost; ὑπο του πνευματος, being <i>under the power of that Spirit</i>; as if he had said: "I have now no choice - God has not left me either to the advices of friends, or to my own prudence: the Spirit of God <i>obliges</i> me to go to Jerusalem, and yet does not intimate to me what peculiar trials shall befall me there: I have only the general intimation that, in every city where I proclaim the Gospel, bonds and afflictions await me." This sense of the word <i>Kypke</i> has largely defended in his note here.</p>
