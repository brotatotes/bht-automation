Verse Acts 20:24. None of these things move me — Ουδενος λογον ποιουμαι; I consider them as nothing; I value them not a straw; they weigh not with me.Neither count I my life dear — I am not my own; my life and being are the Lord's; he requires me to employ them in his service; I act under his direction, and am not anxious about the issue.Finish my course with joy — Τον δρομον μου, My ministerial function. We have already met with this word in application to the same subject, Acts 13:25, where see the note. And the apostle here adds, by way of explanation, και την διακονιαν, even that ministry which I have received of the Lord. The words μετα χαρας, with joy, are omitted by ABD, some others; the Syriac, Erpen, Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Vulgate, and some of the fathers. If we consider them as genuine they may imply thus much: that the apostle wished to fulfil his ministry in such a way as might meet with the Divine approbation; for nothing could give him joy that did not please and glorify God.To testify — Διαμαρτυρασθαι, Earnestly, solemnly, and strenuously to assert, vindicate, and prove the Gospel of the grace of God, not only to be in itself what it professes to be, but to be also the power of God for salvation to every one that believes.
