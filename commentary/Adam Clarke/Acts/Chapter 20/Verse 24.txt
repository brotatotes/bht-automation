<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>. <i><b>None of these things move me</b></i> — Ουδενος λογον ποιουμαι; I consider them as nothing; I value them not a straw; they weigh not with me.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither count I my life dear</b></i> — I am not my own; my life and being are the Lord's; he requires me to employ them in his service; I act under his direction, and am not anxious about the issue.</p>
<p><i><b>Finish my course with joy</b></i> — Τον δρομον μου, <i>My ministerial</i> <i>function</i>. We have already met with this word in application to the same subject, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:25">Acts 13:25</span>, where see the note. And the apostle here adds, by way of explanation, και την διακονιαν, <i>even that ministry</i> which I have received of the Lord. The words μετα χαρας, <i>with joy</i>, are omitted by ABD, some others; the <i>Syriac, Erpen, Coptic,</i> <i>Sahidic, AEthiopic, Vulgate</i>, and some of the <i>fathers</i>. If we consider them as genuine they may imply thus much: that the apostle wished to fulfil his ministry in such a way as might meet with the Divine approbation; for nothing could give him <i>joy</i> that did not <i>please</i> and <i>glorify God</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To testify</b></i> — Διαμαρτυρασθαι, <i>Earnestly, solemnly</i>, and <i>strenuously</i> to <i>assert, vindicate</i>, and <i>prove the Gospel of the</i> <i>grace of God</i>, not only to be in <i>itself</i> what it professes to be, but to be also the power of God for salvation to every one that believes.</p>
