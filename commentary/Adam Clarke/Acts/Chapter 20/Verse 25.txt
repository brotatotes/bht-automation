<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:25">Acts 20:25</span>. <i><b>Ye all - shall see my face no more.</b></i> â€” This probably refers simply to the <i>persons who were now present</i>; concerning whom he might have had a Divine intimation, that they should not be found in life when he should come that way again. Or it may refer only to <i>Ephesus</i> and <i>Miletus</i>. From the dangers to which he was exposed, it was, humanly speaking, unlikely that he should <i>ever</i> return; and this may be all that is implied: but that he did revisit those parts, though probably not Miletus or Ephesus, appears likely from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:25-27">Philippians 1:25-27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:24">Philippians 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:22">Philemon 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:19-23">Hebrews 13:19-23</span>. But in all these places he speaks with a measure of uncertainty: he had not an absolute evidence that he should <i>not</i> return; but, in his own mind, it was a matter of <i>uncertainty</i>. The Holy Spirit did not think proper to give him a direct revelation on this point.</p>
