<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:26">Acts 20:26</span>. <i><b>I</b></i><b> am </b><i><b>pure from the blood of all</b></i> â€” If any man, <i>Jew</i> or <i>Gentile</i>, perish in his sins, his blood shall be upon him; he, alone, shall be accessary to his own perdition. I am blameless, because I have fully shown to both the way to escape from every evil.</p>
