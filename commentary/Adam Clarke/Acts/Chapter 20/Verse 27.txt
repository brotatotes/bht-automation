Verse Acts 20:27. I have not shunned to declare — ου υπεστιλαμην, I have not suppressed or concealed any thing, through fear or favour, that might be beneficial to your souls. This is properly the meaning of the original word. Acts 20:20.All the counsel of God. — All that God has determined and revealed concerning the salvation of man-the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, with repentance towards God, and faith in Jesus as the Messiah and great atoning Priest. In Isaiah 9:6, Jesus Christ is called the wonderful counsellor, פלא יועץ Pele Poets, which the Septuagint translate μεγαλης βουλης αγγελος The messenger of the great counsel. To this the apostle may have referred, as we well know that this version was constantly under his eye. Declaring therefore to them the whole counsel of God, πασηντην βουληντουθεου, the whole of that counsel or design of God, was, in effect, declaring the whole that concerned the Lord Jesus, who was the messenger of this counsel.
