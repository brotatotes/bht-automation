<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>. <i><b>Made you overseers</b></i> — εθετο επισκοπους, <i>Appointed you</i> <i>bishops</i>; for so we translate the original word in most places where it occurs: but <i>overseers</i>, or <i>inspectors</i>, is much more proper, from επι, <i>over</i>, and σκεπτομαι, <i>I look</i>. The persons who examine into the spiritual state of the flock of God, and take care to lead them in and out, and to find them pasture, are termed <i>episcopoi</i>, or <i>superintendents</i>. The office of a <i>bishop</i> is from God; a true pastor only can fulfil this office: it is an office of most awful responsibility; few there are who <i>can</i> fill it; and, of those who occupy this high and awful place, perhaps we may say there are <i>fewer</i> still who discharge the <i>duties</i> of it. There are, however, through the good <i>providence</i> of God, Christian bishops, who, while they are honoured by the calling, do credit to the sacred function. And the annals of our Church can boast of at least as many of this class of men, who have served their God and their generation, as of any other order, in the proportion which this order bears to others in the Church of Christ. That <i>bishop</i> and <i>presbyter</i>, or <i>elder</i>, were at this time of the same order, and that the word was indifferently used of both, see noticed on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Feed the Church of God</b></i> — This verse has been the subject of much controversy, particularly in reference to the term Θεου, <i>of GOD</i>, in this place; and concerning it there is great dissension among the MSS. and versions. Three readings exist in them, in reference to which critics and commentators have been much divided; viz. εκκλησιαν του Θεου, <i>the Church of GOD</i>; τουκυριου, <i>of the</i> <i>LORD</i>; Κυριου και Θεου, <i>of the LORD and GOD</i>. From the collections of <i>Wetstein</i> and <i>Griesbach</i>, it appears that but <i>few</i> MSS., and none of them very <i>ancient</i>, have the word Θεου, <i>of GOD</i>; with these only the <i>Vulgate</i>, and the later <i>Syriac</i> in the text, agree. κυριου, <i>of the LORD</i>, is the reading of ACDE, several others, the <i>Sahidic, Coptic</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, <i>Armenian, AEthiopia</i>, and some of the <i>fathers</i>. Κυριου και Θεου, <i>of the LORD and of GOD</i>, is the reading of the <i>great majority</i>; though the <i>most ancient</i> are for Κυριου, <i>of the LORD</i>: on this ground <i>Griesbach</i> has admitted this reading into the text, and put Κυριου και Θεου in the <i>margin</i>, as being next in authority.</p>
<p>Mr. Wakefield, who was a professed and conscientious Unitarian, decides for του Θεου, <i>of GOD</i>, as the <i>true reading</i>; but, instead of translating του ιδιου αιματος, <i>with his own blood</i>, he translates, <i>by his own Son</i>, and brings some passages from the Greek and Roman writers to show that αιμα and <i>sanguis</i> are used to signify <i>son</i>, or near <i>relative</i>; and, were this the only place where <i>purchasing with his own blood</i> occurred, we might receive this saying; but, as the redemption of man is, throughout the New Testament, attributed to the <i>sacrificial death of Christ</i>, it is not likely that this very <i>unusual</i> meaning should apply here. At all events, we have here a proof that the Church was purchased by the blood of Christ; and, as to his <i>Godhead</i>, it is sufficiently established in many other places. When we grant that the greater evidence appears to be in favour of του Κυριου, <i>feed the Church of</i> <i>the Lord, which he has purchased with his own blood</i>, we must maintain that, had not this <i>Lord</i> been GOD, his blood could have been no purchase for the souls of a lost world.</p>
