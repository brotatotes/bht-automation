<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span>. <i><b>Abode three months</b></i> — Partly, as we may suppose, at Corinth, at Athens, and in Achaia; from which place he is supposed to have sent his epistle to the <i>Romans</i>, because he continued longer here than at any other place, and mentions several of the <i>Corinthians</i> in his salutations to the believers of Rome.</p>
<p><i><b>When the Jesus laid wait for him</b></i> — Paul had determined to go by sea to Syria, and from thence to Jerusalem. This was the first object of his journey; and this was the readiest road he could take; but, hearing that the Jews had <i>laid wait</i> for him, probably to attack his ship on the voyage, seize his person, sell him for a slave, and take the money which he was carrying to the <i>poor saints</i> at Jerusalem, he resolved to go as much of the journey as he conveniently could, by land. Therefore, he returned through Macedonia, and from thence to Troas, where he embarked to sail for Syria, on his way to Jerusalem. The whole of his journey is detailed in this and the following chapter. See also the <i>map</i>.</p>
