<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Also of your own selves</b></i>, c.] From out of your own assembly <i>shall men arise, speaking perverse things</i>, teaching for truth what is erroneous in itself, and perversive of the genuine doctrine of Christ crucified.</p>
<p><i><b>To draw away disciples</b></i> â€” To make <i>schisms</i> or <i>rents</i> in the Church, in order to get a <i>party</i> to <i>themselves</i>. See, here, the cause of divisions in the Church:</p>
<p>1. The superintendents lose the life of God, neglect the souls of the people, become greedy of gain, and, by secular extortions, oppress the people.</p>
<p>2. The members of the Church, thus neglected, oppressed, and irritated, get their minds alienated from their rapacious pastors.</p>
<p>3. Men of sinister views take advantage of this state of distraction, foment discord, preach up the necessity of <i>division</i>, and thus the people become <i>separated</i> from the great body, and associate with those who profess to care for their souls, and who disclaim all secular views.</p>
<p>In this state of distraction, it is a high proof of God's love to his heritage, if one be found who, possessing the <i>true</i> <i>apostolic doctrine</i> and <i>spirit</i>, rises up to call men back to the primitive truth, and restore the primitive discipline. How soon the <i>grievous wolves</i> and <i>perverse teachers</i> arose in the Churches of Asia Minor, the first chapters of the Apocalypse inform us. The <i>Nicolaitans</i> had nearly ruined the Church of <i>Ephesus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:2">Revelation 1:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>. The same sect, with other false teachers, infested the Church of <i>Pergamos</i>, and preached there the doctrine of <i>Balaam</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14-15">Revelation 2:14-15</span>. A false prophetess seduced the Church of <i>Thyatira</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>. All these Churches were in Asia Minor, and probably bishops or ministers from each were present at this convocation.</p>
