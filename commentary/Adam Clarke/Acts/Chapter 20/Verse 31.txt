Verse 31. Therefore watch, and remember — The only way to abide in the truth is to watch against evil, and for good; and to keep in mind the heavenly doctrines originally received. Unwatchfulness and forgetfulness are two grand inlets to apostasy.By the space of three years — τριετιαν. The Greek word here does not necessarily mean three whole years: it may be months more or less. In Acts 19:8; Acts 19:10, we have an account of his spending two years and three months among them; probably this is all that is intended. One MS., perceiving that the time of three years was not completed, inserts διετιαν, the space of two years.
