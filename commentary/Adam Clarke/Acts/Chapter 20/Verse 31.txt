<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Therefore watch, and remember</b></i> — The only way to abide in the truth is to <i>watch</i> against evil, and for good; and to <i>keep</i> <i>in mind</i> the heavenly doctrines originally received. <i>Unwatchfulness</i> and <i>forgetfulness</i> are two grand inlets to apostasy.</p>
<p><i><b>By the space of three years</b></i> — τριετιαν. The Greek word here does not necessarily mean three <i>whole</i> years: it may be months more or less. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:8">Acts 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:10">Acts 19:10</span>, we have an account of his spending <i>two years and three months</i> among them; probably this is all that is intended. One MS., perceiving that the time of <i>three years</i> was not completed, inserts διετιαν, <i>the space of two years</i>.</p>
