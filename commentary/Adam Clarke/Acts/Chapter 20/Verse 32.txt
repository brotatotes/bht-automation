<p>Verse 32. <i><b>I commend you to God</b></i> — Instead of τῳ Θεῳ, <i>to GOD</i>, several MSS. have τῳ Κυριῳ, <i>to the LORD</i>; neither reading makes any difference in the sense.</p>
<p><i><b>And to the word of his grace</b></i> — The doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is able to build you up</b></i> — The <i>foundation</i> is Jesus Christ; God is the great <i>master-builder</i>; the <i>doctrine of his grace</i>, or <i>mercy</i>, points out the <i>order</i> and <i>manner</i>, as well as the <i>extent,</i> c., of this building. Let us observe the order of these things:</p>
<p>1. The soul of man, which was formerly the <i>habitation</i> of God, is now in a state of ruin.</p>
<p>2. The <i>ruins</i> of this soul must be repaired, that it may again become a <i>habitation of God through the</i> <i>Spirit</i>.</p>
<p>3. Jesus Christ is the only <i>foundation</i> on which this house can be <i>rebuilded</i>.</p>
<p>4. The <i>doctrine of God's grace</i> is the <i>model</i>, or <i>plan</i>, according to which the building can be raised.</p>
<p>5. When re-edified, each is to be a lively temple of the Lord, made <i>inwardly pure</i> and <i>outwardly righteous</i>, and thus prepared for a state of bliss.</p>
<p>6. Being made <i>children of God</i>, by faith in Christ Jesus, and <i>sanctified</i> by his Spirit, they have a right to the heavenly <i>inheritance</i> for only the children of the family can possess the celestial estate.</p>
<p>Thus we find they must be saved by grace, and be made thereby children of God; be <i>sanctified</i> by his Spirit; and, then, being prepared for, they are removed, in due time, into the heavenly inheritance.</p>
