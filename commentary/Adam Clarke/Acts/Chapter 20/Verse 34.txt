<p>Verse 34. <i><b>These hands have ministered</b></i>, &amp;c.] It was neither "<i>sin</i> nor <i>discredit</i>" for the apostle to work to maintain himself, when the circumstances of the Church were such that it could not support him. Still many eminent ministers of God are obliged to support themselves and their families, at least <i>in part</i>, in the same way, while indefatigably testifying the Gospel of the grace of God. Whatever it may be to the <i>people</i>, it is no cause of reproach to the <i>minister</i>, to be <i>obliged</i> thus to employ himself.</p>
