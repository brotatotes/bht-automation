<p>Verse 35. <i><b>I have showed you all things</b></i> — The preposition κατα is to be understood before παντα; and the clause should be read thus-<i>I have showed you IN all things</i>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</b></i> — That is, the giver is more <i>happy</i> than the <i>receiver</i>. <i>Where</i>, or on <i>what occasion</i>, our Lord spake these words we know not, as they do not exist in any of the four evangelists. But that our Lord did speak them, St. Paul's evidence is quite sufficient to prove. The sentiment is worthy of Christ. A truly generous mind, in affluence, rejoices in opportunities to do good, and feels <i>happy</i> in having such opportunities. A man of an independent spirit, when reduced to poverty, finds it a severe trial to be obliged to live on the bounty of another, and feels pain in receiving what the other feels a happiness in communicating. Let, therefore, the man who is able to give feel himself <i>the obliged person</i>, and think how much <i>pain</i> the feeling heart of his supplicant must endure, in being obliged to forego his native independence, in soliciting and receiving the bounty of another. I am not speaking of <i>common</i> <i>beggars</i> these have got their minds already <i>depraved</i>, and their <i>native independence</i> reduced, by <i>sin</i> and <i>idleness</i>, to <i>servility.</i></p>
