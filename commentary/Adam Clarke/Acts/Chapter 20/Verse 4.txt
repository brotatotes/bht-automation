<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>. <i><b>And there accompanied him</b></i> — Rather, says Bishop Pearce, <i>there followed him as far as to Asia</i>; for they were not in his company till he set sail from Philippi, and came to them at Troas, in Asia, whither they had gone before, and where they tarried for him, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:5">Acts 20:5</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Into Asia</b></i> — αχρι της ασιας; These words are wanting in two MSS., <i>Erpen</i>, the <i>AEthiopic, Coptic</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>. Some think that they embarrass this place; for how these could <i>accompany</i> him into Asia, and <i>go before him</i>, and <i>tarry for him</i> at Troas, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>, is not so very clear; unless we suppose, what I have glanced at in the table of contents, that they came with him to Asia, but, he tarrying a short time, they <i>proceeded</i> on their journey, and stopped for him at Troas, where he shortly after rejoined them. Mr. Wakefield gets rid of the difficulty by reading the verse thus: <i>Now Sopater of Berea accompanied him; but Aristarchus and</i> <i>Secundus of Thessalonica, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy</i> of Lystra, <i>and</i> <i>Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia, went before, and tarried for us at</i> <i>Troas</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Sopater of Berea</b></i> — Sopater seems to be the same as <i>Sosipater</i>, whom St. Paul mentions as his <i>kinsman</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:21">Romans 16:21</span>. ADE, more than twenty others, with the <i>Coptic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, <i>Vulgate, Itala, Theophylact, Origen</i>, and <i>Bede</i>, add πυρρου <i>Sopater the SON OF PYRRHUS</i>. Griesbach has received this into his text.</p>
<p><i><b>Aristarchus of Thessalonica</b></i> — This person occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>, and is mentioned there as a <i>Macedonian</i>. He attended Paul in his journey to Rome, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>, and was his <i>fellow labourer</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>, and his <i>fellow prisoner</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10-11">Colossians 4:10-11</span>. <i>Secundus</i> is mentioned nowhere but in this place.</p>
<p><i><b>Gaius of Derbe</b></i> — This is supposed to be the same who is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:26">Acts 19:26</span>, and who is there called <i>a man of Macedonia</i>, of which some suppose he was a <i>native</i>, but descended from a family that came from <i>Derbe</i>; but as <i>Gaius</i>, or <i>Caius</i>, was a very common name, these might have been two distinct persons. One of this name was baptized by St. Paul at Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>, and entertained him as his <i>host</i> while he abode there, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>, and was probably the same to whom St. John directs his <i>third epistle</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And Timotheus</b></i> — <i>Of Lystra</i>, is added by the <i>Syriac</i>. This was the same person of whom mention is made, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>, and to whom St. Paul wrote the <i>two epistles</i> which are still extant; and who was a native of <i>Lystra</i>, as we learn from the above place. It was on this evidence, probably that the ancient Syriac translator added, <i>of</i> <i>Lystra</i>, to the text. This reading is not supported by any MSS.</p>
<p><i><b>Tychicus-of Asia</b></i> — This person was high in the confidence of St. Paul. He styles him <i>a beloved brother, and faithful minister in</i> <i>the Lord</i>, whom he sent to the Ephesians, that <i>he might know their</i> <i>affairs, and comfort their hearts</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21-22">Ephesians 6:21-22</span>. He sent him for the same purpose, and with the same commendations, to the Colossians, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7-8">Colossians 4:7-8</span>. Paul seems also to have designed him to superintend the Church at Crete in the absence of Titus; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12">Titus 3:12</span>. He seems to have been the most intimate and confidential friend that Paul had.</p>
<p><i><b>Trophimus.</b></i> — Was an <i>Ephesian</i>; and both he and <i>Tychicus</i> are called εφεσιοι, <i>Ephesians</i>, instead of ασιανοι, <i>Asiatics</i>, in the Codex Bezae, both Greek and Latin, and in the <i>Sahidic</i>. He accompanied Paul from Ephesus into Greece, as we see here; and from thence to Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:29">Acts 21:29</span>. He had, no doubt, travelled with him on other journeys, for we find, by <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:20">2 Timothy 4:20</span>, that he was obliged to leave him sick at Miletus, being then, as it is likely, on his return to his own kindred at Ephesus.</p>
