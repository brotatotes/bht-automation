<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>. <i><b>Days of unleavened bread</b></i> — The seven days of the passover, in which they ate unleavened bread. See the account of this festival in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:1-51">Exodus 12:1-51</span>. It is evident, from the manner in which St. Luke writes here, that he had not been with St. Paul since the time he accompanied him to <i>Philippi</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10-12">Acts 16:10-12</span>; but he now embarks at Philippi with the apostle, and accompanies him to Troas, and continues with him through the rest of his journey.</p>
<p><i><b>To Troas in five days</b></i> — So long they were making this voyage from Philippi, being obliged to keep always <i>by the coast</i>, and in sight of the land; for the magnetic needle was not yet known. See the situation of these places upon the <i>map</i>.</p>
