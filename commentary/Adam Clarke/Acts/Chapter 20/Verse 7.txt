<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>. <i><b>Upon the first day of the week</b></i> — What was called κυριακη, <i>the Lord's day</i>, the Christian Sabbath, in which they commemorated the resurrection of our Lord; and which, among all Christians, afterwards took the place of the <i>Jewish Sabbath</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To break bread</b></i> — To break [Syriac] <i>eucaristia</i>, the eucharist, as the Syriac has it; intimating, by this, that they were accustomed to receive the holy sacrament on each Lord's day. It is likely that, besides this, they received a common meal together. Some think the αγαπη, or <i>love feast</i>, is intended.</p>
<p><i><b>Continued his speech until midnight.</b></i> — At what time he <i>began</i> to preach we cannot tell, but we hear <i>when</i> he <i>concluded</i>. He preached during the whole night, for he did not leave off till the break of the next day, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:11">Acts 20:11</span>, though about midnight his discourse was interrupted by the fall of Eutychus. As this was about the time of pentecost, and we may suppose about the beginning of May, as Troas was in about 40 degrees of north latitude, the sun set there at <i>seven</i> P.M. and rose at <i>five</i> A.M., so that the night was about <i>eight</i> hours long; and taking all the interruptions together, and they could not have amounted to more than <i>two</i> hours, and taking no account of the preceding day's work, Paul must have preached a sermon not less than <i>six</i> hours long. But it is likely that a good part of this time was employed in hearing and answering questions; for διελεγετο, and διαλεγομενου, may be thus understood.</p>
