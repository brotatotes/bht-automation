<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:8">Acts 20:8</span>. <i><b>Upper chamber</b></i> â€” It was in an <i>upper chamber</i> in the temple that the primitive disciples were accustomed to meet: on that account, they might have preferred an <i>upper chamber</i> whenever they could meet with it. The pious Quesnel supposes that the <i>smoke</i>, issuing from the <i>many lamps</i> in this upper chamber, was the cause of Eutychus falling asleep; and this, he says, the apostle mentions, in charity, to excuse the young man's appearing negligent.</p>
