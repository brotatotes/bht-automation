<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:9">Acts 20:9</span>. <i><b>There sat in a window</b></i> â€” This was probably an opening in the wall, to let in light and air, for there was no <i>glazing</i> at that time; and it is likely that Eutychus fell backward through it, down to the ground, on the outside; there being nothing to prevent his falling <i>out</i>, when he had once lost the power to take care of himself, by getting into a deep sleep.</p>
