<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:1">Acts 21:1</span>. <i><b>Came with a straight course</b></i> — Having had, as is necessarily implied, <i>wind</i> and <i>tide</i> in their favour.</p>
<p><i><b>Coos</b></i> — An island in the Archipelago, or AEgean Sea, one of those called the <i>Sporades</i>. It was famous for the worship of AEsculapius and Juno; and for being the birthplace of <i>Hippocrates</i>, the most eminent of <i>physicians</i>, and <i>Apelles</i>, the most celebrated of <i>painters</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Rhodes</b></i> — Another island in the same sea, celebrated for its <i>Colossus</i>, which was one of the seven wonders of the world. This was a brazen statue of Apollo, so high that ships in full sail could pass between its legs. It was the work of <i>Chares</i>, a pupil of <i>Lysippus</i>, who spent twelve years in making it. It was 106 feet high, and so great that few people could fathom its thumb. It was thrown down by an earthquake about 224 years before Christ, after having stood sixty-six years. When the Saracens took possession of this island, they sold this prostrate image to a Jew, who loaded 900 camels with the brass of it; this was about A.D. 660, nearly 900 years after it had been thrown down.</p>
<p><i><b>Patara</b></i> — One of the chief seaport towns of Syria.</p>
