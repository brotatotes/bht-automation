<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:11">Acts 21:11</span>. <i><b>Took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands</b></i>, c.] This was no doubt a <i>prophet</i>, in the commonly received sense of the term and his mode of acting was like that of the ancient prophets, who often accompanied their predictions with significant emblems. Jeremiah was commanded to bury his girdle by the river Euphrates, to mark out the captivity of the Jews. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:4">Jeremiah 13:4</span>.

<p><i><b>Into the hands of the Gentiles.</b></i> â€” That is, the <i>Romans</i>, for the <i>Jews</i> had not, properly speaking, the power of life and death. And, as Agabus said he should be <i>delivered into the hands of the</i> <i>Gentiles</i>, he showed thereby that they would attempt to destroy his <i>life</i>. This prediction of Agabus was literally fulfilled: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:33">Acts 21:33</span>.</p>
