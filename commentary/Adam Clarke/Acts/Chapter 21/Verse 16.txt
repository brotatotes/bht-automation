<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:16">Acts 21:16</span>. <i><b>And brought with them one Mnason</b></i>, c.] It is not very likely that they would bring a man <i>with</i> them with whom they were to <i>lodge</i> in Jerusalem therefore, the text should perhaps be read as Bp. Patrick proposes: <i>There went with us</i> certain <i>of the</i> <i>disciples of Caesarea, bringing us to one Mnason, with whom we</i> <i>were to lodge</i>. This is most likely, as the text will bear this translation. But it is possible that Mnason, formerly of Cyprus, now an inhabitant of Jerusalem, might have been down at Caesarea, met the disciples, and invited them to lodge with him while they were at Jerusalem; and, having transacted his business at Caesarea, might now accompany them to Jerusalem. His being <i>an old</i> <i>disciple</i> may either refer to his having been a very <i>early</i> convert, probably one of those on the day of pentecost, or to his being now an <i>old man</i>.</p>
