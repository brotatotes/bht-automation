<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:23">Acts 21:23</span>. <i><b>We have four men which have a vow</b></i> — From the <i>shaving</i> of the head, mentioned immediately after, it is evident that the four men in question were under the vow of Nazariteship; and that the days of their vow were nearly at an end, as they were about to shave their heads; for, during the time of the <i>Nazariteship</i>, the hair was permitted to grow, and only shaven off at the termination of the vow. Among the Jews, it was common to make vows to God on extraordinary occasions; and that of the <i>Nazarite</i> appears to have been one of the most common; and it was permitted by their law for any person to perform this vow by <i>proxy</i>. See the law produced in my note, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:21">Numbers 6:21</span>. "It was also customary for the richer sort to bestow their charity on the poorer sort for this purpose; for Josephus, Ant. lib. xix. cap. 6, sec. 1, observes that Agrippa, on his being advanced from a <i>prison</i> to a <i>throne</i>, by the Emperor Claudius, came to Jerusalem; and there, among other instances of his religious thankfulness shown in the temple, Ναζαραιων ξυρασθαι διεταξε μαλα συχνους, <i>he ordered very many Nazarites to be shaven</i>, he furnishing them with money for the expenses of that, and of the sacrifices necessarily attending it." See Bp. Pearce.</p>
