<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span>. <i><b>Be at charges with them</b></i> — Or, rather, <i>be at charges for</i> <i>them</i>: help them to bear the expense of that vow. Eight lambs, four rams, besides oil, flour, c., were the expenses on this occasion. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:1-21">Numbers 6:1-21</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou - walkest orderly and keepest the law.</b></i> — Perhaps this advice meant no more than, Show them, by such means as are now in thy power, that thou art not an enemy to Moses that thou dost still consider the law to be holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good. Paul did so, and bore the expenses of those who, from a scruple of conscience, had made a vow, and perhaps were not well able to bear the expense attending it. Had they done this in order to acquire justification through the law, Paul could not have assisted them in any measure with a clear conscience; but, as he did assist them, it is a proof that they had not taken this vow on them for <i>this</i> purpose. Indeed, <i>vows</i> rather referred to a <i>sense of</i> <i>obligation</i>, and the <i>gratitude</i> due to God for mercies already received, than to the procuring of future favours of any kind. Besides, God had not yet fully shown that the law was abolished, as has already been remarked: he tolerated it till the time that the iniquity of the Jews was filled up; and then, by the destruction of Jerusalem, he swept every rite and ceremony of the Jewish law away, with the besom of destruction.</p>
