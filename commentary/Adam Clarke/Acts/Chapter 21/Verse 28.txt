Verse Acts 21:28. This is the man that teacheth, c.] As much as if they had said: This is the man concerning whom we wrote to you who in every place endeavours to prejudice the Gentiles against the Jews, against the Mosaic law, and against the temple and its services.Brought Greeks also into the temple â€” This was a most deliberate and malicious untruth: Paul could accomplish no purpose by bringing any Greek or Gentile into the temple; and their having seen Trophimus, an Ephesian, with him, in the city only, was no ground on which to raise a slander that must so materially affect both their lives. Josephus informs us, War, lib. v. cap. 5, sec. 2, that on the wall which separated the court of the Gentiles from that of the Israelites was an inscription in Greek and Latin letters, which stated that no stranger was permitted to come within the holy place on pain of death. With such a prohibition as this before his eyes, was it likely that St. Paul would enter into the temple in company with an uncircumcised Greek? The calumny refutes itself.
