<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:28">Acts 21:28</span>. <i><b>This is the man that teacheth</b></i>, c.] As much as if they had said: This is the man concerning whom we wrote to you who in every place endeavours to prejudice the Gentiles against the <i>Jews</i>, against the <i>Mosaic law</i>, and against the <i>temple</i> and its services.</p>
<p><i><b>Brought Greeks also into the temple</b></i> â€” This was a most deliberate and malicious untruth: Paul could accomplish no purpose by bringing any Greek or Gentile into the temple; and their having seen Trophimus, an Ephesian, with him, <i>in the city</i> only, was no ground on which to raise a slander that must so materially affect both their lives. Josephus informs us, <i>War</i>, lib. v. cap. 5, sec. 2, that on the wall which separated the court of the Gentiles from that of the Israelites was an inscription in Greek and Latin letters, which stated that <i>no stranger was permitted to come</i> <i>within the holy place on pain of death</i>. With such a prohibition as this before his eyes, was it likely that St. Paul would enter into the temple in company with an uncircumcised Greek? The calumny refutes itself.</p>
