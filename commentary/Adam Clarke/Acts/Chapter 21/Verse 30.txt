<p>Verse 30. <i><b>They took Paul</b></i> â€” They tumultuously seized on him; <i>and</i> <i>drew him out of the temple</i>, out of the court of the Israelites, where he was worshipping: <i>and - the doors were shut</i>; the doors of the court of the Gentiles, probably to prevent Paul from getting any succour from his friends in the city; for their whole proceedings show that they purposed to murder him: they brought him out of the court of the Israelites, <i>that</i> court being peculiarly holy, that it might not be defiled by his blood; and they shut the court of the Gentiles, that they might have the opportunity unmolested of killing him in that place; for the court of the Gentiles was reckoned to be less holy than than that of the Israelites.</p>
