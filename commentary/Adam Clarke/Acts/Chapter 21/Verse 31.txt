<p>Verse 31. <i><b>The chief captain of the band</b></i> â€” The Roman tribune, who had a troop of soldiers under him, which lodged in general in the castle of <i>Antonia</i>, which was built at the angle where the northern and western porticoes of the outer court of the temple were joined together. This castle was built by John Hyrcanus, high priest of the Jews: it was at first called <i>Baris</i>, and was the royal residence of the <i>Asmoneans</i>, as long as they reigned in Jerusalem. It was beautified by Herod the Great, and called <i>Antonia</i>, in honour of his friend Mark <i>Antony</i>. By this castle the temple was commanded, as it stood on higher ground. Josephus describes this castle, <i>War</i>, b. v. chap. 5, sec. 8, "as having four towers, from one of which the whole temple was overlooked; and that one of the towers was joined to the porticoes of the temple, and had a double pair of stairs from it, by which soldiers in the garrison were used to come down with their arms to the porticoes, on the festival days, to keep the people quiet; for, as the temple was a guard to the city, so this castle was a guard to the temple." "It seems, therefore," says Bp. Pearce, "to me very plain, that the place where the Jews were about to kill Paul was the court of the Gentiles, the porticoes being there; and that the chief captain came down there to his rescue." The name of this chief captain, or tribune, was <i>Claudius Lysias</i>, as we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>.</p>
