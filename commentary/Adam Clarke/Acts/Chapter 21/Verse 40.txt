<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:40">Acts 21:40</span>. <i><b>Paul stood on the stairs</b></i> — Where he was out of the reach of the mob, and was surrounded by the Roman soldiers.</p>
<p><i><b>Beckoned with the hand</b></i> — <i>Waving</i> the hand, which was the sign that he was about to address the people. So VIRGIL says of Turnus, when he wished, by single combat between himself and AEneas, to put an end to the war:- </p>
<p>Never was there a more unnatural division than that in this chapter: it ends with a single comma! The best division would have been at the end of the 25th verse.</p>
<p>PAUL'S embarkation at Tyre is very remarkable. The simple manner in which he was escorted to the ship by the disciples of Tyre, <i>men, women</i>, and <i>children</i>, and their affectionate and pious parting, kneeling down on the shore and commending each other to God, are both impressive and edifying. Nothing but Christianity could have produced such a spirit in persons who now, perhaps for the first time, saw each other in the flesh. Every <i>true Christian</i> is a <i>child of God</i>; and, consequently, all children of God have a spiritual affinity. They are all partakers of the same <i>Spirit</i>, are united to the same <i>Head</i>, are actuated with the same <i>hope</i>, and are going to the same <i>heaven</i>. These love one another with pure hearts fervently; and these alone are capable of disinterested and lasting friendship. Though this kind of friendship cannot <i>fail</i>, yet it may err; and with officious affection endeavour to prevent us from bearing a necessary and most honourable cross. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:12-13">Acts 21:12-13</span>. It should, therefore, be kept within <i>Scriptural</i> bounds.</p>
