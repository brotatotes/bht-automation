<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:5">Acts 21:5</span>. <i><b>When we had accomplished those days</b></i> — That is, the seven days mentioned in the preceding verse.</p>
<p><i><b>And they all brought us on our way, with wives and children</b></i> — It is not likely that Paul, Silas, Luke, c., had either wives or children with them and it is more natural to suppose that the brethren of Tyre, with <i>their</i> wives and children are those that are meant; these, through affection to the apostles, accompanied them from their homes to the ship; and the coming out of the husbands, wives, and children, shows what a general and affectionate interest the preaching and private conversation of these holy men had excited.</p>
<p><i><b>Kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.</b></i> — As God fills heaven and earth, so he may be worshipped <i>every where</i>; as well, when circumstances require it, on the <i>seashore</i> as in the temple. We have already seen, in the case of Lydia, that the Jews had proseuchas by the river sides, c. and an observation in Tertullian seems to intimate that they preferred such places, and in the open air offered their petitions to God by the seashore: Omissis templis, per omne littus, quocumque in aperto aliquando jam preces ad coelum mittunt. <i>Tertul. de Jejunio</i>.</p>
