<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:1">Acts 22:1</span>. <i><b>Men, brethren, and fathers</b></i> — A Hebrew form of expression for <i>brethren and fathers</i>: for <i>two</i> classes only are addressed. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hear ye my defense</b></i> — Μου της απολογιας, <i>This apology of mine</i>; in this sense the word <i>apology</i> was anciently understood: hence the <i>Apologies</i> of the primitive fathers, i.e. their defenses of the Christian religion. And this is as proper literal meaning; but it is <i>now</i> used only as implying an <i>excuse for improper conduct</i>. That this is an abuse of the term requires no proof.</p>
