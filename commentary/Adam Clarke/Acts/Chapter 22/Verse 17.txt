<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>. <i><b>When I was come again to Jerusalem</b></i> — It is likely that he refers to the first journey to Jerusalem, about three years after his conversion, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25-26">Acts 9:25-26</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>I was in a trance</b></i> — This circumstance is not mentioned any where else, unless it be that to which himself refers in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2-4">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</span>, when he conceived himself transported to the third heaven; and, if the case be the <i>same</i>, the appearance of Jesus Christ to him, and the command given, are circumstances related only in this place.</p>
