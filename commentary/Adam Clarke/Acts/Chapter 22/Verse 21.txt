<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:21">Acts 22:21</span>. <i><b>I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</b></i> â€” This was the particular appointment of St. Paul: he was <i>the apostle of</i> <i>the Gentiles</i>; for, though he preached frequently to the Jews, yet to <i>preach</i> the Gospel to the Gentiles, and to write for the conversion and establishment of the Gentile world, were his peculiar destination. Hence we find him and his companions travelling every where; through <i>Judea, Phoenicia, Arabia, Syria,</i> <i>Cilicia, Pisidia, Lycaonia, Pamphylia, Galatia, Phrygia,</i> <i>Macedonia, Greece, Asia</i>, the <i>Isles</i> of the <i>Mediterranean Sea</i>, the <i>Isles</i> of the <i>AEgean Sea, Italy</i>, and some add <i>Spain</i> and even <i>Britain</i>. This was the <i>diocess</i> of this primitive bishop: none of the apostles travelled, none preached, none laboured as this man; and, we may add, none was so greatly owned of God. The <i>epistles</i> of <i>Peter, John, James</i>, and <i>Jude</i>, are great and excellent; but, when compared with those of Paul, however glorious they may be, they have no glory comparatively, by reason of that glory which excelleth. Next to Jesus Christ, St. Paul is the glory of the Christian Church. Jesus is the foundation; Paul, the master-builder.</p>
