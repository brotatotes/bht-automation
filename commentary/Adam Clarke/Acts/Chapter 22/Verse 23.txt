<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:23">Acts 22:23</span>. <i><b>Cast off</b></i><b> their </b><i><b>clothes</b></i> — Bishop Pearce supposes that <i>shaking their upper garments</i> is all that is meant here; and that it was an ancient custom for men to do so when highly pleased or greatly irritated; but it is likely that some of them were now actually throwing off their clothes, in order to prepare to stone Paul.</p>
<p><i><b>Threw dust into the air</b></i> — In sign of <i>contempt</i>, and by way of <i>execration</i>. Shimei acted so, in order to express his contempt of David, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+16:13">2 Samuel 16:13</span>, where it is said, <i>he cursed him as he went, and threw stones at him</i>; or, as the margin, <i>he dusted him with dust</i>. Their <i>throwing dust in the air</i> was also expressive of extraordinary rage and vindictive malice. The apostle, being guarded by the Roman soldiers, was out of the power of the mob; and their throwing dust in the air not only showed their <i>rage</i>, but also their <i>vexation</i> that they could not get the apostle into their power. It is still used as a token of hostility and defiance. M. Denon, (Travels in Egypt, vol. iii. p. 98,) on coming down the Nile to Cairo, stopped at the ancient city of <i>Antinoe</i>, to examine its ruins. "Being desirous of obtaining a view of the whole of these ruins, we ascended a little hill, and soon perceived the inhabitants of the modern village assembling behind an opposite eminence: scarcely had we come over against them than, supposing our intentions to be hostile, they called out for assistance, and <i>threw dust into the air, in token of defiance</i>. The alarm spread, and they began firing upon us."</p>
