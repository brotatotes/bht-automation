<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:24">Acts 22:24</span>. <i><b>Examined by scourging</b></i> â€” As the chief captain did not understand the Hebrew language, he was ignorant of the <i>charge</i> brought against Paul, and ignorant also of the <i>defence</i> which the apostle had made; and, as he saw that they grew more and more outrageous, he supposed that Paul must have given them the highest provocation; and therefore he determined to put him to <i>the</i> <i>torture</i>, in order to find out the nature of his crime. The practice of putting people to the <i>rack</i>, in order to make them <i>confess</i>, has, to the disgrace of human nature, existed in all countries.</p>
