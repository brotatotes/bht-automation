<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:28">Acts 22:28</span>. <i><b>With a great sum obtained I this freedom</b></i> — So it appears that the freedom, even of Rome, might be <i>purchased</i>, and that it was sold at a very <i>high price</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But I was free born.</b></i> — It has been generally believed that the inhabitants of Tarsus, born in that city, had the same rights and privileges as Roman citizens, in consequence of a <i>charter</i> or <i>grant</i> from Julius Caesar. Calmet disputes this, because Tarsus was a <i>free</i> not a <i>colonial</i> city; and he supposes that Paul's father might have been rewarded with the freedom of Rome for some military services, and that it was in consequence of <i>this</i> that Paul was born free. But that the city of Tarsus had such privileges appears extremely probable. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:39">Acts 21:39</span>, Paul says he was <i>born at Tarsus in Cilicia</i>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:28">Acts 22:28</span>, he says he was <i>free born</i>; and, at <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:26">Acts 22:26</span>, he calls himself a <i>Roman</i>; as he does also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:37">Acts 16:37</span>. From whence it has been concluded, with every show of reason, that Tarsus, though no Roman colony, yet had this privilege granted to it, that its natives should be citizens of Rome. PLINY, in <i>Hist. Nat</i>. lib. v. 27, tells us that Tarsus <i>was a free city</i>. And APPIAN, <i>De Bello Civil</i>. lib. v. p. 1077, edit. <i>Tollii</i>, says that Antony, Ταρσεας ελευθερους ηφιει, και ατελεις φορων, <i>made the people of Tarsus free, and</i> <i>discharged them from paying tribute</i>. DIO CASSIUS, lib. xlvii. p. 508, edit. <i>Reimar</i>, farther tells us, <i>Adeo Caesari priori, et ejus</i> <i>gratia etiam posteriori, favebant Tarsenses, ut urbem suam pro</i> <i>Tarso JULIOPOLIN vocaverint</i>: "that, for the affection which the people of Tarsus bore to Julius Caesar, and afterwards to Augustus, the former caused their city to be called <i>Juliopolis</i>." The Greek text is as follows:- οὑτω προσφιλως τῳ Καισαρι προτερῳ, και δι' εκεινον τῳ δευτερῳ, οἱ Ταρσεις ειχον, ὡϚε και Ιουλιοπολιν σφας απ' αυτου μετονομασαι. To which I add, that PHILO, de Virt. vol. ii. p. 587, edit. <i>Mang</i>., makes Agrippa say to Caligula, φιλων ενιων πατριδας ὁλας της Ῥωμαΐκης ηξιωσας πολιτειας· <i>You have made</i> <i>whole countries, to which your friends belong, to be citizens of</i> <i>Rome</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:39">Acts 21:39</span>. These testimonies are of weight sufficient to show that Paul, by being born at Tarsus, might have been <i>free born</i>, and a <i>Roman</i>.
