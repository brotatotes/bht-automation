A passage from Cicero, Orat. pro Verr. Act. ii. lib. v. 64, throws the fullest light on this place: Ille, quisquis erat, quem tu in crucem rapiebas, qui tibi esset ignotus, cum civem se Romanum esse diceret, apud te Praetorem, si non effugium, ne moram quidem mortis mentione atque usurpatione civitatis assequi potuit? "Whosoever he might be whom thou wert hurrying to the rack, were he even unknown to thee, if he said that he was a <i>Roman citizen</i>, he would necessarily obtain from thee, the Praetor, by the simple mention of <i>Rome</i>, if not an escape, yet at least a delay of his punishment." The whole of the sixty-fourth and sixty-fifth sections of this oration, which speak so pointedly on this subject, are worthy of consideration. Of this privilege he farther says, Ib. in cap. lvii., <i>Illa vox et</i> <i>exclamatio</i>, Civis Romanus sum, <i>quae saepe multis in ultimis terris</i> <i>opem inter barbaros et salutem tulit</i>, c. That exclamation, <i>I am a</i> <i>Roman citizen</i>, which often times has brought assistance and safety, even among barbarians, in the remotest parts of the earth, c.</p>
<p>PLUTARCH likewise, in his <i>Life of Pompey</i>, (vol. iii. p. 445, edit. <i>Bryan</i>,) says, concerning the behaviour of the pirates, when they had taken any Roman prisoner, Εκεινο δε ην ὑβριϚικωτατον κ. τ. λ <i>what was the most contumelious was this when any of those</i> <i>whom they had made captives cried out</i>, ρωμαιος ειναι, THAT HE WAS A ROMAN, <i>and told them his name, they pretended to be surprised,</i> <i>and be in a fright, and smote upon their thighs, and fell down</i> (on their knees) <i>to him, beseeching him to pardon them</i>! It is no wonder then that the torturer desisted, when Paul cried out that he was a <i>Roman</i> and that the chief captain was <i>alarmed</i>, because he had bound him.</p>
