<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>. <i><b>I have lived in all good conscience</b></i> â€” Some people seem to have been unnecessarily stumbled with this expression. What does the apostle mean by it? Why, that, while he was a <i>Jew</i>, he was <i>one</i> from principle of conscience; that what he did, while he continued Jew, he did from the same principle; that, when God opened his eyes to see the nature of Christianity, he became a Christian, because God persuaded his conscience that it was right for him to become one; that, in a word, he was <i>sincere</i> through the whole course of his religious life, and his conduct had borne the most unequivocal proofs of it. The apostle means, therefore, that there was no part of his life in which he acted as a dishonest or hypocritical man; and that he was now as fully determined to maintain his profession of Christianity as he ever was to maintain that of Judaism, previously to his acquaintance with the Christian religion.</p>
