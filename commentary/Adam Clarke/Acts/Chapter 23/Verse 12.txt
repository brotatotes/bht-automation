<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:12">Acts 23:12</span>. <i><b>That they would neither eat nor drink</b></i>, c.] These forty Jews were no doubt of the class of the <i>sicarii</i> mentioned before, (similar to those afterwards called <i>assassins</i>,) a class of fierce zealots, who took justice into their own hand and who thought they had a right to despatch all those who, according to their views, were not orthodox in their religious principles. If these were, in their bad way, <i>conscientious</i> men, must they not all perish through hunger, as God put it out of their power to accomplish their vow? No: for the doctrine of sacerdotal absolution was held among the Jews as among the Papists: hence it is said, in <i>Hieros. Avodah Zarah</i>, fol. 40: "He that hath made a vow not to eat any thing, wo to him, if he eat; and wo to him, if he do not eat. If he eat, he sinneth against his <i>vow</i>; and if he do not eat, he sinneth against his <i>life</i>." What must such a man do in this case? Let him go to the wise men, and they will loose him from his vow, as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+12:18">Proverbs 12:18</span>: "<i>The tongue of the wise is health</i>." When vows were so easily dispensed with, they might be readily multiplied. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
