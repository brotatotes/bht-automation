<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:17">Acts 23:17</span>. <i><b>Bring this young man unto the chief captain</b></i> â€” Though St. Paul had the most positive assurance from Divine authority that he should be preserved, yet he knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work in his behalf. He who will not help himself, according to the means and power he possesses, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive any assistance from God.</p>
