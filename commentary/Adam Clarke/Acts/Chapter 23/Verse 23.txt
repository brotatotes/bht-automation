But the Codex Alexandrinus reads δεξιοβολους, from δεξια, the right hand, and βαλλειν, to cast or dart, persons who threw javelins. But both words seem to mean nearly the same thing.The third hour of the night — About nine o'clock P.M., for the greater secrecy, and to elude the cunning, active malice of the Jews.
