<p><i><b>Felix the governor.</b></i> — This Felix was a freed man of the Emperor Claudius, and brother of Pallas, chief favourite of the emperor. Tacitus calls him <i>Antonius Felix</i>; and gives us to understand that he governed with all the authority of a king, and the baseness and insolence of a quondam slave. <i>E libertis Antonius Felix per omnem</i> <i>saevitiam ac libidinem jus regium servili ingenio exercuit</i>. Hist. v. 9. He had, according to Suetonius, in his life of Claudius, chap. 28, <i>three queens</i> to his wives; that is, he was married thrice, and each time to the daughter or niece of a king. Drusilla, the sister of Agrippa, was his wife at this time; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:24">Acts 24:24</span>. He was an unrighteous governor; a base, mercenary, and bad man: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:2">Acts 24:2</span>.</p>
