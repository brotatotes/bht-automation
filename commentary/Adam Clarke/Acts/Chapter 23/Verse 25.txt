<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:25">Acts 23:25</span>. <i><b>He wrote a letter after this manner</b></i> â€” It appears that this was not only the <i>substance</i> of the letter, but the <i>letter</i> <i>itself</i>: the whole of it is so perfectly formal as to prove this; and in this simple manner are all the letters of the ancients formed. In this also we have an additional proof of St. Luke's accuracy.</p>
