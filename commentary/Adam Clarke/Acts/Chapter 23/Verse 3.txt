<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:3">Acts 23:3</span>. <i><b>God shall smite thee</b></i><b>, thou </b><i><b>whited wall</b></i> â€” Thou hypocrite! who sittest on the seat of judgment, pretending to hear and seriously weigh the defense of an accused person, who must in justice and equity be presumed to be innocent till he is proved to be guilty; and, instead of acting according to the law, commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law, which always has the person of the prisoner under its protection; nor ever suffers any penalty to be inflicted but what is prescribed as the just punishment for the offense. As if he had said: "Thinkest thou that God will suffer such an insult on his laws, on justice, and on humanity, to pass unpunished?"</p>
