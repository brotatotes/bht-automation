<p>Verse 32. <i><b>On the morrow they left the horsemen</b></i> â€” Being now so far from Jerusalem, they considered Paul in a state of safety from the Jews, and that the seventy horse would be a sufficient guard; the four hundred foot, therefore, returned to Jerusalem, and the horse went on to Caesarea with Paul. We need not suppose that all this troop did reach Antipatris on the <i>same</i> night in which they left Jerusalem; therefore, instead of, <i>they brought him by night to</i> <i>Antipatris</i>, we may understand the text thus-<i>Then the soldiers took</i> <i>Paul by night</i>, and <i>brought him to Antipatris</i>. And the thirty-second verse need not to be understood as if the foot reached the castle of Antonia the <i>next day</i>, (though all this was possible,) but that, having reached <i>Antipatris</i>, and refreshed themselves, they set out the same day, on their march to Jerusalem; <i>on the morrow they returned</i>, that is, they <i>began</i> their march back again <i>to the castle</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:1">Acts 24:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:1">Acts 24:1</span></span>.</p>
