<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:5">Acts 23:5</span>. <i><b>I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest</b></i> — After all the learned labour that has been spent on this subject, the simple meaning appears plainly to be this:-</p>
<p>St. Paul did not know that Ananias was high priest; he had been long absent from Jerusalem; <i>political changes</i> were frequent; the high priesthood was no longer in <i>succession</i>, and was frequently bought and sold; the Romans put down one high priest, and raised up another, as political reasons dictated. As the person of Ananias might have been wholly unknown to him, as the <i>hearing</i> was very sudden, and there was scarcely any time to consult the formalities of justice, it seems very probable that St. Paul, if he ever had known the person of Ananias, had forgotten him; and as, in a council or meeting of this kind, the presence of the high priest was not indispensably necessary, he did not know that the person who presided was not the <i>sagan</i>, or high priest's deputy, or some other person put in the seat for the time being. I therefore understand the words above in their most obvious and literal sense. He knew not who the person was, and God's Spirit suddenly led him to denounce the Divine displeasure against him.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</b></i> — If I had known he was the high priest, I should not have publicly pronounced this execration; for respect is due to his <i>person</i> for the sake of his <i>office</i>. I do not see that Paul intimates that he had done any thing through inadvertence; nor does he here confess any fault; he states two facts:-</p>
<p>1. That he did not know him to be the high priest.</p>
<p>2. That such a one, or any ruler of the people, should be reverenced. But he neither recalled or made an apology for his words: he had not committed a trespass, and he did not acknowledge one. We must beware how we attribute either to him in the case before us.</p>
