He had previously mentioned that Jesus Christ had appeared to him, when on his way to Damascus and, though they might not be ready to admit the doctrine of <i>Christ's resurrection</i>, yet they could, consistently with their own principles, allow that the <i>soul</i> of Christ might appear to him; and they immediately caught at this, as furnishing a strong proof against the doctrine of the Sadducees, who neither believed in angel nor spirit, while the Pharisees confessed both.</p>
<p><i><b>Let us not fight against God.</b></i> — These words are wanting in ABCE, several others, with the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac, Vulgate</i>, and some of the <i>fathers</i>.</p>
