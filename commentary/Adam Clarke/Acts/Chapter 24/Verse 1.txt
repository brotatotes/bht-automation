<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:1">Acts 24:1</span>. <i><b>After five days</b></i> â€” These days are to be reckoned from the time in which Paul was apprehended at Jerusalem, and twelve days after he had arrived in that city; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:11">Acts 24:11</span>. Calmet reckons the days thus:-St. Luke says that Paul was apprehended at Jerusalem when the seven days of his vow were <i>nearly</i> ended, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:27">Acts 21:27</span>; that is, at the end of the <i>fifth</i> day after his arrival. The next day, which was the <i>sixth</i>, he was presented before the Sanhedrin. The night following, he was taken to Antipatris. The next day, the <i>seventh</i>, he arrived at Caesarea. <i>Five</i> days afterwards, that is, the <i>twelfth</i> day after his arrival at Jerusalem, the high priest and the elders, with Tertullus, came down to accuse him before Felix.-But <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:32">Acts 23:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:32">Acts 23:32</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>A certain orator</b></i> named <i>Tertullus</i>] This was probably a Roman proselyte to Judaism; yet he speaks every where as a <i>Jew</i>. Roman orators, advocates; c., were found in different provinces of the Roman empire and they, in general, spoke both the Greek and Latin languages; and, being well acquainted with the Roman laws and customs, were no doubt very useful. <i>Luitprandus</i> supposed that this Tertullus was the same with him who was colleague with Pliny the younger, in the consulate, in the year of Rome, 852; who is mentioned by Pliny, <i>Epist</i>. v. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>. Of this there is no satisfactory proof.</p>
