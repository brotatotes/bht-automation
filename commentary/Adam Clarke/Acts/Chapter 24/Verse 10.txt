<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:10">Acts 24:10</span>. <i><b>Then Paul - answered</b></i> — The apostle's <i>defence</i> consists of <i>two parts</i>: - </p>
<p>1. The <i>exordium</i>, which has for its object the praise of his judge, whose qualifications to discern and decide on a question of this nature he fully allows; and expects, from this circumstance, to have a favourable hearing.</p>
<p>2. The <i>tractation</i>, which consists of two parts:</p>
<p>I. REFUTATION:</p>
<p>1. of the charge of polluting the temple;</p>
<p>2. of stirring up sedition;</p>
<p>3. of being a leader of any sect who had a different worship from the God of their fathers.</p>
<p>II. AFFIRMATION:</p>
<p>1. that he had lived so as to preserve a good conscience towards God, and towards men;</p>
<p>2. that so far from <i>polluting</i> the temple, he had been <i>purified</i> in it, and was found thus worshipping according to the law of God;</p>
<p>3. that what Tertullus and his companions had witnessed was perfectly false; and he defied them to produce a single proof, and appeals to those who had been witnesses of his conduct in Jerusalem, who should have been there could they have proved any thing against him.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou hast been of many years a judge</b></i> — <i>Cumanus</i> and <i>Felix</i> were, for a time, joint governors of Judea; but, after the condemnation of <i>Cumanus</i>, the government fell entirely into the hands of Felix; and from Josephus we learn that this was now the <i>sixth</i> or <i>seventh</i> year of his administration, which might be called <i>many years</i>, when the very frequent removals of the governors of the provinces are considered. See Jos. Antiq. lib. xx. 7, and see the <i>margin</i>.</p>
<p><i>A judge</i> - κριτην, the same here in signification as the Hebrew שפט <i>shophet</i>, which means a <i>ruler</i> or <i>governor</i>. This was the title of the ancient governors of Israel.</p>
<p><i><b>The more cheerfully</b></i> — ευθυμοτερον, With a <i>better heart</i> or <i>courage</i>, because, as thy long residence among us has brought thee to a thorough acquaintance with our customs, I may expect a proper decision in my favour, my cause being perfectly sound.</p>
