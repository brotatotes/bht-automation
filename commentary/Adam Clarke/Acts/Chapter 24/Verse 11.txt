<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:11">Acts 24:11</span>. <i><b>There are yet but twelve days</b></i> â€” This is his <i>reply</i> to their charge of <i>sedition</i>; the improbability of which is shown from the <i>short time</i> he had spent in Jerusalem, quite insufficient to organize a sedition of any kind; nor could a single proof be furnished that he had attempted to seduce any man, or unhinge any person from his allegiance by subtle disputations, either in the <i>temple</i>, the <i>synagogues</i>, or the <i>city</i>. So that this charge necessarily fell to the ground, self-confuted, unless they could bring substantial proof against him, which he challenges them to do.</p>
