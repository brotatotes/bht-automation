<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span>. <i><b>That after the way which they call heresy</b></i> — See the explanation of this word in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span><i>"</i>, and see before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span>, where what is here translated <i>heresy</i>, is there rendered <i>sect</i>. At this time the word had no bad acceptation, in reference to religious opinions. The Pharisees themselves, the most <i>respectable</i> body among the Jews, are called a <i>sect</i>; for Paul, defending himself before Agrippa, says that he <i>lived a Pharisee according to the strictest</i> αιρεσιν, <i>sect</i>, or <i>heresy of their religion</i>. And Josephus, who was a Pharisee, speaks, της των Φαρισαιων αἱρεσεως, <i>of the heresy</i> or <i>sect of the</i> <i>Pharisees</i>. LIFE, chap. xxxviii. Therefore it is evident that the word heresy had no <i>bad</i> meaning among the Jews; it meant simply a <i>religious sect</i>. Why then did they use it by way of degradation to St. Paul? This seems to have been the cause. They had already <i>two</i> accredited <i>sects</i> in the land, the <i>Pharisees</i> and <i>Sadducees:</i> the interests of each of these were pretty well balanced, and each had a part in the government, for the <i>council</i>, or <i>Sanhedrin</i>, was composed both of <i>Sadducees</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>. They were afraid that the <i>Christians</i>, whom they called <i>Nazarenes</i>, should form a <i>new sect</i>, and divide the interests of both the preceding; and <i>what</i> they feared, <i>that</i> they charged them with; and, on this account, the Christians had both the Pharisees and the Sadducees for their enemies. They had charged Jesus Christ with plotting against the state, and endeavouring to raise seditions; and they charged his followers with the same. This they deemed a proper engine to bring a <i>jealous</i> government into action.</p>
<p><i><b>So worship I the God of my fathers</b></i> — I bring in no <i>new object</i> of worship; no new <i>religious creed</i>. I believe all things as they profess to believe; and acknowledge the <i>Law</i> and the <i>Prophets</i> as divinely inspired books; and have never, in the smallest measure, detracted from the <i>authority</i> or <i>authenticity</i> of either.</p>
