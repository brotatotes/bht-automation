<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:16">Acts 24:16</span>. <i><b>And herein do I exercise myself</b></i> — And this very tenet is a pledge for my good behaviour; for as I believe there will be a resurrection, both of the <i>just</i> and <i>unjust</i>, and that <i>every man</i> shall be judged for the <i>deeds done in the body</i>, so <i>I exercise</i> <i>myself day and night, that I may have a conscience void of offence</i> <i>toward God and toward men</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Toward God</b></i> — In entertaining no opinion contrary to <i>his</i> truth; and in offering no <i>worship</i> contrary to <i>his</i> dignity, purity, and excellence.</p>
<p><b>Toward </b><i><b>men.</b></i> — In <i>doing</i> nothing to them that I would not, on a change of circumstances, they should do to me; and in <i>withholding</i> nothing by which I might comfort and serve them.</p>
