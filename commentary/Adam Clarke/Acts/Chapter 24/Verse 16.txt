Verse Acts 24:16. And herein do I exercise myself — And this very tenet is a pledge for my good behaviour; for as I believe there will be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust, and that every man shall be judged for the deeds done in the body, so I exercise myself day and night, that I may have a conscience void of offence toward God and toward men.Toward God — In entertaining no opinion contrary to his truth; and in offering no worship contrary to his dignity, purity, and excellence.Toward men. — In doing nothing to them that I would not, on a change of circumstances, they should do to me; and in withholding nothing by which I might comfort and serve them.
