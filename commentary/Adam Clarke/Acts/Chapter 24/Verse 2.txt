<p>The <i>exordium</i> contains the praise of Felix and his administration, merely for the purpose of conciliating his esteem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:2-4">Acts 24:2-4</span>; The <i>proposition</i> is contained in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span>.

<p><i><b>By thee we enjoy great quietness</b></i> — As bad a governor as Felix most certainly was, he rendered some services to Judea. The country had long been infested with robbers; and a very formidable banditti of this kind, under one Eliezar, he entirely suppressed. Joseph. Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 6; Bell. lib. ii, cap. 22. He also suppressed the sedition raised by an Egyptian impostor, who had seduced 30,000 men; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:38">Acts 21:38</span>. He had also quelled a very afflictive disturbance which took place between the <i>Syrians</i> and the <i>Jews of Caesarea</i>. On this ground Tertullus said, <i>By thee we</i> <i>enjoy great quietness; and illustrious deeds are done to this</i> <i>nation by thy prudent administration</i>. This was all true; but, notwithstanding this, he is well known from his own historians, and from Josephus, to have been not only a very bad man, but also a very bad governor. He was mercenary, oppressive, and cruel; and of all these the Jews brought proofs to Nero, before whom they accused him; and, had it not been for the interest and influence of his brother <i>Pallas</i>; he had been certainly ruined.</p>
