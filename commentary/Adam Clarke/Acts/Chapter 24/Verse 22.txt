<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:22">Acts 24:22</span>. <i><b>And when Felix heard these things</b></i> â€” There is considerable difficulty in this verse. Translators greatly vary concerning the sense; and the MSS. themselves read variously. Mr. Wakefield's translation appears to be as proper as most: <i>Now</i> <i>Felix, upon hearing these things, put them off by saying, When</i> <i>Lysias the captain is come down, after I have gained a more exact</i> <i>knowledge of this doctrine, I will inquire fully into your</i> <i>business</i>.</p>
<p>Calmet's translation is nearly to the same sense:-</p>
<p><i>Felix, having heard</i> these things, <i>put them off to another time,</i> <i>saying, When I shall have acquired a more accurate knowledge of</i> <i>this sect, and when the tribune Lysias shall have come from</i> Jerusalem, <i>I will judge of your business</i>.</p>
<p>And this mode of interpretation is rendered the more <i>likely</i> from the circumstance, that, previously to the coming down of Lysias, Felix had sent for Paul, concerning the faith of Christ; and this he appears to have done, that he might be the better qualified to judge of the business, when it should come again before him. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:20">Acts 24:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:20">Acts 24:20</span></span>.</p>
