<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:23">Acts 24:23</span>. <i><b>He commanded a centurion to keep Paul</b></i> — He gave him into the custody of a captain, by whom he was most likely to be well used: <i>and to let him have liberty</i>; he freed him from the chains with which he was bound to the soldiers, his keepers. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:33">Acts 21:33</span>. <i>And that he should forbid none of his acquaintance</i>, τωνιδιων, of his <i>own people</i>, his fellow <i>apostles</i>, and the <i>Christians</i> in general, <i>to minister or come unto him</i>; to furnish him with any of the <i>conveniences</i> and <i>comforts</i> of life, and <i>visit</i> him as often as they pleased. This was an ample proof that Felix found no evil in him; and he would certainly have dismissed him but for two reasons:</p>
<p>1. He wanted to <i>please the Jews</i>, who, he knew, could depose grievous things against his administration.</p>
<p>2. <i>He hoped to</i> <i>get money</i> from the apostle, or his friends, as the purchase of his liberty.</p>
