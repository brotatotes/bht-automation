<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:24">Acts 24:24</span>. <i><b>His wife Drusilla</b></i> — We have already seen that Felix was <i>thrice</i> married: two of his wives were named <i>Drusilla</i>; one was a Roman, the niece or grand-daughter of Antony and Cleopatra, mentioned by Tacitus, lib. v. cap. 9. The other, the person in the text, was a <i>Jewess</i>, daughter to Herod Agrippa the Great. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1">Acts 12:1</span>, c. When she was but <i>six</i> years of age, she was affianced to <i>Epiphanes</i>, son of <i>Antiochus</i>, king of <i>Comagene</i>, who had promised to embrace Judaism on her account but, as he did not keep his word, her brother Agrippa (mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:13">Acts 25:13</span>) refused to ratify the marriage. About the year of our Lord 53, he married her to <i>Azizus</i>, king of the <i>Emesenes</i>, who received her on condition of being <i>circumcised</i>. Felix having seen her, fell desperately in love with her, and by means of a pretended Jewish magician, a native of Cyprus, persuaded her to leave her husband; on which Felix took her to wife. She appears, on the whole, to have been a person of indifferent character; though one of the finest women of that age. It is said that she, and a son she had by Felix, were consumed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. See <i>Josephus</i>, Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 7, and see <i>Calmet</i> and <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
