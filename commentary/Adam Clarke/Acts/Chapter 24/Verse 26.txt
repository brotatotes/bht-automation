<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:26">Acts 24:26</span>. <i><b>He hoped also that money should have been given him</b></i> â€” Bp. Pearce asks, "How could St. Luke know this?" To which I answer: From the report of St. Paul, with whom Felix had frequent conferences, and to whom he undoubtedly expressed this wish. We may see, here, the most unprincipled <i>avarice</i>, in Felix, united to <i>injustice</i>. Paul had proved before him his innocence of the charges brought against him by the Jews. They had retired in confusion when he had finished his defence. Had Felix been influenced by the common principles of justice, Paul had been immediately discharged; but he detained him on the hope of a ransom. He saw that Paul was a respectable character; that he had opulent friends; that he was at the head of a very numerous sect, to whom he was deservedly dear; and he took it, therefore, for granted that a considerable sum of money would be given for his enlargement. Felix was a <i>freed</i> man of the Emperor Claudius; consequently, had once been a <i>slave</i>. The stream rises not above its source: the meanness of the <i>slave</i> is still apparent, and it is now insufferable, being added to the authority and influence of the <i>governor</i>. <i>Low-bred</i> men should never be intrusted with the administration of public affairs.</p>
