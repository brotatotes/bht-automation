<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:27">Acts 24:27</span>. <i><b>After two years</b></i> — That is, from the time that Paul came prisoner to Caesarea.</p>
<p><i><b>Porcius Festus</b></i> — This man was put into the government of Judea about A.D. 60, the <i>sixth</i> or <i>seventh</i> year of Nero. In the succeeding chapter we shall see the part that <i>he</i> took in the affairs of St. Paul.</p>
<p><i><b>Willing to show the Jews a pleasure</b></i> — As he had not got the money which he expected, he hoped to be able to prevent the <i>complaints</i> of the Jews against his government, by leaving Paul, in some measure, in their hands. For it was customary for governors, c., when they left, or were removed from a particular district or province, to do some <i>public, beneficent act</i>, in order to make themselves <i>popular</i>. But Felix gained nothing by this: the Jews pursued him with their complaints against his administration, even to the throne of the emperor. Josephus states the matter thus: "Now when Porcius Festus was sent as successor to Felix, by Nero, the principal of the Jewish inhabitants of Caesarea went up to Rome, to accuse Felix. And he certainly would have been brought to punishment, had not Nero yielded to the importunate solicitations of his brother <i>Pallas</i>, who was at that time in the highest reputation with the emperor."-Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 9. Thus, like the dog in the fable, by <i>snatching</i> at the <i>shadow</i>, he lost the <i>substance</i>. He hoped for money from the apostle, and got none he sought to conciliate the friendship of the Jews, and miscarried. Honesty is the best policy: he that fears God need fear nothing else. Justice and truth never deceive their possessor.</p>
<p>1. <i>Envy</i> and <i>malice</i> are indefatigable, and torment themselves in order to torment and ruin others. That a <i>high priest</i>, says pious <i>Quesnel</i>, should ever be induced to leave the holy city, and the functions of religion, to become the accuser of an innocent person; this could be no other than the effect of a terrible dereliction, and the punishment of the abuse of sacred things.</p>
<p>2. Tertullus begins his speech with <i>flattery</i>, against which every judge should have a shut ear; and then he proceeds to <i>calumny</i> and <i>detraction</i>. These generally succeed each other. He who <i>flatters</i> you, will in course <i>calumniate</i> you for receiving his flattery. When a man is conscious of the <i>uprightness</i> of his cause, he must know that to attempt to support it by any thing but <i>truth</i> tends directly to debase it.</p>
<p>3. The <i>resurrection of the body</i> was the grand object of the genuine Christian's hope; but the ancient Christians only hoped for a <i>blessed</i> resurrection on the <i>ground</i> of reconciliation to God through the death of his Son. In vain is our hope of glory, if we have not got a <i>meetness</i> for it. And who is <i>fit</i> for this state of blessedness, but he whose iniquity is forgiven, whose sin is covered, and whose heart is purified from deceit and guile!</p>
<p>4. We could applaud the lenity shown to St. Paul by Felix, did not his own conduct render his <i>motives</i> for this lenity very suspicious. "To think no evil, where no evil seems," is the duty of a Christian; but to refuse to see it, <i>where</i> it most evidently appears, is an imposition on the understanding itself.</p>
<p>5. <i>Justice, temperance</i>, and a <i>future judgment</i>, the subjects of St. Paul's discourse to Felix and Drusilla, do not concern an iniquitous judge alone; they are subjects which should affect and interest every Christian; subjects which the eye should carefully examine, and which the heart should ever feel. <i>Justice</i> respects our conduct in life, particularly in reference to others: <i>temperance</i>, the <i>state</i> and <i>government</i> of our souls, in reference to God. He who does not exercise himself in these has neither the <i>form</i> nor the <i>power</i> of godliness; and consequently must be overwhelmed with the shower of Divine wrath in the day of God's appearing, Many of those called <i>Christians</i>, have not less reason to tremble at a display of these truths than this <i>heathen</i>.</p>
