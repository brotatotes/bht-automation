<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:4">Acts 24:4</span>. <i><b>That I be not farther tedious unto thee</b></i> — That I may neither trespass on thy <i>time</i>, by dwelling longer on this subject, nor on thy <i>modesty</i>, by thus enumerating thy beneficent deeds.</p>
<p><i><b>Hear us of thy clemency</b></i> — Give us this farther proof of thy kindness, by hearkening to our present complaint. The whole of this exordium was <i>artful</i> enough, though it was <i>lame</i>. The orator had certainly a very <i>bad cause</i>, of which he endeavoured to make the <i>best</i>. Felix was a bad man and bad governor; and yet he must praise him, to conciliate his esteem. Paul was a very <i>good man</i>, and nothing amiss could be proved against him; and yet he must endeavour to blacken him as much as possible, in order to please his unprincipled and wicked employers. His oration has been blamed as <i>weak, lame</i>, and <i>imperfect</i>; and yet, perhaps, few, with so <i>bad a</i> <i>cause</i>, could have made <i>better</i> of it.</p>
