<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:6">Acts 24:6</span>. <i><b>Hath gone about to profane the temple</b></i> — This was a heavy charge, if it could have been substantiated, because the Jews were permitted by the Romans to put any person to death who profaned their temple. This charge was founded on the gross calumny mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:28-29">Acts 21:28-29</span>; for, as they had seen Trophimus, an Ephesian, with Paul in the city, they pretended that he had brought him into the temple.</p>
<p><i><b>Would have judged according to our law</b></i> — He pretended that they would have tried the case fairly, had not the chief captain taken him violently out of their hands; whereas, had not Lysias interfered, they would have murdered him on the spot.</p>
