<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:7">Acts 24:7</span>. <i><b>With great violence</b></i> — μετα πολλης βιας, I rather think, means <i>with an armed force</i>. Tertullus intimates that Lysias interfered contrary to law, and brought soldiers to support him in his infringement on their constitution. This is what he seems to say and complain of; for the Jews were vexed with Lysias for rescuing the apostle from their hands.</p>
