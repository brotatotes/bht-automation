<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:8">Acts 24:8</span>. <i><b>Commanding his accusers to come</b></i>, c.] Here Tertullus closes his <i>opening</i> and <i>statement</i> of the case and now he proceeds to <i>call</i> and examine his <i>witnesses</i>; and they were no doubt examined one by one, though St. Luke sums the whole up in one word -<i>The Jews</i> <i>also assented, saying, that these things were so</i>. Whoever considers the <i>plan</i> of Tertullus's speech, will perceive that it was both <i>judicious</i> and <i>artful</i>. Let us take a view of the whole:-</p>
<p>1. He praises Felix to conciliate his favour.</p>
<p>2. He generally states the great blessings of his administration.</p>
<p>3. He states that the Jews, throughout the whole land, felt themselves under the greatest obligations to him, and extolled his prudent and beneficent management of the public affairs every where.</p>
<p>4. That the prisoner before him was a very bad man; a disturber of the public peace; a demagogue of a dangerous party; and so lost to all sense of religion as to attempt to profane the temple!</p>
<p>5. That, though he should have been punished on the spot, yet, as they were ordered by the chief captain to appear before him, and show the reason why they had seized on Paul at Jerusalem, they were accordingly come; and, having now exhibited their charges, he would,</p>
<p>6. proceed to examine witnesses, who would prove all these things to the satisfaction of the governor. 7. He then called his witnesses, and their testimony confirmed and substantiated the charges. No bad cause was ever more judiciously and cunningly managed.</p>
