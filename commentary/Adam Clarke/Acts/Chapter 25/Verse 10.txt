<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:10">Acts 25:10</span>. <i><b>I stand at Caesar's judgment seat</b></i> — Every procurator represented the person of the emperor in the province over which he presided; and, as the seat of government was at Caesarea, and Paul was now before the tribunal on which the emperor's representative sat, he could say, with the strictest propriety, that he stood <i>before Caesar's judgment seat</i>, where, as a freeman of Rome, he should be tried.</p>
<p><i><b>As thou very well knowest.</b></i> — The record of this trial before Felix was undoubtedly left for the inspection of Festus; for, as he left the <i>prisoner</i> to his successor, he must also leave the <i>charges</i> against him, and the <i>trial</i> which he had undergone. Besides, Festus must be assured of his innocence, from the trial through which he had just now passed.</p>
