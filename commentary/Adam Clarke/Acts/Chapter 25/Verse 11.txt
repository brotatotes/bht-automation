<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:11">Acts 25:11</span>. <i><b>For if I be an offender</b></i> — If it can be proved that I have broken the laws, so as to expose me to capital punishment, I do not wish to save my life by subterfuges; I am before the only competent tribunal; here my business should be ultimately decided.</p>
<p><i><b>No man may deliver me unto them</b></i> — The words of the apostle are very strong and appropriate. The Jews asked as a <i>favour</i>, χαριν, from Festus, that he would send Paul to Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:3">Acts 25:3</span>. Festus, willing to do the Jews χαριν, this <i>favour</i>, asked Paul if he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:9">Acts 25:9</span>. Paul says, I have done nothing amiss, either against the Jews or against Caesar; therefore no man με δυναται αυτοις χαρισασθαι, <i>can</i> <i>make a PRESENT of me to them</i>; that is, <i>favour</i> them so far as to put my life into their hands, and thus <i>gratify</i> them by my death. Festus, in his address to Agrippa, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:16">Acts 25:16</span>, admits this, and uses the same form of speech: <i>It is not the custom of the Romans</i>, χαριζεσθαι, gratuitously <i>to give up any one</i>, c. Much of the beauty of this passage is lost by not attending to the original words. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:16">Acts 25:16</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>I appeal unto Caesar.</b></i> — A freeman of Rome, who had been tried for a crime, and sentence passed on him, had a right to appeal to the emperor, if he conceived the sentence to be unjust but, even <i>before</i> the sentence was pronounced, he had the privilege of an appeal, in criminal cases, if he conceived that the judge was doing any thing contrary to the laws. <i>ANTE sententiam appellari</i> <i>potest in criminali negotio, si judex contra leges hoc</i> <i>faciat</i>.-GROTIUS.</p>
<p>An appeal to the emperor was highly respected. The <i>Julian</i> law condemned those magistrates, and others having authority, as violaters of the public peace, who had put to death, tortured, scourged, imprisoned, or condemned any Roman citizen who had appealed to Caesar. <i>Lege Julia de vi publica damnatur, qui aliqua</i> <i>potestate praeditus, Civem Romanum ad Imperatorem appellantem</i> <i>necarit, necarive jusserit, torserit, verberauerit, condemnaverit,</i> <i>in publica vincula duci jusserit</i>. Pauli Recept. Sent. lib. v. t. 26.</p>
<p>This law was so very sacred and imperative, that, in the persecution under Trajan, Pliny would not attempt to put to death Roman citizens who were proved to have turned Christians; hence, in his letter to Trajan, lib. x. Ep. 97, he says, <i>Fuerunt alii</i> <i>similis amentiae, quos, quia cives Romani erant, annotavi in urbem</i> <i>remittendos</i>. 'There were others guilty of similar folly, whom, finding them to be Roman citizens, I have determined to send to the city." Very likely these had appealed to Caesar.</p>
