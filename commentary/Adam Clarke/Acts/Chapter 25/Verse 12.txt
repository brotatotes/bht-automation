<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:12">Acts 25:12</span>. <i><b>Conferred with the council</b></i> â€” From this circumstance, we may learn that the appeal of Paul to Caesar was <i>conditional</i>; else Festus could not have deliberated with his council whether it should be granted; for he had no power to refuse to admit such an appeal. We may, therefore, understand Paul thus: "I now stand before a tribunal where I <i>ought</i> to be judged; if <i>thou</i> refuse to hear and try this cause, rather than go to Jerusalem, I appeal to Caesar." Festus, therefore, consulted with the council, whether he should proceed to try the cause, or send Paul to Rome; and it appears that the majority were of opinion that he should be sent to Caesar.</p>
<p><i><b>Hast thou appealed unto Caesar</b></i>, c.] Rather, <i>Thou hast appealed</i> <i>unto Caesar</i>, and <i>to Caesar thou shalt go</i>. The Jews were disappointed of their hope and Festus got his hand creditably drawn out of a business with which he was likely to have been greatly embarrassed.</p>
