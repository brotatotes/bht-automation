<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:13">Acts 25:13</span>. <i><b>King Agrippa</b></i> — This was the son of Herod Agrippa, who is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1">Acts 12:1</span>. Upon the death of his father's youngest brother, Herod, he succeeded him in the kingdom of Chalcis, by the favour of the Emperor Claudius: <i>Jos</i>. Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 4, s. 2; and Bell. lib. ii. cap. 12, s. 1. Afterwards, Claudius removed him from that kingdom to a larger one, giving him the tetrarchy of Philip, which contained Trachonitis, Batanea, and Gaulonitis. He gave him, likewise, the tetrarchy of Lysanias, and the province which <i>Varus</i> had governed. <i>Jos</i>. Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 6, s. 1; Bell. lib. ii. cap. 19, s. 8. Nero made a farther addition, and gave him four cities, <i>Abila, Julias</i> in Peraea, <i>Tarichaea</i> and <i>Tiberias</i> in Galilee: <i>Jos</i>. Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 7, s. 4; Bell. lib. ii. cap 13, s. 2. Claudius gave him the power of appointing the high priest among the Jews; <i>Joseph</i>. Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 1, s. 3; and instances of his exercising this power may be seen in <i>Joseph</i>. Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 7, s. 8, 11. This king was strongly attached to the Romans, and did every thing in his power to prevent the Jews from rebelling against them; and, when he could not prevail, he united his troops to those of Titus, and assisted in the siege of Jerusalem: he survived the ruin of his country several years. See Bishop <i>Pearce</i> and <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bernice</i>, or, as she is sometimes called, <i>Berenice</i>, was sister of this Agrippa, and of the <i>Drusilla</i> mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:24">Acts 24:24</span>: She was at first married to her <i>uncle</i> Herod, king of Chalcis, <i>Jos</i>. Antiq. lib. xix. cap. 9, s. 1; and, on his death, went to live with her brother Agrippa, with whom she was violently suspected to lead an incestuous life. Juvenal, as usual, mentions this in the broadest manner-Sat. vi. ver. 155:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>Barbarus</i> incestae, <i>dedit hunc Agrippa</i> sorori.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Next, a most valuable diamond, rendered more precious by being put on the finger of Berenice; a barbarian gave it to this incestuous woman formerly; and Agrippa gave this to his sister."</p>

<p><i>Josephus</i> mentions the report of her having <i>criminal conversation</i> <i>with her brother Agrippa</i>, φημης επισχουσης, ὁτι τἀδελφῳ συνῃει. To shield herself from this scandal, she persuaded <i>Polemo</i>, king of <i>Cilicia</i>, to embrace the Jewish religion, and marry her; this he was induced to do on account of her <i>great riches</i>; but she soon left him, and he revolted to heathenism: see <i>Jos</i>. Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 7, s. 3. After this, she lived often with her brother, and her life was by no means creditable; she had, however, address to ingratiate herself with Titus Vespasian, and there were even rumours of her becoming empress-propterque insignem reginae Berenices amorem, cui etiam <i>nuptias pollicitus</i> ferebatur.-<i>Suet</i>. in Vit. <i>Titi</i>. Which was prevented by the murmurs of the Roman people: <i>Berenicen statim ab urbe dimisit, invitus invitam</i>.-Ibid. <i>Tacitus</i> also, Hist. lib. ii. cap. 1, speaks of her love intrigue with Titus. From all accounts she must have been a woman of great address; and, upon the whole, an exceptionable character.</p>
