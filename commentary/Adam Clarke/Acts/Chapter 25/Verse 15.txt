<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:15">Acts 25:15</span>. <i><b>Desiring to have judgment against him.</b></i> — Instead of δικην, <i>judgment</i>, καταδικην, <i>condemnation, sentence of death</i>, is the reading of ABC, and several others, which is probably genuine. This is evidently the meaning of the place, whichever reading we prefer. Nothing could satisfy these men but the death of the apostle. It was not <i>justice</i> they wanted, but his destruction.</p>
