Here is a reference to the subject discussed on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:11">Acts 25:11</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face</b></i>, c.] For this righteous procedure the Roman laws were celebrated over the civilized world. APPIAN, in his <i>Hist. Roman</i>., says: ου πατριον σφισιν ακριτους καταδικαζεσθαι. <i>It is not their custom to</i> <i>condemn men before they have been heard</i>. And PHILO <i>De Praesid.</i> <i>Rom</i>., says: τοτε γαρ κοινους ἑαυτους παρεχοντες δικαϚας εξ ισου, και των κατηγορων και απολογουμενων ακουομενοι, μηδενος ακριτου προκαταγινωσκειν αξιουντες, εβραβευον ουτε προς εχθραν, ουτε προς χαριν, αλλα προς την φυσιν της αληθειας, τα δοξαντα ειναι δικαια. "For then, by giving sentence in common, and hearing <i>impartially</i> both <i>plaintiff</i> and <i>defendant</i>, not thinking it right to <i>condemn any person unheard</i>, they decided as appeared to them to be just without either <i>enmity</i> or <i>favour</i>, but according to the merits of the case." See Bp. <i>Pearce</i>. England can boast such laws, not only in her <i>statute books</i>, but in <i>constant operation</i> in all her courts of justice. Even the king himself, were he so inclined, could not imprison nor punish a man without the regular procedure of the law; and <i>twelve honest men</i>, before whom the evidence has been adduced, the case argued, and the law laid down and explained, are ultimately to judge whether the man be guilty or not guilty. <i>Here</i>, in this <i>favoured</i> country, are no <i>arbitrary</i> <i>imprisonments</i>-no <i>Bastiles</i>-no <i>lettres de cachet</i>. <i>Lex facit</i> <i>Regem</i>: the law makes the king, says <i>Bracton</i>, and the king is the grand executor and guardian of the laws-laws, in the eyes of which the <i>character, property</i>, and <i>life</i> of every subject are sacred.</p>
