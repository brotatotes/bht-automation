<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:19">Acts 25:19</span>. <i><b>Questions - of their own superstition</b></i> — Περι της ιδιας δειδιδαιμονιας; <i>Questions concerning their own religion</i>. <i>Superstition</i> meant something as <i>bad</i> among the Romans as it does among us; and is it likely that <i>Festus</i>, only a <i>procurator</i>, should thus speak to <i>Agrippa</i>, a KING, concerning his <i>own religion</i>? He could not have done so without offering the highest insult. The word δεισιδαιμονια must therefore simply mean <i>religion</i>-the <i>national creed</i>, and the <i>national worship</i>, as I have at large proved it to mean, in the observations at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:34">Acts 17:34</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And of one Jesus, which was dead</b></i>, &amp;c.] In this way does this poor heathen speak of the death and resurrection of Christ! There are many who profess Christianity that do not appear to be much farther enlightened.</p>
