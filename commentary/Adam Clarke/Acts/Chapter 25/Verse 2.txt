<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:2">Acts 25:2</span>. <i><b>The high priest - informed him against Paul</b></i> â€” They supposed that as Felix, to please them, on the <i>resignation</i> of his government, had left Paul bound, so Festus, on the <i>assumption</i> of it, would, to please them, deliver him into their hand; but, as they wished this to be done under the <i>colour of justice</i>, they exhibited a number of charges against Paul, which they hoped would appear to Festus a sufficient reason why a new trial should be granted; and he be sent to Jerusalem to take this trial. Their <i>motive</i> is mentioned in the succeeding verse.</p>
