Verse Acts 25:21. Unto the hearing of Augustus — Εις την του ΣεβαϚου διαγνωσιν; To the discrimination of the emperor. For, although σεβαστος is usually translated Augustus, and the Roman emperors generally assumed this epithet, which signifies no more than the venerable, the august, get here it seems to be used merely to express the emperor, without any reference to any of his attributes or titles.
