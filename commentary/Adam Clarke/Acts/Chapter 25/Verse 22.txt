<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:22">Acts 25:22</span>. <i><b>I would also hear the man myself</b></i> â€” A spirit of curiosity, similar to that of Herod, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:8">Luke 23:8</span>.</p>
<p>As Herod, the father of this Agrippa, had been so active an instrument in endeavouring to destroy Christianity, having killed James, and was about to have put Peter to death also, had not God sent him to his own place, there is no doubt that Agrippa had heard much about Christianity; and as to St. Paul, his conversion was so very remarkable that his <i>name</i>, in connection with <i>Christianity</i>, was known, not only throughout Judea, but through all Asia Minor and Greece. Agrippa, therefore might naturally wish to see and hear a man of whom he had heard so much.</p>
