<p><i><b>Unto my Lord</b></i> — The title κυριος, <i>Dominus, Lord</i>, both <i>Augustus</i> and <i>Tiberius</i> had absolutely refused; and forbade, even by public edicts, the application of it to themselves. Tiberius himself was accustomed to say that he was <i>lord</i> only of his <i>slaves, emperor</i> or general of the <i>troops</i>, and <i>prince</i> of the <i>senate</i>. See <i>Suetonius,</i> in his life of this prince. The succeeding emperors were not so modest; they affected the title. Nero, the then emperor, <i>would</i> have it; and Pliny the younger is continually giving it to Trajan in his letters.</p>
