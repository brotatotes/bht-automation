<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:5">Acts 25:5</span>. <i><b>Let them - which among you are able</b></i> — οι δυνατοι, <i>Those</i> <i>who have authority</i>; for so is this word often used by good Greek authors, and by <i>Josephus</i>. Festus seems to have said: "I have heard clamours from the multitude relative to this man; but on such clamours no accusation should be founded: yourselves have only the voice of the multitude as the foundation of the request which you now make. I cannot take up accusations which may affect the life of a Roman citizen on such pretenses. Are there any <i>respectable</i> <i>men</i> among you; men in <i>office</i> and <i>authority</i>, whose <i>character</i> is a pledge for the <i>truth</i> of their depositions, who can prove any thing against him? If so, let these come down to Caesarea, and the cause shall be tried before me; and thus we shall know whether he be a malefactor or not."</p>
