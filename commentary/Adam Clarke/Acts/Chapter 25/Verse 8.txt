<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:8">Acts 25:8</span>. <i><b>While he answered for himself</b></i> â€” In this instance St. Luke gives only a general account, both of the accusations and of St. Paul's defense. But, from the words in this verse, the charges appear to have been threefold:</p>
<p>1. That he had broken the law.</p>
<p>2. That he had defiled the temple.</p>
<p>3. That he dealt in treasonable practices: to all of which he no doubt answered <i>particularly</i>; though we have nothing farther here than this, <i>Neither against the</i> <i>law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against</i> <i>Caesar, have I offended any thing at all</i>.</p>
