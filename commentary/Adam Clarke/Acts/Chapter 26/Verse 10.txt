<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>. <i><b>Many of the saints</b></i> â€” From what is said in this verse, it seems that Paul, before his conversion, was invested with much power: he imprisoned the Christians; punished many in various synagogues; compelled them to blaspheme-to renounce, and, perhaps, to execrate Christ, in order to save their lives; and <i>gave his</i> <i>voice</i>, exerted all his influence and authority, against them, in order that they might be put to death; and from this it would seem that there were other persons put to death besides St. Stephen, though their names are not mentioned.</p>
