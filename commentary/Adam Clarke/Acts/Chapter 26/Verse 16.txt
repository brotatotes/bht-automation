<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span>. <i><b>But rise</b></i>, c.] The particulars mentioned here, and in the two following verses, are not given in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:1-9">Acts 9:1-9</span>, nor in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:6-11">Acts 22:6-11</span>, where he gives an account of his conversion. He has detailed the different circumstances of that important event, as he saw it necessary and perhaps there were several others which then took place, that he had no opportunity of mentioning, because there was nothing in succeeding occurrences which rendered it necessary to produce them.</p>
<p><i><b>To make thee a minister</b></i> — υπηρετην, <i>An under-rower</i>; that is, one who is <i>under the guidance</i> and <i>authority</i> of <i>another</i>; an <i>assistant</i>, or <i>servant</i>. So Paul was to act solely under the authority of Jesus Christ; and <i>tug hard at the oar</i>, in order to bring the vessel, through the tempestuous ocean, to the safe harbour. See the concluding observations on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:0">John 6:0</span>, <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:71">John 6:71</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:71">John 6:71</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And a witness</b></i> — μαρτυρα, A <i>martyr</i>. Though this word literally means a <i>witness</i>, yet we apply it only to such persons as have borne testimony to the truth of God at the hazard and expense of their lives. In this sense, also, ancient history states St. Paul to have been a <i>witness</i>; for it is said he was beheaded at Rome, by the command of Nero.</p>
<p><i><b>In the which I will appear</b></i> — Here Christ gives him to understand that he should have farther communications from himself; and this may refer either to those interpositions of Divine Providence by which he was so often rescued from destruction, or to those encouragements which he received in dreams, visions, trances, &amp;c., or to that general inspiration under which he was enabled to apprehend and reveal the secret things of God, for the edification of the Church. To all of which may be added that <i>astonishing power</i> by which he was so often enabled to work miracles for the confirmation of the truth.</p>
