<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>. <i><b>To open their eyes</b></i> — To be the instrument of informing their <i>understanding</i> in the things of God.</p>
<p><i><b>To turn</b></i><b> them </b><i><b>from darkness to light</b></i> — From <i>heathenism</i> and <i>superstition</i> to the <i>knowledge</i> and <i>worship</i> of the true God.</p>
<p><b>From </b><i><b>the power of Satan unto God</b></i> — Της εξουσιας του Σατανα, From the <i>authority</i> and <i>domination</i> of Satan; for as the kingdom of darkness is his kingdom, so those who live in this darkness are under his dominion; and he has <i>authority</i> and <i>right</i> over them. The blessed Gospel of Christ is the means of bringing the soul from this state of spiritual darkness and wretchedness to the light and liberty of the children of God; and thus they are brought from under the <i>power</i> and <i>authority of Satan, to be under the power and</i> <i>authority</i> of GOD.</p>
<p><i><b>That they may receive forgiveness of sins</b></i> — That all their sins may be pardoned, and their souls sanctified; for nothing less is implied in the phrase, αφεσις ἁμαρτιων, which signifies the <i>taking</i> <i>away</i> or <i>removal of sins</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And inheritance</b></i> — By remission of sins, i.e. the removal of the guilt and pollution of sin, they become children of God; and, if <i>children</i>, then <i>heirs</i>; for the children of the heavenly family shall alone possess the heavenly <i>estate</i>. And as the inheritance is said to be <i>among them that are</i> SANCTIFIED, this is a farther proof that αφεσις ἁμαρτιων signifies, not only the <i>forgiveness of sins</i>, but also the <i>purification of the heart</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>By faith that is in me.</b></i> — By believing on Christ Jesus, as dying for their offenses, and rising again for their justification. Thus we see that not only this salvation comes through <i>Christ</i>, but that it is to be received by <i>faith</i>; and, consequently, neither by the merit of <i>works</i>, nor by that of <i>suffering</i>.</p>
