<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:21">Acts 26:21</span>. <i><b>For these causes the Jews - went about to kill</b></i><b> me.</b>] These <i>causes</i> may be reduced to <i>four</i> heads:-</p>
<p>1. He had maintained the <i>resurrection of the dead</i>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>resurrection of Christ</i>, whom they had crucified and slain.</p>
<p>3. That this <i>Jesus was the promised</i> <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
<p>4. He had <i>offered salvation</i> to <i>the Gentiles</i> as <i>well as</i> <i>to the Jews</i>. He does not mention the accusation of having <i>defiled</i> <i>the temple</i>, nor of <i>disloyalty to the Roman government</i>; probably, because his adversaries had abandoned these charges at his preceding trial before Festus: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:8">Acts 25:8</span>; and see <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
