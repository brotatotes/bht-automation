Verse Acts 26:21. For these causes the Jews - went about to kill me.] These causes may be reduced to four heads:-1. He had maintained the resurrection of the dead.2. The resurrection of Christ, whom they had crucified and slain.3. That this Jesus was the promised Messiah.4. He had offered salvation to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews. He does not mention the accusation of having defiled the temple, nor of disloyalty to the Roman government; probably, because his adversaries had abandoned these charges at his preceding trial before Festus: see Acts 25:8; and see Calmet.
