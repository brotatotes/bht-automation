<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:22">Acts 26:22</span>. <i><b>Having - obtained help of God</b></i> — According to the gracious promise made to him: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:17">Acts 26:17</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Witnessing both to small and great</b></i> — Preaching before kings, rulers, priests, and peasants; fearing no evil, though ever surrounded with evils; nor slackening in my duty, notwithstanding the opposition I have met with both from Jews and Gentiles. And these continual interpositions of God show me that I have not mistaken my call, and encourage me to go forward in my work.</p>
