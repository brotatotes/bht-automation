<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23">Acts 26:23</span>. <i><b>That Christ should suffer</b></i> — That <i>the Christ</i>, or <i>Messiah</i>, should suffer. This, though fully revealed in the prophets, the prejudices of the Jews would not permit them to receive: they expected their Messiah to be a <i>glorious secular</i> <i>prince</i>; and, to reconcile the fifty-third of Isaiah with their system, they formed the childish notion of two Messiahs-<i>Messiah</i> <i>ben David</i>, who should reign, conquer, and triumph; and <i>Messiah ben</i> <i>Ephraim</i>, who should suffer and be put to death. A distinction which has not the smallest foundation in the whole Bible.</p>
<p>As the apostle says he preached <i>none other things than those</i> <i>which Moses and the prophets said should come</i>, therefore he understood that both Moses and the prophets spoke of the <i>resurrection of the dead</i>, as well as of the <i>passion</i> and <i>resurrection of Christ</i>. If this be so, the favourite system of a learned bishop cannot be true; viz. that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul was unknown to the ancient Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>That he should be the first that should rise from the dead</b></i> — That is, that he should be the first who should rise from the dead so as <i>to die no more</i>; and to give, in his own person, the proof of the resurrection of the human body, no more to return under the empire of death. In no other sense can Jesus Christ be said to be the <i>first that rose again from the dead</i>; for Elisha raised the son of the Shunammite. A dead man, put into the sepulchre of the Prophet Elisha, was restored to life as soon as he touched the prophet's bones. Christ himself had raised the widow's son at Nain; and he had also raised Lazarus, and several others. All these died again; but the human nature of our Lord was raised from the dead, and can die no more. Thus he was the first who rose again from the dead to return no more into the empire of death.</p>
<p><i><b>And should show light unto the people</b></i> — Should give the true knowledge of the law and the prophets to the Jews; for these are meant by the term <i>people</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:17">Acts 26:17</span>. <i>And to the Gentiles</i>, who had no revelation, and who sat in the valley of the shadow of death: these also, through Christ, should be brought to the knowledge of the truth, and be made a glorious Church, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. That the Messiah should be the <i>light</i> both of the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>, the prophets had clearly foretold: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>: <i>Arise and shine</i>, or be <i>illuminated, for thy LIGHT is come, and</i> <i>the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee</i>. And again, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>: <i>I will give thee for a LIGHT to the GENTILES, that thou mayest</i> <i>be my salvation unto the ends of the earth</i>. With such sayings as these Agrippa was well acquainted, from his education as a Jew.</p>
