<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:25">Acts 26:25</span>. <i><b>I am not mad, most noble Festus</b></i> — This most sensible, appropriate, and modest answer, was the fullest proof he could give of his <i>sound sense</i> and <i>discretion</i>. The title, κρατιστε, <i>most noble</i>, or <i>most excellent</i>, which he gives to Festus, shows at once that he was far above indulging any sentiment of <i>anger</i> or <i>displeasure</i> at Festus, though he had called him a <i>madman</i>; and it shows farther that, with the strictest conscientiousness, even an <i>apostle</i> may give <i>titles of respect</i> to men in power, which taken <i>literally</i>, imply much more than the persons <i>deserve</i> to whom they are applied. κρατιστος, which implies <i>most excellent</i>, was merely a <i>title</i> which belonged to the <i>office</i> of Festus. St. Paul hereby acknowledges him as the <i>governor</i>; while, perhaps, <i>moral excellence</i> of any kind could with no propriety be attributed to him.</p>
<p><i><b>Speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</b></i> — αληθειας και σωφροσυνης, Words of <i>truth and of mental soundness</i>. The very terms used by the apostle would at once convince Festus that he was mistaken. The σωφροσυνη of the apostle was elegantly opposed to the μανια of the governor: the one signifying <i>mental derangement</i>, the other <i>mental sanity</i>. Never was an answer, on the spur of the moment, more happily conceived.</p>
