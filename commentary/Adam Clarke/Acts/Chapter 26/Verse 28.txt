<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:28">Acts 26:28</span>. <i><b>Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</b></i> — Εν ολιγῳ με πειθεις ΧριϚιανον γενεσθαι. This declaration was almost the necessary consequence of the apostle's reasoning, and Agrippa's faith. If he believed the prophets, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:22">Acts 26:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23">Acts 26:23</span>, and believed that Paul's application of their words to Christ Jesus was correct, he must acknowledge the <i>truth</i> of the Christian religion; but he might <i>choose</i> whether he would <i>embrace</i> and <i>confess</i> this truth, or not. However, the sudden appeal to his religious faith extorts from him the declaration, <i>Thou hast nearly persuaded</i> <i>me to embrace Christianity</i>. How it could have entered into the mind of any man, who carefully considered the <i>circumstances</i> of the case, to suppose that these words of Agrippa are spoken <i>ironically</i>, is to me unaccountable. Every circumstance in the case proves them to have been the genuine effusion of a heart persuaded of the truth; and only prevented from fully acknowledging it by secular considerations.</p>
