<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:29">Acts 26:29</span>. <i><b>I would to God</b></i>, c.] Ευξαιμην αν τῳ Θεῳ, και εν ολιγῳ και εν πολλῳ - So fully am I persuaded of the infinite excellence of Christianity, and so truly happy am I in possession of it, that <i>I</i> <i>most ardently wish that not only thou, but this whole council,</i> <i>were not only almost, but altogether, such as I am, these CHAINS</i> <i>excepted</i>. Thus, while his heart glows with affection for their best interests, he wishes that they might enjoy all his blessings, if possible, without being obliged to bear any cross on the account. His <i>holding up his chain</i>, which was probably now detached from the soldier's arm, and wrapped about his own, must have made a powerful impression on the minds of his audience. Indeed, it appears they could <i>bear the scene no longer</i> the king was overwhelmed, and rose up instantly, and so did the rest of the council, and went immediately aside; and, after a very short conference among themselves, they unanimously pronounced him innocent; and his <i>last word</i>, των δεσμων, BONDS! and the <i>action</i> with which it was accompanied, had made such a deep impression upon their hearts that they conclude their judgment with that very identical word δεσμων. Would to God, says the apostle, that all who hear me this day were altogether such as as I am, except <i>these</i> BONDS! The whole council say-This man hath done nothing worthy of death nor of BONDS! δεσμων, BONDS, is <i>echoed</i> by them from the last words of the apostle; as we may plainly perceive that, seeing such an innocent and <i>eminent</i> man suffering such indignity had made a deep impression upon their hearts. Alas! why should such a man be in B-O-N-D-S!</p>
