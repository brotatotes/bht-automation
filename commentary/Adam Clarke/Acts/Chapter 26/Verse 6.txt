<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:6">Acts 26:6</span>. <i><b>For the hope of the promise</b></i> — This does not appear to mean, <i>the hope of the Messiah</i>, as some have imagined, but <i>the hope</i> <i>of the resurrection of the dead</i>, to which the apostle referred in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>, where he says to the Jewish council, (from which the Roman governor took him,) <i>of the hope and resurrection of the dead</i> <i>I am called in question</i>: see the notes there. And here he says, <i>I</i> <i>stand and am judged for the hope of the promise</i>, c., and <i>to</i> <i>which</i>, he says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span>, the <i>twelve tribes hope to come</i>. The Messiah <i>had</i> come, and was gone again, as Paul well knew and what is here meant is something which the Jews hoped to <i>come to</i>, or <i>attain</i>; not what was <i>to come</i> <i>to them</i>; and this singular observation excludes the Messiah from being meant. It was the resurrection of all men from the dead which Paul's words signified; and this the Jews had been taught to hope for, by many passages in the Old Testament. I shall only add, that when, in the next verse, this hope of the promise is mentioned as what the Jews did then <i>hope</i>, καταντηοαι, <i>to come to</i>, it is the very same word which Paul, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11">Philippians 3:11</span>, uses to express the same thing: <i>If by any means</i>, (says he) καταντησω, <i>I might</i> <i>attain to, the resurrection of the dead</i>.
