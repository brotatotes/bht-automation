<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:8">Acts 26:8</span>. <i><b>That God should raise the dead?</b></i> â€” As Agrippa believed in the true God, and knew that one of his attributes was <i>omnipotence</i>, he could not believe that the resurrection of the dead was an <i>impossible</i> thing; and to this belief of his the apostle appeals; and the more especially, because the Sadducees denied the doctrine of the resurrection, though they professed to believe in the same God. <i>Two</i> attributes of God stood pledged to produce this resurrection: his <i>truth</i>, on which his promise was founded; and his <i>power</i>, by which the thing could be easily affected, as that power is <i>unlimited</i>.</p>
<p>Some of the best critics think this verse should be read thus: <i>What! should it be thought a thing incredible with you, if God</i> <i>should raise the dead</i>?</p>
