<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:11">Acts 27:11</span>. <i><b>The centurion believed the master</b></i> — τω κυβερνητη, the <i>pilot; and owner of the ship</i>, τω ναυκληρω, the <i>captain</i> and <i>proprietor</i>. This latter had the command of the ship and the crew; the <i>pilot</i> had the guidance of the vessel along those dangerous coasts, under the direction of the captain; and the centurion had the power to cause them to proceed on their voyage, or to go into port, as he pleased; as he had other state prisoners on board; and probably the ship itself was freighted for government. Paul told them, if they proceeded, they would be in danger of shipwreck; the <i>pilot</i> and <i>captain</i> said there was <i>no</i> danger; and the <i>centurion</i>, believing them, commanded the vessel to proceed on her voyage. It is likely that they were now in the port called <i>the Fair Havens</i>.</p>
