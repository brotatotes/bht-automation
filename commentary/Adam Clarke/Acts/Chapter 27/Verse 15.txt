Verse Acts 27:15. And when the ship was caught — Συναρπασθεντος δε του πλοιου. The ship was violently hurried away before this strong levanter; so that it was impossible for her, αντοφθαλμειν, to face the wind, to turn her prow to it, so as to shake it out, as I have heard sailors say, and have seen them successfully perform in violent tempests and squalls.We let her drive. — We were obliged to let her go right before this tempestuous wind, whithersoever it might drive her.
