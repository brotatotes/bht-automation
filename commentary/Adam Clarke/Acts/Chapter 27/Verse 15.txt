The ship was violently hurried away before this strong <i>levanter</i>; so that it was impossible for her, αντοφθαλμειν, to <i>face the wind</i>, to <i>turn her prow to it</i>, so as to <i>shake it out</i>, as I have heard sailors say, and have seen them successfully perform in violent tempests and squalls.</p>
<p><i><b>We let her drive.</b></i> — We were obliged to let her go right before this tempestuous wind, whithersoever it might drive her.</p>
