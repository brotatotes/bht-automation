<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>. <i><b>A ship of Adramyttium</b></i> — There were several places of this name; and in different MSS. the name is variously written. The port in question appears to have been a place in Mysia, in Asia Minor. And the abbé <i>Vertot</i>, in his history of the <i>Knights of</i> <i>Malta</i>, says it is now called <i>Mehedia</i>. Others think it was a city and seaport of <i>Africa</i>, whence the ship mentioned above had been fitted out; but it is more probable that the city and seaport here meant is that on the coast of the AEgean Sea, opposite Mitylene, and not far from Pergamos. See its situation on the <i>map</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Aristarchus, a Macedonian</b></i> — We have seen this person with St. Paul at Ephesus, during the disturbances there, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>, where he had been seized by the mob, and was in great personal danger. He afterwards attended Paul to Macedonia, and returned with him to Asia, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>. Now, accompanying him to Rome, he was there a <i>fellow prisoner</i> with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>, and is mentioned in St. Paul's epistle to Philemon, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>, who was probably their common friend.-<i>Dodd</i>. Luke and Aristarchus were certainly not prisoners at this time, and seem to have gone with St. Paul merely as his companions, through affection to him, and love for the cause of Christianity. How Aristarchus became his <i>fellow prisoner</i>, as is stated <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>, we cannot tell, but it could not have been at this time.</p>
