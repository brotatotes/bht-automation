<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:21">Acts 27:21</span>. <i><b>After long abstinence</b></i> — Πολλης δε ασιτιας ὑπαρχουσης. Mr. Wakefield connects this with the preceding verse, and translates it thus: <i>Especially as there was a great scarcity of</i> <i>provisions</i>. But this by no means can agree with what is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:34-38">Acts 27:34-38</span>. The vessel was a <i>corn vessel</i>; and they had not as yet thrown the <i>wheat</i> into the sea, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:38">Acts 27:38</span>. And we find they had <i>food</i> sufficient to eat, but were discouraged, and so utterly hopeless of life that they had no appetite for food: besides, the storm was so great that it is not likely they could <i>dress</i> any thing.</p>
<p><i><b>Have gained this harm and loss.</b></i> — It seems strange to talk of <i>gaining</i> a <i>loss</i>, but it is a correct rendering of the original, κερδησαι, which expresses the idea of <i>acquisition</i>, whether of <i>good</i> or <i>evil</i>. Those who wish it, may see this use of the term well illustrated by Bp. <i>Pearce</i>, in his note on this verse. The <i>harm</i> was damage to the vessel; the <i>loss</i> was that of the merchandise, furniture, &amp;c.</p>
