Verse Acts 27:21. After long abstinence — Πολλης δε ασιτιας ὑπαρχουσης. Mr. Wakefield connects this with the preceding verse, and translates it thus: Especially as there was a great scarcity of provisions. But this by no means can agree with what is said, Acts 27:34-38. The vessel was a corn vessel; and they had not as yet thrown the wheat into the sea, see Acts 27:38. And we find they had food sufficient to eat, but were discouraged, and so utterly hopeless of life that they had no appetite for food: besides, the storm was so great that it is not likely they could dress any thing.Have gained this harm and loss. — It seems strange to talk of gaining a loss, but it is a correct rendering of the original, κερδησαι, which expresses the idea of acquisition, whether of good or evil. Those who wish it, may see this use of the term well illustrated by Bp. Pearce, in his note on this verse. The harm was damage to the vessel; the loss was that of the merchandise, furniture, &c.
