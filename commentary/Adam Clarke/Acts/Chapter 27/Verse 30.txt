<p>Verse 30. <i><b>The shipmen</b></i> â€” <i>The sailors - let down the boat</i>. Having lowered the boat from the deck into the sea, they pretended that it was necessary to carry some anchors <i>ahead</i>, to keep her from being carried in a dangerous direction by the tide, but with the real design to make for shore, and so leave the prisoners and the passengers to their fate. This was timely noticed by the pious and prudent apostle; who, while simply depending on the promise of God, was watching for the safety and comfort of all.</p>
