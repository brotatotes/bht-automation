<p>Verse 33. <i><b>While the day was coining on</b></i> — It was then apparently about day-break.</p>

Indeed we may take it for granted that, during the whole of the storm, very little was eaten by any man: for what appetite could men have for food, who every moment had death before their eyes?</p>
