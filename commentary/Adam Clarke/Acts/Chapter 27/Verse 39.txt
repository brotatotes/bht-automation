<p>Verse 39. <i><b>They knew not the land</b></i> — And therefore knew neither the nature of the coast, nor where the proper port lay.</p>
<p><i><b>A-creek with a shore</b></i> — κολπον, <i>Sinum</i>, a bay, with a shore; a neck of land perhaps on either side, running out into the sea, and this little bay or gulf between them; though some think it was a tongue of land, running out into the sea, having the sea on both sides, at the point of which these <i>two seas met</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:41">Acts 27:41</span>. There is such a place as this in the island of <i>Malta</i>, where, tradition says, Paul was shipwrecked; and which is called <i>la Cale de St.</i> <i>Paul</i>. See <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
