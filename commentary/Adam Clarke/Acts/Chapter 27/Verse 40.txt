<p>Verse 40. <i><b>Taken up the anchors</b></i> — Weighed all the anchors that they had cast out of the stern. Some think the meaning of the word is, they slipped their cables; and so left the anchors in the sea. This opinion is expressed in the <i>margin</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Loosed the rudder bands</b></i> — Or, the bands of the rudders; for large vessels in ancient times had two or more rudders, one at the side, and another at the stern, and sometimes one at the prow. The <i>bands</i>, ζευκτηριας, were some kind of fastenings, by which the rudders were hoisted some way out of the water; for, as they could be of no use in the storm, and, should there come fair weather, the vessel could not do without them, this was a prudent way of securing them from being broken to pieces by the agitation of the waves. These bands being loosed, the rudders would fall down into their proper places, and serve to steer the vessel into the creek which they now had in view.</p>
<p><i><b>Hoisted up the mainsail</b></i> — αρτεμονα is not the <i>mainsail</i>, (which would have been quite improper on such an occasion,) but the <i>jib</i>, or triangular sail which is suspended from the foremast to the <i>bowspirit</i>; with this they might hope both to steer and carry in the ship.</p>
