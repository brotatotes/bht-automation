Verse 41. Where two seas meet — The tide running down from each side of the tongue of land, mentioned Acts 27:39, and meeting at the point.Ran the ship aground — In striving to cross at this point of land, they had not taken a sufficiency of sea-room, and therefore ran aground.The forepart stuck fast — Got into the sands; and perhaps the shore here was very bold or steep, so that the stem of the vessel might be immersed in the quicksands, which would soon close round it, while the stern, violently agitated with the surge, would soon be broken to pieces. It is extremely difficult to find the true meaning of several of the nautical terms used in this chapter. I have given that which appeared to me to be the most likely; but cannot absolutely say that I have everywhere hit the true meaning.
