<p><i><b>Myra</b></i><b>, a city </b><i><b>of Lycia.</b></i> — The name of this city is written variously in the MSS., <i>Myra, Murrha, Smyra</i>, and <i>Smyrna</i>. Grotius conjectures that all these names are <i>corrupted</i>, and that it should be written <i>Limyra</i>, which is the name both of a <i>river</i> and <i>city</i> in Lycia. It is certain that, in common conversation, the first syllable, <i>li</i>, might be readily dropped, and then <i>Myra</i>, the word in the text, would remain. Strabo mentions both <i>Myra</i> and <i>Limyra</i>, lib. xiv. p. 666. The former, he says, is <i>twenty stadia from the sea</i>, επιμετεωρουλοφου, <i>upon a high hill</i>: the latter, he says, is the name of a <i>river</i>; and <i>twenty stadia up this river is the town</i> <i>Limyra itself</i>. These places were not far distant, and one of them is certainly meant.</p>
