<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:9">Acts 27:9</span>. <i><b>Sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now</b></i><b> </b><i><b>already past</b></i> â€” It is generally allowed that the fast mentioned here was that of the <i>great day of atonement</i> which was always celebrated on the <i>tenth</i> day of the <i>seventh</i> month, which would answer to the latter end of our <i>September</i>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:29">Leviticus 16:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:27">Leviticus 23:27</span>, &amp;c. As this was about the time of the autumnal equinox, when the Mediterranean Sea was sufficiently tempestuous, we may suppose this feast alone to be intended. To sail after this feast was proverbially dangerous among the ancient Jews. See proofs in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
