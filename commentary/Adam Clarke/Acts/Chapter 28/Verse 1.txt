<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:1">Acts 28:1</span>. <i><b>They knew that the island was called Melita.</b></i> — There were two islands of this name: one in the <i>Adriatic Gulf</i>, or Gulf of Venice, on the coast of Illyricum, and near to Epidaurus; the other in the Mediterranean Sea, between Sicily and Africa, and now called <i>Malta</i>. It is about fifty miles from the coast of Sicily; twenty miles long, and twelve miles in its greatest breadth; and about sixty miles in circumference. It is one immense rock of white, soft freestone, with about one foot depth of earth on an average, and most of this has been brought from Sicily! It produces cotton, excellent fruits, and fine <i>honey</i>; from which it appears the island originally had its name; for μελι, <i>meli</i>, and in the genitive case, μελιτος, <i>melitos</i>, signifies <i>honey</i>. Others suppose that it derived its name from the Phoenicians, who established a colony in it, and made it a place of <i>refuge</i>, when they extended their traffic to the ocean, because it was furnished with excellent harbours: (on the E. and W. shores:) hence, in their tongue, it would be called מליטה <i>Meliteh</i>, escape or refuge, from מלט <i>malat</i>, to <i>escape</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Phaeacians</i> were probably the <i>first</i> inhabitants of this island: they were expelled by the <i>Phoenicians</i>; the Phoenicians by the <i>Greeks</i>; the Greeks by the <i>Carthaginians</i>; the Carthaginians by the <i>Romans</i>, who possessed it in the time of the apostle; the Romans by the <i>Goths</i>; the Goths by the <i>Saracens</i>; the Saracens by the <i>Sicilians</i>, under Roger, earl of Sicily, in 1190. Charles V., emperor of Germany, took possession of it by his conquest of Naples and Sicily; and he gave it in 1525 to the <i>knights of</i> <i>Rhodes</i>, who are also called the knights of St. John of Jerusalem. In 1798, this island surrendered to the <i>French</i>, under Bonaparte, and in 1800, after a blockade of two years, the island being reduced by famine, surrendered to the <i>British</i>, under whose dominion it still remains (1814.) Every thing considered, there can be little doubt that this is the <i>Melita</i> at which St. Paul was wrecked, and not at that other island in the <i>Adriatic</i>, or <i>Venitian</i> <i>Gulf</i>, as high up <i>northward</i> as Illyricum. The following reasons make this greatly evident:</p>
<p>1. <i>Tradition</i> has unvaryingly asserted this as the place of the apostle's shipwreck.</p>
<p>2. The island in the Venitian Gulf, in favour of which Mr. Bryant so learnedly contends, is totally <i>out of the track</i> in which the <i>euroclydon</i> must have driven the vessel.</p>
<p>3. It is said, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:11">Acts 28:11</span>, that another ship of Alexandria, bound, as we must suppose, for Italy, and very probably carrying <i>wheat</i> thither, as St. Paul's vessel did, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:38">Acts 27:38</span>,) had been driven out of its course of sailing, by stress of weather, up to the Illyricum <i>Melita</i>, and had been for that cause obliged to winter in the isle. Now this is a <i>supposition</i> which, as I think, is too much of a <i>supposition</i> to be made.</p>
<p>4. In St. Paul's voyage to Italy from Melita, on board the Alexandrian ship that had wintered there, he and his companions landed at Syracuse, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:12-13">Acts 28:12-13</span>, and from thence went to Rhegium. But if it had been the <i>Illyrican Melita</i>, the proper course of the ship would have been, first to <i>Rhegium</i>, before it reached <i>Syracuse</i>, and needed not to have gone to Syracuse at all; whereas, in a voyage from the present <i>Malta</i> to Italy, it was necessary to reach Syracuse, in Sicily, before the ship could arrive at Rhegium in Italy. See the map; and see Bp. Pearce, from whom I have extracted the <i>two</i> last arguments.</p>
<p>That Malta was possessed by the <i>Phoenicians</i>, before the Romans conquered it, Bochart has largely proved; and indeed the language to the present day, notwithstanding all the political vicissitudes through which the island has passed, bears sufficient evidence of its <i>Punic</i> origin. In the year 1761, near a place called <i>Ben Ghisa</i>, in this island, a sepulchral cave was discovered, in which was a square stone with an inscription in <i>Punic</i> or <i>Phoenician</i> <i>characters</i>, on which Sir Wm. Drummond has written a learned essay, (London, Valpy, 1810, 4to.,) which he supposes marks the burial place, at least of the <i>ashes</i>, of the famous Carthaginian general, <i>Hannibal</i>. I shall give this inscription in Samaritan characters, as being the present form of the ancient Punic, with Sir Wm. Drummond's translation: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "The inner chamber of the sanctuary of the sepulchre</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> of Hannibal,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Illustrious in the consummation of calamity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> He was beloved;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The people lament, when arrayed</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> In order of battle,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Hannibal the son of Bar-Melec."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>As this is a curious piece, and one of the largest remains of the Punic language now in existence, and as it helps to ascertain the ancient inhabitants of this <i>island</i>, I thought it not improper to insert it here. For the illustration of this and several other points of Punic antiquity, I must refer the curious reader to the essay itself.</p>
