<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:10">Acts 28:10</span>. <i><b>Honoured us with many honours</b></i> — The word τιμη, as Bishop Pearce has remarked, is often used to signify a pecuniary <i>recompense</i>, or <i>present</i>. The Greek word seems to be thus used in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>. <i>Let the elders which rule well be accounted worthy of double</i> <i>HONOUR</i>, τιμης, which St. Chrysostom, on the place, explains thus: την των αναγκαιων χορηγιαν· <i>a supplying them with all necessary</i> <i>things</i>. Diodorus Siculus, and Xenophon, used the word in the same way. In the sense of a <i>pecuniary recompense</i>, or <i>price</i>, paid for any thing, the word τιμη is met with in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23">1 Corinthians 7:23</span>. And in the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:17">Numbers 22:17</span>; compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:18">Numbers 22:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:5">Psalms 8:5</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+49:12">Psalms 49:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:9">Proverbs 3:9</span>.

<p><i><b>Such things as were necessary.</b></i> — They had before given them many presents, and now they gave them a good <i>sea stock</i>; all that was necessary for their passage.</p>
