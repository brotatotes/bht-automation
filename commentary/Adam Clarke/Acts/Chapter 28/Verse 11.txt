<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:11">Acts 28:11</span>. <i><b>After three months</b></i> — Supposing that they had reached Malta about the end of <i>October</i>, as we have already seen, then it appears that they left it about the end of <i>January</i>, or the beginning of <i>February</i>; and, though in the depth of winter, not the worst time for sailing, even in those seas, the wind being then generally more <i>steady</i>; and, on the whole, the passage more safe.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</b></i> — These were two fabulous semi-deities, reported to be the sons of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Leda</i>, who were afterwards translated to the heavens, and made the constellation called <i>Gemini</i>, or the <i>Twins</i>. This constellation was deemed propitious to mariners; and, as it was customary to have the images of their gods both on the head and stern of their ships, we may suppose that this Alexandrian ship had these on either her <i>prow</i> or <i>stern</i>, and that these gave name to the ship. We, who profess to be a <i>Christian</i> people, follow the same heathen custom: we have out ships called the <i>Castor</i>, the <i>Jupiter</i>, the <i>Minerva</i>, the <i>Leda</i>, (the mother of Castor and Pollux,) with a multitude of other demon gods and goddesses; so that, were ancient <i>Romans</i> or <i>Grecians</i> to visit our navy, they would be led to suppose that, after the lapse of more than 2000 years, their old religion had continued unaltered!</p>

<p>Several ancient fables appear to have arisen out of the names of ships. Jupiter is fabled to have carried off <i>Europa</i>, across the sea, in the shape of a bull; and to have carried away Ganymede, in the shape of an <i>eagle</i>. That is, these persons were carried away, one in a ship called <i>Taurus</i>, or <i>Bull</i>; and the other in one denominated <i>Aquila</i>, the <i>Eagle</i>. Why not <i>Taurus</i>, as well as <i>Tigris</i>? and why not <i>Aquila</i>, as well as <i>Chimera</i>?-which names did belong to ships, as we find from the above quotations.</p>
