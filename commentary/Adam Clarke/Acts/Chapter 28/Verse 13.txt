<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:13">Acts 28:13</span>. <i><b>We fetched a compass</b></i> — οθεν περιελθοντες, <i>Whence we</i> <i>coasted about</i>. This will appear evident, when the coast of Sicily is viewed on any correct map, of a tolerably large scale.</p>
<p><i><b>Rhegium</b></i> — A city and promontory in Calabria, in Italy, opposite to Sicily. It is now called <i>Reggio</i>. It had its name, ρηγιον, <i>Rhegium</i>, from the Greek ρηγνυμι, <i>to break off</i>; because it appears to have been <i>broken off</i> from Sicily.</p>
<p><i><b>The south wind blew</b></i> — This was the fairest wind they could have from Syracuse, to reach the straits of Rhegium.</p>
<p><i><b>The next day to Puteoli</b></i> — This place, now commonly called <i>Pozzuoli</i>, is an ancient town of Naples in the <i>Terra di Lavoro</i>; and is supposed to have been founded by the <i>Samians</i>, about 470 years before Christ. Within this city are several <i>warm baths</i>, very highly celebrated; and from these, and its springs in general, it seems to have had its ancient name <i>Puteoli</i>, from PUTEI, <i>wells</i> or <i>pits</i>; though some derive it from <i>putor</i>, a <i>stench</i>, or <i>bad</i> <i>smell</i>, because of the <i>sulphureous</i> exhalations from its warm waters. <i>Varro</i> gives both these etymologies, lib. iv. de <i>Ling. Lat</i>. cap. 5. It is famous for its temple of Jupiter Serapis, which is built, not according to the Grecian or Roman manner, but according to the <i>Asiatic</i>. Near this place are the remains of <i>Cicero's</i> villa, which are of great extent. The town contains, at present, about 10,000 inhabitants. Long. 14°. 40'. E., lat. 41°. 50'. N.</p>
