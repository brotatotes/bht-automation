<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:14">Acts 28:14</span>. <i><b>Where we found brethren</b></i> — That is, <i>Christians</i>; for there had been many in Italy converted to the faith of Christ, some considerable time before this, as appears from St. Paul's epistle to the Romans, written some years before this voyage.</p>
<p><i><b>We went toward Rome.</b></i> — One of the most celebrated cities in the universe, the capital of Italy, and once of the <i>whole world</i>; situated on the river Tiber, 410 miles SSE. of Vienna; 600 SE. of Paris; 730 E. by N. of Madrid; 760 W. of Constantinople; and 780 SE. of London. Long. 12°. 55'. E., lat. 41°. 54'. N. This famous city was founded by <i>Romulus</i>, at the end of the seventh Olympiad, A.M. 3251; of the flood, 1595; and 753 years before the Christian aera. The history of this city must be sought for in works written expressly on the subject, of which there are many. <i>Modern Rome</i> is greatly inferior to <i>ancient Rome</i> in every respect. Its population, taken in 1709, amounted to 138,569 souls only; among whom were 40 <i>bishops</i>, 2686 <i>priests</i>, 3359 <i>monks</i>, 1814 <i>nuns</i>, 893 <i>courtezans</i>, between 8 and 9000 <i>Jews</i>, and 14 <i>Moors</i>. This city, which once tyrannized over the world by its arms, and over the whole Christian world by its popes, is now reduced to a very low state among the governments of Europe, by whom it is supported, for it has no power sufficient for its own defence.</p>
