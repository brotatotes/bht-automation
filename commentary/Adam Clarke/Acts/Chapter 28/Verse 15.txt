<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:15">Acts 28:15</span>. <i><b>When the brethren heard of us</b></i> — By <i>whom</i> the Gospel was planted at Rome is not known: it does not appear that any <i>apostle</i> was employed in this work. It was probably carried thither by some of those who were converted to God at the day of pentecost; for there were then at Jerusalem, not only <i>devout men</i>, proselytes to the Jewish religion, <i>from every nation under heaven</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:5">Acts 2:5</span>, but there were <i>strangers of Rome</i> also, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:10">Acts 2:10</span>. And it in most reasonable to believe, as we know of no other origin, that it was by these Christianity was planted at Rome.</p>
<p><i><b>As far as Appii Forum</b></i> — About 52 miles from Rome; a long way to come on purpose to meet the apostle! The <i>Appii Forum</i>, or <i>Market of</i> <i>Appius</i>, was a town on the <i>Appian</i> way, a road paved from Rome to Campania, by the consul <i>Appius Claudius</i>. It was near the sea, and was a famous resort for sailors, peddlers, c. Horace, lib. i. Satyr. 5, ver. 3, mentions this place on his journey from Rome to Brundusium:- </p>
<p><i><b>And the Three Taverns</b></i> — This was another place on the same road, and about 33 miles from Rome. Some of the Roman Christians had come as far as <i>Appii Forum</i>: others, to the <i>Three Taverns</i>. Bp. Pearce remarks, there are some ruins in that place which are now called <i>Tre Taverne</i> and this place Cicero mentions in his epistles to Atticus, lib. ii. 11. <i>Ab</i> Appi Foro <i>hora quarta: dederam aliam</i> <i>paulo ante in</i> Tribus Tabernis. "Dated at ten in the morning, from <i>Appii Forum</i>. I sent off another (epistle) a little before, from the <i>Three Taverns</i>."</p>
<p>Zosimus, lib. 2, mentions τρια καπηλεια, the <i>three taverns</i>, or <i>victualling houses</i>, where the Emperor <i>Severus</i> was strangled by the treason of <i>Maximinus Herculeus</i>, and his son <i>Maxentius</i>. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>The word <i>taberna</i>, from <i>trabs</i>, a beam, signifies any building formed of <i>timber</i>; such as those we call <i>booths, sheds</i>, c., which are formed of <i>beams, planks, boards</i>, and the like and therefore me may consider it as implying, either a <i>temporary</i> residence, or some <i>mean building</i>, such as a <i>cottage</i>, c. And in this sense Horace evidently uses it, Carm. lib. i. Od. iv. ver. 13:- </p>
<p><i><b>Thanked God, and took courage.</b></i> — He had longed to see Rome; (see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9-15">Romans 1:9-15</span>;) and, finding himself brought through so many calamities, and now so near the place that he was met by a part of that Church to which, some years before, he had written an epistle, <i>he gave thanks to God</i>, who had preserved him, and <i>took</i> fresh <i>courage</i>, in the prospect of bearing there a testimony for his Lord and Master.</p>
