<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:17">Acts 28:17</span>. <i><b>Paul called the chief of the Jews together</b></i> — We have already seen, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>, that <i>Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome</i>; see the note there: but it seems they were permitted to return very soon; and, from this verse, it appears that there were then <i>chiefs</i>, probably of <i>synagogues</i>, dwelling at Rome.</p>
<p><i><b>I have committed nothing</b></i> — Lest they should have heard and received malicious reports against him, he thought it best to state his own case.</p>
