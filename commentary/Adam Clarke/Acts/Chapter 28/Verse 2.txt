<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:2">Acts 28:2</span>. <i><b>The barbarous people</b></i> — We have already seen that this island was peopled by the Phoenicians, or Carthaginians, as Bochart has proved, <i>Phaleg</i>. chap. xxvi.; and their ancient language was no doubt in use among them at that time, though mingled with some Greek and Latin terms; and this language must have been unintelligible to the Romans and the Greeks. With these, as well as with other nations, it was customary to call those βαρβαροι, <i>barbarians</i>, whose language they did not understand. St. Paul himself speaks after this manner in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:11">1 Corinthians 14:11</span>: <i>If I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that</i> <i>speaketh a BARBARIAN, and he that speaketh shall be a BARBARIAN</i> <i>unto me</i>. Thus <i>Herodotus</i> also, lib. ii. 158, says, βαρβαρους παντας Αιγυπτιοι καλεουσι τους μη σφι ὁμογλωσσους· <i>The Egyptians call all</i> <i>those BARBARIANS who have not the same language with themselves</i>. And <i>Ovid</i>, when among the <i>Getes</i>, says, in <i>Trist</i>. ver. 10:- </p>
<p><i><b>Because of the present rain and - of the cold.</b></i> — This must have been sometime in <i>October</i>; and, when we consider the <i>time of the</i> <i>year</i>, the <i>tempestuousness of the weather</i>, and their escaping to shore <i>on planks, spars</i>, &amp;c., wet of course to the skin, they must have been very <i>cold</i>, and have needed all the kindness that these well disposed people showed them. In some parts of Christianized Europe, the inhabitants would have attended on the beach, and knocked the survivors on the head, that they might convert the wreck to their own use! This barbarous people did not act in this way: they joined hands with God to make these sufferers live.</p>
