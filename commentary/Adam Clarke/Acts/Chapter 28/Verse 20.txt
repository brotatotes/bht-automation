<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:20">Acts 28:20</span>. <i><b>For the hope of Israel I am bound</b></i>, c.] As if he had said: This, and this alone, is the cause of my being delivered into the hands of the Romans I have proclaimed <i>Jesus</i> as the <i>Messiah</i>; have maintained that though he was crucified by the Jews, yet he rose again from the dead; and, through him, I have preached the general resurrection of mankind: this all Israel professes to hope for; and yet it is on this account that the Jews persecute <i>me</i>. Both the <i>Messiah</i> and the <i>resurrection</i> might be said to be the hope of Israel; and it is hard to tell which of them is here meant: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:6">Acts 13:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:21">Acts 24:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:6">Acts 26:6</span>. It is certain that, although the Jews believed in the <i>general resurrection</i>, yet they did not credit it in the <i>manner</i> in which Paul preached it; for he laid the foundation of the <i>general resurrection</i> on the <i>resurrection of Christ</i>.</p>
