<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:21">Acts 28:21</span>. <i><b>We neither received letters</b></i>, c.] This is very strange, and shows us that the Jews knew their cause to be <i>hopeless</i>, and therefore did not send it forward to Rome. They wished for an opportunity to kill Paul: and, when they were frustrated by his appeal to the emperor, they permitted the business to drop. Calmet supposes they had not <i>time</i> to send but this supposition does not appear to be sufficiently solid: they might have sent long before Paul sailed; and they might have written officially by the vessel in which the centurion and the prisoners were embarked. But their case was hopeless; and they could not augur any good to themselves from making a formal complaint against the apostle at the emperor's throne.</p>
