Verse Acts 28:22. For as concerning this sect â€” Acts 24:14; Acts 24:14. A saying of Justin Martyr casts some light on this saying of the Jews: he asserts that the Jews not only cursed them in their synagogues, but they sent out chosen men from Jerusalem, to acquaint the world, and particularly the Jews everywhere, that the Christians were an atheistical and wicked sect, which should be, detested and abhorred by all mankind. Justin Martyr, Dial. p. 234.
