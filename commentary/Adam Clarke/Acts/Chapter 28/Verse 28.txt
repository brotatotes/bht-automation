<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:28">Acts 28:28</span>. <i><b>The salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles</b></i> — St. Paul had spoken to this effect twice before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>, where see the notes; but here he uses a firmer tone, being out of the Jewish territories, and under the protection of the emperor. By <i>the salvation of God</i>, all the blessings of the kingdom of Christ are intended. This salvation God could have sent unto the Gentiles, independently of the Jewish <i>disobedience</i>; but He waited till <i>they</i> had rejected it, and then <i>reprobated</i> them, and <i>elected</i> the Gentiles. Thus the <i>elect</i> became <i>reprobate</i>, and the <i>reprobate</i> elect.</p>
<p><i><b>They will hear it.</b></i> — That is, they will <i>obey it</i>; for ακουειν signifies, not only <i>to hear</i>, but also <i>to obey</i>.</p>
