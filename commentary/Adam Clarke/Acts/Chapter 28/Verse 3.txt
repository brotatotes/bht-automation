<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:3">Acts 28:3</span>. <i><b>There came a viper out of the heat</b></i> â€” We may naturally suppose that there had been fuel laid <i>before</i> on the fire, and that the viper was in this fuel, and that it had been revived by the <i>heat</i>; and, when St. Paul laid his bundle on the fire, the viper was then in a state to lay hold on his hand.</p>
