<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:30">Acts 28:30</span>. <i><b>Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house</b></i> â€” As a state prisoner, he might have had an apartment in the common prison; but peculiar favour was showed him, and he was permitted to dwell alone, with the soldier that guarded him, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:16">Acts 28:16</span>. Finding now an opportunity of preaching the Gospel, he hired a house for the purpose, and paid for it, St. Chrysostom observes, by the fruits of his own labour. Here he received all that came unto him, and preached the Gospel with glorious success; so that his <i>bonds</i> became the means of spreading the truth, and he became celebrated even in the palace of Nero, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:12">Philippians 1:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:13">Philippians 1:13</span>; and we find that there were several <i>saints</i>, even in <i>Caesar's household</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:22">Philippians 4:22</span>, which were, no doubt, the fruits of the apostle's ministry. It is said that during his two years' residence here he became acquainted with Seneca, the philosopher, between whom and the apostle an epistolary correspondence took place. In an ancient MS. of Seneca's epistles in my own possession, these letters are extant, and are in number fourteen and have a prologue to them written by St. Jerome. That they are very <i>ancient</i> cannot be doubted; but learned men have long ago agreed that they are neither worthy of <i>Paul</i> nor of <i>Seneca</i>.</p>
<p>While he was in captivity, the Church at Philippi, to which he was exceedingly dear, sent him some pecuniary assistance by the hands of their minister, Epaphroditus, who, it appears, risked his life in the service of the apostle, and was taken with a dangerous malady. When he got well, he returned to Philippi, and, it is supposed, carried with him that epistle which is still extant; and from it we learn that <i>Timothy</i> was then at Rome with Paul, and that he had the prospect of being shortly delivered from his captivity.
