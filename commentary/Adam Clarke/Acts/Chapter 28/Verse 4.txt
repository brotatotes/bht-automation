<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span>. <i><b>The venomous beast</b></i> — το θηριον, The venomous animal; for θηρια is a general name among the Greek writers for <i>serpents,</i> <i>vipers, scorpions, wasps</i>, and such like creatures. Though the viper fastened on Paul's hand, it does not appear that it really <i>bit</i> him; but the Maltese supposed that it had, because they saw it fasten on his hand.</p>
<p><i><b>Vengeance suffereth not to live.</b></i> — These heathens had a general knowledge of <i>retributive</i> justice; and they thought that the stinging of the serpent was a proof that Paul was a <i>murderer</i>. There is a passage in <i>Bamidbar Rabba</i>, fol. 239, that casts some light on this place. "Although the Sanhedrin is ceased, yet are not the <i>four</i> deaths ceased. For he that deserves <i>stoning</i> either falls from his <i>house</i>, or a <i>wild beast</i> tears and devours him. He that deserves <i>burning</i> either falls into the <i>fire</i>, or a <i>serpent</i> bites him. He that deserves <i>cutting of with the sword</i> is either betrayed into the power of a <i>heathen kingdom</i>, or the <i>robbers break</i> <i>in upon him</i>. He that deserves <i>strangling</i> is either <i>suffocated</i> in the <i>water</i>, or dies of a <i>quinsy</i>." See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>As these people were heathens, it is not likely that they had any correct notion of the justice of the <i>true God</i>; and therefore it is most probable that they used the word δικη, not to express the quality or attribute of any being, but the goddess <i>Dikê</i>, or vindictive Justice, herself, who is represented as punishing the iniquities of men.</p>
<p>Hesiod makes a goddess of what the Maltese called Δικη, or <i>Justice</i>:- </p>
