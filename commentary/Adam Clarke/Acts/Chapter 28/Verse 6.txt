<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:6">Acts 28:6</span>. <i><b>When he should have swollen</b></i> — πιμπρασθαι, When he should have been <i>inflamed</i>: by means of an acrid poison introduced into the blood, it is soon coagulated; and, in consequence, the extremities of the vessels become obstructed, strong inflammation takes place, and all the parts become most painfully swollen.</p>
<p><i><b>Said that he was a god.</b></i> — As <i>Hercules</i> was one of the gods of the Phoenicians, and was worshipped in Malta under the epithet of αλεξικακος, the <i>dispeller of evil</i>, they probably thought that Paul was <i>Hercules</i>; and the more so, because Hercules was famous for having destroyed, in his youth, two serpents that attacked him in his cradle.</p>
