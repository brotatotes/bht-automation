Verse Acts 28:7. The chief man of the island — The term πρωτος, CHIEF, used hereby St. Luke, was the ancient title of the governor of this island, as is evident from an inscription found in Malta, which runs thus:-Λ. Κ. υἱος, κυρ. ἱππευς. ῥωμ. πρωτος Μελιταιων·Lucius Caius, son of Quirinus, a Roman knight, CHIEF of the Melitese. See Bochart, Phaleg. and Chan. vol. i. chap. 498, &c., and Grotius. This title is another proof of the accuracy of St. Luke, who uses the very epithet by which the Roman governor of that island was distinguished.
