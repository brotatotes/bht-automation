<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:7">Acts 28:7</span>. <i><b>The chief man of the island</b></i> — The term πρωτος, CHIEF, used hereby St. Luke, was the ancient title of the <i>governor</i> of this island, as is evident from an inscription found in Malta, which runs thus:-</p>
<p>Λ. Κ. υἱος, κυρ. ἱππευς. ῥωμ. πρωτος Μελιταιων·</p>
<p><i>Lucius Caius, son of Quirinus, a Roman knight, CHIEF of the</i> <i>Melitese</i>. See <i>Bochart</i>, Phaleg. and Chan. vol. i. chap. 498, &amp;c., and Grotius. This title is another proof of the accuracy of St. Luke, who uses the very epithet by which the Roman governor of that island was distinguished.</p>
