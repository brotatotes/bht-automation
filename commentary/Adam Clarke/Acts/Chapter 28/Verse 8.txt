<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:8">Acts 28:8</span>. <i><b>The father of Publius lay sick</b></i> — πυρετοις και δυσεντερια; Of a fever and dysentery; perhaps a <i>cholera morbus</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Paul - prayed</b></i> — That God would exert his power; <i>and laid his hands</i> <i>on him</i>, as the means which God ordinarily used to convey the energy of the Holy Spirit, and <i>healed him</i>; God having conveyed the healing power by this means. In such a disorder as that mentioned here by St. Luke, where the bowels were in a state of inflammation, and a general fever aiding the dysentery in its work of death, nothing less than a <i>miracle</i> could have made an <i>instantaneous</i> cure in the patient. Such a cure was wrought, and even the <i>heathens</i> saw that it was <i>the hand of God</i>.</p>
