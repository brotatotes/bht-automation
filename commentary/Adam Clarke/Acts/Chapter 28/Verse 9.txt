<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:9">Acts 28:9</span>. <i><b>Others - which had diseases</b></i> â€” Luke was a <i>physician</i>; yet we do not find him engaging in these cures. As a medical man, he might have been of use to the father of Publius; but he is not even <i>consulted</i> on the occasion. <i>Paul enters in to him, prays for</i> <i>him, lays his hands on him</i>, and he is healed. The other diseased persons who are mentioned in this verse were doubtless healed in the same way.</p>
