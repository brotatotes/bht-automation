<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span>. <i><b>Peter and John went up together</b></i> — The words επιτοαυτο, which we translate <i>together</i>, and which are the first words in this chapter in the Greek text, we have already seen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:47">Acts 2:47</span>, are added by several MSS. and versions to the last verse of the preceding chapter. But they do not make so good a sense <i>there</i> as they do <i>here</i>; and should be translated, not <i>together</i>, which really makes no sense here, but <i>at that time</i>; intimating that this transaction occurred nearly about the same time that those took place which are mentioned at the close of the former chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>At the hour of prayer</b></i> — This, as is immediately added, was the <i>ninth</i> hour, which answers, in a general way, to our three o'clock in the afternoon. The <i>third</i> hour, which was the other grand time of public prayer among the Jews, answered, in a general way, to our <i>nine</i> in the morning. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>.</p>
<p>It appears that there were <i>three</i> hours of the day destined by the Jews to public prayer; perhaps they are referred to by David, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:17">Psalms 55:17</span>: EVENING and MORNING, <i>and at NOON, will I pray and cry aloud</i>. There are three distinct times marked in the book of the Acts. The THIRD hour, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>, answering, as we have already seen, to nearly our <i>nine</i> o'clock in the morning; the SIXTH hour, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:9">Acts 10:9</span>, answering to about <i>twelve</i> with us; and the NINTH hour, mentioned in this verse, and answering to our <i>three</i> in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The rabbins believed that <i>Abraham</i> instituted the time of <i>morning</i> prayer; <i>Isaac</i>, that at <i>noon</i>; and <i>Jacob</i>, that of the <i>evening</i>: for which they quote several scriptures, which have little reference to the subject in behalf of which they are produced. Others of the rabbins, particularly <i>Tanchum</i>, made a more natural division. Men should pray,</p>
<p>1. When the sun <i>rises</i>;</p>
<p>2. when the sun has gained the <i>meridian</i>;</p>
<p>3. when the sun has <i>set</i>, or passed just under the horizon.</p>
<p>At each of these three times they required men to offer prayer to God; and I should be glad to know that every Christian in the universe observed the same rule: it is the most natural division of the day; and he who <i>conscientiously</i> observes these <i>three stated times</i> of prayer will infallibly grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
