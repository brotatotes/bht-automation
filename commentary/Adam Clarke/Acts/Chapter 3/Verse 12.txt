<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:12">Acts 3:12</span>. <i><b>As though by our own power</b></i> — δυναμει, <i>Miraculous</i> <i>energy</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Or holiness</b></i> — Η ευσεβεια, Meaning <i>religious attachment</i> to the <i>worship</i> of God. Do not think that we have wrought this miracle by any power of our own; or that any supereminent piety in us should have induced God thus to honour us, by enabling us to work it. Instead of ευσεβεια, <i>holiness</i>, the <i>Syriac</i> of Erpen, <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and some copies of the <i>Itala</i>, have εξουσια, <i>power</i> or <i>authority</i>; but the first appears to be the legitimate reading.</p>
