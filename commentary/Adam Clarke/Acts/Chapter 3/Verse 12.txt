Verse Acts 3:12. As though by our own power — δυναμει, Miraculous energy.Or holiness — Η ευσεβεια, Meaning religious attachment to the worship of God. Do not think that we have wrought this miracle by any power of our own; or that any supereminent piety in us should have induced God thus to honour us, by enabling us to work it. Instead of ευσεβεια, holiness, the Syriac of Erpen, Armenian, Vulgate, and some copies of the Itala, have εξουσια, power or authority; but the first appears to be the legitimate reading.
