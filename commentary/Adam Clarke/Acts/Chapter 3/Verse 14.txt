<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span>. <i><b>Ye denied the HOLY ONE</b></i> — τον αγιον. A manifest reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:10">Psalms 16:10</span>: <i>Thou wilt not suffer thy HOLY ONE to see corruption</i>; where the original word חסידיך <i>Chasideyca</i>, thy HOLY ONE, is translated by the Septuagint, τον Ὁσιον σου, a word of the same import with that used by Peter.</p>
<p><i><b>And desired a murderer</b></i> — Barabbas: the case must have been fresh in their own remembrance. <i>Like</i> cleaves to <i>like</i>, and begets its <i>like</i>: they were murderers themselves, and so Christ calls them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:7">Matthew 22:7</span>, and they preferred a murderer to the <i>holy</i> and <i>righteous</i> ONE of God.</p>
