Verse Acts 3:14. Ye denied the HOLY ONE — τον αγιον. A manifest reference to Psalms 16:10: Thou wilt not suffer thy HOLY ONE to see corruption; where the original word חסידיך Chasideyca, thy HOLY ONE, is translated by the Septuagint, τον Ὁσιον σου, a word of the same import with that used by Peter.And desired a murderer — Barabbas: the case must have been fresh in their own remembrance. Like cleaves to like, and begets its like: they were murderers themselves, and so Christ calls them, Matthew 22:7, and they preferred a murderer to the holy and righteous ONE of God.
