<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>. <i><b>And killed the Prince of life</b></i> — τον αρχηγον της ζωης, The <i>author of this life</i>: not only implying that all life proceeds from Jesus Christ as its <i>source</i>, but that the life-giving influence of that religion which they were now proclaiming came all through him. αρχηγος signifies a <i>prime leader</i> or <i>author</i>, a <i>captain</i>, from αρχη, the <i>beginning, head</i>, or <i>chief</i>; and αγω <i>I lead</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>, Christ is called αρχηγος της σωτηριας, the <i>Captain of salvation</i>. He <i>teaches</i> the doctrine of <i>life</i> and <i>salvation, leads</i> the way in which men should walk, and has purchased the eternal life and glory which are to be enjoyed at the end of the way. So the Jews preferred a <i>son of death</i>, a <i>destroyer</i> <i>of life</i>, to the <i>Author</i> and <i>Procurer</i> of <i>life</i> and <i>immortality</i>!</p>
<p><i><b>Whereof we are witnesses.</b></i> — They had now wrought a most striking miracle in the name of Christ, and immediately proposed themselves as witnesses of his resurrection from the dead; the miracle which they had thus wrought being an unimpeachable proof of this resurrection.</p>
