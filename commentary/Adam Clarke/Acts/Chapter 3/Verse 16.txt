<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:16">Acts 3:16</span>. <i><b>And his name</b></i> â€” JESUS, the Saviour: <i>through faith in his</i> <i>name</i>, as the <i>Saviour, and author of life</i>, and all its concomitant blessings, such as <i>health</i>, c. It is not quite clear whether the apostles refer to their <i>own</i> faith in Jesus, or to the faith of the <i>lame man</i>. It is true Christ had promised that they should perform miracles in his name, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:17">Mark 16:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</span>. And that whatsoever they asked of the Father in his name, he would grant it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span>. And they might have been led at this time to make request unto God to be enabled to work this miracle and the faith they had in his <i>unlimited</i> power and <i>unchangeable</i> truth might have induced them to make this request. Or, the faith might have been that of the <i>lame man</i>; the apostles, in the time they desired him to look on them, might have taught him the necessity of believing in Christ in order to his healing; and the man's mind might have been prepared for this by the miracle of the <i>gift of tongues</i>, of which he must have heard; and heard that this mighty effusion of the Spirit had come in the <i>name</i> and through the <i>power of Christ</i>. However the faith may be understood, it was only the <i>means</i> to receive the blessing, which the apostles most positively attribute, not to <i>their power or holiness</i>, but to Jesus Christ alone. <i>Faith</i> always <i>receives</i>; never <i>gives</i>.</p>
