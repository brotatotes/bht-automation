<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:18">Acts 3:18</span>. <i><b>But those things - he hath so fulfilled.</b></i> â€” Your ignorance and malice have been overruled by the sovereign wisdom and power of God, and have become the instruments of fulfilling the Divine purpose, that Christ must suffer, in order to make an atonement for the sin of the world. <i>All the prophets</i> had declared this; some of them in express terms, others indirectly and by symbols; but, as the whole Mosaic dispensation referred to Christ, all that prophesied or ministered under it must have referred to him also.</p>
