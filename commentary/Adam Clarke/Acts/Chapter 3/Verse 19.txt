<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:19">Acts 3:19</span>. <i><b>Repent ye therefore</b></i> — Now that ye are convinced that this was the Messiah, let your <i>minds be changed</i>, and your hearts become contrite for the sins you have committed.</p>
<p><i><b>And be converted</b></i> — επιστρεψατε, Turn to God through this Christ, deeply deploring your transgressions, and believing on his name; <i>that your sins may be blotted out</i>, which are not only <i>recorded</i> against you, but for which you are condemned by the justice of God; and the punishment due to them must be executed upon you, unless prevented by your repentance, and turning to him whom ye have pierced. The <i>blotting out</i> of sins may refer to the ceremony of the waters of jealousy, where the curse that was written in the book was to be <i>blotted out with the bitter water</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+5:23">Numbers 5:23</span>. Their sins were <i>written down</i> against them, and cried aloud for punishment; for they themselves had said, <i>His blood be upon us, and upon our</i> <i>children</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:25">Matthew 27:25</span>; and unless they took refuge in this <i>sacrificial blood</i>, and got their sins <i>blotted out</i> by it, they could not be saved.</p>
<p><i><b>When the times of refreshing shall come</b></i> — Dr. Lightfoot contends, and so ought all, that ὁπως αν ελθωσι καιροι αναψυξεως, should be translated, <i>THAT the times of refreshing MAY come</i>. αναψυξις, signifies a <i>breathing time</i>, or <i>respite</i>, and may be here applied to the <i>space</i> that elapsed from this time till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. This was a <i>time of respite</i>, which God gave them to repent of their sins, and be converted to himself. Taking the word in the sense of <i>refreshment</i> in general, it may mean the whole reign of the kingdom of grace, and the blessings which God gives here below to all genuine believers, <i>peace, love,</i> <i>joy, and communion with himself</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:21">Acts 3:21</span>.</p>
