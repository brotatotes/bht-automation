<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:2">Acts 3:2</span>. <i><b>A - man lame from his mother's womb</b></i> — The case of this man must have been <i>well known</i>:</p>
<p>1. from the <i>long standing</i> of his infirmity:</p>
<p>2. from his being <i>daily exposed</i> in a place <i>so public</i>.</p>
<p>It appears that he had no power to walk, and was what we term a <i>cripple</i>, for he was <i>carried</i> to the gate of the temple, and <i>laid</i> there in order to excite compassion. These circumstances are all marked by St. Luke, the more fully to show the greatness and incontestable nature of the miracle.</p>
<p><i><b>The gate - which is called Beautiful</b></i> — There are different opinions concerning this gate. Josephus observes, Bell. Jud. lib. v. cap. 5, sect. 3, that the temple had <i>nine</i> gates, which were on every side covered with gold and silver; but there was one gate which was without the holy house, and was of <i>Corinthian</i> brass, and greatly excelled those which were only covered with gold and silver: πολυ τῃ τιμῃ τας καταργυρους και περιχρυσους ὑπεραγουσα. The magnitudes of the other gates were equal one to another; but that of the Corinthian gate, which opened on the east, over against the gate of the holy house itself, was much larger: πεντηκοντα γαρ πηχων ουσα την αναστασιν, τεσσαρακοντα πηχεις τας θυρας ειχε, και τον κοσμον πολυτελεστερον, επι δαψιλες παχος αργυρου τε και χρυσου· <i>for its height was fifty cubits, and its</i> <i>doors were forty cubits, and it was adorned after a most costly</i> <i>manner, as having much richer and thicker plates of silver and</i> <i>gold upon them than upon the other</i>. This last was probably the gate which is here called <i>Beautiful</i>; because it was on the outside of the temple, to which there was an easy access, and because it was evidently the most costly, according to the account in Josephus; but it must be granted that the text of Josephus is by no means clear.</p>
