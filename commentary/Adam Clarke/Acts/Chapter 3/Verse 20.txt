<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:20">Acts 3:20</span>. <i><b>Which before was preached unto you</b></i> — Instead of προκεκηρυγμενον, <i>before preached</i>, ABCDE, fifty-three others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Armenian, Chrysostom</i>, and others, have προκεχειρισμενον, who was <i>before designed</i>, or <i>appointed</i>; and this is without doubt the true reading. Christ crucified was the person whom God had from the beginning <i>appointed</i> or <i>designed</i> for the Jewish people. It was not a <i>triumphant</i> Messiah which they were to expect; but one who was to <i>suffer</i> and <i>die</i>. Jesus was this person; and by believing in him, as thus suffering and dying for their sins, he should be <i>again sent</i>, in the power of his Spirit, to justify and save them.</p>
