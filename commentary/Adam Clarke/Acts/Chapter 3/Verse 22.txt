<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22">Acts 3:22</span>. <i><b>Moses truly said unto the fathers</b></i> â€” On this subject the reader is requested to refer to the note, <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:22">Deuteronomy 18:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:22">Deuteronomy 18:22</span></span>. From this appeal to Moses it is evident that Peter wished them to understand that Jesus Christ was come, not as an ordinary prophet, to exhort to repentance and amendment, But as a <i>legislator</i>, who was to give them a <i>new law</i>, and whose commands and precepts they were to obey, on pain of endless destruction. Therefore they were to understand that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was that <i>new law</i> which should supersede the <i>old</i>.</p>
