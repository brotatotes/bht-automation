<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:24">Acts 3:24</span>. <i><b>All the prophets from Samuel</b></i> — Dr. Lightfoot observes: "We have <i>Moses</i> and <i>Samuel</i> mentioned together in this place, as also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+99:6">Psalms 99:6</span>, because there were few or no prophets between these two, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+3:1">1 Samuel 3:1</span>, and the apparition of angels having been more frequent; but, after the decease of Phineas, it is a question whether there was any oracle by <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i>, through the defect of prophecy in the high priests, till the times of Samuel. But then it revived in Abimelec, Abiather, &amp;c." The Jews have a saying, <i>Hieros. Chagigah</i>, fol. 77. גכיאים שמואל דבן של <i>Samuel was</i> <i>the chief of the prophets</i>. Perhaps it was in reference to this that Peter said, <i>All the prophets from Samuel</i>, &amp;c.</p>
