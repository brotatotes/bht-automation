<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:25">Acts 3:25</span>. <i><b>Ye are the children of the prophets</b></i> â€” This is the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>: as ye are the children or disciples of the prophets, ye are bound to believe their predictions, and obey their precepts; and not only so, but ye are entitled to their promises. Your duty and your interest go hand in hand; and there is not a blessing contained in the covenant which was made with your fathers but belongs to <i>you</i>. Now, as this covenant respected the blessings of the Gospel, you must believe in Jesus Christ, in order to be put in possession of all those blessings.</p>
