<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:26">Acts 3:26</span>. <i><b>Unto you first, God, having raised up</b></i> â€” As you are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant, the <i>first</i> offers of salvation belong to <i>you</i>, and God thus makes them to you. The great mission of Jesus Christ is directed <i>first</i> to <i>you</i>, that you may be saved from your sins. God designs to <i>bless you</i>, but it is by <i>turning each of you away from his iniquities</i>. The salvation promised in the covenant is <i>a salvation from SIN</i>, not from the <i>Romans</i>; and no man can have his sin <i>blotted out</i> who does not <i>turn away from it</i>.</p>
<p>1. We may learn from this that neither <i>political</i> nor <i>ecclesiastical</i> privileges can benefit the soul, merely considered in themselves: a man may have Abraham for his father, according to the flesh; and have Satan for his father, according to the spirit. A man may be a member of the visible Church of Christ, without any title to the Church triumphant. In short, if a man be not <i>turned away from his iniquities</i>, even the death of Christ profits him nothing. <i>His name shall be called JESUS, for he</i> <i>shall SAVE his people FROM their SINS</i>.</p>
<p>2. If Christ be the substance and sum of all that the prophets have written, is it not the duty and interest of every Christian, in reading the Scriptures, to search for the testimony they bear to this Christ, and the salvation procured by his death?</p>
