<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span>. <i><b>Silver and gold have I none</b></i> â€” Though it was customary for all those who entered the temple to carry some money with them, for the purposes mentioned above, yet so <i>poor</i> were the apostles that their had nothing to give, either to the sacred <i>treasury</i>, or to the <i>distressed</i>. The popish writers are very dexterous at forming analogies between St. <i>Peter</i> and the <i>pope</i>; but it is worthy of note that they have not attempted any <i>here</i>. Even the judicious and generally liberal <i>Calmet</i> passes by this important saying of the person whom he believed to have been the <i>first pope</i>. <i>Thomas Aquinas</i>, surnamed the <i>angelical doctor</i>, who was highly esteemed by Pope <i>Innocent</i> IV., going one day into the pope's chamber, where they were reckoning large sums of money, the pope, addressing himself to Aquinas, said: "You see that the Church is no longer in an age in which she can say, <i>Silver and</i> <i>gold have I none</i>?" "It is true, holy father," replied the angelical doctor, "nor can she now say to the lame man, <i>Rise up</i> <i>and walk</i>!" This was a faithful testimony, and must have cut deep for the moment. One thing is very remarkable, that though the saints of this church can work no miracles while <i>alive</i>, they work many when <i>dead</i>; and it is the attestation of those <i>post mortem</i> miracles that leads to their canonization. <i>Thomas a Becket</i>, who did no good while he lived, is reported to have done much after his death. Many have visited his tomb, and, in days of yore, many were said to be healed of whatsoever disease they had. The age is more enlightened, and the tomb of this reputed saint has lost all its power.</p>
