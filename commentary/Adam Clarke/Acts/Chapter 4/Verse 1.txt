Verse Acts 4:1. The priests — These persons had evidenced the most implacable enmity against Christ from the beginning.The captain of the temple — See this office particularly explained in the note, Luke 22:4; Luke 22:4.The Sadducees — Whose whole system was now in danger by the preaching of the resurrection of Christ; for they believed not in the immortality of the soul, nor in any future world. These made a common cause with the priests, &c., to suppress the evidence of Christ's resurrection, and silence the apostles.
