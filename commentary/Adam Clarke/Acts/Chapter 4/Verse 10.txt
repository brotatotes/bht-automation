<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:10">Acts 4:10</span>. <i><b>By the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth</b></i> â€” This was a very bold declaration in the presence of such an assembly; but he felt he stood on good ground. The cure of the lame man the day before was notorious; his long infirmity was well known; his person could be easily identified; and he was now standing before them whole and sound: they themselves therefore could judge whether the miracle was true or false. But the <i>reality</i> of it was not questioned, nor was there any difficulty about the instruments that were employed; the only question is, <i>How</i> have ye done this? and in <i>whose name</i>? Peter immediately answers, We have done it in the name of Jesus of Nazareth whom <i>ye crucified</i>, and whom God hath raised from the dead.</p>
