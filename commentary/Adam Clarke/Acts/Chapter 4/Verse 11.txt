Verse Acts 4:11. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders â€” By your rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, you have fulfilled one of your own prophecies, Psalms 118:22; and, as one part of this prophecy is now so literally fulfilled, ye may rest assured, so shall the other; and this rejected stone shall speedily become the head stone of the corner. Matthew 21:42.
