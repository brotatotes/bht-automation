<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:12">Acts 4:12</span>. <i><b>Neither is there salvation in any other</b></i> — No kind of <i>healing</i>, whether for <i>body</i> or <i>soul</i>, can come through any but him who is called JESUS. The spirit of <i>health</i> resides in him; and from him alone its influences must be received.</p>
<p><i><b>For there is none other name</b></i> — Not only no other <i>person</i>, but no <i>name</i> except that divinely appointed one, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>, by which salvation from sin can be expected-<i>none given under heaven</i>-no other means ever devised by God himself for the salvation of a lost world. All other means were only <i>subordinate</i>, and <i>referred to</i> <i>him</i>, and had their efficacy from him alone. He was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world; and no man ever came, or can come, to the Father but by him.</p>
