<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:13">Acts 4:13</span>. <i><b>The boldness of Peter and John</b></i> — την παρρησιαν, The <i>freedom</i> and <i>fluency</i> with which they spoke; for they spoke now from the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, and their word was with power.</p>
<p><i><b>That they were unlearned and ignorant men</b></i> — αγραμματοι, Persons without literature, not brought up in nor given to literary pursuits-<i>and ignorant</i>, ιδιωται, persons in <i>private life</i>, brought up in its occupations alone. It does not mean <i>ignorance</i> in the common acceptation of the term; and our translation is very improper. In <i>no</i> sense of the word could any of the apostles be called <i>ignorant men</i>; for though their spiritual knowledge came all from heaven, yet in all other matters they seem to have been men of good, sound, strong, common sense.</p>
<p><i><b>They took knowledge of them</b></i> — επεγινωσκον may imply that they <i>got</i> <i>information</i>, that they had been disciples of Christ, and probably they might have seen them in our Lord's company; for there can be little doubt that they had often seen our Lord teaching the multitudes, and these disciples attending him.</p>
<p><i><b>That they had been with Jesus.</b></i> — Had they not had his teaching, the present company would soon have confounded them; but they spoke with so much power and authority that the whole sanhedrin was confounded. He who is taught in spiritual matters by Christ Jesus has a better gift than the tongue of the learned. He who is taught in the school of Christ will ever speak to the point, and intelligibly too; though his words may not have that polish with which they who prefer <i>sound</i> to <i>sense</i> are often carried away.</p>
