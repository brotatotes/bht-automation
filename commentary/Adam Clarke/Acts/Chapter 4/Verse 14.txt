<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:14">Acts 4:14</span>. <i><b>They could say nothing against it.</b></i> â€” They could not gainsay the apostolic doctrine, for that was supported by the miraculous fact before them. If the doctrine be false, the man cannot have been miraculously healed: if the man be miraculously healed, then the doctrine must be true that it is by the name of Jesus of Nazareth that he has been healed. But the man is incontestably healed; therefore the doctrine is true.</p>
