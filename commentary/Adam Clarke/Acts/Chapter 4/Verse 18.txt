<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:18">Acts 4:18</span>. <i><b>Not to speak - nor teach in the name of Jesus.</b></i> â€” Any other doctrine, and any other name, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites and infidels will bear, but the doctrine which is according to godliness, proclaiming salvation through the blood of Christ crucified, they will not bear. If their doctrine were not the truth of God it could not be so unpopular; there is such an enmity in human nature against all that is good and true, that whatever comes from God is generally rejected by wicked men.</p>
