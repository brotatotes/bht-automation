<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:19">Acts 4:19</span>. <i><b>Whether it be right in the sight of God</b></i> â€” As if they had said: Worldly prudence and a consideration of our secular interests would undoubtedly induce us to obey you; but acting as before God, and following the dictates of eternal truth and justice, we dare not be silent. Can it be right to obey men contrary to the command and will of God? When he commands us to speak, dare we hold our tongue? We have received our authority from God through Christ, and feel fully persuaded of the truth by the Holy Spirit which now dwells in us; and we should be guilty of treason against God, were we on any consideration to suppress his testimony. Your own consciences testify that we should be sinners against our heavenly King, were we to act according to your orders; and the conclusion is, that <i>we cannot but speak what we</i> <i>have seen and heard</i>.</p>
