<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:21">Acts 4:21</span>. <i><b>When they had farther threatened them</b></i> — προσαπειλησαμενοι, When they had added to their former threatenings, repeating the former menaces, and adding new penalties.</p>
<p><i><b>Finding nothing how they might punish them</b></i> — Or, as the <i>Codex</i> <i>Bezae</i> reads, μηεὑρισκοντες αιτιαν, πως κολασωνται, <i>not finding, a</i> <i>cause why they might punish them</i>. This reading is supported by the <i>Syriac</i> and <i>Arabic</i>. Bp. Pearce says, "This is better sense and better Greek."</p>
<p><i><b>Because of the people</b></i> — The people saw the miracle, confessed the finger of God, believed on the Lord Jesus, and thus became converts to the Christian faith; and the converts were now so numerous that the sanhedrin was afraid to proceed to any extremities, lest an insurrection should be the consequence.</p>
