Verse Acts 4:21. When they had farther threatened them — προσαπειλησαμενοι, When they had added to their former threatenings, repeating the former menaces, and adding new penalties.Finding nothing how they might punish them — Or, as the Codex Bezae reads, μηεὑρισκοντες αιτιαν, πως κολασωνται, not finding, a cause why they might punish them. This reading is supported by the Syriac and Arabic. Bp. Pearce says, "This is better sense and better Greek."Because of the people — The people saw the miracle, confessed the finger of God, believed on the Lord Jesus, and thus became converts to the Christian faith; and the converts were now so numerous that the sanhedrin was afraid to proceed to any extremities, lest an insurrection should be the consequence.
