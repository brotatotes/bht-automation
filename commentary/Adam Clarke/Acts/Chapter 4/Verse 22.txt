<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:22">Acts 4:22</span>. <i><b>The man was above forty years old</b></i> â€” The disease was of long standing, and consequently the more inveterate; but all difficulties, small or great, yield equally to the sovereign power of God. It is as easy with God to convert a sinner of <i>forty</i> or <i>four-score</i>, as one of <i>ten</i> years old. But he who <i>now</i> refuses to obey the call of God has neither reason nor revelation to support himself even in the most distant hope that he shall get, in a future time, the salvation which he rejects in the present.</p>
