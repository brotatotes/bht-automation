<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:23">Acts 4:23</span>. <i><b>They went to their own company</b></i> â€” This was properly the first persecution that had been raised up against the Church since the resurrection of Christ; and as the rest of the disciples must have known that Peter and John had been cast into prison, and that they were to be examined before the sanhedrin, and knowing the evil disposition of the rulers toward their brethren, they doubtless made joint supplication to God for their safety. In this employment it is likely Peter and John found them on their return from the council, and repeated to them all their treatment, with the threats of the chief priests and elders.</p>
