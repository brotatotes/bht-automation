<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:25">Acts 4:25</span>. <i><b>By the mouth of thy servant David hast said</b></i> — Several add, but impertinently, δια πνευματος αγιου, <i>by the Holy Spirit</i>; but it is sufficient that GOD has said it; and thugs we find that David spoke by the inspiration of God; and that the second Psalm relates to Jesus Christ, and predicts the vain attempts made by Jewish and heathen powers to suppress Christianity.</p>
