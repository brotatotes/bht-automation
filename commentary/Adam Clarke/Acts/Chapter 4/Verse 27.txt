<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:27">Acts 4:27</span>. There is a parenthesis in this verse that is not sufficiently noticed: it should be read in connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:28">Acts 4:28</span>, thus: <i>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast</i> <i>anointed, (for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel</i> <i>determined before to be done,) both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with</i> <i>the Gentiles and people of Israel, were gathered together</i>.</p>
<p>It is evident that what God's <i>hand and counsel determined before</i> <i>to be done</i> was not that which Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles, (Romans,) and the people of Israel had done and were doing; for, then, their <i>rage</i> and <i>vain counsel</i> would be such as God himself had determined should take place, which is both impious and absurd; but these gathered together to <i>hinder</i> what God had before determined that his Christ or Anointed should perform; and thus the passage is undoubtedly to be understood.</p>
<p><i><b>Were gathered together</b></i> — εν τη πολει ταυτη, <i>In this very city</i>, are added by ABDE, and several others; all the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Coptic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Armenian, Slavonian, Vulgate, Itala</i>, and several of the primitive fathers. This reading Griesbach has received into the text. This makes the words much more emphatic; in this thy own city, these different and in all other cases dissentient powers are leagued together against thine Anointed, and are determined to prevent the accomplishment of thy purpose.</p>
