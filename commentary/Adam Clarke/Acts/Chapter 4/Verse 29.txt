<p>Verse 29. <i><b>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings</b></i> — It is not against <i>us</i>, but against <i>thee</i>, that they conspire: it is not to prevent the success of <i>our preaching</i>, but to bring to nought <i>thy</i> <i>counsel</i>: the whole of their enmity is against thee. Now, Lord, look upon it; consider this.</p>
<p><i><b>And grant unto thy servants</b></i> — While we are endeavouring to fulfil thy counsels, and can do nothing without thee, sustain our courage, that we may proclaim thy truth with boldness and irresistible power.</p>
