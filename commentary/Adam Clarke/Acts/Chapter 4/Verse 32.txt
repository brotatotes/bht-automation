Verse 32. The multitude of them that believed — The whole 5000, mentioned Acts 4:4, and probably many others, who had been converted by the ministry of the other apostles since that time.Were of one heart and of one soul — Were in a state of the most perfect friendship and affection. In all the 5000 there appeared to be but one heart and one soul; so perfectly did they agree in all their views, religious opinions, and holy affections. Some MSS. add, και ουκ ην διακρισις εν αυτοις ουδεμια, and there was no kind of difference or dissension among them. This remarkable reading is found in the Codex Bezae, another of great authority, E, two others, Ambrose, Bede, Cyprian, and Zeno. Diogenes Laertius relates of Aristotle, ερωτηθεις, τι εστι φιλος; being asked, What is a FRIEND? εφη, μια ψυχη δυο σωμασιν ενοικουσα answered, ONE soul dwelling in TWO bodies. This saying has been justly celebrated: but what would this wonderful philosopher have thought and said, had he seen these disciples of Jesus, and friends of mankind: one soul dwelling in 5000 bodies!They had all things common. — Acts 2:44, where this subject is examined. Acts 4:34.
