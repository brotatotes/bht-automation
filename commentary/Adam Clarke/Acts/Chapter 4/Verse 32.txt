<p>Verse 32. <i><b>The multitude of them that believed</b></i> — The whole 5000, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:4">Acts 4:4</span>, and probably many others, who had been converted by the ministry of the other apostles since that time.</p>
<p><i><b>Were of one heart and of one soul</b></i> — Were in a state of the most perfect friendship and affection. In all the 5000 there appeared to be but one heart and one soul; so perfectly did they agree in all their views, religious opinions, and holy affections. Some MSS. add, και ουκ ην διακρισις εν αυτοις ουδεμια, <i>and there was no</i> <i>kind of difference</i> or <i>dissension among them</i>. This remarkable reading is found in the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, another of great authority, E, two others, <i>Ambrose, Bede, Cyprian</i>, and <i>Zeno</i>. Diogenes Laertius relates of Aristotle, ερωτηθεις, τι εστι φιλος; <i>being asked, What</i> <i>is a FRIEND</i>? εφη, μια ψυχη δυο σωμασιν ενοικουσα <i>answered, ONE</i> <i>soul dwelling in TWO bodies</i>. This saying has been justly celebrated: but what would this wonderful philosopher have thought and said, had he seen these disciples of Jesus, and friends of mankind: <i>one</i> soul dwelling in 5000 <i>bodies</i>!</p>
