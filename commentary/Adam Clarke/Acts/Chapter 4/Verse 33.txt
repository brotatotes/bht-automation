<p>Verse 33. <i><b>With great power gave the apostles witness</b></i> — This power they received from the Holy Spirit, who enabled them, μεγαλη δυναμει, <i>with striking miracles</i>, to give proof of <i>the resurrection</i> <i>of the Lord Jesus</i>; for this is the point that was particularly to be proved: that he was slain and buried, all knew; that he rose again from the dead, many knew; but it was necessary to give such proofs as should convince and confound all. This preaching and these miracles demonstrated this Divine truth: Jesus died for your sins-he rose again for your justification; behold what God works in confirmation of these glorious truths; believe therefore in the Lord Jesus, and ye shall not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
<p><i><b>Great grace was upon them all.</b></i> — They all received much of the favour or grace of God; and they had much favour with all who feared God. In both these ways this clause may be understood; for χαρις means <i>favour</i>, whether that be evidenced by <i>benevolence</i> or <i>beneficence</i>, or by <i>both</i>. The favour of God is the <i>benevolence</i> of God; but his benevolence is never exerted without the exertions of his <i>beneficence</i>. Hence the <i>grace</i> or <i>favour</i> of God always implies a blessing or gift from the hand of his mercy and power. The favour or benevolence of men may exist without <i>beneficence</i>, because it may not be in their power to communicate any gift or benefit, though they are disposed to do it; or, 2dly. the persons who enjoy their favour may not stand in need of any of their kind acts; but it is not so with God: his good will is ever accompanied by his good work; and every soul that is an object of his benevolence stands in the utmost need of the acts of his beneficence. Hence, as he <i>loved</i> the world, he gave his Son a ransom for all. All needed his help; and, because they all needed it, therefore all had it. And truly we may say of the whole human race, for whom the Son of God tasted death, that <i>great grace was</i> <i>upon all</i>; for ALL have been purchased by his sacrificial death. This by the way.</p>
