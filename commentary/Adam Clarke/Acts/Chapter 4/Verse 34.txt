Verse 34. Neither was there any among them that lacked — It was customary with the Jews to call the poor together, to eat of the sacrifices, but as the priests, c., were incensed against Christ and Christianity, consequently the Christian poor could have no advantage of this kind therefore, by making a common stock for the present necessity, the poor were supplied; so there was none among them that lacked. This provision therefore of the community of goods, which could be but temporary, was made both suitably and seasonably. See Bp. Pearce, and Acts 2:44; Acts 2:44.
