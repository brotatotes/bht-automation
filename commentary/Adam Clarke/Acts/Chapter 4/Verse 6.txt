<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:6">Acts 4:6</span>. <i><b>Annas</b></i> — Though this man was not now actually in the office of high priest, yet he had possessed it for eleven years, bore the title all his life, and had the honour of seeing five of his sons fill that eminent place after him-an honour that never happened to any other person from the commencement of the Mosaic institution. He is the same who is called Ananus by Josephus, Ant. b. xx. c. 8.</p>
<p><i><b>And Caiaphas</b></i> — He was son-in-law to Annas, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>, was now high priest, and the same who, a short time before, condemned Christ to be crucified.</p>
<p><i><b>And John</b></i> — Dr. Lightfoot conjectures, with great probability that this was <i>Jochanan ben Zaccai</i>, who was very famous at that time in the Jewish nation. Of him it is said in the Talmud, <i>Jucas</i>. fol. 60: "Rabbin Jochanan ben Zaccai the priest lived 120 years. He found favour in the eyes of Caesar, from whom he obtained Jafneh. When he died, the glory of wisdom ceased." The following is a remarkable passage: <i>Yoma</i>, fol. 39: Forty years before the destruction of the city, (the very time of which St. Luke now treats,) when the gates of the temple flew open of their own accord, Rab. Jochanan ben Zaccai said, "O temple! temple! why dost thou disturb thyself? I know thy end, that thou shalt be destroyed, for so the Prophet Zachary hath spoken concerning thee: open thy doors, O Lebanon! that the fire may devour thy cedars." See <i>Lightfoot</i> and <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And Alexander</b></i> — This was probably Alexander Lysimachus, one of the richest Jews of his time, who made great presents to the temple, and was highly esteemed by King Agrippa. See <i>Calmet</i>. He was brother to the famous Philo Judaeus, and father of Alexander Tiberius, who married Berenice, the daughter of Agrippa the elder, and was governor of Judea after Cuspius Fadus. See Josephus, Ant. l. xix. c. 5, s. 1.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the kindred of the high priest</b></i> — Or rather, as Bp. Pearce renders it, "<i>of the race of the high priests</i>, i.e. of the family out of which the high priests were chosen." It may, however, comprehend those who belonged to the families of <i>Annas</i> and <i>Caiaphas</i>, and all who were <i>connected</i> with the sacerdotal family. Luke distinctly mentions all these, to show how <i>formidable</i> the enemies were against whom the infant Church of Christ had to contend.</p>
