<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:1">Acts 5:1</span>. <i><b>But a certain man named Ananias</b></i> — Of these unhappy people we have no farther account than what is recorded here. In reference to birth, connections, &amp;c., their names are written in the dust. The import of his name, חנניה <i>chananiyah</i>, the <i>grace</i> or <i>mercy of the Lord</i>, agrees very ill with his conduct.</p>
