<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:10">Acts 5:10</span>. <i><b>Yielded up the ghost</b></i> â€” See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:5">Acts 5:5</span>. It was not by Peter's <i>words</i>, nor through Peter's <i>prayers</i>, nor through <i>shame</i>, nor through <i>remorse</i>, that this guilty pair died, but by an immediate judgment of God. The question of the salvation of Ananias and Sapphira has not been a little agitated; and most seem inclined to hope that, though their sin was punished by this awful display of the Divine judgment, mercy was extended to their souls. For my own part, I think their sin was what the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:16">1 John 5:16</span>, calls <i>a sin unto death</i>; a sin which must be punished with temporal death, or the death of the body, while mercy was extended to the soul. It was right in this infant state of the Church to show God's displeasure against <i>deceit, fraud</i>, and <i>hypocrisy</i>: had this guilty pair been permitted to live after they had done this evil, this <i>long-suffering</i> would have been infallibly abused by others; and, instead of leading them who had sinned to <i>repentance</i>, might have led them to <i>hardness of heart</i> by causing them to presume on the mercy of God. That hypocrisy may be afraid to show her face, God makes these <i>two</i> an example of his justice; but, because they had not the ordinary respite, we may presume that God extended mercy to them, though cut off almost in the act of sin. Their case, however, cannot become a precedent, allowing them to have received mercy; because those who have seen in this case the <i>severity</i> of God must expect much sorer punishment, if, with such an example before their eyes, they should presume on the <i>mercy</i> of their Maker: this would be doing evil that good might come, and the perdition of such would be just.</p>
