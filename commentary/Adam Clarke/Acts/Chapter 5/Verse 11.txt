<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:11">Acts 5:11</span>. <i><b>Great fear came upon all the Church</b></i> â€” This judgment answered the end for which it was inflicted; a deeply religious fear occupied every mind, and hypocrisy and deception were banished from this holy assembly. On the word <i>Church</i>, see the observations at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:0">Matthew 16:0</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span> It has been properly observed that we have in this place a native specimen of a New Testament Church:</p>

<p>2. grafted into Christ by baptism;</p>
<p>3. animated by love;</p>
