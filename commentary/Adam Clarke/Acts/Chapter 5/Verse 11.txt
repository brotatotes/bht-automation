Verse Acts 5:11. Great fear came upon all the Church â€” This judgment answered the end for which it was inflicted; a deeply religious fear occupied every mind, and hypocrisy and deception were banished from this holy assembly. On the word Church, see the observations at the end of Matthew 16:0. Matthew 16:28 It has been properly observed that we have in this place a native specimen of a New Testament Church:1. Called by the Gospel;2. grafted into Christ by baptism;3. animated by love;4. united by all kinds of fellowship;5. and disciplined by the exemplary punishment of hypocrites.See Dodd.
