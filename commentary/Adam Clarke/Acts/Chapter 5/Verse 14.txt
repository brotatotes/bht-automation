<p>1. Those who credited the Divine mission of Christ.</p>
<p>2. That he was the Messiah.</p>
<p>3. That he died for their sins.</p>
<p>4. That he rose again.</p>
<p>5. That he ascended into heaven.</p>
<p>6. That he sent down the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>7. That he ever appeared in the presence of God for them.</p>
<p>8. That it was he who gives repentance and remission of sins. And,</p>
<p>9. He by whom the world is to be judged.</p>
<p>These were simple articles, of the truth of which they had the fullest evidence.</p>
