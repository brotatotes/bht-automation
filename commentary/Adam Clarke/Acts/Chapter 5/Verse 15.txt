<p>How these different verses and clauses of verses, got so intermingled and confounded as they are now in our common text, I cannot tell but the above will appear at once to be the natural order in which they should be placed.</p>
<p><i><b>That - the shadow of Peter passing by</b></i> — I cannot see all the miraculous influence here that others profess to see. The people who had seen the miracles wrought by the apostles pressed with their sick to share the healing benefit: as there must have been <i>many</i> diseased people, it is not likely that the apostles, who generally addressed such persons, prayed and used imposition of hands, could reach all those that were brought to them, as fast as the solicitude of their friends could wish. As, therefore, they could not get Peter or the other apostles, <i>personally</i>, to all their sick, they thought if they placed them on that side of the way where the shadow was projected, (the sun probably now declining, and consequently the shadow lengthening,) they should be healed by the <i>shadow</i> of the man passing over them, in whose <i>person</i> such miraculous powers were lodged. But it does not appear that the persons who thus thought and acted were of the number of those converts already made to the faith of Christ nor does it appear that any person was healed in this way. The sacred penman simply relates the <i>impression</i> made on the people's minds; and how they acted in consequence of this impression. A popish writer, assuming that the <i>shadow</i> of Peter <i>actually cured all on</i> <i>which it was projected</i>, argues from this precarious principle in favour of the wonderful efficacy of <i>relics</i>! For, says he, "if the shadow of a saint can do so much, how much more may his <i>bones</i>, or <i>any thing</i> that was in <i>contact</i> with his <i>person</i>, perform!" Now, before this conclusion can be valid, it must be proved:</p>
<p>1. That the shadow of Peter did actually cure the sick;</p>
<p>2. That this was a virtue common to all the apostles;</p>
<p>3. That all eminent <i>saints</i> possess the same virtue;</p>
<p>4. That the <i>bones</i>, c., of the <i>dead</i>, possess the same virtue with the <i>shadow</i> of the <i>living</i></p>
<p>5. That those whom they term <i>saints</i> were actually <i>such</i>;</p>
<p>6. That miracles of healing have been wrought by their <i>relics</i>;</p>
<p>7. That touching these <i>relics</i> as necessarily produces the miraculous healing as they suppose the shadow of Peter to have done.</p>
<p>I think there is not sufficient evidence here that Peter's shadow healed any one, though the people thought it could; but, allowing that it did, no evidence can be drawn from this that any virtue is resident in the relics of <i>reputed</i> or <i>real saints</i>, by which miraculous influence may be conveyed. It was only in <i>rare cases</i> that God enabled even an <i>apostle</i> to work a miracle.</p>
<p>After the words, <i>might overshadow some of them</i>, the Vulgate adds, <i>et liberarentur ab infirmitatibus suis</i>; a Greek MS. (E) has nearly the same words, και ῥυσθωσιν απο πασης ασθενειας ἡς ειχον, <i>and that they might be freed from all the infirmities which they</i> <i>had</i>: a few other MSS. agree in the main with this reading.</p>
