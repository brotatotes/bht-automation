Verse Acts 5:16. Sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits â€” Here it is evident that sick people are distinguished from those who were vexed with unclean spirits; and therefore they were not one and the same thing. The same distinction is made Matthew 4:24; Matthew 10:1; Mark 1:32, Mark 1:34; Mark 16:17-18; and Luke 4:40-41; Luke 7:21.
