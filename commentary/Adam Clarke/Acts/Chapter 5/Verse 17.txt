<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>. <i><b>The high priest - and - the sect of the Sadducees</b></i> — αιρεσις των σαδδουκαιων, <i>The heresy of the Sadducees</i>. In this place, as well as in several others, the word αιρεσις, <i>heresy</i>, has no <i>evil</i> meaning in itself; it is a word of distinction, and may receive either a <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> colouring from the <i>persons</i> or <i>opinions</i> designated by it. It signifies a <i>sect</i> or <i>party</i>, whether good or bad, distinguished from any other <i>sect</i>. αιρεσις, <i>heresy</i>, comes from αιρεω, <i>I choose</i>, and was anciently applied to the <i>different</i> <i>sects</i> of the heathen philosophers, the members of each sect having <i>chosen</i> their own in preference to all the others. It has been applied among ecclesiastical writers in the same way - when a man <i>chooses</i> one party of Christians, in preference to others, to be his companions in the way of salvation; and he <i>chooses</i> them and their creed and Christian discipline, because he believes the whole to be more consistent with the oracles of God than any of the rest. The Church of Rome has thought proper to attach a very <i>bad</i> meaning to this <i>innocent</i> word, and then apply it to all those who can neither credit her <i>transubstantiation</i>, depend on her <i>purgatory</i>, nor worship her <i>relics</i>. A <i>heretic</i>, in her acceptation, is one who is <i>not</i> a <i>papist</i>, and, because not a papist, utterly <i>out of the way</i> and out of the <i>possibility</i> of being <i>saved</i>. These persons should recollect that, by a then <i>persecuting</i> <i>brother</i>, St. Paul, all the apostles, and the whole Church of Christ, were termed ναζωραιων αιρεσις, <i>the heresy of the</i> <i>Nazarenes</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span>; and it was <i>after the way</i> which the persecuting Jews called <i>heresy</i> that St. Paul and the rest of the apostles <i>worshipped the God of their</i> <i>fathers</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span>; and it was according to the <i>strictest</i> HERESY in the Jewish Church, ακιριβεστατην αιρεσιν, that St. Paul lived before his conversion, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:5">Acts 26:5</span>; and we find, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:22">Acts 28:22</span>, that the <i>whole Church of Christ</i> was termed <i>this heresy</i>, ταυτης αιρεσεως, and this by persons who intended <i>no reproach</i>, but wished simply to distinguish the <i>Christians</i> from <i>scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees</i>, c. <i>Heresy</i> therefore, in its <i>first</i> acceptation, signifies simply <i>a</i> <i>choice</i>: afterwards it was applied to designate all those persons who made the same choice and hence the word <i>sect</i> and it became synonymous: in process of time it was applied to those professing Christianity who made, in some cases, a different <i>choice</i> as to some <i>article of faith</i>, or <i>form of worship</i>, from those which had obtained in that part of the Church with which they had been before connected. The majority, from whom they became thus separated, spoke evil of them, and treated them ill, because they presumed to <i>choose</i> for <i>themselves</i> on the foundation of the Holy Scriptures; and because they would take nothing for the truth of God that was not accredited from heaven. Thus, when the people now called <i>Protestants</i>, began to examine their creed according to the Holy Scriptures, and, in consequence of this examination, left out <i>auricular confession, indulgences</i>, the <i>priests' power to forgive</i> <i>sins, adoration of saints, angels</i>, and <i>relics, purgatory</i>, and the <i>doctrine of transubstantiation</i>, because they could not find them in the word of God, the papists called them <i>heretics</i>, by which <i>they</i> meant, in opposition to the meaning of the word, persons holding <i>damnable errors</i>; and, as such, they persecuted, <i>burnt</i>, and destroyed them wherever they had power. Now be it known to these persecutors, that the Protestants still <i>choose</i> to reject opinions and practices which they know to be unscriptural, absurd, and superstitious; and which they have a thousand times <i>demonstrated</i> <i>to be such</i>: and, on this ground, may they still be HERETICS!</p>
<p><i><b>Were filled with indignation.</b></i> — ζηλου, <i>With zeal</i>. ζηλος, from ζεω, to be <i>hot</i>, and λα or λιαν, <i>very much</i>, signifies a vehement affection or disposition of the mind, which, according to its object, is either <i>good</i> or <i>bad, laudable</i> or <i>blamable</i>. Its meaning in this place is easily discerned; and not improperly translated <i>indignation</i>, in our version. We need not be surprised that the <i>Sadducees</i> were <i>filled with indignation</i>, because the apostles proclaimed the <i>resurrection</i> of Christ, and, through that, the <i>general resurrection</i>, which was diametrically opposed to their doctrine; for they denied the possibility of a resurrection, and believed not in the being of either <i>angel</i> or <i>spirit</i>; nor did they allow of the existence of a spiritual world. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:2">Acts 4:2</span>.</p>
