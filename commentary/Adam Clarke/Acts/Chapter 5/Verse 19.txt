Verse Acts 5:19. But the angel of the Lord - opened the prison doors â€” This was done:1. To increase the confidence of the apostles, by showing them that they were under the continual care of God; and,2. To show the Jewish rulers that they were fighting against Him while persecuting his followers, and attempting to prevent them from preaching the Gospel.This was another warning graciously given them by a good and merciful God, that they might repent, and so escape the coming wrath.
