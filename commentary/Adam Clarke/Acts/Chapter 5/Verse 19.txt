<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:19">Acts 5:19</span>. <i><b>But the angel of the Lord - opened the prison doors</b></i> â€” This was done:</p>
<p>1. To increase the confidence of the apostles, by showing them that they were under the continual care of God; and,</p>
<p>2. To show the Jewish rulers that they were fighting against Him while persecuting his followers, and attempting to prevent them from preaching the Gospel.</p>
<p>This was another warning graciously given them by a good and merciful God, that they might repent, and so escape the coming wrath.</p>
