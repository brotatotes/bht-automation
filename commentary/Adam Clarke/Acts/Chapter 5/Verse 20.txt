Verse Acts 5:20. All the words of this life. â€” All the doctrines of life eternal, founded on the word, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus. This is another periphrasis for Gospel. Go to the temple-the most public place, and speak to the people-who come there to worship according to the law, the words of this life-the whole doctrine of salvation from sin and death; and show that the law is fulfilled in the sacrifice of Jesus, and that, by his resurrection, he has brought life and immortality to light.
