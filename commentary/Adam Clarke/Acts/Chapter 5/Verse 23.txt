<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:23">Acts 5:23</span>. <i><b>The prison truly found we shut</b></i> â€” All the doors were properly bolted, and the keepers at their post; <i>but when we had</i> <i>opened</i>, for it appears they were alone in possession of the keys; how much must this have increased their astonishment when they found that the doors were not <i>broken</i> open, the guards properly posted, and every thing as they left it, for they themselves had put the apostles in prison; but, when they had opened, there was no man within!</p>
