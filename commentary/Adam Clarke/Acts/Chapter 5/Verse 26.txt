<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:26">Acts 5:26</span>. <i><b>Brought them without violence</b></i> â€” On receiving the information mentioned above, proper officers were sent to seize and bring them before the council. The officers, on reaching the temple, found the multitude gladly receiving the doctrine of the apostles, and so intent on hearing <i>all the words of this life</i> that they were afraid to show any hostility to the apostles, lest the people should stone them; we may therefore conclude that the officers entreated them to accompany them to the council; and that they felt it their duty to obey every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, and so cheerfully went with them, trusting in the Lord their God.</p>
