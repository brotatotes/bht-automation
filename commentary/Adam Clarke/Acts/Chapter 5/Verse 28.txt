<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:28">Acts 5:28</span>. <i><b>Did not we straitly command you</b></i> — ου παραγγελια παρηγγειλαμεν, <i>With commanding did we not command you</i>; a Hebraism-another proof of the accuracy and fidelity of St. Luke, who seems always to give every man's speech <i>as he delivered it</i>; not the <i>substance</i>, but the <i>very words</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:17">Acts 4:17</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Not teach in this name?</b></i> — That is, of JESUS as the <i>Christ</i> or <i>Messiah</i>. His saving name, and the doctrines connected with it, were the only theme and substance of their discourses.</p>
<p><i><b>Intend to bring this men's blood upon us.</b></i> — You speak in such a way of him to the people as to persuade them that we have crucified an <i>innocent</i> man; and that we must on that account fall victims to the Divine vengeance, or to the fury of the people, whom, by your teaching, you are exciting to sedition against us.</p>
