<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Him hath God exalted with his right hand</b></i> — By a supereminent display of his <i>almighty power</i>, for so the <i>right hand</i> of God often means; he has raised him from the dead, and raised his human nature to the throne of his glory. Instead of δεξια, the <i>right hand</i>, the <i>Codex Bezae</i> has δοξη, <i>to glory</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A Prince</b></i> — The leader or director in the way. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:19">Acts 3:19</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And a Saviour</b></i> — σωτηρα, <i>A deliverer</i> or <i>preserver</i>. The word σωτηρ comes from σωω to <i>save, deliver, preserve, escape from</i> <i>death</i> or <i>danger, bring into a state of security</i> or <i>safety</i>. JESUS and SAVIOUR are nearly of the same import. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span>. He alone <i>delivers</i> from <i>sin, death</i>, and <i>hell</i>: by him alone we <i>escape</i> from the <i>snares</i> and <i>dangers</i> to which we are exposed: and it is by and in him, and in connection with him, that we are <i>preserved</i> <i>blameless</i> and <i>harmless</i>, and made the sons of God without rebuke. He alone can <i>save</i> the soul from sin, and <i>preserve</i> it in that state of salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>To give repentance</b></i> — See this explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Forgiveness of sins.</b></i> — αφεσιν των αμαρτιων, The <i>taking away of</i> <i>sins</i>. This is not to be restrained to the mere act of <i>justification</i>; it implies the <i>removal of sin</i>, whether its <i>power,</i> <i>guilt</i>, or <i>impurity</i> be considered. Through Jesus we have the <i>destruction</i> of the <i>power</i>, the <i>pardon</i> of the <i>guilt</i>, and the <i>cleansing</i> from the <i>pollution</i>, of sin. And was Jesus Christ exalted a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and remission of sins to ISRAEL? Then none need despair. If such as were <i>now</i> before the apostles could be saved, then the salvation of the very worst of transgressors, of <i>any</i> or <i>all</i> on this side perdition, is gloriously possible. Yes, for he tasted death for every man; and he prayed for his murderers, compared to some of whom JUDAS himself was a <i>saint</i>.</p>
<p>The two words in Italics, in this text, <i>to be</i>, are impertinently introduced; it reads much better without them.</p>
