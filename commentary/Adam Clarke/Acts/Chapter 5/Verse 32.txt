<p>Verse 32. <i><b>We are his witnesses</b></i> — The word αυτου, <i>his</i>, is omitted by AD, and several others of good note; the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, AEthiopic</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>. It does not seem to be necessary.</p>
<p><i><b>Of these things</b></i> — των πηματων τουτων, <i>Of these transactions</i>: i.e. of Christ's life and miracles, and of your murderous proceedings against him.</p>
<p><i><b>And</b></i><b> so is </b><i><b>also the Holy Ghost</b></i> — In the gift of tongues lately communicated; and by his power and influence on our souls, by which we are enabled to give irresistible witness of our Lord's resurrection.</p>
<p><i><b>To them that obey him.</b></i> — We obey GOD, not <i>you</i>; and therefore God gives us this Spirit, which is in us a fountain of light, life, love, and power. The Spirit of God is given to the obedient: in proportion as a man who has received the <i>first</i> influences of it (for without this he cannot <i>move</i> in the spiritual life) is obedient to those influences, in the same proportion the gifts and graces, the light, life, and power, of the Holy Spirit, are increased in his soul.</p>
