<p>Verse 33. <i><b>They were cut</b></i><b> to the heart</b>] διεπριοντο, Literally, <i>they were sawn through</i>, from δια <i>through</i>, and πριω, <i>to</i> <i>saw</i>. They were stung to the heart, not with <i>compunction</i> nor <i>remorse</i>, but with <i>spite, malice</i>, and <i>revenge</i>: for, having the murder of Christ thus brought home to their consciences, in the first feelings of their malice and revenge, they thought of destroying the persons who had witnessed their nefarious conduct.</p>
