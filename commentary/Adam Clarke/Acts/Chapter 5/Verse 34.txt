<p>Verse 34. <i><b>A Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law</b></i> — "This," says Dr. Lightfoot, "was <i>Rabban Gamaliel</i> the <i>first</i>; commonly, by way of distinction, called <i>Rabban Gamaliel the elder</i>. He was president of the council after the death of his own father, <i>Rabban Simeon</i>, who was the son of <i>Hillel</i>. He was St. Paul's master, and the 35th receiver of the traditions, and on this account might not be improperly termed νομοδιδασκαλος, a <i>doctor of</i> <i>the law</i>, because he was one that kept and handed down the <i>Cabala</i> received from Mount Sinai. He died eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem, his son <i>Simeon</i> succeeding him in the chair, who perished in the ruins of the city."
