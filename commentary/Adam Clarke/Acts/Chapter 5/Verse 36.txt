<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Rose up Theudas</b></i> — Josephus, Ant. lib. xx. cap. 4, sect. 1, mentions one named <i>Theudas</i> who was the author of an insurrection; about whom there has been much controversy whether he were the person spoken of here by Gamaliel. Every circumstance, as related by Josephus agrees well enough with what is referred to here, except the <i>chronology</i>; for the <i>Theudas</i> mentioned by Josephus made his insurrection when <i>Fadus</i> was governor of Judea; which was at least <i>ten</i> years after the time in which the apostles were brought before this council. Much labour has been thrown away in unsuccessful attempts to reconcile the <i>historian</i> and the <i>evangelist</i>, when it is very probable they speak of different transactions. Bp. <i>Pearce</i> thinks "the whole difficulty will disappear if we follow the opinion of Abp. <i>Usher</i>, who imagined that Luke's <i>Theudas</i> was the same with that <i>Judas</i> of whom Josephus gives this account, Ant. lib. xvii. cap. 12, sect. 5; and War, lib. ii. cap. 4, sect. 1: 'that a little after the death of Herod the Great, he raised an insurrection in Galilee, and aimed at getting the sovereignty of Judea,' and that he was defeated and put to death, as is implied in sect. 10, of the same chapter. That <i>Theudas</i> and <i>Judas</i> might be names for the <i>same person</i>, Bp. <i>Pearce</i> thinks probable from the consideration, that the same apostle who is called <i>Judas</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:22">John 14:22</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16">Luke 6:16</span>, and called <i>Jude</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:1">Jude 1:1</span>, is, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:18">Mark 3:18</span>, called <i>Thaddeus</i>; and, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>, is also called <i>Lebbeus</i>. This apostle having the names <i>Judas</i> and <i>Thaddeus</i> and <i>Lebbeus</i> given to him, <i>two</i> of these must have been the <i>same</i>; because no Jew had more than <i>two</i> names, unless when a <i>patronymic</i> name was given to him, as when <i>Joseph</i> surnamed <i>Justus</i> was called <i>Barsabas</i>, i.e. the son of <i>Saba</i>. It is no unreasonable thing to suppose that <i>Thaddeus</i> and <i>Theudas</i> are the same name; and that therefore the person called <i>Theudas</i> in Luke is probably the same whom Josephus, in the places above quoted, calls <i>Judas</i>."</p>
<p>Dr. Lightfoot thinks that "Josephus has made a slip in his chronology;" and rather concludes that the Theudas mentioned in the Ant. lib. xx. cap. 4, sect. 1, is the person referred to in the text. I confess the matter does not appear to me of so much consequence; it is mentioned by Gamaliel in a careless way, and St. Luke, as we have already seen, scrupulously <i>gives the Lords of</i> <i>every speaker</i>. The story was no doubt well known, and there were no doubts formed on it by the Jewish Council. We see plainly the <i>end</i> for which it was produced; and we see that it answered this end most amply; and certainly we have no farther concern with Gamaliel or his story.</p>
<p><i><b>Boasting himself to be somebody</b></i> — λεγον ειναι τινα εαυτον, <i>Saying</i> <i>that he was a great personage</i>, i.e., according to the supposition of Bp. Pearce, setting himself up to be <i>king of the Jews</i>: see the preceding note. After εαυτον, <i>himself</i>, μαγαν, <i>great one</i>, is added by several very respectable MSS. and versions.</p>
