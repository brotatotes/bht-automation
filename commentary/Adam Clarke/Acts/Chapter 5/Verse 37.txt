<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Judas of Galilee</b></i> — Concerning Judas of Galilee, Rabbi Abraham, in <i>Jucasin</i>, fol. 139, writes thus: "In this time there were three sects: for, besides the <i>Pharisees</i> and <i>Sadducees</i>, <i>Judas</i> <i>of Galilee</i> began another sect, which was called <i>Essenes</i>. They caused the Jews to rebel against the Romans, by asserting that they should not obey strangers; nor call any one <i>Lord</i> (or Governor) but the holy blessed God above." Rabbi Abraham makes a mistake here: the <i>Essenes</i> existed long before the days of Judas of Galilee; but it is very possible that he might have been <i>one</i> of that sect. Josephus mentions the insurrection made by Judas of Galilee, Ant. lib. xviii. cap. 1, and says it was when Cyrenius was governor of Syria: <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:2">Luke 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:2">Luke 2:2</span></span>. Bp. Pearce supposes that there were two απογραφαι, <i>taxations</i> or <i>enrolments</i>; and that the one mentioned here took place <i>ten years after</i> that mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1-5">Luke 2:1-5</span>. He observes also, in conformity with the note on the preceding verse, that the Judas mentioned here, was not only different from that Judas or <i>Theudas</i> spoken of before, but that his pretence for rebellion was <i>different</i>; the former wished to have the <i>empire of Judea</i>; the latter only maintained that it was <i>base</i> and <i>sinful</i> to <i>obey</i> a <i>heathen governor</i>.</p>
