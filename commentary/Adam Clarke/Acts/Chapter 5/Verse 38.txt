<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Refrain from these men</b></i> â€” Do not molest them, leave them to God; for if this counsel and work be of man it will come to nought, like the rebellion of Theudas, and that of Judas of Galilee: for whatever pretends to be done in the name of God, but is not of him, will have his <i>curse</i> and not his <i>blessing</i>. He whose name is prostituted by it will vindicate his injured honour, and avenge himself.</p>
