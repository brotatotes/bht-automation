Verse 39. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it — Because his counsel cannot fail; and his work cannot be counteracted. If he be determined that this doctrine shall prevail, it is vain for us to attempt to suppress it.Lest haply ye be found-to fight against God. — Μηποτε και θεομαχοι εὑρεθητε. Some have thought that they saw a parallel to these words in the speech of Diomede, when, seeing Mars, associated with Hector, oppose the Grecians, he judged farther opposition vain, and desired his troops to retire from the battle.  Τῳ δ' αιει παρα εἱς γε θεων, ὁς λοιγον αμυνει· Και νυν οἱ παρα κεινος Αρης, βροτῳ ανδρι εοικως. Αλλα προς Τρωας τετραμμενοι αιεν οπισσω Εικετε, μηδε Θεοις μενεαινεμεν ιφι μαχεσθαι. Iliad, lib. v. 603.  Protected always by some power divine; And Mars attends this moment at his side, In form a man. Ye therefore still retire, But facing still your foes: nor battle wage, However fierce, yet fruitless, with the gods. COWPER.
