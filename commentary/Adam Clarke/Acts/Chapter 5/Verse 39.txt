<p>Verse 39. <i><b>But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it</b></i> — Because his counsel cannot fail; and his work cannot be counteracted. If he be determined that this doctrine shall prevail, it is vain for us to attempt to suppress it.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest haply ye be found-to fight against God.</b></i> — Μηποτε και θεομαχοι εὑρεθητε. Some have thought that they saw a parallel to these words in the speech of Diomede, when, seeing <i>Mars</i>, associated with Hector, oppose the Grecians, he judged farther opposition vain, and desired his troops to retire from the battle. </p>
