<p>Verse 40. <i><b>To him they agreed</b></i> â€” That is, not to <i>slay</i> the apostles, nor to attempt any farther to <i>imprison</i> them; but their malevolence could not be thus easily satisfied; and therefore they <i>beat</i> <i>them</i>-probably gave each of them thirty-nine stripes; and, having commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, they let them go. It was of JESUS they were afraid: not of the <i>apostles</i>. They plainly saw that, if the doctrine of Christ was preached, it must prevail; and, if it prevailed, they must come to nought. It was a wise saying of the popish bishops in the time of Queen Mary-<i>If we</i> <i>do not put down this PRINTING, it will put us down</i>: They laboured to <i>put down the printing</i>, but they could not; and, under God, the printing, by exposing the wickedness of their doctrine and practices, and especially by multiplying copies of the New Testament, did most effectually <i>put them down</i>.</p>
