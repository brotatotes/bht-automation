<p>Verse 41. <i><b>Rejoicing that they there counted worthy</b></i>, c.] The whole verse may be read thus: <i>But they departed rejoicing from the</i> <i>presence of the sanhedrin, because they there deemed worthy to be</i> <i>dishonoured on account of THE NAME</i>. The word, αυτου, <i>his</i>, is omitted by ABCD, several others Erpen's <i>Syriac</i>, and the <i>Coptic</i>. THE NAME, probably, by this time, distinguished both the <i>author</i> of salvation and the sacred <i>system of doctrine</i> which the apostles preached. To <i>rejoice</i> in <i>persecution</i>, and <i>triumph</i> in the midst of <i>pain</i>, shame, disgrace, and various threatened deaths, is the privilege of the <i>New Testament</i>. Nothing of this kind, as far as I can recollect, appears even in the choicest <i>saints</i> under the Old Testament dispensation. Some of them fretted and mourned, and sometimes even murmured; some merely possessed their souls in <i>patience</i>; Christians exulted and triumphed in the God of their salvation. This is no mean proof of the additional light and evidence which the New Testament dispensation affords.</p>
