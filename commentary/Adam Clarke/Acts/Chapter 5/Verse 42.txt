<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:42">Acts 5:42</span>. <i><b>Daily in the temple</b></i> — That is at the hours of morning and evening prayer; for they felt it their duty to worship God in <i>public</i>, and to help others to make a profitable use of the practice. Every man that professes Christianity should, in this respect also, copy their conduct: nor can any man be considered to have any religion, let his sentiments be what they may, who does not attend on the <i>public worship</i> of his Maker.</p>
<p><i><b>They ceased not to teach and preach Jesus.</b></i> — Far from <i>desisting</i>, they became more <i>zealous</i>, yea, <i>incessant</i>, in their work. They took advantage of the public assemblies in the temple, as well as of all private opportunities, to <i>teach</i> all the truths of their holy religion; and to <i>preach</i>, proclaim Jesus as the only Messiah, that he who was crucified rose from the dead, and was exalted a Prince and a Saviour at the right hand of God. How little must these men have regarded their lives, who in the midst of such danger could pursue a line of conduct which, to all human views, must terminate in their ruin. They loved their Master, they loved his work, they loved their thankless countrymen, they loved their present wages-persecution and stripes, and <i>hated</i> nothing but their own lives! These men were proper persons to be employed in converting the world. Preachers of the Gospel, look at those men, and learn at once your duty, your employment, and your interest. Live and preach like apostles, and God will crown your labours with similar success.</p>
