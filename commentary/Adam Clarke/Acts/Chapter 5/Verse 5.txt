<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:5">Acts 5:5</span>. <i><b>Fell down, and gave up the ghost</b></i> — πεσων εξεψυξε, <i>Falling down, he expired, breathed his last</i>: "Gave up the ghost" is a very improper translation here. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:8">Genesis 25:8</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:50">Matthew 27:50</span>. Two things may be remarked here:</p>
<p>1. That the sin of this person was of no ordinary magnitude, else God would not have visited it with so signal a punishment.</p>
<p>2. That Peter must have had the power to <i>discern the state of the heart</i>, else he had not known the perfidy of Ananias. This power, commonly called the <i>discernment of spirits</i>, the apostles had as a particular gift, not probably <i>always</i> but at <i>select times</i>, when God saw it necessary for the good of his Church.</p>
