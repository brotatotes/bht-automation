Verse Acts 5:5. Fell down, and gave up the ghost — πεσων εξεψυξε, Falling down, he expired, breathed his last: "Gave up the ghost" is a very improper translation here. Genesis 25:8, and Matthew 27:50. Two things may be remarked here:1. That the sin of this person was of no ordinary magnitude, else God would not have visited it with so signal a punishment.2. That Peter must have had the power to discern the state of the heart, else he had not known the perfidy of Ananias. This power, commonly called the discernment of spirits, the apostles had as a particular gift, not probably always but at select times, when God saw it necessary for the good of his Church.
