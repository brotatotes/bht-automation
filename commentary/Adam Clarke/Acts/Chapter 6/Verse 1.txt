<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>. <i><b>A murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews</b></i> — Those who are here termed Grecians, ελληνισται, or Hellenists, were Jews who sojourned now at Jerusalem, but lived in countries where the <i>Greek language</i> was spoken, and probably in general knew no other. They are distinguished here from those called <i>Hebrews</i>, by which we are to understand <i>native Jews</i>, who spoke what was then termed the Hebrew language, a sort of Chaldaio-Syriac.</p>
<p>It has been remarked that Greek words ending in ιστης imply <i>inferiority</i>. ελληνες, <i>Hellenes</i>, was distinguished from ελληνισται: the former implies <i>pure Greeks, native</i> Greeks, who spoke the Greek tongue in its purity and the latter, Jews or others sojourning among the Greeks, but who spoke the Greek language according to the <i>Hebrew idiom</i>. Pythagoras divided his disciples into two classes; those who were capable of entering into the <i>spirit</i> and mystery of his doctrine he called πυθαγορειοι, <i>Pythagoreans</i>; those who were of a different cast he termed πυθαγορισται, <i>Pythagorists</i>: the former were <i>eminent</i> and <i>worthy</i> of their master; the latter only <i>so so</i>. The same distinction is made between those called αττικοι and αττικισται, <i>Attics</i> and <i>Atticists</i>, the pure and less pure Greeks, as between those called ελληνες and ελληνισται, <i>Hellenes</i> and <i>Hellenists, pure</i> <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Graecising Jews</i>. See <i>Jamblicus</i>, De Vit. Pyth. cap. 18, and <i>Schoettgen</i> on this place.</p>
<p>The cause of the murmuring mentioned here seems to have been this: When all the disciples had put their property into a common stock, it was intended that out of it each should have his quantum of supply. The foreign or Hellenistic Jews began to be jealous, that their widows were neglected in the daily ministration, that they either had not the <i>proportion</i>, or were not <i>duly</i> served; the Palestine Jews being <i>partial</i> to those of their own country. This shows that the community of goods could never have been designed to become general. Indeed, it was no ordinance of God; and, in any state of society, must be in general impracticable. The apostles, hearing of this murmuring, came to the resolution mentioned below.</p>
