<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:10">Acts 6:10</span>. <i><b>They there not able to resist the wisdom</b></i>, c.] He was <i>wise</i>, well exercised and <i>experienced</i>, in Divine things and, as appears by his defence, in the following chapter, well versed in the Jewish history. The spirit by which he spake was the Holy Spirit, and its power was irresistible. They were obliged either to <i>yield</i> to its teachings, or were <i>confounded</i> by its truth. Several MSS. add to this verse, <i>because he reproved them with</i> <i>boldness, they could not resist the truth</i>. This reading is not genuine, though it exists (but in different forms) in some good MSS.</p>
