<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13">Acts 6:13</span>. <i><b>Against this holy place</b></i> — The <i>temple</i>, that it shall be destroyed.</p>
<p><i><b>And the law</b></i> — That it <i>cannot</i> give <i>life</i>, nor save from <i>death</i>. It is very likely that they had heard him speak words to this amount, which were all as true as the spirit from which they proceeded; but they gave them a very false colouring, as we see in the succeeding verse.</p>
