<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:15">Acts 6:15</span>. <i><b>Saw his face, as it had been the face of an angel.</b></i> â€” Sayings like this are frequent among the Jewish writers, who represent God as distinguishing eminent men by causing a glory to shine from their faces. <i>Rabbi Gedalia</i> said that, "when Moses and Aaron came before Pharaoh, they appeared like those <i>angels</i> which minister before the <i>face of the Lord</i>; for their stature appeared <i>greater</i>, and the <i>splendour of their faces</i> was like the sun, and their eyes like the wheels of the sun; their beard like clusters of grapes, and their words like <i>thunder</i> and <i>lightning</i>; and that, through fear of them, those who were present fell to the earth."</p>
<p>The like is said of Moses, in <i>Debarim Rabba</i>, fol. 75. that "when Sammael (Satan) came to Moses, the <i>splendour of his face</i> was like the <i>sun</i>, and himself resembled <i>an angel of God</i>." The reader may find several similar sayings in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>It appears that the light and power of God which dwelt in his soul shone through his face, and God gave them this proof of the <i>falsity</i> of the testimony which was now before them; for, as the <i>face of Stephen</i> now <i>shone</i> as the <i>face of Moses</i> did when he came down from the mount, it was the fullest proof that he had not spoken blasphemous words either against Moses or God, else this splendour of heaven had not rested upon him.</p>
<p>The history of the apostolic Church is a series of wonders. Every thing that could prevent such a Church from being established, or could overthrow it when established, is brought to bear against it. The instruments employed in its erection and defence had neither <i>might</i> nor <i>power</i>, but what came immediately from God. They work, and God works with them; the Church is founded and built up; and its adversaries, with every advantage in their favour, cannot overthrow it. Is it possible to look at this, without seeing the mighty hand of God in the whole? He permits <i>devils</i> and <i>wicked men</i> to work-to avail themselves of all their advantages, yet counterworks all their plots and designs, turns their weapons against themselves, and promotes his cause by the very <i>means</i> that were used to <i>destroy</i> it. How true is the saying, There is neither might nor counsel against the Lord!</p>
