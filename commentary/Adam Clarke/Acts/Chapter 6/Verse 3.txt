<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>. <i><b>Wherefore - look ye out among you seven men</b></i> — Choose persons in whom ye can all confide, who will distribute the provisions impartially, and in due time; and let these persons be the objects of the choice both of the Hebrews and Hellenists, that all cause of murmuring and discontent may be done away. Though seven was a <i>sacred</i> number among the Jews, yet there does not appear to be any mystery intended here. Probably the <i>seven</i> men were to take each his <i>day</i> of service; and then there would be a superintendent for these widows, c., for <i>each day of the week</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of honest report</b></i> — μαρτυρουμενους Persons to whose character there is authentic <i>testimony</i>, well known and accredited.</p>
<p><i><b>Full of the Holy Ghost</b></i> — Saved into the spirit of the Gospel dispensation and made partakers of that Holy Ghost by which the soul is sanctified, and endued with those graces which constitute the mind that was in Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>And wisdom</b></i> — Prudence, discretion, and economy; for mere piety and uprightness could not be sufficient, where so many must be pleased, and where frugality, impartiality, and liberality, must ever walk hand in hand.</p>
<p><i><b>Whom we may appoint</b></i> — Instead of καταστησωμεν, <i>we may appoint</i>, καταστησομεν, <i>we shall appoint</i>, is the reading of ABCDE, and several others. It makes, however, very little difference in the sense.</p>
