<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>. <i><b>We will give ourselves continually to prayer</b></i> — προσκαρτερησομεν,, We will <i>steadfastly</i> and <i>invariably</i> attend, we will <i>carefully keep</i> our <i>hearts</i> to this work. The word is very emphatic.</p>
<p><i>To prayer</i>. - See this defined, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5">Matthew 6:5</span>. Even apostles could not live without prayer; they had no <i>independent</i> graces; what they had could not be <i>retained</i> without an <i>increase</i>; and for this increase they must make prayer and supplication, depending continually on their God.</p>
<p><i><b>Ministry of the word.</b></i> — διακονιατουλογου, The <i>deaconship of the</i> <i>word</i>. The continual proclamation of the Gospel of their Lord; and, to make this effectual to the souls of the hearers, they must <i>continue</i> in <i>prayer</i>: a minister who does not <i>pray much, studies</i> <i>in vain</i>.</p>
<p>The office of <i>deacon</i>, διακονος, came to the Christian from the Jewish Church. Every synagogue had at least three <i>deacons</i>, which were called פרנסים <i>parnasim</i>, from פרנס <i>parnes, to feed,</i> <i>nourish, support, govern</i>. The פרנס <i>parnas</i>, or <i>deacon</i>, was a sort of judge in the synagogue; and, in each, <i>doctrine</i> and <i>wisdom</i> were required, that they might be able to <i>discern</i> and give <i>right</i> <i>judgment</i> in things both <i>sacred</i> and <i>civil</i>. The חזן <i>chazan</i>, and שמש <i>shamash</i>, were also a sort of <i>deacons</i>. The first was the priest's <i>deputy</i>; and the last was, in some cases, the <i>deputy</i> of this <i>deputy</i>, or the <i>sub-deacon</i>. In the New Testament the <i>apostles</i> are called <i>deacons</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:7">Ephesians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>: see also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:15">2 Corinthians 11:15</span>. Christ himself, the Shepherd and Bishop of souls, is called the <i>deacon of the circumcision</i>, λεγω δε Χριστον Ιησουν διακονον γεγενησθαι περιτομης, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>. As the word implies to <i>minister</i> or <i>serve</i>, it was variously applied, and pointed out all those who were employed in helping the bodies or souls of men; whether <i>apostles, bishops</i>, or those whom we call <i>deacons</i>. Some remark that there were <i>two orders of deacons</i>:</p>
<p>1. διακονοι της τραπιζης, <i>deacons of the TABLE</i>, whose business it was to take care of the alms collected in the Church, and distribute them among the poor, widows, c.</p>
<p>2. διακονοι του λογου, <i>deacons of the WORD</i>, whose business it was to <i>preach</i>, and variously instruct the people. It seems that after the persecution raised against the apostolic Church, in consequence of which they became <i>dispersed</i>, the <i>deaconship</i> of <i>tables</i> ceased, as did also the <i>community of</i> <i>goods</i> and Philip, who was one of these deacons, who at first served tables, betook himself entirely to preaching of the word: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span>, c.</p>
<p>In the primitive Church, it is sufficiently evident that the deacons gave the bread and wine in the Eucharist to the believers in the Church, and carried it to those who were absent, <i>Just. Mar</i>. Apol. ii. p. 162 they also <i>preached</i>, and in some cases administered <i>baptism</i>. See <i>Suicer</i> on the words διακονος κηρυσσω, and βαπτισμα. But it appears they did the two last by the special authority of the bishop. In the ancient Roman Church, and in the Romish Church, the number of <i>seven</i> deacons, in imitation of those appointed by the apostles, was kept up; and in the council of Neocaesarea it was decreed that this number should never be exceeded, even in the largest cities: vide <i>Concil. Neocaesar</i>. Canon. xiv. other Churches varied this number; and the Church of Constantinople had not less than one hundred. Deacons were ordained by the bishops, by <i>imposition of hands</i>. None was ordained deacon till he was twenty-five years of age, and we find that it was lawful for them to have wives. See <i>Suicer</i> under the word διακονος, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span>.</p>
<p>In the Church of England, (the purest and nearest to the apostolical model in doctrine and discipline of all national Churches,) a deacon receives ordination by the imposition of the hands of a bishop, in consequence of which he can preach, assist in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and in general perform any sacred office, except consecrating the elements, and pronouncing the absolution. No person in this Church can be ordained deacon till he be twenty-three years of age, unless by dispensation from the Abp. of Canterbury. There were <i>deaconesses</i>, both in the apostolic and primitive Church, who had principally the care of the women, and visited and ministered to them in those circumstances in which it would have been improper for a deacon to attend. They also assisted in preparing the female candidates for baptism.</p>
<p>At present, the office for which the seven deacons were appointed is, in the Church of England, filled by the churchwardens and overseers of the poor; in other Churches and religious societies, by elders, stewards, &amp;c., chosen by the people, and appointed by the minister.</p>
