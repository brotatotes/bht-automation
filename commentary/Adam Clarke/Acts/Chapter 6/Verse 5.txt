<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span>. <i><b>Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost</b></i> — A person every way properly fitted for his work; and thus qualified to be the first <i>martyr</i> of the Christian Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch</b></i> — A heathen Greek, who had not only believed in the God of Israel, but had also received circumcision, and consequently was a <i>proselyte of the covenant</i>; for, had he been only a <i>proselyte of the gate</i>, the Jews could not have associated with him. On the word <i>proselyte</i>, see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:43">Exodus 12:43</span>. As this is the only proselyte mentioned here, we may presume that all the rest were <i>native Jews</i>. From this Nicolas, it is supposed that the sect called <i>Nicolaitans</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:15">Revelation 2:15</span>, derived their origin. Dr. Lightfoot doubts this, and rather inclines to derive the name "from ניכולא <i>nicola</i>, <i>let us</i> <i>eat together</i>; those brutes encouraging each other to eat meats offered to idols, like those in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+22:13">Isaiah 22:13</span>, who said, <i>Let us eat flesh and drink wine</i>, &amp;c." Both <i>Irenaeus</i> and <i>Epiphanius</i> derive this sect from Nicolas the deacon. <i>Clemens</i> <i>Alexandrinus</i> gives this Nicolas a good character, even while he allows that the sect who taught the community of wives pretended to derive their origin from him. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span></span>.</p>
