<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:6">Acts 6:6</span>. <i><b>And when they had prayed</b></i> — Instead of και, <i>and</i>, the <i>Codex Bezae</i> reads οιτινες, <i>who</i>, referring the act of praying to the apostles, which removes a sort of ambiguity. The apostles prayed for these persons, that they might in every respect be qualified for their office, and be made successful in it. And, when they had done this, they <i>laid their hands</i> upon them, and by this rite appointed them to their office. So then, it plainly appears that the <i>choice</i> of the Church was not <i>sufficient</i>: nor did the Church think it sufficient; but, as they knew their own members best, the apostles directed them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>, to <i>choose</i> those persons whom they deemed best qualified, according to the criterion laid down by the apostles themselves, that they should be <i>of honest report</i>, and <i>full of the Holy Ghost</i> and <i>wisdom.</i> Let us examine the process of this business:</p>
<p>1. There was an evident <i>necessity</i> that there should be more <i>helpers</i> in this blessed work</p>
<p>2. The <i>apostles</i> called the <i>disciples</i> together, that they might consider of this necessity and provide for it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>.</p>
<p>3. They directed the disciples to <i>choose out from among themselves</i> such persons as they judged the most proper for the work.</p>
<p>4. They gave them the <i>criterion</i> by which their choice should be directed; not <i>any</i> man, not <i>every</i> man, not their nearest <i>relative</i>, or <i>best</i> beloved <i>friend</i>; but such as were of <i>honest report</i>, whose <i>public</i> <i>character</i> was known to be unblemished; and men who were <i>full of</i> <i>the Holy Ghost</i>, the influence of which would keep all right <i>within</i>, and direct their hearts into all truth; and men who were known to be men of <i>prudence</i> and <i>economy</i>, for not every good and pious man may be proper for such a work.</p>
<p>5. Seven persons being chosen by the disciples, according to this criterion, are presented to the apostles for their approbation and confirmation.</p>
<p>6. The apostles, receiving them from the hands of the Church, consecrated them to God by <i>prayer</i>, imploring his blessing on them and their labour.</p>
<p>7. When this was done, <i>they laid their hands</i> <i>upon them</i> in the presence of the disciples, and thus <i>appointed</i> them to this sacred and important work; for it is evident they did not get their commission merely to <i>serve tables</i>, but to <i>proclaim</i>, in <i>connection with</i> and under the <i>direction</i> of the apostles, the word of life.</p>
<p>Let no man say that any of the things here enumerated was unnecessary, and let no Church pretend or affect to do without them.</p>
<p>1. No preacher or minister should be provided till there is a place for him to labour in, and necessity for his labour.</p>
<p>2. Let none be imposed upon the Church of Christ who is not of that Church, well known and fully approved by that branch of it with which he was connected.</p>
<p>3. Let none be sent to <i>publish</i> salvation from <i>sin</i>, and the necessity of a <i>holy life</i>, whose <i>moral</i> <i>character</i> cannot bear the strictest scrutiny among his neighbours and acquaintance.</p>
<p>4. Let none, however <i>moral</i>, or well reported of, be sent to convert souls, who has not the most solid reason to believe <i>that he is moved thereto by the Holy Ghost</i>.</p>
<p>5. Let those who have the power to appoint see that the person be a man of <i>wisdom</i>, i.e. sound understanding-for a <i>witling</i> or a <i>blockhead</i>, however upright, will never make a Christian minister; and that he be a man of <i>prudence</i>, knowing how to direct his own concerns, and those of the Church of God, with discretion.</p>
<p>6. Let no private person, nor number of private members in a Church, presume to authorize such a person, though in every way qualified to preach the Gospel; for even the one hundred and twenty primitive disciples did not arrogate this to themselves.</p>
<p>7. Let the person be brought to those to whom God has given authority in the Church, and let them, after most solemnly <i>invoking</i> God, <i>lay their hands</i> <i>upon him</i>, according to the <i>primitive</i> and <i>apostolic plan</i>, and thus devote him to the work of the ministry.</p>
<p>8. Let such a one from that moment consider himself the property of God and his Church, and devote all his time, talents, and powers, to convert sinners, and build up believers in their most holy faith.</p>
<p>9. And let the Church of God consider such a person as <i>legitimately</i> and <i>divinely</i> sent, and receive him as the ambassador of Christ.</p>
