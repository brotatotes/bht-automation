<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>. <i><b>The word of God increased</b></i> — By such preachers as the apostles and these deacons, no wonder the doctrine of God increased-became widely diffused and generally known; in consequence of which, the number of the disciples must be greatly multiplied: for God will ever bless his own word, when ministered by those whom he has qualified to proclaim it.</p>
<p><i><b>A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</b></i> — This was one of the greatest miracles wrought by the grace of Christ: that persons so intent on the destruction of Christ, his apostles, and his doctrine, should at last espouse that doctrine, is astonishing; and that they who had withstood the evidence of the <i>miracles</i> of Christ should have yielded to the doctrine of his <i>death</i> and <i>resurrection</i>, is worthy of note. And from this we may learn that it is not by <i>miracles</i> that sinners are to be converted unto God, but by the <i>preaching of Christ dying for their offenses,</i> <i>and rising again for their justification</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of λερεων, <i>priests</i>, a few MSS., and the <i>Syriac</i>, read ιουδαιων, <i>Jews</i>; for the copyists seem to be struck here with <i>two</i> difficulties:</p>
<p>1. That such persons as <i>these</i> priests could be converted.</p>
<p>2. That the word οξλος, <i>company</i>, or <i>multitude</i>, could with propriety be applied to this class, which must have been inconsiderable in their numbers, when compared with the rest of the Jews.</p>
<p>To preserve the ancient reading, which is undoubtedly genuine, some have altered the text by <i>conjecture</i>; and, by putting a comma after οχλος, and a και before των ιερεων, make the text read thus: <i>And a great multitude, and some of the priests, were</i> <i>obedient to the faith</i>. This conjecture is unnecessary, as there is no such difficulty here as to require so desperate an expedient, which is not recommended by the evidence of a single MS. or version.</p>
<p>1. The grace of Christ Jesus can save even a murderous Jewish priest: his death is a grand atonement for <i>all crimes</i> and for the <i>worst</i> of <i>sinners</i>.</p>
<p>2. In the twenty-four courses of priests, there was not a <i>multitude</i> merely, but <i>multitudes</i>: indeed the number of ecclesiastics at Jerusalem was enormous. A great company out of these might be converted, and yet multitudes be left behind.</p>
