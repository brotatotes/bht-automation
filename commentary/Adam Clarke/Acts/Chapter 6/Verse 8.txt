Verse Acts 6:8. Stephen, full of faith and power — Instead of πιστεως, faith, χαριτος, grace, is the reading of ABD, several others, the Syriac of Erpen, the Coptic, Armenian, Vulgate, and some of the fathers. This reading Griesbach has admitted into the text. Some MSS. join both readings. Stephen was full of faith-gave unlimited credence to the promises of his Lord; he was full of grace-receiving the fulfilment of those promises, he enjoyed much of the unction of the Divine Spirit, and much of the favour of his God; and, in consequence, he was full of power, δυναμεως, of the Divine energy by which he was enabled to work great wonders and miracles among the people.
