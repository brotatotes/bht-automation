<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:8">Acts 6:8</span>. <i><b>Stephen, full of faith and power</b></i> — Instead of πιστεως, <i>faith</i>, χαριτος, <i>grace</i>, is the reading of ABD, several others, the <i>Syriac</i> of Erpen, the <i>Coptic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and some of the <i>fathers</i>. This reading Griesbach has admitted into the text. Some MSS. join both readings. Stephen was full of <i>faith</i>-gave unlimited credence to the promises of his Lord; he was full of <i>grace</i>-receiving the fulfilment of those promises, he enjoyed much of the unction of the Divine Spirit, and much of the <i>favour</i> of his God; and, in consequence, he was full of <i>power</i>, δυναμεως, of the <i>Divine energy</i> by which he was enabled to work <i>great wonders</i> <i>and miracles among the people</i>.</p>
