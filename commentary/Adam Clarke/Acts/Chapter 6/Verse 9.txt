<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:9">Acts 6:9</span>. <i><b>The synagogue - of the Libertines</b></i>, c.] That Jews and proselytes from various countries had now come up to Jerusalem to bring offerings, and to attend the feast of pentecost, we have already seen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9-11">Acts 2:9-11</span>. The persons mentioned here were <i>foreign Jews</i>, who appear to have had a synagogue peculiar to themselves at Jerusalem, in which they were accustomed to worship when they came to the public festivals.</p>
<p>Various opinions have been entertained concerning the <i>Libertines</i> mentioned here: Bp. <i>Pearce's</i> view of the subject appears to me to be the most correct.</p>
<p>"It is commonly thought that by this name is meant the sons of such Jews as had been slaves, and obtained their freedom by the favour of their masters but it is to be observed that with these <i>Libertines</i> the <i>Cyrenians</i> and <i>Alexandrians</i> are here joined, as having one and the same synagogue for their public worship. And it being known that the <i>Cyrenians</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:10">Acts 2:10</span>) lived in <i>Libya</i>, and the <i>Alexandrians</i> in the neighbourhood of it, it is most natural to look for the <i>Libertines</i> too in that part of the world. Accordingly we find <i>Suidas</i>, in his Lexicon, saying, upon the word λιβερτινοι, that it is ονοματουεθνους, <i>the name of a</i> <i>people</i>. And in <i>Gest. Collationis Carthagine habitae inter</i> <i>Catholicos et Donatistas</i>, published with <i>Optatus's</i> works, Paris, 1679, (No. 201, and p. 57,) we have these words: <i>Victor episcopus</i> <i>Ecclesiae Catholicae LIBERTINENSIS dixit, Unitas est illic,</i> <i>publicam non latet conscientiam</i>. <i>Unity is there: all the world</i> <i>knows it</i>. From these two passages it appears that there was in Libya a town or district called <i>Libertina</i>, whose inhabitants bore the name of λιβερτινοι, <i>Libertines</i>, when Christianity prevailed there. They had an episcopal see among them, and the above-mentioned Victor was their bishop at the council of <i>Carthage</i>, in the reign of the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>. And from hence it seems probable that the town or district, and the people, existed in the time of which Luke is here speaking. They were <i>Jews</i>, (no doubt,) and came up, as the <i>Cyrenian</i> and <i>Alexandrian</i> Jews did, to bring their offerings to Jerusalem, and to worship God in the temple there. <i>Cunaeus</i>, in his <i>Rep. Hebr</i>. ii. 23, says that the Jews who lived in <i>Alexandria</i> and <i>Libya</i>, and all other Jews who lived out of the Holy Land, except those of <i>Babylon</i> and its neighbourhood, were held in great contempt by the Jews who inhabited Jerusalem and Judea; partly on account of their quitting their proper country, and partly on account of their using the <i>Greek</i> language, and being quite ignorant of the other. For these reasons it seems probable that the <i>Libertines, Cyrenians</i>, and <i>Alexendrians</i>, had a separate synagogue; (as perhaps the <i>Cilicians</i> and those of Asia had;) the Jews of Jerusalem not suffering them to be present in their synagogues, or they not choosing to perform their public service in synagogues where a language was used which they did not understand."</p>
<p>It is supposed, also, that these synagogues had <i>theological</i>, if not <i>philosophical</i>, schools attached to them; and that it was the disciples or scholars of these schools who came forward to dispute with Stephen, and were enraged because they were confounded. For it is not an uncommon custom with those who have a bad cause, which can neither stand the test of Scripture nor reason, to endeavour to support it by <i>physical</i> when logical force has failed; and thus: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Prove their doctrine orthodox,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> By apostolic blows and knocks."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>In the reign of Queen Mary, when popery prevailed in this country, and the simplest women who had read the Bible were an overmatch for the greatest of the popish doctors; as they had neither Scripture nor reason to allege, they burned them alive, and thus terminated a controversy which they were unable to maintain. The same cause will ever produce the same effect: the Libertines, Cilicians, Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, pursued this course: Stephen confounded them by <i>Scripture</i> and <i>reason</i>, and they beat his brains out with <i>stones</i>! This was the most effectual way to silence a disputant whose wisdom they could not resist. In the same way were the Protestants treated, when by Scripture and reason they had shown the absurdity and wickedness of that anti-christian system which the fire and the sword were brought forth to establish. These persecutors professed great concern at first for the <i>souls</i> of those whom they variously tortured, and at last burned; but their tender mercies were cruel, and when they gave up the body to the flames, they most heartily consigned the soul to Satan. <i>Scires sanguine natos</i>: their conduct proclaimed their genealogy.</p>
