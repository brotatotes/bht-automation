<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:1">Acts 7:1</span>. <i><b>Are these things so?</b></i> â€” Hast thou predicted the <i>destruction</i> of the <i>temple</i>? And hast thou said that <i>Jesus of</i> <i>Nazareth</i> shall <i>change our customs</i>, abolish our religious rites and temple service? Hast thou spoken these <i>blasphemous things against</i> <i>Moses, and against God</i>? Here was some <i>colour of justice</i>; for Stephen was permitted to defend himself. And, in order to do this he thought it best to enter into a detail of their history from the commencement of their nation; and thus show how kindly God had dealt with <i>them</i>, and how ungraciously they and their fathers had requited <i>Him</i>. And all this naturally led him to the conclusion, that God could no longer bear with a people the cup of whose iniquity had been long overflowing; and therefore they might expect to find wrath, without mixture of mercy.</p>
<p>But how could St. Luke get all this circumstantial account? 1. He might have been present, and heard the whole; or, more probably, he had the account from St. Paul, whose companion he was, and who was certainly present when St. Stephen was judged and stoned, for he was consenting to his death, and kept the clothes of them who stoned him.
