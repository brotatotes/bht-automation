<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:14">Acts 7:14</span>. <i><b>Threescore and fifteen souls.</b></i> â€” There are several difficulties here, which it is hoped the reader will find satisfactorily removed in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:20">Genesis 46:20</span>. It is well known that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:27">Genesis 46:27</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+10:22">Deuteronomy 10:22</span>, their number is said to be <i>threescore and ten</i>; but Stephen quotes from the Septuagint, which adds five persons to the account which are not in the Hebrew text, <i>Machir, Gilead, Sutelaam, Taham</i>, and <i>Edem</i>; but see the note referred to above.</p>
