<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:16">Acts 7:16</span>. <i><b>And were carried over to Sychem</b></i> — "It is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+50:13">Genesis 50:13</span>, that Jacob was buried in the cave of the field of <i>Machpelah</i> before Mamre. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+24:32">Joshua 24:32</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:19">Exodus 13:19</span>, it is said that the bones of Joseph were carried out of Egypt by the Israelites, and buried in Shechem, which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem. As for the eleven brethren of Joseph, we are told by Josephus, Ant. lib. ii. cap. 8. sect. 2, that they were buried in <i>Hebron</i>, where their father had been buried. But, since the books of the Old Testament say nothing about this, the authority of Stephen (or of Luke here) for their being buried in <i>Sychem</i> is at least as good as that of Josephus for their being buried in Hebron."-Bp. <i>Pearce</i>.</p>
<p>We have the uniform consent of the Jewish writers that all the patriarchs were brought out of Egypt, and buried in Canaan, but none, except Stephen, mentions their being buried in <i>Sychem</i>. As Sychem belonged to the <i>Samaritans</i>, probably the Jews thought it too great an honour for that people to possess the bones of the patriarchs; and therefore have carefully avoided making any mention of it. This is Dr. Lightfoot's conjecture; and it is as probable as any other.</p>
<p><i><b>That Abraham bought for a sum of money</b></i> — Two accounts seem here to be confounded:</p>
<p>1. The <i>purchase</i> made by Abraham of the cave and field of Ephron, which was in the field of Machpelah: this purchase was made from the children of <i>Heth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:3">Genesis 23:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:10">Genesis 23:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:17">Genesis 23:17</span>.</p>
<p>2. The purchase made by Jacob, from the sons of <i>Hamor</i> or <i>Emmor</i>, of a sepulchre in which the bones of Joseph were laid: this was in Sychem or Shechem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:19">Genesis 33:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+24:32">Joshua 24:32</span>.</p>
<p>The word <i>Abraham</i>, therefore, in this place, is certainly a mistake; and the word <i>Jacob</i>, which some have supplied, is doubtless more proper. Bp. <i>Pearce</i> supposes that Luke originally wrote, ο ωνησατο τιμης αργυριου, <i>which he bought for a sum of money</i>: i.e. which <i>Jacob</i> bought, who is the last person, of the <i>singular</i> number, spoken of in the preceding verse. Those who saw that the word ωνησατο, <i>bought</i>, had no <i>nominative</i> case joined to it, and did not know where to find the proper one, seem to have inserted αβρααμ, <i>Abraham</i>, in the text, for that purpose, without sufficiently attending to the different circumstances of <i>his</i> purchase from that of <i>Jacob's</i>.</p>
