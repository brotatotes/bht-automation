<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:19">Acts 7:19</span>. <i><b>The same dealt subtilty</b></i> — ουτος κατασοφισαμενος, A word borrowed from the Septuagint, who thus translate the Hebrew נהחכמה לו <i>nithchokmah lo</i>, <i>let us deal wisely with it</i>, i.e. with <i>cunning</i> and <i>deceit</i>, as the <i>Greek</i> word implies; and which is evidently intended by the <i>Hebrew</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:35">Genesis 27:35</span>, <i>Thy brother came with subtilty</i>, which the Targumist explains by בחוכמא <i>be-chokma, with wisdom</i>, that is, <i>cunning</i> and <i>deceit</i>. For this the Egyptians were so <i>remarkable</i> that αιγυπτιαζειν, to <i>Egyptize</i>, signified to <i>act cunningly</i>, and to <i>use wicked devices</i>. Hence the Jews compared them to <i>foxes</i>; and it is of them that Canticles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="so+2:15">Song of Solomon 2:15</span>, is understood by the rabbins: <i>Take us the little foxes which spoil our vines</i>; destroy the Egyptians, who, having slain our male children, sought to destroy the name of Israel from the face of the earth.</p>
<p><i><b>To the end they might not live.</b></i> — Might not grow up and propagate, and thus build up the Hebrew nation.</p>
