<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span>. <i><b>Men, brethren, and fathers</b></i> — Rather, <i>brethren and</i> <i>fathers</i>, for ανδρες should not be translated separately from αδελφοι. Literally it is men-brethren, a very usual form in Greek; for every person knows that ανδρες αθηναιοι and ανδρες περσαι should not be translated men-Athenians and men-Persians, but simply <i>Athenians</i> and <i>Persians</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:22">Acts 17:22</span>. So, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:15">Luke 2:15</span>, ανθρωποι ποιμενες should be translated <i>shepherds</i>, not <i>men-shepherds</i>. And ανθρωπος βασιλευς <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:23">Matthew 18:23</span>, should not be translated <i>man-king</i>, but <i>king</i>, simply. By translating as we do, <i>men,</i> <i>brethren</i>, and <i>fathers</i>, and putting a comma after men, we make Stephen address <i>three</i> classes, when in fact there were but <i>two</i>: the elders and scribes, whom he addressed as <i>fathers</i>; and the <i>common people</i>, whom he calls <i>brethren</i>. See Bp. <i>Pearce</i>, and see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:27">Acts 8:27</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The God of glory appeared</b></i>, c.] As Stephen was now vindicating himself from the false charges brought against him, he shows that he had uttered no blasphemy, either against God, Moses, or the temple but states that his accusers, and the Jews in general, were guilty of the faults with which they charged him: that they had from the beginning rejected and despised Moses, and had always violated his laws. He proceeds to state that there is no blasphemy in saying that the temple shall be destroyed: they had been without a temple till the days of David; nor does God ever confine himself to temples built by hands, seeing he fills both heaven and earth; that Jesus is the prophet of whom Moses spoke, and whom they had persecuted, condemned, and at last put to death; that they were wicked and uncircumcised in heart and in ears, and always resisted the Holy Ghost as their fathers did. This is the substance of St. Stephen's defense as far as he was permitted to make it: a defense which they could not confute; containing charges which they most glaringly illustrated and confirmed, by adding the murder of this faithful disciple to that of his all-glorious Master.</p>
<p><i><b>Was in Mesopotamia</b></i> — In that part of it where <i>Ur</i> of the Chaldees was situated, near to Babel, and among the rivers, (Tigris and Euphrates,) which gave the name of Mesopotamia to the country. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:31">Genesis 11:31</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Before he dwelt in Charran</b></i> — This is called <i>Haran</i> in our translation of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:31">Genesis 11:31</span>; this place also belonged to Mesopotamia, as well as <i>Ur</i>, but is placed <i>west</i> of it on the maps. It seems most probable that Abraham had <i>two</i> calls, one in <i>Ur</i>, and the other in <i>Haran</i>. He left <i>Ur</i> at the first call, and came to <i>Haran</i>; he left <i>Haran</i> at the second call, and came into the promised land. See these things more particularly stated in the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1">Genesis 12:1</span>.</p>
