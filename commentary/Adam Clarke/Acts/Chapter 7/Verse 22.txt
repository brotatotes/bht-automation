<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:22">Acts 7:22</span>. <i><b>In all the wisdom of the Egyptians</b></i> — Who were, at that time, the most intelligent and best instructed people in the universe. Philo says, Moses was taught <i>arithmetic, geometry,</i> <i>poetry, music, medicine</i>, and the knowledge of <i>hieroglyphics</i>. In <i>Sohar Cadash</i>, fol. 46, it is said, "that, of the <i>ten portions</i> of wisdom which came into the world, the Egyptians had <i>nine</i>, and that all the inhabitants of the earth had only the remaining portion." Much of the same nature may be seen in the <i>rabbins</i>, though they apply the term wisdom here to magic.</p>
<p><i><b>Was mighty in words and in deeds.</b></i> — This may refer to the <i>glorious doctrines</i> he taught, and the <i>miracles</i> he wrought in Egypt. Josephus Ant. lib. ii. cap. 10, sect. 1, gives an account of his being general of an Egyptian army, defeating the Ethiopians, who had invaded Egypt, driving them back into their own country, and taking <i>Saba</i> their capital, which was afterwards called <i>Meroe</i>. But this, like many other <i>tales</i> of the same writer, is worthy of little credit.</p>
<p>Phoenix says the same of Achilles:-</p>
<p>Μυθων τε ῥητηρ' εμεναι, πρηκτηρα τε εργων. Il. ix. v. 443.</p>
<p>Not only an orator of words, but a performer of deeds.</p>
