And does not St. Stephen plainly say by this, that the very person, Jesus Christ, whom they had rejected and delivered up into the hands of Pilate to be crucified, was the person <i>alone</i> by whom they could be delivered out of their <i>spiritual bondage</i>, and made partakers of the inheritance among the saints in light? No doubt they felt that this was the drift of his speech.</p>
