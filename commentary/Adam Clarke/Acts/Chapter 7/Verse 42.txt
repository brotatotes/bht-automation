<p>Verse 42. <i><b>Then God turned, and gave them up</b></i>, c.] He left them to themselves, and then they deified and worshipped the sun, moon, planets, and principal stars.</p>
<p><i><b>In the book of the prophets</b></i> — As this quotation is found in Amos, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+5:25">Amos 5:25</span>, by the <i>book of the prophets</i> is meant the <i>twelve minor prophets</i>, which, in the ancient Jewish division of the sacred writings, formed only <i>one book</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Have ye offered to me slain beasts</b></i> — It is certain that the Israelites did offer various sacrifices to God, while in the wilderness and it is as certain that they scarcely ever did it with an upright heart. They were idolatrous, either in <i>heart</i> or <i>act</i>, in almost all their religious services; these were therefore so very imperfect that they were counted for <i>nothing</i> in the sight of God; for this seems to be strongly implied in the question here asked, <i>Have ye offered to ME</i> (exclusively and with an upright heart) <i>slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of</i> <i>forty years</i>? On the contrary, these forty years were little else than a tissue of rebellion and idolatry.</p>
