<p>Verse 43. <i><b>Ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them.</b></i> — This is a literal translation of the place, as it stands in the <i>Septuagint</i>; but in the Hebrew text it stands thus: <i>But ye have</i> <i>borne the tabernacle of your Molech, and Chiun, your images, the</i> <i>star of your god which ye made to yourselves</i>. This is the simple version of the place, unless we should translate ונסאתם את סכות מלככם <i>venasatem eth Siccuth malkekem, ye took</i> <i>SIKUTH your king</i>, (instead of <i>ye took up the tabernacle of your</i> <i>MOLEK</i>,) as some have done. The place is indeed very obscure, and the two texts do not tend to cast light on each other. The rabbins say <i>siccuth</i>, which we translate <i>tabernacle</i>, is the name of an <i>idol</i>. Molech is generally understood to mean the <i>sun</i>; and several persons of good judgment think that by <i>Remphan</i> or <i>Raiphan</i> is meant the planet <i>Saturn</i>, which the <i>Copts</i> call ρηφαν, <i>Rephan</i>. It will be seen above that instead of <i>Remphan</i>, or, as some of the best MSS. have it, <i>Rephan</i>, the Hebrew text has כיון <i>Chiun</i>, which might possibly be a corruption of ריפן <i>Reiphan</i>, as it would be very easy to mistake the כ <i>caph</i> for ר <i>resh</i>, and the <i>vau</i> <i>shurek</i> ו for פ <i>pe</i>. This emendation would bring the <i>Hebrew,</i> <i>Septuagint</i>, and the <i>text of Luke</i>, nearer together; but there is no authority either from MSS. or <i>versions</i> for this correction: however, as <i>Chiun</i> is mentioned in no other place, though <i>Molech</i> often occurs, it is the more likely that there might have been some very early mistake in the text, and that the Septuagint has preserved the true reading.</p>
<p>It was customary for the idolaters of all nations to carry images of their gods about them in their journeys, military expeditions, c. and these, being <i>very small</i>, were enclosed in little boxes, perhaps some of them in the shape of temples, called <i>tabernacles</i>; or, as we have it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:24">Acts 19:24</span>, <i>shrines</i>. These little gods were the <i>penates</i> and <i>lares</i> among the Romans, and the <i>tselems</i> or <i>talismans</i> among the ancient eastern idolaters. The Hebrew text seems to refer to these when it says, the <i>tabernacle</i> of your Molech, and <i>Chiun, your images</i>, צלמיכם tsalmeycem, your <i>tselems</i>, τους τυπους, the types or simulachres of your gods. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:19">Genesis 31:19</span>. Many of those small portable images are now in my own collection, all of copper or brass; some of them the identical <i>penates</i> of the ancient <i>Romans</i>, and others the offspring of the <i>Hindoo</i> idolatry; they are from an <i>ounce</i> weight to <i>half a pound</i>. Such images as these I suppose the idolatrous Israelites, in imitation of their neighbours, the <i>Moabites, Ammonites</i>, c., to have <i>carried about</i> with them and to such the prophet appears to me unquestionably to allude.</p>
<p><i><b>I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</b></i> — You have carried your idolatrous images about; and I will carry you into captivity, and see if the gods in whom ye have trusted can deliver you from my hands. Instead of <i>beyond Babylon</i>, Amos, from whom the quotation is made, says, <i>I will carry you beyond Damascus</i>. Where they were carried was into Assyria and Media, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:6">2 Kings 17:6</span>: now, this was not only <i>beyond Damascus</i>, but <i>beyond Babylon</i> itself; and, as Stephen knew this to be the fact, he states it here, and thus more precisely fixes the place of their captivity. The Holy Spirit, in his <i>farther</i> revelations, has undoubted right to <i>extend</i> or illustrate those which he had given <i>before</i>. This case frequently occurs when a former prophecy is quoted in later times.</p>
