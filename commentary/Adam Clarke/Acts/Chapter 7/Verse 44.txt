<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>wilderness</b></i> — That is, the tabernacle in which the two tables of stone written by the finger of God were laid up, as a testimony that he had delivered these laws to the people, and that they had promised to obey them. As one great design of St. Stephen was to show the Jews that they placed too much dependence on <i>outward</i> privileges, and had not used the law, the tabernacle, the temple, nor the temple service, for the purpose of their institution, he labours to bring them to a due sense of this, that conviction might lead to repentance and conversion. And he farther shows that God did not <i>confine</i> his worship to <i>one place</i>, or <i>form</i>. He was worshipped <i>without</i> any <i>shrine</i> in the times of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, c. He was worshipped <i>with</i> a <i>tabernacle</i>, or <i>portable temple</i>, in the wilderness. He was worshipped also in the <i>fixed temple</i> projected by David, but built by Solomon. He asserts farther that his infinite majesty cannot be confined to temples, made by human hands and where there is neither <i>tabernacle</i> nor <i>temple</i>, (in any part of his vast dominions,) he may be worshipped acceptably by the upright in heart. Thus he proves that neither tabernacle nor temple are <i>essentially</i> requisite for the true worship of the true God. Concerning the tabernacle to which St. Stephen here refers, the reader is requested to consult the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:8">Exodus 25:8</span>, c., and the subsequent chapters.</p>
<p><i><b>Speaking unto Moses</b></i> — ο λαλων, <i>Who spake</i>, as in the <i>margin</i> signifying the angel of God who spake to Moses, or God himself. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:40">Exodus 25:40</span>.</p>
