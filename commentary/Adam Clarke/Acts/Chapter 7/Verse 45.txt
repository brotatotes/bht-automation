<p>Verse 45. <i><b>Brought in with Jesus</b></i> — That is, with JOSHUA, whom the Greek version, quoted by St. Stephen, always writes ιησους, JESUS, but which should constantly be written <i>Joshua</i> in such cases as the present, in order to avoid ambiguity and confusion.</p>
<p><i><b>Possession of the Gentiles</b></i> — των εθνων, <i>of the heathens</i>, whom Joshua conquered, and gave their land to the children of Israel.</p>
