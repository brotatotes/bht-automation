Brought in with Jesus — That is, with JOSHUA, whom the Greek version, quoted by St. Stephen, always writes ιησους, JESUS, but which should constantly be written Joshua in such cases as the present, in order to avoid ambiguity and confusion.Possession of the Gentiles — των εθνων, of the heathens, whom Joshua conquered, and gave their land to the children of Israel.
