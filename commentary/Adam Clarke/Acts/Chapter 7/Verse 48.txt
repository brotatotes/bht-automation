<p>Verse 48. <i><b>The Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands</b></i> — Here St. Stephen evidently refers to Solomon's speech, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:27">1 Kings 8:27</span>. <i>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heaven, and</i> <i>the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this</i> <i>house that I have builded</i>? Both Solomon and St. Stephen mean that the <i>majesty</i> of God could not be contained, not even in the whole vortex of nature; much less in any <i>temple</i> which human hands could erect.</p>
<p><i><b>As saith the prophet</b></i> — The place referred to is <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:1-2">Isaiah 66:1-2</span> : <i>Thus saith the Lord, the heaven is my throne, and the earth my</i> <i>footstool. Where is the house that ye build unto me? And where is</i> <i>the place of my rest</i>, &amp;c., with which the quotation by Stephen agrees.</p>
