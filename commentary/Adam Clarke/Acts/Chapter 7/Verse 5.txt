Gave him none inheritance — Both Abraham and Jacob had small parcels of land in Canaan; but they had them by purchase, not by God's gift; for, as Abraham was obliged to buy a burying-place in Canaan, Genesis 23:3-18, it is obvious he had no inheritance there.And to his seed after him — See Genesis 12:7 (note); Genesis 13:15, and the notes there.
