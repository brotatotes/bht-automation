<p>Verse 51. <i><b>Ye stiff-necked</b></i> — σκληροτραχηλοι. A metaphor taken from <i>untoward oxen</i>, who cannot be broken into the yoke; and whose strong necks cannot be bended to the right or the left.</p>
<p><i><b>Uncircumcised in heart and ears</b></i> — This was a Jewish mode of speech, often used by the prophets. Circumcision was instituted, not only as a <i>sign</i> and <i>seal</i> of the <i>covenant</i> into which the Israelites entered with their Maker, but also as a type of that <i>purity</i> and <i>holiness</i> which the law of God requires; hence there was an <i>excision</i> of what was deemed not only <i>superfluous</i> but also <i>injurious</i>; and by this <i>cutting off</i>, the propensity to that crime which ruins the body, debases the mind, and was generally the forerunner of <i>idolatry</i>, was happily lessened. It would be easy to prove this, were not the subject too delicate. Where the spirit of disobedience was found, where the heart was prone to iniquity, and the ears impatient of reproof and counsel, the person is represented as <i>uncircumcised</i> in those parts, because devoted to iniquity, impatient of reproof, and refusing to obey. In <i>Pirkey</i> <i>Eliezer</i>, chap. 29, "Rabbi Seira said, There are <i>five</i> species of <i>uncircumcision</i> in the world; <i>four</i> in <i>man</i>, and <i>one</i> in <i>trees.</i> Those in man are the following:-</p>
<p>"1. Uncircumcision of the EAR. <i>Behold, their EAR is</i> <i>uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+6:10">Jeremiah 6:10</span>.</p>
<p>"2. The uncircumcision of the LIPS. <i>How shall Pharaoh hear me,</i> <i>who am of uncircumcised LIPS</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:12">Exodus 6:12</span>.</p>
<p>"3. Uncircumcision of HEART. <i>If then their uncircumcised HEARTS</i> <i>be humbled</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+26:41">Leviticus 26:41</span>.</p>
<p><i>Circumcise therefore the FORESKIN of your HEART</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+10:16">Deuteronomy 10:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:4">Jeremiah 4:4</span>.</p>
<p><i>For all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the HEART</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:26">Jeremiah 9:26</span>.</p>
<p>"4. The uncircumcision of the FLESH. <i>Ye shall circumcise the</i> <i>FLESH of your FORESKIN</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:11">Genesis 17:11</span>."</p>
<p><i><b>Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost</b></i> —</p>
<p>1. Because they were uncircumcised in <i>heart</i>, they always resisted the <i>influences</i> of the Holy Spirit, bringing light and conviction to their minds in consequence of which they became hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, and neither repented at the preaching of John, nor credited the glad tidings told them by Christ and the apostles.</p>
<p>2. Because they were uncircumcised in <i>ears</i>, they would neither hear nor obey Moses, the prophets, Christ, nor the apostles.</p>
<p><i><b>As your fathers</b></i><b> did, </b><i><b>so</b></i><b> do </b><i><b>ye.</b></i> — They were disobedient <i>children</i>, of disobedient <i>parents</i>: in all their generations they had been disobedient and perverse. This whole <i>people</i>, as well as this <i>text</i>, are fearful proofs that the Holy Spirit, the almighty energy of the living God, may be resisted and rendered of none effect. This Spirit is not sent to <i>stocks, stones</i>, or <i>machines</i>, but to <i>human</i> <i>beings</i> endued with <i>rational</i> souls; therefore it is not to work on them with that <i>irresistible</i> energy which it must exert on <i>inert</i> matter, in order to conquer the <i>vis inertiae</i> or disposition to abide eternally in a motionless state, which is the state of all inanimate beings; but it works upon <i>understanding, will, judgment,</i> <i>conscience</i>, c., in order to enlighten, convince, and persuade. If, after all, the <i>understanding</i>, the eye of the mind, refuses to behold the <i>light</i> the <i>will</i> determines to remain obstinate; the <i>judgment</i> purposes to draw false inferences; and the <i>conscience</i> hardens itself against every check and remonstrance, (and all this is possible to a rational soul, which must be dealt with in a rational way,) then the Spirit of God, being thus resisted, is grieved, and the sinner is left to reap the fruit of his doings. To <i>force</i> the man to see, feel, repent, believe, and be saved, would be to alter the essential principles of his creation and the nature of <i>mind</i>, and reduce him into the state of a <i>machine</i>, the <i>vis inertiae</i> of which was to be overcome and conducted by a certain quantum of <i>physical force</i>, superior to that resistance which would be the natural effect of the certain quantum of the <i>vis inertiae</i> possessed by the subject on and by which this agent was to operate. Now, <i>man</i> cannot be operated on in this way, because it is contrary to the laws of his creation and nature; nor can the Holy Ghost work on that as a <i>machine</i> which himself has made a <i>free agent</i>. Man therefore <i>may</i>, and generally <i>does</i>, resist the Holy Ghost; and the whole revelation of God bears unequivocal testimony to this most dreadful <i>possibility</i>, and most awful <i>truth</i>. It is trifling with the sacred text to say that resisting the Holy Ghost here means resisting the laws of Moses, the exhortations, threatenings, and promises of the prophets, c. These, it is true, the uncircumcised <i>ear</i> may resist but the uncircumcised <i>heart</i> is that <i>alone</i> to which the <i>Spirit</i> that gave the laws, exhortations, promises, c, speaks; and, as <i>matter</i> resists <i>matter</i>, so <i>spirit</i> resists <i>spirit</i>. These were not only uncircumcised in <i>ear</i>, but uncircumcised also in <i>heart</i>; and therefore they resisted the Holy Ghost, not only in his <i>declarations</i> and <i>institutions</i>, but also in his <i>actual</i> energetic <i>operations</i> upon their <i>minds</i>.</p>
