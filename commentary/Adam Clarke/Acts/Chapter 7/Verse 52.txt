<p>Verse 52. <i><b>Which of the prophets have not your fathers</b></i><b> </b><i><b>persecuted?</b></i> — Ye have not only resisted the Holy Ghost, but ye have <i>persecuted</i> all those who have spoken to you in <i>his name</i>, and by his <i>influence</i>: thus ye prove your opposition to the Spirit <i>himself</i>, by your opposition to every thing that <i>proceeds</i> from <i>him</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>They have slain them</b></i>, c.] Isaiah, <i>who showed before of the</i> <i>coming of Christ</i>, the Jews report, was sawn asunder at the command of Manasseh.</p>
<p><i><b>The coming of the Just One</b></i> — του δικαιου, Meaning Jesus Christ emphatically called the <i>just</i> or <i>righteous person</i>, not only because of the <i>unspotted</i> integrity of his <i>heart</i> and <i>life</i>, but because of his plenary <i>acquittal</i>, when tried at the tribunal of Pilate: <i>I</i> <i>find no fault at all in him</i>. The mention of this circumstance served greatly to aggravate their guilt. The character of <i>Just One</i> is applied to our Lord in <i>three</i> other places of Scripture: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:6">James 5:6</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The betrayers and murderers</b></i> — Ye first <i>delivered him up</i> into the hands of the Romans, hoping they would have put him to death; but, when they <i>acquitted</i> him, then, in opposition to the declaration of his innocence, and in outrage to every <i>form</i> of <i>justice</i>, ye took and <i>murdered</i> him. This was a most terrible charge; and one against which they could set up no sort of defense. No wonder, then, that they were instigated by the spirit of the old destroyer, which they never resisted, to add another murder to that of which they had been so recently guilty.</p>
