<p>Verse 53. <i><b>By the disposition of angels</b></i> — εις διαταγας αγγελων. After all that has been said on this difficult passage, perhaps the simple meaning is, that there were <i>ranks</i>, διαταγαι, <i>of angels</i> attending on the Divine Majesty when he gave the law: a circumstance which must have added greatly to the grandeur and solemnity of the occasion; and to this <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:17">Psalms 68:17</span> seems to me most evidently to allude: <i>The chariots of God</i> are <i>twenty thousand, even</i> <i>many thousands of angels: the Lord is among them as in SINAI, in</i> <i>the holy place</i>. It was not then by the <i>mouths</i> nor by the <i>hands</i> of angels, as <i>prime agents</i>, that Moses, and through him the people, received the law; but God himself gave it, accompanied with <i>many</i> <i>thousands</i> of those glorious beings. As it is probable they might be <i>assisting</i> in this most glorious solemnity, therefore St. Paul might say, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>, that it was <i>ordained by angels</i>, διαταγεις δι αγγελων, <i>in the hand of a</i> <i>Mediator</i>. And as they were the only <i>persons</i> that could <i>appear</i>, for no man hath <i>seen</i> God at any time, therefore the apostle might say farther, (if indeed he refers to the same transaction, see the note there,) <i>the word spoken by angels was steadfast</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>. But the circumstances of this case are not sufficiently plain to lead to the knowledge of what was done by the angels in this most wonderful transaction; only we learn, from the use made of this circumstance by St. Stephen, that it added much to the <i>enormity</i> of their transgression, that they did not keep a law, in dispensing of which the <i>ministry of angels</i> had been employed. Some think Moses, Aaron, and Joshua are the <i>angels</i> here intended; and others think that the <i>fire, light, darkness, cloud</i> and <i>thick darkness</i> were the angels which Jehovah used on this occasion, and to which St. Stephen refers; but neither of these senses appears sufficiently natural, and particularly the latter.</p>
