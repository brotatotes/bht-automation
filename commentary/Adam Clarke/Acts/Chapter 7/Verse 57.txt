This was a fearful proof against them; for if Jesus was at the <i>right hand of God</i>, then they had murdered an <i>innocent</i> person; and they must infer that God's justice must speedily avenge his death. They were determined not to suffer a man to live any longer who could say he saw the <i>heavens opened and</i> <i>Jesus Christ standing at the right hand of God</i>.</p>
