<p>Verse 59. <i><b>And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God</b></i> â€” The word <i>God</i> is not found in any MS. or version, nor in any of the primitive fathers except <i>Chrysostom</i>. It is not genuine, and should not be inserted here: the whole sentence literally reads thus: <i>And</i> <i>they stoned Stephen, invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my</i> <i>spirit</i>! Here is a most manifest proof that <i>prayer is offered to</i> <i>Jesus Christ</i>; and that in the most solemn circumstances in which it could be offered, viz., when a man was <i>breathing his last</i>. This is, properly speaking, one of the <i>highest acts of worship</i> which can be offered to God; and, if Stephen had not conceived Jesus Christ to be GOD, could he have committed his soul into his hands?</p>
<p>We may farther observe that this place affords a full proof of the <i>immateriality of the soul</i>; for he could not have commended his spirit to Christ, had he believed that he had no spirit, or, in other words, that his <i>body</i> and <i>soul</i> were <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i> <i>thing</i>. Allowing this most eminent saint to have had a correct notion of theology, and that, being full of the Holy Ghost, as he was at this time, he could make no mistake in matters of such vast weight and importance, then these two points are satisfactorily stated in this verse:</p>
<p>1. That Jesus <i>Christ</i> is GOD; for Stephen died praying to him.</p>
<p>2. That the soul is <i>immaterial</i>; for Stephen, in dying, commends his departing spirit into the hand of Christ.</p>
