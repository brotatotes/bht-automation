<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:6">Acts 7:6</span>. <i><b>That his seed should sojourn in a strange land</b></i> — See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:13">Genesis 15:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:14">Genesis 15:14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Four hundred years.</b></i> — MOSES says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:40">Exodus 12:40</span>, <i>that the sojourning of the children of Israel in Egypt-was 430</i> <i>years</i>. See the note there. St. PAUL has the same number, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span>; and so has Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. lib. ii. cap. 1, sect. 9; in <i>Bell</i>. lib. v. cap. 9, sect. 4. St. Stephen uses the round number of 400, leaving out the odd <i>tens</i>, a thing very common, not only in the sacred writers, but in all others, those alone excepted who write professedly on <i>chronological</i> matters.</p>
