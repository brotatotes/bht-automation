<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:7">Acts 7:7</span>. <i><b>Will I judge</b></i> — κρινωεγω, <i>I will punish</i>, for in this sense the Greek word is frequently taken. "When," says Bp. <i>Pearce</i>, "a malefactor is brought before a judge, the judge does <i>three</i> things:</p>
<p>1. he tries or judges him;</p>
<p>2. he then gives his judgment or sentence; and,</p>
<p>3. he puts the law in execution, and punishes him.</p>
<p>Hence κρινω, at different times, signifies each of these things; and the sense of the word is to be determined by the context. Here it signifies <i>to punish</i>, as κριμα is used for <i>punishment</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:2">Romans 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30-31">1 Corinthians 11:30-31</span>." The Egyptians, to whom the Israelites were in bondage, were punished by the <i>ten plagues</i>, described <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:19-30">Exodus 7:19-30</span></p>
