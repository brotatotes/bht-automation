<p><i><b>And so</b></i><b> Abraham </b><i><b>begat Isaac</b></i> — και ουτως, And <i>thus</i>, in this covenant, he begat Isaac and as a proof that he was born under this covenant, was a true son of Abraham and inheritor of the promises, he circumcised him the eighth day; and this rite being observed in the family of Isaac, Jacob and his twelve sons were born under the covenant; and thus their descendants, the twelve tribes, being born under the same covenant, and practising the same rite, were, by the ordinance of Gods legal inheritors of the promised land, and all the secular and spiritual advantages connected with it.</p>
