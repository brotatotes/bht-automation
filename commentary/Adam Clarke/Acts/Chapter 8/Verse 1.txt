<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>. <i><b>Saul was consenting unto his death.</b></i> — So inveterate was the hatred that this man bore to Christ and his followers that he <i>delighted</i> in their destruction. So blind was his heart with superstitious zeal that he thought he did God service by offering him the blood of a fellow creature, whose creed he supposed to be erroneous. The word συνευδοκων signifies <i>gladly consenting</i>, being <i>pleased</i> with his murderous work! How dangerous is a party spirit; and how destructive may zeal even for the true worship of God prove, if not inspired and regulated by the spirit of Christ!</p>
<p>It has already been remarked that this clause belongs to the conclusion of the preceding chapter; so it stands in the <i>Vulgate</i>, and so it <i>should</i> stand in every version.</p>
<p><i><b>There was a great persecution</b></i> — The Jews could not bear the doctrine of Christ's <i>resurrection</i>; for this point being proved demonstrated <i>his innocence</i> and <i>their</i> enormous <i>guilt</i> in his crucifixion; as therefore the apostles continued to insist strongly on the resurrection of Christ, the persecution against them became hot and general.</p>
<p><i><b>They were all scattered abroad - except the apostles.</b></i> — Their Lord had commanded them, when persecuted in one city, to flee to another: this they did, but, wherever they went, they proclaimed the same doctrines, though at the risk and hazard of their lives. It is evident, therefore, that they did not flee from persecution, or the death it threatened; but merely in obedience to their Lord's command. Had they fled through the fear of death, they would have taken care not to provoke persecution to follow them, by continuing to proclaim the same truths that provoked it in the first instance.</p>
<p>That the <i>apostles</i> were not also exiled is a very remarkable fact: they continued in Jerusalem, to found and organize the infant Church; and it is marvellous that the hand of persecution was not permitted to touch <i>them</i>. Why this should be we cannot tell; but so it pleased the great Head of the Church. Bp. Pearce justly suspects those accounts, in Eusebius and others, that state that the apostles went very shortly after Christ's ascension into different countries, preaching and founding Churches. He thinks this is inconsistent with the various intimations we have of the continuance of the apostles in Jerusalem; and refers particularly to the following texts: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:14">Acts 8:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:25">Acts 8:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:26">Acts 9:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:27">Acts 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:2">Acts 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1-4">Acts 12:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:4">Acts 15:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:6">Acts 15:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:17">Acts 21:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:18">Acts 21:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17-19">Galatians 1:17-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>. The Church at Jerusalem was the <i>first CHRISTIAN Church</i>; and consequently, the <i>boast</i> of the Church of Rome is vain and unfounded. From this time a new aera of the Church arose. Hitherto the apostles and disciples confined their labours among their countrymen in Jerusalem. Now persecution drove the latter into different parts of Judea, and through Samaria; and those who had received the doctrine of Christ at the pentecost, who had come up to Jerusalem from different countries to be present at the feast, would naturally return, especially at the commencement of the persecution, to their respective countries, and proclaim to their countrymen the Gospel of the grace of God. To effect this grand purpose, the Spirit was poured out at the day of pentecost; that the multitudes from different quarters, partaking of the word of life, might carry it back to the different nations among whom they had their residence. One of the fathers has well observed, that "these holy fugitives were like so many lamps, lighted by the fire of the Holy Spirit, spreading every where the sacred flame by which they themselves had been illuminated."</p>
