<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:10">Acts 8:10</span>. <i><b>This man is the great power of God.</b></i> — That is, he is invested with it, and can command and use it. They certainly did not believe him to be <i>God</i>; but they thought him to be endued with a great supernatural power.</p>
<p>There is a remarkable reading here in several MSS. which should not pass unnoticed. In ABCDE, several others, together with the <i>AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac, Vulgate, Itala, Origen</i>, and <i>Irenaeus</i>, the word καλουμενη is <i>added</i> before μεγαλη, and the passage reads thus, <i>This person is that power of God which is</i> <i>CALLED the GREAT</i>. This appears to be the true reading; but what the Samaritans meant by that power of God which they termed <i>the</i> <i>Great</i>, we know not. Simon endeavoured to persuade the people that he was a very great personage, and he succeeded.</p>
