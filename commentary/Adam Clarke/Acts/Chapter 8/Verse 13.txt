<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:13">Acts 8:13</span>. <i><b>Simon himself believed also</b></i> — He was struck with <i>the</i> <i>doctrine and miracles of Philip</i>-he saw that these were <i>real</i>; he knew his own to be <i>fictitious</i>. He believed therefore that Jesus was the Messiah, and was in consequence <i>baptized</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Continued with Philip, and wondered</b></i> — εξιστατο, He was as much <i>astonished</i> and <i>confounded</i> at the miracles of Philip as the people of Samaria were at his <i>legerdemain</i>. It is worthy of remark that εξιστατο comes from the same root, εξιστημι, as the word εξιστων, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>, and, if our translation <i>bewitched</i> be proper there, it should be retained here; and then we should read, <i>Then Simon himself believed and was baptized, and</i> <i>continued with Philip, being BEWITCHED, beholding the miracles and</i> <i>signs which were done</i>. We may see, from this circumstance, how improper the term <i>bewitched</i> is, in the 9th and 11th verses. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:11">Acts 8:11</span></p>
