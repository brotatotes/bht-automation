Verse Acts 8:14. The word of God — The doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ.They sent unto them Peter and John — There was no individual ruler among the apostles-there was not even a president of the council; and Peter, far from being chief of the apostles, is one of those sent, with the same commission and authority as John, to confirm the Samaritans in the faith.
