<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:15">Acts 8:15</span>. <i><b>When they were come down</b></i> — The very same mode of speaking, in reference to <i>Jerusalem</i> formerly, obtains now in reference to <i>London</i>. The metropolis in both cases is considered as the <i>centre</i>; and all parts, in every direction, no matter how distant, or how <i>situated</i>, are represented as <i>below</i> the metropolis. Hence we so frequently hear of persons going <i>up</i> to Jerusalem: and going <i>down</i> from the same. So in London the people speak of going <i>down</i> to the country; and, in the country, of going <i>up</i> to London. It is necessary to make this remark, lest any person should be led away with the notion that Jerusalem was situated on the highest ground in Palestine. It is a mode of speech which is used to designate a <i>royal</i> or <i>imperial</i> city.</p>
<p><i><b>Prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.</b></i> — It seems evident from this case, that even the most holy <i>deacons</i>, though full of the Holy Ghost themselves, could not confer this heavenly gift on others. This was the prerogative of the <i>apostles</i>, and they were only <i>instruments</i>; but they were those alone by which the Lord chose to work. They prayed and laid their hands on the disciples, and God sent down the gift; so, the blessing came <i>from</i> God <i>by</i> the apostles, and not <i>from</i> the apostles to the people. But for what purpose was the Holy Spirit thus given? Certainly not for the sanctification of the souls of the people: this they had on believing in Christ Jesus; and this the apostles never dispensed. It was the <i>miraculous</i> gifts of the Spirit which were thus communicated: the <i>speaking with different tongues</i>, and those <i>extraordinary</i> qualifications which were necessary for the successful preaching of the Gospel; and doubtless many, if not all, of those on whom the apostles laid their hands, were employed more or less in the <i>public work</i> of the Church.</p>
