<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:2">Acts 8:2</span>. <i><b>Devout men carried Stephen</b></i><b> to his burial</b>] The Greek word, συνεκομισαν, signifies not only to <i>carry</i>, or rather to <i>gather up</i>, but also to do every thing necessary for the <i>interment</i> of the dead. Among the Jews, and indeed among most nations of the earth, it was esteemed a work of piety, charity, and mercy, to bury the dead. The Jews did not bury those who were condemned by the Sanhedrin in the burying place of the fathers, as they would not bury the <i>guilty</i> with the <i>innocent</i>; and they had a separate place for those who were stoned, and for those that were burnt. According to the <i>Tract Sanh</i>. fol. 45, 46, the <i>stone</i> wherewith any one was stoned, the <i>post</i> on which he was hanged, the <i>sword</i> by which he was beheaded, and the <i>cord</i> by which he was strangled, were buried in the same place with the bodies of the executed persons. As these persons died under the curse of the law, the instruments by which they were put to death were considered as unclean and accursed, and therefore buried with their bodies. Among the ancients, whatever was <i>grateful</i> or <i>useful</i> to a person in life was ordinarily buried with him; thus the <i>sword, spear, shield</i>, c., of the soldier were put in the same grave the <i>faithful dog</i> of the hunter, c., c. And on this principle the wife of a Brahman burns with the body of her deceased husband.</p>
<p><i><b>Made great lamentation over him.</b></i> — This was never done over any condemned by the Sanhedrin-they only bemoaned such privately this great lamentation over Stephen, if the same custom then prevailed as afterwards, is a proof that Stephen was not condemned by the Sanhedrin he probably fell a sacrifice to the fury of the bigoted incensed mob, the Sanhedrin not interfering to prevent the illegal execution.</p>
