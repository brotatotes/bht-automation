<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:20">Acts 8:20</span>. <i><b>Thy money perish with thee</b></i> — This is an awful declaration; and imports thus much, that <i>if he did not repent</i>, he and his ill-gotten goods would perish together; his <i>money</i> should be <i>dissipated</i>, and his <i>soul</i> go into <i>perdition</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That the gift of God may be purchased</b></i> — Peter takes care to inform not only Simon, but all to whom these presents may come, that the Spirit of God is the gift of God alone, and consequently cannot be purchased with money; for what reward can HE receive from his <i>creatures</i>, to whom the silver and the gold belong, the cattle on a thousand hills, the earth and its fulness!</p>
