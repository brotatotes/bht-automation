<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:21">Acts 8:21</span>. <i><b>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter</b></i> — Thou hast no part among the <i>faithful</i>, and no <i>lot in this ministry</i>. That the word κληρος, which we translate <i>lot</i>, is to be understood as implying a <i>spiritual portion, office</i>, c., see proved in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+26:55">Numbers 26:55</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thy heart is not right</b></i> — It is not through motives of purity, benevolence, or love to the souls of men, that thou desirest to be enabled to confer the Holy Ghost it is through pride, vain glory, and love of money: thou wouldest now give a little money that thou mightest, by thy new gift, gain much.</p>
