<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:24">Acts 8:24</span>. <i><b>Pray ye to the Lord for me</b></i> — The words of Peter certainly made a deep impression on Simon's mind; and he must have had a high opinion of the apostle's sanctity and influence with God, when he thus commended himself to their prayers. And we may hope well of his repentance and salvation, if the reading of the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, and the margin of the later <i>Syriac</i> may be relied on: <i>Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none</i> (τουτων των κακων) OF ALL THOSE EVILS <i>which ye have spoken</i> (μοι) TO ME, <i>may come upon</i> <i>me</i>: (ος πολλα κλαιων ου διελιμπανεν) WHO WEPT GREATLY, <i>and</i> DID NOT CEASE. That is, he was an <i>incessant</i> penitent. However favourably this or any other MS. may speak of Simon, he is generally supposed to have "grown worse and worse, opposing the apostles and the Christian doctrine, and deceiving many cities and provinces by magical operations; till being at Rome, in the reign of the Emperor <i>Claudius</i>, he boasted that he could <i>fly</i>, and when exhibiting before the emperor and the senate, St. Peter and St. Paul being present, who knew that his flying was occasioned by <i>magic</i>, prayed to God that the people might be undeceived, and that his power might fail; in consequence of which he came tumbling down, and died soon after of his bruises." This account comes in a most questionable shape, and has no evidence which can challenge our assent. To me, <i>it</i> and the rest of the things spoken of Simon the sorcerer appear utterly unworthy of credit. <i>Calmet</i> makes a general collection of what is to be found in <i>Justin</i> <i>Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian; Eusebius, Theodoret, Augustine</i>, and others, on the subject of Simon Magus; and to him, if the reader think it worth the pains, he may refer. The substance of these accounts is given above, and in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span><i>"</i>; and to say the least of them they are all very <i>dubious</i>. The tale of his having an altar erected to him at Rome, with the inscription, <i>Simoni sancto deo</i>, "To the holy god Simon," has been founded on an utter mistake, and has been long ago sufficiently confuted. See the inscriptions in <i>Gruter</i>, vol. i. p. 96, inscript. No. 5, 6, 7.</p>
