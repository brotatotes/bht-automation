<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:26">Acts 8:26</span>. <i><b>Arise, and go toward the south</b></i> — How circumstantially particular are these directions! Every thing is so precisely marked that there is no danger of the apostle missing his way. He is to perform some great <i>duty</i>; but <i>what</i>, he is not informed. The <i>road</i> which he is to take is marked out; but <i>what</i> he is to <i>do</i> in that road, or <i>how far</i> he is to proceed, he is not told! It is GOD who employs him, and requires of him <i>implicit</i> obedience. If he <i>do</i> <i>his will</i>, according to the <i>present direction</i>, he shall know, by the <i>issue</i>, that God hath sent him on an errand worthy of his wisdom and goodness. We have a similar instance of <i>circumstantial</i> <i>direction</i> from God in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11">Acts 9:11</span>: <i>Arise, go into the street called Straight, and inquire in the</i> <i>house of Judas for one Saul of Tarsus</i>, c. And another instance, still more particular, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:5">Acts 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:6">Acts 10:6</span>: <i>Send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is</i> <i>Peter he lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the</i> <i>sea side</i>. God never sends any man on a message, without giving him such directions as shall prevent all mistakes and miscarriages, if simply and implicitly followed. This is also strictly true of the doctrines contained in his word: no soul ever missed salvation that simply followed the directions given in the word of God. Those who will refine upon every thing, question the Divine testimony, and dispute with their Maker, cannot be saved. And how many of this stamp are found, even among <i>Christians</i>, professing <i>strict</i> godliness!</p>
<p><i><b>Gaza, which is desert.</b></i> — αυτη εστιν ερημος, <i>This it the desert</i>, or <i>this is in the desert</i>. Gaza was a town about two miles and a half from the sea-side; it was the last town which a traveller passed through, when he went from Phoenicia to Egypt, and was at the entrance into a wilderness, according to the account given by Arrian in Exped. Alex. lib. ii. cap. 26, p. 102. [Ed. Gronov.] <i>That it was the last inhabited town, as a man goes from</i> <i>Phoenicia to Egypt</i>, επι τη αρχη της ερημου, <i>on the commencement of</i> <i>the desert</i>. See Bp. <i>Pearce</i>.</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i> supposes that the word <i>desert</i> is added here, because at that time the ancient Gaza was actually <i>desert</i>, having been destroyed by Alexander, and μενουσα ερημος, <i>remaining desert</i>, as <i>Strabo</i>, lib. xvi. p. 1102, says; and that the angel mentioned this desert Gaza to distinguish it from another city of the <i>same</i> <i>name</i>, in the tribe of Ephraim, not far from the place where Philip now was. On this we may observe that, although Gaza was desolated by Alexander the Great, as were several other cities, yet it was afterwards rebuilt by <i>Gabinius</i>. See Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. lib. xv. cap. 5, sect. 3. And writers of the first century represent it as being flourishing and populous in their times. See <i>Wetstein</i>.</p>
<p><i>Schoettgen</i> thinks that ερημος, <i>desert</i>, should be referred, not to <i>Gaza</i>, but to οδος, the <i>way</i>; and that it signifies a road that was <i>less frequented</i>. If there were two roads to Gaza from Jerusalem, as some have imagined, (see <i>Rosenmuller</i>,) the eunuch might have chosen that which was desert, or less frequented, for the sake of privacy in his journeying religious exercises.</p>
