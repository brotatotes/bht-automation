<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:27">Acts 8:27</span>. <i><b>A man of Ethiopia</b></i> — ανηραιθιοψ should be translated <i>an</i> <i>Ethiopian</i>, for the reasons given on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>An eunuch</b></i> — See this word interpreted, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:12">Matthew 19:12</span>. The term eunuch was given to persons in authority at court, to whom its <i>literal</i> meaning did not apply. Potiphar was probably an eunuch only as to his <i>office</i>; for he was a <i>married</i> man. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+37:36">Acts 37:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+39:1">Acts 39:1</span>. And it is likely that this Ethiopian was of the same sort.</p>
<p><i><b>Of great authority</b></i> — δυναστης, <i>A perfect lord chamberlain</i> of the royal household; or, rather, her <i>treasurer</i>, for it is here said, <i>he had charge of all her treasure</i>, ην επι πασης της γαζης αυτης. The apparent Greek word γαζα, <i>Gaza</i>, is generally allowed to be <i>Persian</i>, from the authority of <i>Servius</i>, who, in his comment on AEn. lib. i. ver. 118:- </p>
<p>But who was Candace? It is granted that she is not found in the common lists of Ethiopic sovereigns with which we have been favoured. But neither the <i>Abyssinians</i> nor the <i>Jews</i> admitted <i>women</i> in their <i>genealogies</i>. I shall not enter into this controversy, but shall content myself with quoting the words of Mr. Bruce. "It is known," says he, "from credible writers engaged in no controversy, that this <i>Candace</i> reigned upon the Nile in <i>Atbara</i>, near Egypt. Her capital also, was taken in the time of Augustus, a few years before the conversion of the slave by Philip; and we shall have occasion often to mention her successors and her kingdom, as existing in the reign of the <i>Abyssinian</i> kings, long after the Mohammedan conquest: they existed when I passed through <i>Atbara</i>, and do undoubtedly exist there to this day."-<i>Bruce's Travels</i>, vol. ii. p. 431.</p>
<p>It does not appear, as some have imagined, that the Abyssinians were converted to the Christian faith by this <i>eunuch</i>, nor by any of the <i>apostles</i>; as there is strong historic evidence that they continued <i>Jews</i> and <i>Pagans</i> for more than three hundred years after the Christian aera. Their conversion is with great probability attributed to <i>Frumentius</i>, sent to Abyssinia for that purpose by Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, about A.D. 330. See <i>Bruce</i> as above.</p>
<p>The Ethiopians mentioned here are those who inhabited the isle or peninsula of <i>Meroe</i>, above and southward of Egypt. It is the district which Mr. Bruce calls <i>Atbara</i>, and which he proves formerly bore the name of <i>Meroe</i>. This place, according to Diodorus Siculus, had its name from Meroe, daughter of Cambyses, king of Persia, who died there in the expedition which her father undertook against the Ethiopians. Strabo mentions a queen in this very district named <i>Candace</i>: his words are remarkable. Speaking of an insurrection of the Ethiopians against the Romans he says: Τουτων δ' ησαν και οἱ βασιλισσης στρατηγοι της Κανδακης, ἡ καθ' ἡμας ηρξε των Αιθιοπων, ανδρικη τις γυνη, πεπηρωενη τον οφθαλμον, "Among these were the officers of Queen CANDACE, who in our days reigned over the Ethiopians. She was a masculine woman, and blind of one eye." Though this could not have been the <i>Candace</i> mentioned in the text, it being a little before the Christian <i>aera</i>, yet it establishes the fact that a queen of this name did reign in this place; and we learn from others that it was a <i>common</i> name to the queens of Ethiopia. Pliny, giving an account of the report made by Nero's messengers, who were sent to examine this country, says, <i>AEdificia oppidi</i> (Meroes) <i>pauca: regnare faeminam CANDACEN; quod</i> <i>nomen multis jam annis ad reginas transiit</i>. Hist. Nat. lib. vi. cap. 29, ad fin. They reported that "the edifices of the city were few: that a woman reigned there of the name of <i>Candace</i>; which name had passed to their queens, <i>successively</i>, for many years." To one of those queens the eunuch in the text belonged; and the above is sufficient authority to prove that queens of this name reigned over this part of Ethiopia.</p>
<p><i><b>Had come to Jerusalem for to worship</b></i> — Which is a proof that he was a worshipper of the God of Israel; but how came he acquainted with the Jewish religion? Let us, for a little, examine this question. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+10:1">1 Kings 10:1</span>, c., we have the account of the visit paid to Solomon by the <i>queen of Sheba</i>, the person to whom our Lord refers, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:42">Matthew 12:42</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:31">Luke 11:31</span>. It has been long credited by the Abyssinians that this queen, who by some is called <i>Balkis</i>, by others <i>Maqueda</i>, was not only instructed by Solomon in the Jewish religion, but also established it in her own empire on her return that she had a son by Solomon named <i>Menilek</i>, who succeeded her in the kingdom; and, from that time till the present, they have preserved the Jewish religion. Mr. Bruce throws some light upon this subject: the substance of what he says is the following: "There can be no doubt of the expedition of the queen of Sheba; as Pagan, Moor, Arab, Abyssinian, and all the countries round, vouch for it, nearly in the terms of Scripture. Our Saviour calls her queen of the south; and she is called, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+10:1">1 Kings 10:1</span>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+9:1">2 Chronicles 9:1</span>, c., queen of <i>Sheba</i> or <i>Saba</i> for <i>Saba, Azab</i>, and <i>Azaba</i>, all signify the <i>south</i>: and she is said to have come from the <i>uttermost parts of</i> <i>the earth</i>. In our Saviour's time the boundaries of the known land, <i>southward</i>, were <i>Raptam</i> or <i>Prassum</i> which were the uttermost parts of the known earth, and were with great propriety so styled by our Lord. The gold, myrrh, cassia, and frankincense, which she brought with her, are all products of that country. The annals of the Abyssinians state that she was a pagan when she left <i>Saba</i> or <i>Azab</i>, to visit Solomon; and that she was there converted and had a son by Solomon, who succeeded her in the kingdom, as stated above. All the inhabitants of this country, whether Jews or Christians, believe this; and, farther, that the 45th Psalm <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:1">Psalms 45:1</span>, c. was a prophecy of her journey to Jerusalem that she was accompanied by a daughter of Hiram from Tyre; and that the latter part of the Psalm is a prophecy of her having a son by Solomon, and of his ruling over the Gentiles." Travels, vol. ii. page 395, c. All this being granted, and especially the Scripture fact of the queen of Sheba's visit, and the great probability, supported by uninterrupted tradition, that she established the Jewish religion in her dominions on her return, we may at once see that the eunuch in question was a descendant of those <i>Jews</i> or that he was a <i>proselyte</i> in his own country to the Jewish faith, and was now come up at the great feast to worship God at Jerusalem. Mr. Bruce may be right; but some think that <i>Saba</i>, in Arabia Felix, is meant: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:42">Matthew 12:42</span>.</p>
