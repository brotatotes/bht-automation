<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Then the Spirit said unto Philip</b></i> â€” This holy man having obeyed the first direction he received from God, and gone southward without knowing the reason why, it was requisite that he should now be informed of the object of his mission: the <i>Spirit</i> <i>said unto</i> him, <i>go near, and join thyself</i>, c. The angel who had given him the first direction had departed and the influence of the Holy Spirit now completed the information. It is likely that what the Spirit did in this case was by a strong impression on his mind, which left him no doubt of its being from God.</p>
