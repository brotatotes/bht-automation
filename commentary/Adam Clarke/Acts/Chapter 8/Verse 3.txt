<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>. <i><b>Saul made havoc of the Church</b></i> — The word ελυμαινετο, from λυμαινω, to <i>destroy, devastate, ravage</i>, signifies the act of <i>ferocious animals</i>, such as <i>bears, wolves</i>, and the like, in seeking and devouring their prey. This shows with what persevering rancour this man pursued the harmless Christians; and thus we see in him what bigotry and false zeal are capable of performing.</p>
<p><i><b>Entering into every house</b></i> — For, however it might be to others, a Christian man's house was not <i>his</i> castle.</p>
<p><i><b>Haling men and women</b></i> — Neither sparing age nor sex in the professors of Christianity. The word συρων signifies <i>dragging</i> them before the magistrates, or dragging them <i>to justice</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Committed</b></i><b> them </b><i><b>to prison.</b></i> — For, as the Romans alone had the power of life and death, the Sanhedrin, by whom Saul was employed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>, could do no more than arrest and imprison, in order to inflict any punishment short of death. It is true, St. Paul himself says that some of them were put to death, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>; but this was either done by <i>Roman</i> authority, or by what was called the <i>judgment of zeal</i>, i.e. when the mob took the execution of the laws into their own hands, and massacred those whom they pretended to be blasphemers of God: for these sanctified their murderous outrage under the specious name of <i>zeal for God's glory</i>, and quoted the ensample of Phineas as a precedent. Such persons as these formed a sect among the Jews; and are known in ecclesiastical history by the appellation of <i>Zealots</i> or <i>Sicarii</i>.</p>
