<p>Verse 31. <i><b>How can I, except some man should guide me?</b></i> — This is <i>no proof</i> that "the Scriptures cannot be understood without an authorized interpreter," as some of the papistical writers assert. How could the eunuch know any thing of the Gospel dispensation, to which this scripture referred? That dispensation had not yet been proclaimed to him; he knew nothing about <i>Jesus</i>. But where that dispensation has been published, where the four Gospels and the apostolic epistles are at hand, every thing relative to the salvation of the soul may be clearly apprehended by any simple, upright person. There are difficulties, it is true, in different parts of the sacred writings, which neither the <i>pope</i> nor his <i>conclave</i> can solve; and several which even the <i>more</i> enlightened <i>Protestant</i> cannot remove; but these difficulties do not refer to matters in which the <i>salvation of the soul</i> is immediately concerned: they refer to such as are common to every ancient author in the universe. These difficulties, being understood, add to the beauty, elegance, and justness of the language, thoughts, and turns of expression; and these, only the <i>few</i> who are capable of <i>understanding</i> are able to <i>relish</i>. As to all the rest, all that relates to <i>faith</i> and <i>practice</i>, all in which the present and eternal interest of the soul is concerned, "the wayfaring man, though a fool, (quite illiterate,) shall not err therein."</p>
<p><i><b>That he would come up, and sit with him.</b></i> — So earnestly desirous was he to receive instruction relative to those things which concerned the welfare of his soul.</p>
