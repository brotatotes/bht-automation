<p>Verse 33. <i><b>In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away</b></i> — He who was the <i>fountain of judgment</i> and <i>justice</i> had no justice shown him (<i>mercy</i> he needed not) in <i>his humiliation</i>; viz. that time in which he <i>emptied himself</i>, and appeared in the form of a servant.</p>
<p><i><b>Who shall declare his generation</b></i> — την γενεαν αυτου: Answering to the Hebrew דורו <i>doro</i>, which Bp. Lowth understands as implying <i>his</i> <i>manner of life</i>. It was the custom among the Jews, when they were taking away any criminal from <i>judgment</i> to <i>execution</i>, to call out and inquire whether there was any person who could appear in behalf of the character of the criminal-whether there was any who, from intimate acquaintance with his <i>manner of life</i>, could say any thing in his favour? This circumstance I have noticed before, and it has been particularly remarked in the case of Stephen: see at <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>. In our Lord's case, this benevolent inquiry does not appear to have been made; and perhaps to this breach of <i>justice</i>, as well as of <i>custom</i>, the prophet refers; and this shows how minutely the conduct of those bad men was known seven hundred years before it took place. God can <i>foreknow</i> what he pleases, and can <i>do</i> what he pleases; and all the operations of his infinite mind are just and right. Some think that, <i>who shall declare his</i> <i>generation</i>? refers to his <i>eternal Sonship</i>; others, to his <i>miraculous conception</i> by the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, in the womb of the <i>virgin</i>; others, to the <i>multitudinous progeny</i> of <i>spiritual</i> <i>children</i> which should be born unto God, in consequence of his passion and meritorious death. Perhaps the <i>first</i>, which refers to the usual custom in behalf of the criminal, is the <i>best</i> and most natural sense.</p>
