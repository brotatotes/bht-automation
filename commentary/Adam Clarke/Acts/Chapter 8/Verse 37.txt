<p>Verse 37. <i><b>I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</b></i> â€” He believed that Jesus, whom Philip preached to him, was THE CHRIST or <i>Messiah</i>, and consequently the <i>Son of God</i>.</p>
<p>This whole verse is omitted by ABCG, several others of the first authority, Erpen's edit. of the <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Coptic,</i> <i>Sahidic, AEthiopic</i>, and some of the <i>Slavonic</i>: almost all the critics declare against it as spurious. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text; and Professor <i>White</i> in his <i>Crisews</i> says, "Hic versus <i>certissime</i> delendus," <i>this verse, most assuredly, should be</i> <i>blotted out</i>. It is found in E, several others of minor importance, and in the <i>Vulgate</i> and <i>Arabic</i>. In those MSS. where it is extant it exists in a variety of forms, though the sense is the same.</p>
