<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:40">Acts 8:40</span>. <i><b>Philip was found at Azotus</b></i> — Prom the time he left the eunuch, he was not heard of till he got to Azotus, which, according to Dr. Lightfoot, was about 34 miles from Gaza, and probably it was near Gaze that Philip met the eunuch. The Azotus of the New Testament is the Ashdod of the old. It was given by Joshua to the tribe of Judah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:47">Joshua 15:47</span>. It was one of the five lordships which belonged to the Philistines, and is a seaport town on the Mediterranean Sea, between Gaza on the <i>south</i>, and Joppa or Jaffa on the <i>north</i>. Herodotus reports, lib. ii. cap. 157, that Psammeticus, king of Egypt, besieged this city 29 years, which, if true, is the longest siege which any city or fortress ever endured.</p>
<p><i><b>Preached in all the cities, till he cams to Caesarea.</b></i> — This was <i>Caesarea</i> in <i>Palestine</i>, formerly called <i>Strato's Tower</i>, built by Herod the Great in honour of Augustus. There was an excellent harbour here made by Herod; and, after the destruction of Jerusalem, it became the <i>capital</i> of the whole land of Judea. It must be always distinguished from <i>Caesarea Philippi</i>, which was an inland town not far from the springs of Jordan. Whenever the word <i>Caesarea</i> occurs without <i>Philippi</i>, the former is intended. As Philip preached in all the cities of Palestine till he came to Caesarea, he must have preached in the different cities of the <i>Philistine</i> country, <i>Ashdod, Akkaron</i>, and <i>Jamnia</i>, and also in the principal parts of <i>Samaria</i>, as these lay in his way from <i>Gaza</i> to Caesarea. As there was a readier disposition to receive the word in those places, the Spirit of the Lord, under whose guidance he acted, did not suffer him to accompany the eunuch to <i>Abyssinia</i>. It appears, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:8">Acts 21:8</span>, that Philip settled at Caesarea, where he had a house and family, four of his unmarried daughters being prophetesses. It is likely that his itinerant mission ended here; though he continued occasionally to perform the work of an <i>evangelist</i>, and to bring up his family in the knowledge and fear of God, which is the most imperious duty that any master of a family can be called on to perform, and which it is impossible for any man to accomplish by substitute; and which none can neglect without endangering his own salvation.</p>
