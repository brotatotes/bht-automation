<p><i><b>The city of Samaria</b></i> — At this time there was no city of Samaria existing: according to Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. lib. xiii. cap. 10, sect. 3, Hyrcanus had so utterly demolished it as to leave no vestige of it remaining. Herod the Great did afterwards build a city on the same spot of ground; but he called it σεβαστη i.e. <i>Augusta</i>, in compliment to the Emperor Augustus, as Josephus tells us, <i>Ant</i>. lib. xv. cap. 8, sect. 5; <i>War</i>, lib. i. cap. 2. sect. 7; and by this name of <i>Sebasté</i>, or <i>Augusta</i>, that city, if meant here, would in all probability have been called, in the same manner as the town called <i>Strato's Tower</i>, (which Herod built on the sea coasts, and to which he gave the name of <i>Caesarea</i>, in compliment to Augustus Caesar,) is always called <i>Caesarea</i>, wherever it is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles.

<p>As Sychem was the very heart and seat of the Samaritan religion, and Mount Gerizim the cathedral church of that sect, it is more likely that <i>it</i> should be intended than any other. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. As the Samaritans received the same law with the Jews, as they also expected the Messiah, as Christ had preached to and converted many of that people, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:39-42">John 4:39-42</span>, it was very reasonable that the earliest offers of salvation should be made to <i>them</i>, before any attempt was made to evangelize the <i>Gentiles</i>. The Samaritans, indeed, formed the connecting link between the <i>Jews</i> and the <i>Gentiles</i>; for they were a mongrel people, made up of both sorts, and holding both Jewish and Pagan rites. See the account of them on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span>.</p>
