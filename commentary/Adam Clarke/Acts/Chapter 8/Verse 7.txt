<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:7">Acts 8:7</span>. <i><b>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out</b></i><b> </b><i><b>of many that were possessed</b></i> â€” Hence it is evident that these <i>unclean spirits</i> were not a species of diseases; as they are here distinguished from the <i>paralytic</i> and the <i>lame</i>. There is nothing more certain than that the New Testament writers mean real diabolic possessions by the terms <i>unclean spirits, devils</i>, &amp;c., which they use. It is absolute trifling to deny it. If we, in our superior sagacity can show that they were mistaken, that is quite a different matter!</p>
