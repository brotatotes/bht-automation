<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>. <i><b>A certain man called Simon</b></i> — In ancient ecclesiastical writers, we have the strangest account of this man; they say that he pretended to be the <i>Father</i>, who gave the law to Moses; that he came in the reign of Tiberius in the person of the <i>Son</i>; that he descended on the apostles on the day of pentecost, in flames of fire, in quality of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>; that he was the <i>Messiah</i>, the <i>Paraclete</i>, and <i>Jupiter</i>; that the <i>woman</i> who accompanied him, called <i>Helena</i>, was <i>Minerva</i>, or the <i>first intelligence</i>; with many other extravagancies which probably never had an existence. All that we know to be certain on this subject is, that he <i>used</i> <i>sorcery</i>, that he <i>bewitched the people</i>, and that he <i>gave out</i> <i>himself to be some great one</i>.</p>
<p>This might be sufficient, were not men prone to be wise <i>above</i> what is written.</p>
<p>Our word <i>sorcerer</i>, from the French <i>sorcier</i>, which, from the Latin <i>sors</i>, a <i>lot</i>, signifies the using of <i>lots</i> to draw presages concerning the future; a custom that prevailed in all countries, and was practised with a great variety of forms. On the word <i>lot</i> <i>see Clarke's note, "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:8">Leviticus 16:8</span>; <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:9">Leviticus 16:9</span><i>"</i>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+14:2">Joshua 14:2</span>.</p>
<p>The Greek word, μαγευων, signifies practising the <i>rites</i> or <i>science</i> of the <i>Magi</i>, or [Persic] <i>Mughan</i>, the worshippers of fire among the Persians; the same as [Arabic] <i>Majoos</i>, and [Arabic] <i>Majooseean</i>, from which we have our word <i>magician</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And bewitched the people of Samaria</b></i> — εξιστων, <i>Astonishing,</i> <i>amazing</i>, or <i>confounding</i> the judgment of the people, from εξιστημι to <i>remove out of a place</i> or <i>state</i>, to be <i>transported beyond one's</i> <i>self, to be out of one's wits</i>; a word that expresses precisely the same effect which the tricks or <i>legerdemain</i> of a juggler produce in the minds of the common people who behold his feats. It is very likely that Simon was a man of this cast, for the east has always abounded in persons of this sort. The Persian, Arabian, Hindoo, and Chinese jugglers are notorious to the present day; and even while I write this, (July, 1813,) three <i>Indian</i> jugglers, lately arrived, are <i>astonishing the people of London</i>; and if such persons can <i>now</i> interest and amaze the people of a city so cultivated and enlightened, what might not such do among the grosser people of Sychem or Sebaste, eighteen hundred years ago?</p>
<p><i><b>That himself was some great one.</b></i> — That the feats which he performed sufficiently proved that he possessed a most powerful supernatural agency, and could do whatsoever he pleased.</p>
