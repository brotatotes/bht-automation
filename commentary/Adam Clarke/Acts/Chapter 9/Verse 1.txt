<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:1">Acts 9:1</span>. <i><b>Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter</b></i> — The original text is very emphatic, ετι εμπνεων απειλης και φονου, and points out how determinate Saul was to pursue and accomplish his fell purpose of totally destroying the infant Church of Christ. The mode of speech introduced above is very frequent in the Greek writers, who often express any <i>vehement</i> and <i>hostile</i> affection of the mind by the verb πνεειν, to <i>breathe</i>, to <i>pant</i>; so Theocritus, Idyll. xxii. ver. 82:</p>
<p>And <i>Aristophanes</i> more fully, referring to all the preparations for war:- </p>
<p><i><b>Went unto the high priest</b></i> — As the high priest was chief in all matters of an ecclesiastical nature, and the present business was pretendedly <i>religious</i>, he was the proper person to apply to for letters by which this virulent persecutor might be accredited. The letters must necessarily be granted in the name of the whole <i>Sanhedrin</i>, of which <i>Gamaliel</i>, Saul's master, was at that time the <i>head</i>; but the <i>high priest</i> was the proper organ through whom this business might be negotiated.</p>
