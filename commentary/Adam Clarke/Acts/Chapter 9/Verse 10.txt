<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:10">Acts 9:10</span>. <i><b>A certain disciple - named Ananias</b></i> — A general opinion has prevailed in the Greek Church that this Ananias was one of the seventy-two disciples, and that he was martyred; and they celebrate his martyrdom on the first of October. It has been farther stated that his house was turned into a church, which remains to the present day, though now occupied as a Turkish mosque; but even the Mohammedans have the tradition, and treat his memory with great respect. However this may be, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:12">Acts 22:12</span>, we learn, what is of more importance, that <i>he was a devout man</i> <i>according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews that</i> <i>dwelt</i> there. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>To him said the Lord in a vision</b></i> — εν οραματι, In a strong impression made upon his mind, which left no doubt concerning its <i>heavenly</i> origin, nor of the <i>truth</i> of the things represented by it. It is very probable that the whole took place in a <i>dream</i>.</p>
