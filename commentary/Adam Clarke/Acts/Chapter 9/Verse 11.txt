<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11">Acts 9:11</span>. <i><b>Arise, and go into the street which is called</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Straight</b></i> — How very particular is this direction! And it was necessary that it should be so, that he might see the whole to be a Divine communication; the house was probably one in which Saul was accustomed to reside when at Damascus; and where he was known as a native of Tarsus.</p>
<p>Tarsus was a city of Cilicia, seated on the <i>Cydnus</i>, and now called <i>Tarasso</i>. It was, at one period, the capital of all Cilicia, and became a rival to Alexandria and Athens in the arts and sciences. The inhabitants, in the time of Julius Caesar, having shown themselves friendly to the Romans, were endowed with all the privileges of Roman citizens; and it was on this account that St. Paul claimed the rights of a Roman citizen; a circumstance which, on different occasions, was to him, and the cause in which he was engaged, of considerable service.</p>
<p><i><b>Behold, he prayeth</b></i> — He is earnestly seeking to know my will, and to find the salvation of his soul; therefore, go <i>speedily</i>, and direct him. Some have laid needless stress on these words, as if they intimated, that "though Saul as a Pharisee had often <i>said</i> his prayers, yet he had never <i>prayed</i> them till now." This is not correct: he could himself testify that, while he was a Pharisee, <i>he had lived in all good conscience towards God</i>; and consequently, in that time, made many <i>faithful</i> and <i>fervent</i> prayers; but he was praying now for instruction, and his prayers were speedily answered.</p>
