<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13">Acts 9:13</span>. <i><b>Lord, I have heard by many of this man</b></i> — This was all done in a <i>dream</i>, else this sort of reasoning with his Maker would have been intolerable in Ananias. Saul had been a <i>notorious</i> persecutor; <i>many</i> could testify of his outrageous acts against the poor followers of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Thy saints</b></i> — That is, the <i>Christians</i>, or followers of Christ. αγιοι signifies not only <i>holy persons</i>, but also <i>consecrated</i> persons; from α, <i>negative</i>, and γη, the <i>earth</i>; persons who are <i>separated</i> from all <i>earthly</i> uses, and <i>consecrated</i> to the service of God alone.</p>
