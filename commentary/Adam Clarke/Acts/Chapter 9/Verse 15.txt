<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>. <i><b>Go thy way</b></i> — He was thus prevented from going farther in his reasoning on this subject.</p>
<p><i><b>He is a chosen vessel unto me</b></i> — The word σκευος in Greek, and כלי <i>keley</i> in Hebrew, though they literally signify a <i>vessel</i>, yet they are both used to signify any kind of <i>instrument</i>, or the <i>means</i> by which an act is done. In the Tract. <i>Sohar Exod</i>. fol. 87, on these words of Boaz to Ruth, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ru+2:9">Ruth 2:9</span>, <i>When thou art athirst, go unto the vessels and drink</i>, c., there are these remarkable words ." כלי <i>keley, vessels</i> that is, the <i>righteous</i>, who are called the <i>vessels</i> or <i>instruments</i> of Jehovah; for it is decreed that the whole world shall bring gifts to the King Messiah; and these are the vessels of the Lord: vessels, I say, which the holy and blessed God uses, although they be <i>brittle</i>; but they are brittle only in this world, that they may establish the law and the worship with which the holy and blessed God is worshipped in this world; neither can this ministry be exercised but by <i>vessels</i> or <i>instruments</i>."</p>
<p>This mode of speech was common also among the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> writers. So POLYBIUS, speaking of <i>Damocles, Excerpta</i>, vol. iii. lib. 13, [Edit. Ernesti,] says, Ην ὑπηρετικον σκευος, και πολλας εχων εφορμας εις πραγματων οικονομιαν. "He was a useful <i>instrument</i>, and fit for the management of affairs." We find Paul, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>, using the same word, σκευος, for the <i>body</i>, agreeable to the expression of <i>Lucretius</i>, iii. 441, <i>Corpus, quod VAS quasi constitit ejus</i>. "The BODY, which is the VESSEL or instrument of the soul." See Bp. <i>Pearce</i> on this passage.</p>
<p><i>Chosen vessel</i>. - σκευος εκλογης is properly a <i>Hebraism</i>, for an <i>excellent</i> or <i>well-adapted instrument</i>. Every reader of the Bible must have noticed how often the word <i>chosen</i> is used there to signify <i>excelling</i> or <i>eminent</i>: so we use the word <i>choice</i>, "<i>choice</i> men," eminent persons; "<i>choice</i> things," excellent articles. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+22:7">Jeremiah 22:7</span>: <i>They shall cut down the choice cedars</i>, וכרתו מבחר ארזיך vecaretu <i>MIBCHAR arazeyca</i>; και εκκοψουσι τας εκλεκτας κεδρους σου, SEPT. <i>They shall cut the most EXCELLENT of thy cedars</i>; or thy cedar trees, which are the most <i>excellent</i> of their kind, they will cut down. Whoever considers the character of St. Paul, his education, attainments in natural knowledge, the distinguished part he took-first against Christianity, and afterwards, on the fullest conviction, the part he took in its favour-will at once perceive how well he was every way qualified for the great work to which God had called him.</p>
<p><i><b>To bear my name before the Gentiles</b></i> — To carry the ensign of the cross among the Greeks and Romans; and, by the demonstration of the Spirit, to confound their wisdom and learning, and prove that neither salvation nor happiness could be found in any other. Hence he was emphatically called, <i>the apostle of the Gentiles</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:7">1 Timothy 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:11">2 Timothy 1:11</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7-8">Galatians 2:7-8</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>.</p>
