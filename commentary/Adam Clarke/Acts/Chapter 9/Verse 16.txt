<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:16">Acts 9:16</span>. <i><b>How great things he must suffer</b></i> â€” Instead of proceeding as a persecutor, and inflicting sufferings on <i>others</i>, I will show him how many things he <i>himself</i> must suffer for preaching that very doctrine which he has been hitherto employed in persecuting. Strange change indeed! And with great show of reason, as with incontrovertible strength of argument, has a noble writer, Lord <i>Lyttleton</i>, adduced the conversion of Saul of Tarsus, and his subsequent conduct, as an irrefragable proof of the truth of Christianity.</p>
<p>Some think that the words, <i>I will show him</i>, c., refer to a visionary representation, which Christ was immediately to give Saul, of the trials and difficulties which he should have to encounter as also of that <i>death</i> by which he should seal his testimony to the truth. If so, what a most thorough conviction must Saul have had of the truth of Christianity, cheerfully and deliberately to give up all worldly honours and profits, and go forward in a work which he knew a <i>violent death</i> was to terminate!</p>
