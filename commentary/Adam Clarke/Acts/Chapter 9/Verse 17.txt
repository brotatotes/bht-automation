<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>. <i><b>Brother Saul</b></i> — As he found that the <i>Head</i> of the Church had adopted Saul into the heavenly family, he made no scruple to give him the right hand of fellowship, and therefore said, <i>Brother</i> <i>Saul</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord</b></i><b>, even </b><i><b>Jesus</b></i> — Of what use is this intrusive word <i>even</i> here? It injures the sense. St. Luke never wrote it; and our translators should not have inserted it. <i>The Lord Jesus</i>, the sovereign Jesus who appeared unto thee in the way, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. Christ could have cured him so miraculously by his own power, without human means, as he had enlightened his heart without them; but he will honour man by making him his <i>agent</i>, even in working miracles.</p>
<p><i><b>And be filled with the Holy Ghost.</b></i> — So it appears that the Holy Spirit was given to him at this time, and probably by the imposition of the hands of Ananias. To say that it would be degrading to an apostle to receive the Holy Ghost by means of one who was not an <i>apostle</i> is a very flimsy argument against the evidence which the text affords that Saul did receive this Spirit by the ministry of Ananias: besides, Saul was not an <i>apostle</i> at this time; he was not even a <i>Christian</i>; and the Holy Ghost, which he received now, was given more to make him a thorough <i>Christian</i> <i>convert</i> than to make him an <i>apostle</i>. No person will deny that he was <i>baptized</i> by Ananias; and certainly there was as strong an objection against an apostle receiving <i>baptism</i> from one who was not an apostle as there could be in receiving the Holy Spirit from such a person. It is very likely that Ananias was either one of the seventy disciples commissioned by Jesus Christ himself, or one of those who had been converted on the day of pentecost. If he were the former, any authority that man could have he had. But who was the <i>instrument</i> is a matter of little importance; as the <i>apostleship</i>, and the <i>grace</i> by which it was to be fulfilled, came immediately from Jesus Christ himself. Nor has there ever been an apostle, nor a legitimate successor of an apostle, that was not made such by Christ himself. If we consider the <i>authority</i> as coming by <i>man</i>, or through <i>any description</i> of <i>men</i>, we should be arrested and confounded by the difficult question, Who baptized the apostles? Jesus Christ baptized no man, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:2">John 4:2</span>. Who then baptized Peter! Can the Roman conclave answer this question? I trow not. It would be as difficult to answer it as to prove Peter's supremacy. We have no evidence who baptized the apostles, who themselves baptized so many others. The truth is, none but Christ ever made an apostle; and none but himself can make and qualify a Christian minister.</p>
