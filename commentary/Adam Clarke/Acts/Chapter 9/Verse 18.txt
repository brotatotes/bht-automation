<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:18">Acts 9:18</span>. <i><b>There fell from his eyes as it had been scales</b></i> — This was real: he had been so dazzled with the brightness of the light that we may suppose the globe of the eye, and particularly the <i>cornea</i>, had suffered considerable injury. The structure of the <i>cornea</i> was doubtless much disturbed, and the whole of that humour would be rendered <i>opaque</i>, and incapable of permitting the rays of light to pass through the different humours to the <i>retina</i>, where all the images of things transmitted through the lenses, or humours, are distinctly painted. In the miraculous cure the membrane was restored to its primitive state, and the opaque matter separated from the <i>cornea</i>, in the form of thin <i>laminae</i> or <i>scales</i>. This being done, the light would have as free a passage as formerly, and the result would be <i>distinct vision</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And arose, and was baptized.</b></i> — That he was baptized by Ananias there is every reason to believe; as he appears to have been the chief Christian at Damascus. As baptism implied, in an adult, the public profession of that faith into which he was baptized, this baptism of Saul proved, at once, his own sincerity, and the deep and thorough conviction he had of the truth of Christianity.</p>
