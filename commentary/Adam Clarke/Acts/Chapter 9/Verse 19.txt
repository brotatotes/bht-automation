<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:19">Acts 9:19</span>. <i><b>When he had received meat, he was strengthened</b></i> — His <i>mind</i> must have been greatly worn down under his three days' conviction of sin, and the awful uncertainty he was in concerning his state; but when he was baptized, and had received the Holy Ghost, his <i>soul</i> was Divinely invigorated; and now, by taking food, his <i>bodily</i> strength, greatly exhausted by three days' fasting, was renewed also. The <i>body</i> is not supported by the <i>bread of life</i>, nor the <i>soul</i> by the <i>bread that perisheth</i>: each must have its proper aliment, that the whole man may be invigorated, and be enabled to perform all the functions of the animal and spiritual life with propriety and effect.</p>
<p><i><b>Then was Saul certain days with the disciples</b></i> — Doubtless under <i>instructions</i>, relative to the doctrines of Christianity; which he must learn <i>particularly</i>, in order to preach them successfully. His miraculous conversion did not imply that he must then have a consummate knowledge of every Christian doctrine. To this day we find that even the genuine Christian convert has a thousand things to learn; and for his instruction he is placed in the Church of Christ, where he is built up on his most holy faith by the ministry and experience of the disciples. Without the communion of saints, who is likely to make a steady and consistent Christian; even though his conversion should have been the most sincere and the most remarkable?</p>
