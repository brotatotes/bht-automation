<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span>. <i><b>Letters to Damascus to the synagogues</b></i> — Damascus, anciently called דמסק <i>Damask</i>, and דרמסק <i>Darmask</i>, was once the metropolis of all Syria. It was situated at fifty miles' distance from the sea; from which it is separated by lofty mountains. It is washed by two rivers, <i>Amara</i> or <i>Abara</i>, which ran through it, and <i>Pharpar</i>, called by the Greeks <i>Chrysorrhoas</i>, the golden stream, which ran on the outside of its walls. It is one of the most ancient cities in the world, for it existed in the time of Abraham, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:15">Genesis 14:15</span>; and how long <i>before</i> is not known. The city of Damascus is at present a place of considerable trade, owing to its being the rendezvous for all the pilgrims from the north of Asia, on their road to and from the temple of <i>Mecca</i>. It is surrounded with pretty strong walls, which have <i>nine</i> gates, and is between four and five miles in circumference. It contains about 100,000 inhabitants, some say more, the principal part of whom are <i>Arabs</i> and <i>Turks</i>, with whom live, in a state of considerable degradation, about 15,000 <i>Christians</i>. Damascus, like other places of importance, has passed through the hands of many <i>masters</i>. It was captured and ruined by <i>Tiglath Pileser</i>, who carried away its inhabitants to <i>Kin</i>, beyond the Euphrates, about 740 years before the Christian aera; and thus was fulfilled the prophecy of <i>Isaiah</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+17:1-3">Isaiah 17:1-3</span>, and that of <i>Amos</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+1:4">Amos 1:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+1:5">Amos 1:5</span>. It was also taken by <i>Sennacherib</i>, and by the <i>generals</i> of Alexander the Great. <i>Metellus</i> and <i>Laelius</i> seized it, during the war of <i>Pompey</i> with <i>Tigranes</i>; before Christ 65. It continued under the dominion of the <i>Romans</i> till the <i>Saracens</i> took possession of it, in A.D. 634. It was besieged and taken by <i>Teemour lenk</i>, A.D. 1400, who put all the inhabitants to the sword. The Egyptian <i>Mamelukes</i> repaired Damascus when they took possession of <i>Syria</i>; but the Turkish Emperor <i>Selim</i> having defeated them at the battle of Aleppo in 1516, Damascus was brought under the government of the <i>Turks</i>, and in their hands it still remains. In the time of St. Paul it was governed by Aretas, whose father, <i>Obodas</i>, had been governor of it under Augustus. Damascus is 112 miles south of Antioch; 130 N.N.E. of Jerusalem; and 270 S.S.W; of Diarbek. Longitude 37° east: latitude 33° 45' north. The fruit tree called the <i>Damascene</i>, vulgarly <i>Damazon</i>, and the flower called the <i>Damask</i> rose, were transplanted from Damascus to the gardens of Europe; and the <i>silks</i> and <i>linens</i>, known by the name of <i>Damasks</i>, were probably first manufactured by the inhabitants of this ancient city.</p>
<p><i><b>Any of this way</b></i> — That is, this <i>religion</i>, for so דרך <i>derec</i> in Hebrew, and οδος, <i>hodos</i>, in Hellenistic Greek, are often to be understood. דרך יהוה <i>derec Yehovah</i>, the way of the Lord, implies the <i>whole</i> of the <i>worship</i> due to him, and prescribed by himself: the <i>way</i> or <i>path</i> in which he wills men to <i>walk</i>, that they may get safely through life, and finally attain everlasting felicity. The Jewish writers designate the whole doctrine and practice of Christianity by a similar expression, דרך הנוצרים <i>derec</i> <i>hanotsarim</i>, the <i>way, doctrine</i>, or <i>sect</i> of the Christians.</p>
<p><i><b>Whether they were men or women</b></i> — Provided they were <i>Jews</i>; for no converts had as yet been made among the <i>Gentiles</i>; nor did the power of the high priest and Sanhedrin extend to any but those who belonged to the <i>synagogues</i>. <i>Pearce</i>.</p>
<p>In every country where there were Jews and synagogues, the power and authority of the Sanhedrin and high priest were acknowledged: just as papists in all countries acknowledge the authority of the pope. And as there can be but <i>one pope</i>, and <i>one conclave</i>, so there could be but <i>one high priest</i>, and <i>one Sanhedrin</i>; and this is the reason why the high priest and sanhedrin at Jerusalem had authority over all Jews, even in the <i>most distant countries</i>.</p>
