<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:20">Acts 9:20</span>. <i><b>Preached Christ in the synagogues</b></i> — Instead of χριστον, <i>Christ</i>, ιησουν, <i>Jesus</i>, is the reading of ABCE, several others of high importance, together with the <i>Syriac, Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Slavonic</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>.</p>
<p>The great question to be determined, for the conviction of the Jews, was that JESUS was the Son of God. That the <i>Christ</i>, or <i>Messiah</i>, was to be the <i>Son of God</i>, they all believed. Saul was now convinced that Jesus, whom they had crucified, and who had appeared to him on the way, was the <i>Son of God</i>, or <i>Messiah</i>; and therefore as such he proclaimed him. The word <i>Christ</i> should be changed for <i>Jesus</i>, as the latter is, without doubt, the genuine reading.</p>
<p>The first offers of the grace of the Gospel were uniformly made to the Jews. Saul did not at first offer Jesus to the <i>heathens</i> at Damascus; but to the <i>synagogues</i> of the Jews.</p>
