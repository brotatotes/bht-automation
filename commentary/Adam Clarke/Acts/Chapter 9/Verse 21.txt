<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:21">Acts 9:21</span>. <i><b>Is not this he that destroyed them</b></i> — οπορθησας. The verb πορθειν has three acceptations in the Greek writers:</p>
<p>1. <i>To</i> <i>treat one as an enemy, to spoil him of his goods</i>.</p>
<p>2. <i>To lead away</i> <i>captive, to imprison</i>.</p>
<p>3. <i>To slay</i>.</p>
<p>Paul was properly πορθων, <i>a</i> <i>destroyer</i>, in all these senses.</p>
<p>1. He acted as the most determined <i>enemy</i> of the Christians: <i>Being exceedingly mad against them, he</i> <i>persecuted them to strange cities</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>.</p>
<p>2. He shut up many of the <i>saints in prison</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:14">Acts 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>.</p>
<p>3. He persecuted them unto <i>death</i>-gave his voice against them that they might be <i>destroyed</i>, and was a principal instrument in the <i>martyrdom</i> of Stephen. <i>He breathed threatenings and slaughter</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:1">Acts 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10-11">Acts 26:10-11</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore these <i>three</i> meanings of the original word are all exemplified in the conduct of Saul.</p>
