Verse Acts 9:21. Is not this he that destroyed them — οπορθησας. The verb πορθειν has three acceptations in the Greek writers:1. To treat one as an enemy, to spoil him of his goods.2. To lead away captive, to imprison.3. To slay.Paul was properly πορθων, a destroyer, in all these senses.1. He acted as the most determined enemy of the Christians: Being exceedingly mad against them, he persecuted them to strange cities, Acts 26:11.2. He shut up many of the saints in prison, Acts 8:3; Acts 9:14; Acts 26:10.3. He persecuted them unto death-gave his voice against them that they might be destroyed, and was a principal instrument in the martyrdom of Stephen. He breathed threatenings and slaughter. See Acts 7:58; Acts 8:1; Acts 9:1; Acts 26:10-11.Therefore these three meanings of the original word are all exemplified in the conduct of Saul.
