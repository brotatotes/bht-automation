<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:23">Acts 9:23</span>. <i><b>And after that many days were fulfilled</b></i> â€” What follows relates to transactions which took place about <i>three years</i> after his conversion, when he had come a second time to Damascus, after having been in Arabia. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17-18">Galatians 1:17-18</span>. What he did in Arabia we know not; he probably preached Christ in different Jewish synagogues; but with what fruit we are not told. St. Luke, who could not have been ignorant of this part of his history, passes it over in silence; and any assertion, at this distance of time, relative to his employment in Arabia for those three years, must be both foolish and impertinent.</p>
