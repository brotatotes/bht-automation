<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:24">Acts 9:24</span>. <i><b>They watched the gates day and night to kill him.</b></i> â€” At this time Damascus was under the government of Aretas, king of Arabia, who was now at war with Herod, his son-in-law, who had put away his daughter in order to marry Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. As Herod was supported by the <i>Romans</i>, Saul's enemies might intimate that he was in league with them or Herod; and, as the gates of the city were constantly watched and shut, that no spy might enter, and no fugitive get away, they thought it would be easy to apprehend him; and doubtless got orders for the different officers at the gates to be on the <i>look-out</i> that he might not be permitted to escape.</p>
