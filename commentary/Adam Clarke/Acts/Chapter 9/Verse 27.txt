It appears that he went up at this time to Jerusalem merely <i>to see</i> <i>Peter, with whom he abode fifteen days</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>. How it came that the apostles and Church at Jerusalem had not heard of Saul's conversion, which had taken place <i>three years</i> before, is not easy to be accounted for. The following considerations may help;</p>
<p>1. It is certain that intelligence did not travel speedily in those primitive times; there were few open roads, and no regular posts, except those between military stations.</p>
<p>2. Though there were many <i>Jews</i> in Damascus, and several <i>Christians</i>, yet the city was <i>heathen</i>, and under a heathen king, with whom the Jews at Jerusalem could have little commerce.</p>
<p>3. Though Herod had married the daughter of Aretas, yet, as he had put her away, there were great animosities between the two courts, which at last broke out into an open war; this must have prevented all social and commercial intercourse.</p>
<p>4. The Christians were at that time greatly persecuted by the Jews, and therefore the few that dwelt at Damascus could have little connection, if any, with their brethren at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>5. It might be the interest of the Jews at Jerusalem, supposing they had heard of it, to keep the fact of Saul's conversion as quiet as possible, that the Christian cause might not gain credit by it.</p>
<p>6. They might have heard of his conversion; but either did not fully credit what they had heard, or were not satisfied that the person who now presented himself was the man; for it is not likely that all the Christians at Jerusalem had been personally acquainted with Saul.</p>
