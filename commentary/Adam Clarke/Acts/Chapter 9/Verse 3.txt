<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:3">Acts 9:3</span>. <i><b>Suddenly there shined round about him</b></i> â€” This might have been an extraordinary flash of the <i>electric fluid</i>, accompanied with thunder, with which God chose to astonish and confound Saul and his company; but so modified it as to prevent it from striking them dead. <i>Thunder</i> would naturally follow such a large quantity of this fluid as appears to have been disengaged at this time; and <i>out</i> of this thunder, or immediately <i>after</i> it, Christ spoke in an awful and distinct voice, which appears to have been understood by Saul only.</p>
