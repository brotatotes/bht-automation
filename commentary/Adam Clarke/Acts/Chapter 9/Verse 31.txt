<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Then had the Churches rest</b></i> — Instead of ια εκκλησιαι, <i>the Churches</i>, ABC, several others, the <i>Syriac, Coptic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>, have ηεκκλησια, <i>the Church</i>. Every assembly of God's people was <i>a Church</i>; the aggregate of these assemblies was THE CHURCH. The word ειρηνην, which we translate <i>rest</i>, and which literally signifies <i>peace</i>, evidently means, in this place, <i>prosperity</i>; and in this sense both it and the Hebrew שלום <i>shalom</i> are repeatedly used. But what was the cause of this <i>rest</i> or <i>success</i>? Some say, the conversion of Saul, who before made havoc of the Church; but this is not likely, as <i>he</i> could not be a universal cause of persecution and distress, however active and virulent he might have been during the time of his enmity to the Christian Church. Besides his <i>own persecution</i>, related above, shows that the opposition to the Gospel continued with considerable virulence three years <i>after</i> his conversion; therefore it was not Saul's ceasing to be a persecutor that gave this rest to the Churches. Dr. Lardner, with a greater show of probability, maintains that this rest was owing to the following circumstance: Soon after Caligula's accession to the imperial dignity, the Jews at Alexandria suffered very much from the Egyptians in that city; and at length their oratories were all destroyed. In the third year of Caligula, A.D. 39, Petronius, who was made president of Syria in the place of Vitellius, was sent by the emperor to set up his statue in the temple at Jerusalem. This was a thunder-stroke to the Jews, and so occupied them that they had no time to think of any thing else; apprehending that their temple must be <i>defiled</i>, and the <i>national religion destroyed</i>, or themselves run the risk of being exterminated if they rebelled against the imperial decree.</p>
<p>The account given by Josephus will set this in a clear point of view. "Caligula sent Petronius to go with an army to Jerusalem, to set up his statues in the temple, enjoining him if the Jews opposed it, to put to death all that made resistance, and to make all the rest of the nation slaves. Petronius therefore marched from Antioch into Judea, with three legions, and a large body of auxiliaries raised in Syria. <i>All were hereupon filled with</i> <i>consternation</i>, the army being come as far as Ptolemais. The Jews, then, gathering together, went to the plain near Ptolemais, and entreated Petronius in the first place for their laws, in the next place for themselves. Petronius was moved with their solicitations, and, leaving his army and the statues, went into Galilee, and called an assembly of the heads of the Jews at Tiberias; and, having exhorted them without effect to submit to the emperor's orders, said, 'Will ye then fight against Caesar?' They answered that they offered up sacrifices twice every day for the emperor and the Roman people; but that if he would set up the images, he ought first of all to sacrifice the whole Jewish nation; and that they were ready to submit themselves, their wives and children, to the slaughter." Philo gives a similar account of this transaction. See <i>Lardner's Credibility</i>, Works, vol. i. p. 97, c.</p>
<p>It appears, therefore, that, as these transactions took place about the time mentioned in the text, their persecution from the Romans diverted them from persecuting the Christians and <i>THEN had</i> <i>the Churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee, and Samaria</i>; the terror occasioned by the imperial decree having spread itself through all those places.</p>
<p><i><b>Were edified</b></i> — οικοδομουμεναι, A metaphor taken from a building.</p>
<p>1. The ground is marked out;</p>
<p>2. the ichnograph, or dimensions of the building, ascertained;</p>
<p>3. the foundation is digged;</p>
<p>4. the foundation stone laid;</p>
<p>5. the walls builded up with <i>course</i> upon <i>course</i>;</p>
<p>6. the top-stone brought on;</p>
<p>7. the roof raised, and the whole covered in; and,</p>
<p>8. the interior part fitted up and adorned, and rendered convenient for the intended inhabitant.</p>
<p>This figure frequently occurs in the sacred writings, especially in the New Testament. It has its reason in the original creation of man: God made the first human being as a <i>shrine</i> or <i>temple</i>, in which himself might dwell. Sin entered, and the heavenly building was destroyed. The <i>materials</i>, however, though all dislocated, and covered with rubbish and every way defiled, yet exist; no essential power or faculty of the soul having been lost. The work of redemption consists in building up this house as it was in the beginning, and rendering it a proper <i>habitation for God</i>. The various powers, faculties, and passions, are all to be purified and refined by the power of the Holy Spirit, and <i>order</i> and <i>harmony</i> restored to the whole soul. All this is beautifully pointed out by St. Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4-5">1 Peter 2:4-5</span>: <i>To whom</i> (Jesus Christ) <i>coming as unto a LIVING STONE, chosen of</i> <i>God and precious, ye also, as LIVING STONES, are BUILT UP a</i> <i>spiritual HOUSE, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual</i> <i>sacrifices to God by Jesus Christ</i>. And St. Paul, who, from his own profession as a <i>tent-maker</i>, could best seize on the metaphor, and press it into this spiritual service, goes through the whole figure at large, in the following inimitable words: <i>Ye are the</i> <i>HOUSEHOLD of God, and are BUILT upon the FOUNDATION of the</i> <i>apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief</i> <i>CORNERSTONE, in whom all the BUILDING, FITLY FRAMED together,</i> <i>groweth unto a HOLY TEMPLE in the Lord: in whom ye also are</i> <i>BUILDED together for a HABITATION of God, through the Spirit</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19-22">Ephesians 2:19-22</span>. <i>Edification</i> signifies, therefore, an increase in the <i>light,</i> <i>life</i>, and <i>power</i> of <i>God</i>; being founded on the doctrine of Christ crucified; having the soul purified from all unrighteousness, and fitted, by <i>increasing holiness</i>, to be a permanent residence for the ever-blessed God.</p>
<p><i><b>Walking in the fear of the Lord</b></i> — Keeping a continually <i>tender</i> <i>conscience</i>; abhorring all sin; having respect to every Divine precept; <i>dreading</i> to offend him from whom the soul has derived its being and its blessings. Without this salutary <i>fear</i> of <i>God</i> there never can be any circumspect walking.</p>
<p><i><b>In the comfort of the Holy Ghost</b></i> — In a consciousness of their acceptance and union with God, through his Spirit, by which solid peace and happiness are brought into the soul; the truly religious man <i>knowing</i> and <i>feeling</i> that he is of God, by the Spirit which is given him: nothing less can be implied in the <i>comfort of the Holy</i> <i>Ghost</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Were multiplied.</b></i> — No wonder that the Church of God increased, when such <i>lights</i> as these shone among men. This is a short, but full and forcible description of the righteousness, purity, and happiness of the primitive Church.</p>
