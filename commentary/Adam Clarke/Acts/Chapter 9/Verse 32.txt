<p>Verse 32. <i><b>As Peter passed throughout all</b></i><b> quarters</b>] δια παντων, Bp. Pearce thinks, should be translated, not <i>through all quarters</i>, but <i>through all the saints</i>. The Churches having rest, the apostles made use of this interval of quiet to visit the different congregations, in order to build them up on their most holy faith. Of Saul we hear no more till <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>, which is supposed to be about <i>five years</i> after this time; <i>eight</i> in all from his conversion. Peter, it seems, had continued in Jerusalem all the time that the Churches were in a state of persecution throughout the whole land. Great as he was, he never evidenced that <i>steady</i> <i>determinate courage</i> by which St. Paul was so eminently distinguished; nor did he ever suffer half so much for God and his truth.</p>
<p><i><b>To the saints</b></i> — The <i>Jews</i>, who had been converted to <i>Christianity</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which dwelt at Lydda.</b></i> — A town in the tribe of Ephraim, almost on the border of Judea, and nigh unto <i>Joppa</i>: it was about ten leagues from Jerusalem, and was afterwards known by the name of <i>Diospolis</i>, or the <i>city of Jupiter</i>.</p>
