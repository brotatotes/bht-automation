<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Jesus Christ maketh thee whole</b></i> — Not <i>Peter</i>, for <i>he</i> had no power but what was given him from above. And, as an <i>instrument</i>, any man could heal with this power as well as Peter; but God chose to put honour upon those primitive preachers of his word, that men might see that they were commissioned from heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>Arise, and make thy bed.</b></i> — Give now full proof that <i>Jesus Christ</i> <i>HAS made thee whole</i>, by <i>arising</i>, and by <i>making</i> thy bed. He was at <i>home</i>, and therefore was not commanded, as the paralytic person, to <i>take up his bed</i>; but he was ordered to <i>make</i> it-strew it afresh, that all might see that the cure was perfect.</p>
