<p>Verse 35. <i><b>All that dwelt in Lydda and Saron saw him</b></i> â€” Saron was that <i>champaign country</i> that lay between Joppa and Lydda. The long <i>affliction</i> of this man had been well known; and his <i>cure</i>, consequently, became a subject of general examination: it was found to be real. It was known to have been performed by the grace and mercy of Christ; and the consequence of all this conviction was that all these people became <i>Christians</i>.</p>
