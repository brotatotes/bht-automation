<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Now there was at Joppa</b></i> — This was a sea-port town on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, about a day's journey from Jerusalem. It is supposed to be the same which is called in the Old Testament <i>Japho</i>, which belonged to the tribe of Dan, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:46">Joshua 19:46</span>. It is at present called <i>Jaffa</i>, and is still a place of considerable note.</p>
<p><i><b>A certain disciple named Tabitha</b></i> — This word is more properly <i>Syriac</i> than <i>Hebrew</i>. [Syriac] <i>tebitho</i> is the word in the Syriac version, and is their manner of writing the Hebrew צבי <i>tsebi</i>, the ט <i>teth</i> being changed for the צ <i>tsaddi</i>. The word [Syriac] <i>tabio</i>, and the feminine [Syriac] <i>tabitho</i>, have the same meaning as the Hebrew צבי <i>tsebi</i> and the Greek δορκας, <i>Dorcas</i>, and signify the <i>gazel</i> or <i>antelope</i>; and it is still customary in the east to give the names of beautiful animals to <i>young women</i>. The comparison of fine eyes to those of the antelope is continually occurring in the writings of the Arabic and Persian poets. The person in the tern probably had her name in the same way. She was very beautiful, and was therefore called <i>Tabitha</i> and <i>Dorcas</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>This woman was full of good works</b></i> — She spent her life in acts of kindness and charity. Her soul was <i>full</i> of love to God and man; and her whole time was <i>filled</i> up with works of piety and mercy.</p>
