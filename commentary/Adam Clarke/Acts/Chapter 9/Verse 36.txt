Verse 36. Now there was at Joppa — This was a sea-port town on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, about a day's journey from Jerusalem. It is supposed to be the same which is called in the Old Testament Japho, which belonged to the tribe of Dan, Joshua 19:46. It is at present called Jaffa, and is still a place of considerable note.A certain disciple named Tabitha — This word is more properly Syriac than Hebrew. [Syriac] tebitho is the word in the Syriac version, and is their manner of writing the Hebrew צבי tsebi, the ט teth being changed for the צ tsaddi. The word [Syriac] tabio, and the feminine [Syriac] tabitho, have the same meaning as the Hebrew צבי tsebi and the Greek δορκας, Dorcas, and signify the gazel or antelope; and it is still customary in the east to give the names of beautiful animals to young women. The comparison of fine eyes to those of the antelope is continually occurring in the writings of the Arabic and Persian poets. The person in the tern probably had her name in the same way. She was very beautiful, and was therefore called Tabitha and Dorcas.This woman was full of good works — She spent her life in acts of kindness and charity. Her soul was full of love to God and man; and her whole time was filled up with works of piety and mercy.
