Verse 37. She was sick, and died — Even her holiness and usefulness could not prevent her from sickness and death. Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return, is a decree that must be fulfilled, even on the saints; for the body is dead, sentenced to death, because of sin, though the spirit be life because of righteousness.Whom when they had washed — Having the fullest proof that she was dead, they prepared for her interment. In most nations of the world it was customary to wash their dead before they buried them, and before they laid them out to lie in state, as Homer tells us was the case with the body of Patroclus: -  Conjiciunt, c.  "Meanwhile, the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes, To dead Misenus pay his obsequies. First from the ground a lofty pile they rear Of pitch-trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir: The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew; The topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn: Warm waters then, in brazen cauldrons borne, Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint; And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint. With groans and cries Misenus they deplore. Then on a bier with purple cover'd o'er The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay." DRYDEN.

The primitive Christians washed the bodies of their dead not only out of decency and affectionate respect to them, but as a token of their firm belief in the resurrection of the dead.
