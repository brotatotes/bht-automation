<p>Verse 37. <i><b>She was sick, and died</b></i> — Even her holiness and usefulness could not prevent her from sickness and death. <i>Dust</i> <i>thou art, and to dust thou shalt return</i>, is a decree that must be fulfilled, even on the saints; <i>for the body is dead</i>, sentenced to death, <i>because of sin, though the spirit be life because of</i> <i>righteousness</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whom when they had washed</b></i> — Having the fullest proof that she was <i>dead</i>, they prepared for her interment. In most nations of the world it was customary to wash their dead before they buried them, and before they laid them out <i>to lie in state</i>, as <i>Homer</i> tells us was the case with the body of <i>Patroclus</i>: - </p>

<p>These <i>rites</i>, in many respects, resemble those still used among the native Irish. See the account of the funeral ceremonies of the Egyptians, in the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+50:2">Genesis 50:2</span>. The primitive Christians washed the bodies of their dead not only out of decency and affectionate respect to them, but as a token of their firm belief in the <i>resurrection of the dead</i>.</p>
