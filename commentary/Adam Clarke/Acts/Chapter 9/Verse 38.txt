<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Sent unto him - desiring - that he would not delay to</b></i> <i>come</i>] Tabitha died at Joppa, and Peter was at Lydda, about four leagues distant. But why did they send for Peter? We cannot tell. It is not likely that they had any expectation that he should raise her from the <i>dead</i>; for none of the apostles had as yet raised any; and if God did not choose to restore <i>Stephen</i> to life, this favour could not be reasonably expected in behalf of <i>inferior</i> persons. However, they might hope that he who cured Eneas at Lydda might cure Dorcas; for it is probable that they had sent for Peter <i>before</i> she died; and in this sense we might understand the απεστειλαν of the text.</p>
