Verse Acts 9:40. Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed — It was not even known to Peter that God would work this miracle: therefore he put all the people out, that he might seek the will of God by fervent prayer, and during his supplications be liable neither to distraction nor interruption, which he must have experienced had he permitted this company of weeping widows to remain in the chamber.And turning - to the body — σωμα, The lifeless body, for the spirit had already departed.Said, Tabitha, arose. — During his wrestling with God, he had, undoubtedly, received confidence that she would be raised at his word.And when she saw Peter, she sat up. — As Dorcas was a woman so eminently holy, her happy soul had doubtless gone to the paradise of God.

We walk here by faith, and not by sight.
