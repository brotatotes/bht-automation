<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:5">Acts 9:5</span>. <i><b>Who art thou, Lord?</b></i> — τις ει, κυριε; <i>Who art thou, SIR</i>? He had no knowledge who it was that addressed him, and would only use the term κυριε, as any Roman or Greek would, merely as a term of <i>civil respect</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest</b></i> — "Thy enmity is against <i>me</i> and my religion; and the injuries which thou dost to my followers I consider as done to <i>myself</i>."</p>
<p>The following words, making twenty in the original, and thirty in our version, are found in no Greek MS. The words are, It is <i>hard for thee to kick against the pricks: and he trembling and</i> <i>astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? and the Lord</i> said <i>unto him</i>. It is not very easy to account for such a large <i>addition</i>, which is not only not found in any <i>Greek</i> MS. yet discovered, but is wanting in the <i>Itala</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Syriac, Coptic, Sahidic</i>, and most of the <i>Slavonian</i>. It is found in the <i>Vulgate</i>, one of the <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>AEthiopic</i>, and <i>Armenian;</i> and was probably borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span>, and some marginal notes. It is wanting also in the <i>Complutensian</i> edition, and in that of <i>Bengel</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> also leaves it out of the text.</p>
<p><i><b>It is hard for thee</b></i>, c.] σκληρον σοι προς κεντρα λακτιζειν. This is a <i>proverbial</i> expression, which exists, not only in <i>substance</i>, but even in <i>so many words</i>, both in the Greek and Latin writers. κεντρον, <i>kentron</i>, signifies an ox goad, a piece of pointed iron stuck in the end of a stick, with which the ox is urged on when drawing the plough. The origin of the proverb seems to have been this: sometimes it happens that a restive or stubborn ox kicks back against the goad, and thus wounds himself more deeply: hence it has become a proverb to signify the fruitlessness and absurdity of rebelling against lawful authority, and the getting into greater difficulties by endeavouring to avoid trifling sufferings. So the proverb, <i>Incidit in Scyllam qui vult</i> <i>vitare Charybdim</i>. Out of the <i>cauldron</i> into the <i>fire</i>. "Out of <i>bad</i> into <i>worse</i>." The saying exists, almost in the apostolic form, in the following writers. EURIPIDES, in <i>Bacch</i>. ver. 793:- </p>
<p>PINDAR has a similar expression, <i>Pyth</i>. ii. ver. 171-5 :- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> But madly now I wound myself alone,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Dashing my injured foot against the stone:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> So to the wide arena, wild with pain,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The vanquish'd gladiator hastes again;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> So the poor shatter'd bark the tempest braves,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Launching once more into the swelling waves.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>Intelligent men, in all countries and in all ages of the world, have seen and acknowledged the folly and wickedness of fighting against God; of murmuring at the dispensations of his providence; of being impatient under affliction; and of opposing the purposes of his justice and mercy. The words contain a universal lesson, and teach us patience under affliction, and subjection to the sovereign will of God; and they especially show the desperate wickedness of endeavouring, by persecution, to hinder the dissemination of the truth of God in the earth. He that kicks against <i>this</i> goad does it at the risk of his final salvation. The fable of the <i>viper and the file</i> is another illustration of this proverb: it <i>gnawed</i> and <i>licked</i> the file, till it <i>destroyed</i> its <i>teeth</i> and <i>wasted</i> away its <i>tongue</i>. The maxim in the proverb should be early inculcated on the minds of children and scholars; when chastised for their faults, resistance and stubbornness produce increased coercion and chastisement. And let parents and masters learn that the oft-repeated use of the goad and ferula seldom tend to reclaim, but beget obduracy and desperation. The advice of <i>Columella</i> to the ploughman, having some relation to the proverb in the text, and a strong bearing on this latter part of the subject, is worthy of the most serious regard: "<i>Voce</i> potius quam <i>verberibus</i> terreat: <i>ultimaque</i> sint opus recusantibus <i>remedia</i> <i>plagae</i>. Nunquam <i>stimulo</i> lacessat <i>juvencum</i>, quod <i>retrectantem</i> <i>calcitrosumque</i> eum reddit: nonnunquam tamen admoneat flagello." COLUMELLA, <i>De Re Rustica</i>, lib. ii. cap. 2, in fine. "Let the husbandman intimidate his oxen more by his voice than by <i>blows</i>, to which he should never have recourse but in <i>extreme cases</i>. A <i>young</i> <i>steer</i> should never be <i>goaded</i>, for this will induce him to <i>kick</i> and <i>run back</i>; but on proper occasions the <i>whip</i>, as an incentive to activity, may be profitably used." In reference to the same subject, which all concerned should feel to be of the greatest importance I shall close with the advice of one greater than the Roman agriculturist: <i>Fathers, provoke not your children to anger,</i> <i>lest they be discouraged</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+3:21">Colossians 3:21</span>; but <i>bring them up</i> (εν παιδειᾳ και νουθεσιᾳ Κυριου) <i>in the discipline</i> <i>and admonition of the Lord</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4">Ephesians 6:4</span>, using the authority that God has given you with a steady hand, actuated by a tender and feeling heart.</p>
