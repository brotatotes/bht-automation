<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>. <i><b>Stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</b></i> — The men were εννεοι, <i>stupified</i>, hearing τηςφωνης, <i>the voice</i> or <i>thunder</i>, but not distinguishing the <i>words</i>, which were addressed to Saul alone; and which were spoken <i>out</i> of the thunder, or in a small, still voice, <i>after</i> the peal had ceased. The remarkable case, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:11-13">1 Kings 19:11-13</span>, may serve to illustrate that before us. <i>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord;</i> <i>and the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the</i> <i>mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lard; and</i> <i>after the wind an earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire; and</i> <i>after the fire a still small voice; and when Elijah heard it, he</i> <i>wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the</i> <i>entering in of the cave, and behold, there came a voice unto him,</i> <i>and said, WHAT DOST THOU HERE, ELIJAH</i>! The <i>thunder</i> must have been heard by all; the <i>small, still voice</i> by Saul alone. This consideration amply reconciles the passage in the text with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span>, where Paul says, They that were with me saw the light and were afraid, but they heard not the voice of him that spoke with one. They had heard the <i>thunder</i> which followed the escape of the lightning, but they heard not the <i>voice</i> of him that spake to Saul; they did not hear the words, <i>I am Jesus whom thou</i> <i>persecutest</i>, c. but they saw and heard enough to convince them that the whole was supernatural; for they were all struck down to the earth with the splendour of the light, and the sound of the thunder, which I suppose took place on this occasion. It has been a question among divines, whether Jesus Christ did <i>really appear</i> to Saul on this occasion. The arguments against the real appearance are not strong. St. Luke tells us that those who were with him heard the voice, but they saw no man; which is a strong intimation that <i>he</i> saw what they did not. Ananias, it seems, was informed that there had been a <i>real appearance</i>, for, in addressing Saul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>, he says, <i>The Lord Jesus that APPEARED unto THEE in the way as thou</i> <i>camest</i>, c. And Barnabas intimates thus much, when he brought him before the apostles at Jerusalem, for he <i>declared unto them</i> <i>how he had SEEN the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken unto</i> <i>him</i> and, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>, where the discourse of Ananias is given more at large, he says, <i>The God of our fathers hath chosen thee that</i> <i>thou shouldest know his will, and SEE that JUST ONE, and shouldest</i> <i>HEAR the voice of his mouth</i>; so we find that <i>hearing the voice</i>, or <i>words of his mouth</i>, was not what is called the <i>appearance</i>; for, besides this, there was an actual manifestation of the person of Christ. But St. Paul's own words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>, put the subject out of dispute: <i>Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? HAVE I NOT SEEN JESUS</i> <i>CHRIST OUR LORD</i>? To which may be added, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>, <i>And last of all, HE WAS SEEN OF ME ALSO, as of one born out of</i> <i>due time</i>.</p>
