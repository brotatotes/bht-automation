<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:8">Acts 9:8</span>. <i><b>When his eyes were opened, he saw no man</b></i> — Instead of ουδενα, <i>no man</i>, the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, the <i>Syriac, Vulgate</i>, and some others, have ουδεν <i>nothing</i>. He not only saw no <i>man</i>, but he saw nothing, being quite blind; and therefore was led by the hand to Damascus, μη βλεπων, being <i>without sight</i>.</p>
