<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:1">Colossians 1:1</span>. <i><b>Paul, an apostle - by the will of God</b></i> — As the word αποστολος, <i>apostle</i>, signifies <i>one sent</i>, an envoy or messenger, any person or persons may be the <i>senders</i>: but the word is particularly restrained to the messengers of the everlasting Gospel, sent immediately from God himself; and this is what St. Paul particularly remarks here when he calls himself an <i>apostle by</i> <i>the will of God</i>; signifying that he had derived his commission from an express volition or purpose of the Almighty.</p>
<p><i><b>And Timotheus</b></i> — Though Timothy is here joined in the salutation, yet he has never been understood as having any part in composing this epistle. He has been considered as the amanuensis or scribe of the apostle.</p>
