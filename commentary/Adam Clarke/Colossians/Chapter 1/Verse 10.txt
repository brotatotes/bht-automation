<p>Verse 10. <i><b>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord</b></i> — Suitably to your Christian profession, exemplifying its holy doctrines by a holy and useful life. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>; and on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto all pleasing</b></i> — Doing every thing in the best <i>manner</i>, in the most proper <i>time</i>, and in a becoming <i>spirit</i>. Even a good work may be marred and rendered fruitless by being done <i>improperly</i>, out of <i>season</i>, or in a <i>temper</i> of mind that grieves the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>Being fruitful in every good work</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>.</p>
<p>St. Paul exhorts the Christians at Colosse,</p>
<p>1. To <i>walk</i>-to be active in their Christian calling.</p>
<p>2. <i>To walk worthily</i>-suitably to the dignity of that calling, and to the purity of that God who had called them into this state of salvation.</p>
<p>3. To do every thing <i>unto all pleasing</i>; that God might be pleased with the <i>manner</i>, the <i>time</i>, the <i>motive, disposition, design</i>, and <i>object</i> of every act.</p>
<p>4. That they should be <i>fruitful</i>; mere <i>harmlessness</i> would not be sufficient; as God had sown good seed, he expected good fruit.</p>
<p>5. That <i>every work</i> should be <i>good</i>; they must not be fruitful in some works and fruitless in others.</p>
<p>6. That they should increase in religious knowledge as time rolled on, knowing, by genuine Christian <i>experience</i>, more of God, of his love, and of his peace, day by day.</p>
