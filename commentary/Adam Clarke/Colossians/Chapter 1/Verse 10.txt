Verse 10. That ye might walk worthy of the Lord — Suitably to your Christian profession, exemplifying its holy doctrines by a holy and useful life. Ephesians 4:1; and on "Philippians 1:27".Unto all pleasing — Doing every thing in the best manner, in the most proper time, and in a becoming spirit. Even a good work may be marred and rendered fruitless by being done improperly, out of season, or in a temper of mind that grieves the Holy Spirit.Being fruitful in every good work — Colossians 1:6.St. Paul exhorts the Christians at Colosse,1. To walk-to be active in their Christian calling.2. To walk worthily-suitably to the dignity of that calling, and to the purity of that God who had called them into this state of salvation.3. To do every thing unto all pleasing; that God might be pleased with the manner, the time, the motive, disposition, design, and object of every act.4. That they should be fruitful; mere harmlessness would not be sufficient; as God had sown good seed, he expected good fruit.5. That every work should be good; they must not be fruitful in some works and fruitless in others.6. That they should increase in religious knowledge as time rolled on, knowing, by genuine Christian experience, more of God, of his love, and of his peace, day by day.
