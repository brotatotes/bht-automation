<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Giving thanks unto the Father</b></i> — Knowing that ye have nothing but what ye have received from his mere mercy, and that in point of <i>merit</i> ye can never <i>claim</i> any thing from him.</p>
<p><i><b>Which hath made us meet</b></i> — ικανωσαντι. Who has <i>qualified</i> us to be partakers, c. Instead of ικανωσαντι, some MSS. and versions have καλεσαντι, <i>called</i> and B (the Codex Vaticanus) has both readings. <i>Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath called and</i> <i>qualified us to be partakers</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the inheritance</b></i> — εις την μεριδα του κληρου. A plain allusion to the division of the promised land by <i>lot</i> among the different families of the twelve Israelitish tribes. The κληρος was the <i>lot</i> or <i>inheritance</i> belonging to the <i>tribe</i>; the μερις was the <i>portion</i> in that <i>lot</i> which belonged to each <i>family</i> of that tribe. This was a type of the kingdom of God, in which <i>portions</i> of eternal blessedness are dispensed to the genuine Israelites; to them who have the circumcision of the heart by the Spirit, whose praise is of God, and not of man.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the saints in light</b></i> — <i>Light</i>, in the sacred writings, is used to express knowledge, <i>felicity</i>, purity, comfort, and joy of the most substantial kind; here it is put to point out the state of glory at the right hand of God. As in Egypt, while the judgments of God were upon the land, there was a <i>darkness</i> which might be felt yet all the Israelites had <i>light</i> in their dwellings; so in this world, while the <i>darkness</i> and wretchedness occasioned by sin remain, the disciples of Christ are light in the Lord, walk as children of the <i>light</i> and of the <i>day</i>, have in them no occasion of <i>stumbling</i>, and are on their way to the <i>ineffable light</i> at the right hand of God. Some think there is an allusion here to the <i>Eleusinian mysteries</i>, celebrated in deep caves and <i>darkness</i> in honour of Ceres; but I have already, in the notes to the Epistle to the Ephesians, expressed my doubts that the apostle has ever condescended to use such a simile. The phraseology of the text is frequent through various parts of the sacred writings, where it is most obvious that no such allusion could possibly be intended.</p>
