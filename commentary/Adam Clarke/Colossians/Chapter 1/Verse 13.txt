<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Delivered us from the power of darkness</b></i> — Darkness is here <i>personified</i>, and is represented as having εξουσια, <i>power,</i> <i>authority</i>, and <i>sway</i>; all Jews and Gentiles, which had not embraced the Gospel, being under this authority and power. And the apostle intimates here that nothing less than the power of God can redeem a man from this darkness, or prince of darkness, who, by means of sin and unbelief, keeps men in ignorance, vice, and misery.</p>
<p><i><b>Translated</b></i><b> us </b><i><b>into the kingdom</b></i><b>, c.</b>] He has thoroughly changed our state, brought us out of the dark region of vice and impiety, and placed us in the kingdom under the government of <i>his dear Son</i>, υιου της αγαπης αυτου, <i>the Son of his love</i> the person whom, in his infinite love, he has given to make an atonement for the sin of the world.</p>
