Verse 14. In whom we have redemption — Who has paid down the redemption price, even his own blood, that our sins might be cancelled, and we made fit to be partakers of the inheritance among the saints in light.The clause, δια του αιματος αυτου, Through his blood, is omitted by ABCDEFG, and by most others of weight and importance; by the Syriac, Arabic of Erpen, Coptic, AEthiopic, Sahidic, some copies of the Vulgate and by the Itala; and by most of the Greek fathers. Griesbach has left it out of the text. It is likely that the reading here is not genuine; yet that we have redemption any other way than through the sacrifice of Christ, the Scriptures declare not. The same phrase is used Ephesians 1:7, where there is no various reading in any of the MSS., versions, or fathers.The forgiveness of sins — αφεσιν των αμαρτιων. The taking away of sins; all the power, guilt, and infection of sin. All sin of every kind, with all its influence and consequences.
