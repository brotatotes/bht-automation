<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Who is the image of the invisible God</b></i> — The counterpart of God Almighty, and if the <i>image</i> of the <i>invisible</i> God, consequently nothing that <i>appeared</i> in him could be that <i>image</i>; for if it could be <i>visible</i> in the <i>Son</i>, it could also be <i>visible</i> in the <i>Father</i>; but if the Father be <i>invisible</i>, consequently his <i>image</i> in the Son must be <i>invisible</i> also. This is that <i>form of God</i> of which he divested himself; the ineffable glory in which he not only did not appear, as to its <i>splendour</i> and <i>accompaniments</i>, but concealed also its essential nature; that inaccessible light which no man, no created being, can possibly see. This was that Divine nature, the <i>fulness of the Godhead</i> <i>bodily</i>, which dwelt in him.</p>
<p><i><b>The first-born of every creature</b></i> — I suppose this phrase to mean the same as that, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>: <i>God hath given him a name which is above every name</i>; he is as <i>man</i> at the <i>head</i> of all the creation of God; nor can he with any propriety be considered as a <i>creature</i>, having himself created all things, and existed before any thing was made. If it be said that God created <i>him</i> first, and that he, by a delegated power from God, created all things, this is most flatly contradicted by the apostle's reasoning in the 16th and 17th verses. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span> As the Jews term Jehovah בכורו של עולם <i>becoro shel olam</i>, <i>the first-born of all the world</i>, or <i>of all the creation</i>, to signify his having created or produced all things; (see Wolfius in loc.) <i>so</i> Christ is here termed, and the words which follow in the 16th and 17th <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span> verses are the proof of this. The phraseology is Jewish; and as they apply it to the supreme Being merely to denote his eternal <i>pre-existence</i>, and to point him out as the <i>cause</i> of all things; it is most evident that St. Paul uses it in the same way, and illustrates his meaning in the following words, which would be absolutely absurd if we could suppose that by the former he intended to convey any idea of the <i>inferiority</i> of Jesus Christ.</p>
