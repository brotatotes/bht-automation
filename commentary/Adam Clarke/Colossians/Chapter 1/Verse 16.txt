<p>Verse 16. 17. <i><b>For by him were all things created</b></i>, c.] These two verses contain parts of the same subject. I shall endeavour to distinguish the statements of the apostle, and reason from them in such a way as the premises shall appear to justify, without appealing to any other scripture in proof of the doctrine which I suppose these verses to vindicate.</p>
<p><i>Four</i> things are here asserted:</p>
<p>1. That Jesus Christ is the <i>Creator of the universe of all things visible and invisible</i> of all things that had a <i>beginning</i>, whether they exist in <i>time</i> or in <i>eternity</i>.</p>
<p>2. That whatsoever was created was created FOR <i>himself</i>; that he was the <i>sole end</i> of his own work.</p>
<p>3. That he was <i>prior</i> to all <i>creation</i>, to all <i>beings</i>, whether in the <i>visible</i> or <i>invisible</i> world.</p>
<p>4. That he is the <i>preserver</i> and <i>governor</i> of all things; for <i>by him all things consist</i>.</p>
<p>Now, allowing St. Paul to have understood the terms which he used, he must have considered Jesus Christ as being truly and properly <i>God</i>.</p>
<p>I. Creation is the proper work of an infinite, unlimited, and unoriginated Being; possessed of all perfections in their highest degrees; capable of knowing, willing, and working infinitely, unlimitedly, and without control: and as creation signifies the production of <i>being</i> where all was <i>absolute nonentity</i>, so it necessarily implies that the Creator acted <i>of</i> and <i>from</i> himself; for as, previously to this creation, there was no being, consequently he could not be actuated by any <i>motive, reason</i>, or <i>impulse, without himself</i>; which would argue there was some being to produce the <i>motive</i> or <i>impulse</i>, or to <i>give</i> the <i>reason</i>. Creation, therefore, is the work of him who is <i>unoriginated</i>, infinite, unlimited, and eternal. But <i>Jesus Christ is the Creator</i> <i>of all things</i>, therefore Jesus Christ must be, according to the plain construction of the apostle's words, truly and properly GOD.</p>
<p>II. As, previously to creation, there was no <i>being</i> but God, consequently the great <i>First Cause</i> must, in the exertion of his creative energy, have respect to himself alone; for he could no more have respect to that which had <i>no existence</i>, than he could be <i>moved</i> by <i>nonexistence</i>, to produce existence or creation. The Creator, therefore, must make every thing FOR <i>himself</i>.</p>
<p>Should it be objected that Christ created <i>officially</i> or by <i>delegation</i>, I answer: This is impossible; for, as creation requires absolute and unlimited power, or omnipotence, there can be but <i>one</i> Creator; because it is impossible that there can be <i>two</i> or <i>more</i> Omnipotents, Infinites, or Eternals. It is therefore evident that creation cannot be effected <i>officially</i>, or by <i>delegation</i>, for this would imply a <i>Being conferring the office</i>, and <i>delegating</i> such <i>power</i>; and that the Being <i>to</i> whom it was delegated was a <i>dependent Being</i>; consequently not <i>unoriginated</i> and <i>eternal</i>; but this the nature of creation proves to be absurd.</p>
<p>1. The thing being impossible in itself, because no limited being could produce a work that necessarily requires omnipotence.</p>
<p>2. It is impossible, because, if omnipotence be <i>delegated</i>, he to whom it is delegated <i>had it not before</i>, and he who delegates it <i>ceases to</i> <i>have it</i>, and consequently <i>ceases to be</i> GOD; and the other to whom it was delegated <i>becomes God</i>, because such attributes as those with which he is supposed to be invested are <i>essential</i> to the nature of God. On this supposition <i>God ceases to exist</i>, though infinite and eternal, and another not naturally <i>infinite</i> and <i>eternal</i> becomes such; and thus an <i>infinite</i> and <i>eternal Being</i> ceases to exist, and another infinite and eternal Being is produced in <i>time</i>, and has a <i>beginning</i>, which is absurd. Therefore, as <i>Christ</i> is the <i>Creator</i>, he did not create by <i>delegation</i>, or in any <i>official way</i>.</p>
<p>Again, if he had created by <i>delegation</i> or <i>officially</i>, it would have been <i>for</i> that <i>Being who gave him that office</i>, and delegated to him the requisite power; but the text says that <i>all things were</i> <i>made</i> BY <i>him and</i> FOR <i>him</i>, which is a demonstration that the apostle understood Jesus Christ to be truly and essentially God.</p>
<p>III. As all <i>creation</i> necessarily exists in <i>time</i>, and had a <i>commencement</i>, and there was an <i>infinite duration</i> in which it <i>did</i> <i>not exist</i>, whatever was <i>before</i> or <i>prior</i> to that must be <i>no part</i> <i>of creation</i>; and the Being who existed prior to creation, <i>and</i> <i>before all things</i> - all existence of every kind, must be the unoriginated and eternal God: but St. Paul says, <i>Jesus Christ was</i> <i>before all things</i>; ergo, the apostle conceived Jesus Christ to be truly and essentially God.</p>
<p>IV. As every <i>effect</i> depends upon its <i>cause</i>, and cannot exist without it; so <i>creation</i>, which is an <i>effect</i> of the <i>power</i> and <i>skill</i> of the Creator, can only exist and be preserved by a continuance of that energy that first gave it being. Hence, God, as the <i>Preserver</i>, is as necessary to the continuance of all things, as God the <i>Creator</i> was to their original production. But this <i>preserving</i> or <i>continuing</i> power is here ascribed to <i>Christ</i>, for the apostle says, And <i>by him do all things consist</i>; for as all being was derived from him as its <i>cause</i>, so all being must <i>subsist</i> <i>by him</i>, as the <i>effect</i> subsists <i>by</i> and <i>through</i> its <i>cause</i>. This is another proof that the apostle considered Jesus Christ to be truly and properly God, as he attributes to him the <i>preservation</i> of all created things, which property of preservation belongs to God alone; ergo, Jesus Christ is, according to the plain obvious meaning of every expression in this text, truly, properly, independently, and essentially God.</p>
<p>Such are the reasonings to which the simple letter of these two verses necessarily leads me. I own it is possible that I may have misapprehended this awful subject, for <i>humanum est errare et</i> <i>nescire</i>; but I am not conscious of the slightest intentional flaw in the argument. Taking, therefore, the apostle as an <i>uninspired</i> man, giving <i>his own view</i> of the Author of the Christian religion, it appears, beyond all controversy, that himself believed Christ Jesus to be God; but considering him as writing under the <i>inspiration of the Holy Ghost</i>, then we have, from the plain grammatical meaning of the words which he has used, the fullest <i>demonstration</i> (for the Spirit of God cannot lie) that he who died for our sins and rose again for our justification, and in whose blood we have redemption, was GOD <i>over all</i>. And as <i>God</i> alone can give salvation to men, and God only can remit sin; hence with the strictest propriety we are commanded to believe on the <i>Lord Jesus</i>, with the assurance that we shall be saved. Glory be to God for this unspeakable gift! See my discourse on this subject.</p>
