<p>Verse 18. <i><b>He is the head of the body</b></i> — What the apostle has said in the two preceding verses refers to the <i>Divine</i> nature of Jesus Christ; he now proceeds to speak of his <i>human</i> nature, and to show how highly that is exalted beyond all created things, and how, in that, he is <i>head</i> of the <i>Church</i>-the author and dispenser of light, life, and salvation, to the Christian world; or, in other words, that from him, as the <i>man</i> in whom the fulness of the Godhead bodily dwelt, all the mercy and salvation of the Gospel system is to be received.</p>
<p><i><b>The beginning, the first-born from the dead</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>, Christ is called <i>the first-fruits of them that slept</i>; and here, the <i>chief and first-born from the dead</i>; he being the first that ever resumed the natural life, with the employment of all its functions, never more to enter the empire of death, after having died a natural death, and in such circumstances as precluded the possibility of deception. The αρχη, <i>chief, head</i>, or <i>first</i>, answers in this verse to the απαρχη, or <i>first-fruits</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>. Jesus Christ is not only the first who rose from the dead to die no more, but he is the first-fruits of human beings; for as surely as the <i>first-fruits</i> were an indication and pledge of the <i>harvest</i>, so surely was the <i>resurrection</i> of Christ the proof that all mankind should have a resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p><i><b>That in all - he might have the pre-eminence</b></i> — That he might be considered, in consequence of his mediatorial office, as possessing the <i>first</i> place in and being <i>chief</i> over all the creation of God; for is it to be wondered at that the human nature, with which the great Creator condescended to unite himself, should be set over all the works of his hands?</p>
