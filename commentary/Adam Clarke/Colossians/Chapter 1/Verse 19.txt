<p>Verse 19. <i><b>For it pleased the Father that in him should all</b></i><b> </b><i><b>fulness dwell</b></i> — As the words, <i>the Father</i> are not in the text, some have translated the verse thus: <i>For in him it seemed right that</i> <i>all fulness should dwell</i>; that is, that the majesty, power, and goodness of God should be manifested in and by Christ Jesus, and thus by him the Father reconciles all things to himself. The πληρωμα, or <i>fulness</i>, must refer here to the Divine nature dwelling in the man Christ Jesus.</p>
