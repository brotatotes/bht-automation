<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:2">Colossians 1:2</span>. <i><b>To the saints</b></i> — Those who professed Christianity. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which are at Colosse</b></i> — Instead of εν κολοσσαις, at Colosse, or among the Colossians, ABC, and many other excellent MSS., with both the <i>Syriac, Coptic, Slavonic, Origen</i>, Gregory Nyssen, Amphilochus, Theodoret, Damascenus, Theophylact, and others, read εν κολασσαις in <i>Colassa</i>, or among the <i>Colassians</i>; and this is most probably the true reading. That this city perished by an earthquake, a short time after the date of this epistle, we have the testimony of Eusebius. That which at present is supposed to occupy the site of this ancient city is called <i>Konos</i>. For other particulars see the <i>preface</i> to this epistle. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1- :">Ephesians 1:1- :</span></p>
<p><i><b>Grace be unto you</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And the Lord Jesus Christ.</b></i> — This clause is omitted by many MSS., several <i>versions</i>, and some of the <i>fathers</i>. Griesbach has left it out of the text, not, in my opinion, on sufficient evidence.</p>
