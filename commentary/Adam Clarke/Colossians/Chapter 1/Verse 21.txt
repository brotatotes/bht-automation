<p>Verse 21. <i><b>And you, that were sometime alienated</b></i> — All men are <i>alienated</i> from God, and all are <i>enemies in their minds</i> to him, and show it by their <i>wicked works</i>; but this is spoken particularly of the <i>Gentiles</i>. The word απαλλοτριοω, which we render to <i>alienate</i>, to <i>give to another</i>, to <i>estrange</i>, expresses the state of the Gentiles: while the Jews were, at least by profession, <i>dedicated</i> to God, the Gentiles were <i>alienated</i>, that is, <i>given up to others</i>; they worshipped not the true God, but had gods many and lords many, to whom they dedicated themselves, their religious service, and their property. The verb αλλοτριοω, to <i>alienate</i>, being compounded here with the preposition απο, <i>from</i>, signifies to abalienate, to <i>estrange utterly</i>, to be <i>wholly the property of</i> <i>another</i>. Thus the Gentiles had alienated themselves from God, and were alienated or rejected by him, because of their wickedness and idolatry.</p>
<p><i><b>Enemies in your mind</b></i> — They had the <i>carnal mind</i>, which is enmity against God; and this was expressed in their outward conduct by <i>wicked works</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span></span>. The mind is taken here for all the <i>soul, heart, affections, passions</i>, &amp;c.</p>
