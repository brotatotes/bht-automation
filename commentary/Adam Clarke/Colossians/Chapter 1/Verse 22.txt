<p>Verse 22. <i><b>In the body of his flesh</b></i> — By Christ's assumption of a human body, and dying for man, he has made an atonement for sin, through which men become reconciled to God and to each other.</p>
<p><i><b>To present you holy</b></i> — Having saved you from your sins.</p>
<p><i><b>Unblamable</b></i> — Having filled you with his Spirit, and written his law in your <i>hearts</i>, so that his love, shed abroad in your hearts, becomes the principle and motive to every action. The <i>tree</i> therefore being good, the <i>fruit</i> is also good.</p>
<p><i><b>And unreprovable</b></i> — For, being filled with love, joy, peace, meekness, gentleness, and goodness, against these there is no law; and as they were called to love God with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength, and their neighbour as themselves, the whole <i>spirit</i> and <i>design</i> of the law was fulfilled in them, for <i>love is</i> <i>the fulfilling of the law</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>In his sight</b></i> — At the day of judgment. None can enjoy heaven who have not been <i>reconciled</i> to God here, and shown forth the fruits of that reconciliation in being made <i>holy</i> and <i>unblamable</i>, that, when they come to be judged, they may be found <i>unreprovable</i>.</p>
