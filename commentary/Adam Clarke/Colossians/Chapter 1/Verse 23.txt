<p>Verse 23. <i><b>If ye continue in the faith</b></i> — This will be the case if you, who have already believed in Christ Jesus, continue in that faith, <i>grounded</i> in the knowledge and love of God, and <i>settled</i>-made <i>firm</i> and perseveringly <i>steadfast</i>, in that state of salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>And</b></i> be <i>not moved away</i>] Not permitting yourselves to be seduced by false teachers.</p>
<p><i><b>The hope of the Gospel</b></i> — The resurrection of the body, and the glorification of it and the soul together, in the realms of blessedness. This is properly the Gospel HOPE.</p>
<p><i><b>To every creature which is under heaven</b></i> — A Hebraism for the whole human race, and particularly referring to the two grand divisions of mankind, the Jews and Gentiles; to both of these the Gospel had been preached, and to each, salvation by Christ had been <i>equally</i> offered. And as none had been excluded from the offers of mercy, and Jesus Christ had tasted death for every man, and the Jews and Gentiles, in their great corporate capacity, had all been invited to believe the Gospel; therefore, the apostle concludes that the Gospel was preached to every creature under heaven, as being offered without restrictions or limitations to these two grand divisions of mankind, including the whole human race.</p>
