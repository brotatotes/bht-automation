<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Rejoice in my sufferings for you</b></i> — St. Paul always considers his persecutions, as far as the Jews were concerned in them, as arising from this simple circumstance - his asserting that God had chosen the Gentiles, and called them to enjoy the <i>very</i> <i>same privileges</i> with the Jews, and to constitute one Church with them.</p>
<p>It was on this account that the Jews attempted his life at Jerusalem, when, in order to save it, he was obliged to appeal to Caesar; the consequences of which persecution he was now suffering in his imprisonment in Rome. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:2">Colossians 4:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That which is behind of the afflictions of Christ</b></i> — I have still some afflictions to pass through before my race of glory be finished; afflictions which fall on me on account of the Gospel; such as Christ bore from the same persecuting people.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that the apostle does not say παθηματα, the <i>passion</i> of Christ, but simply θλιψεις, the <i>afflictions</i>; such as are common to all good men who bear a testimony against the ways and fashions of a wicked world. In these the apostle had his share, in the <i>passion</i> of Christ he could have none. He trod the wine press <i>alone</i>, of the people there were none with him.</p>
<p><i><b>His body's sake</b></i> — Believers, both of Jews and Gentiles, who form that one <i>body</i>, of which Christ is the <i>head</i>.</p>
