<p><i><b>According to the dispensation</b></i> — κατα την οικονομιαν. According to the Gospel <i>economy</i> or <i>institution</i>; the <i>scheme</i> or <i>plan</i> of salvation by Christ crucified.</p>
<p><i><b>To fulfil the word of God</b></i> — The Greek πληρωσαι τον λογον του Θεου may be translated, <i>fully to preach the doctrine of God</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:19">Romans 15:19</span>, and the note there. Were we to take the word in its common meaning, it might signify to accomplish the purpose of God, as predicted by the prophets.</p>
