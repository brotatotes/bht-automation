<p>Verse 27. <i><b>The riches of the glory</b></i> — God manifests to these how abundantly glorious this Gospel is among the Gentiles; and how effectual is this doctrine of Christ crucified to the salvation of multitudes.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is Christ in you, the hope of glory</b></i> — In this and the following verse there are several remarkable particulars:-</p>
<p>I. We find here the <i>sum</i> and <i>substance</i> of the apostle's preaching.</p>
<p>1. He preached <i>Christ</i>, as the only Saviour of sinners.</p>
<p>2. He proclaimed this Christ as being <i>in</i> them; for the design of the Gospel is to put men in possession of the Spirit and power of Christ, to make them partakers of the Divine nature, and thus prepare them for an eternal union with himself. Should it be said that the preposition εν should be translated <i>among</i>, it amounts to the same; for Christ was <i>among</i> them, to enlighten, quicken, purify, and refine them, and this he could not do without dwelling <i>in</i> them.</p>
<p>3. He preached this <i>present</i> and <i>indwelling</i> Christ as the <i>hope of</i> <i>glory</i>; for no man could rationally hope for glory who had not the <i>pardon</i> of his sins, and whose nature was not sanctified; and none could have pardon but through the blood of his cross; and none could have glorification but through the indwelling, sanctifying Spirit of Christ.</p>
<p>II. We see the <i>manner</i> in which the apostles preached.</p>
<p>1. <i>They warned every one</i>-they showed every man his danger; they proved that both Jews and Gentiles were under sin; and that the wrath of God was revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men; that time and life were uncertain; and that now was the day of salvation.</p>
<p>2. <i>They taught every man in all wisdom</i>-they considered the world in a state of ignorance and darkness, every man being through sin ignorant of himself and God; and the apostles taught them to know themselves, viz., that they were sinners, wretched, helpless, and perishing; and they taught them to know God, in his purity, justice, and truth, and in his mercy through Christ Jesus. Thus they instructed men in all wisdom; for the knowledge of a man's self and his God constitutes all that is essentially necessary to be known for present and eternal happiness.</p>
<p>III. The <i>end</i> which the apostles had in view in thus preaching Christ: to <i>present every man perfect in Christ Jesus</i>. The words τελειον εν χριστω, perfect in or through Christ, signify two things: 1. That they should be <i>thoroughly instructed</i> in the doctrines of Christianity, so that they should know the truth as it is in Jesus. 2. That they should be made partakers of the grace of the Gospel, so that they might be saved from all their sins, and be filled with His fulness. The succeeding chapter amply proves that nothing less than this entered into the apostle's design. Men may dispute as they please about <i>Christian</i> <i>perfection</i>, but without it no soul shall ever see God. He who is not saved from <i>all sin</i> here, cannot, to his joy, see God hereafter. This perfection of which the apostle speaks, and to which he laboured to bring all men, was something to be attained in and <i>through Christ</i>. The apostles preached Christ <i>in</i> the people; and they preached him as crucified for mankind. He who <i>died for</i> them was to <i>live in</i> them, and fill their whole souls with his own purity. No <i>indwelling sin</i> can be tolerated by an <i>indwelling Christ</i>; for he came into the world to save his people from their sins.</p>
<p>IV. We see who were the objects of the apostle's ministry: the Jews and Gentiles; παντα ανθρωπον, every man, the <i>whole human</i> <i>race</i>. Every man had sinned; and for every sinner Christ had died; and he died for them that they might be saved from all their sins. The apostles never restrained the offers of salvation; they made them frankly to all, believing that it was the will of God that all should believe and be saved: hence they warned and taught every man that they might, at the day of judgment, present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; for, although their own personal ministry could not reach all the inhabitants of the earth, yet it is by the doctrines which they preached, and by the writings which they have left on record, that the earth is to be filled with the knowledge and glory of God, and the souls of men brought to the enjoyment of the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of peace.</p>
