<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>. <i><b>Whereunto I also labour</b></i> — In order to accomplish this end, I labour with the utmost zeal and earnestness; and with all that strength with which God has most powerfully furnished me. Whoever considers the original words, αγωνιζομενος κατα την ενεργειαν αυτου την ενεργουμενην - εν δυναμει, will find that no verbal translation can convey their sense. God worked <i>energetically</i> in St. Paul, and he <i>wrought energetically</i> with God; and all this was in reference to the salvation of mankind.</p>
<p>1. THE preceding chapter contains the highest truths in the Christian religion, conveyed in language peculiar to this apostle; a language never taught by man, clothing ideas as vast as the human mind can grasp, and both coming immediately from that inspiration of the Almighty which giveth understanding.</p>
<p>2. What the apostle says on the Godhead of Christ has already been distinctly noted; and from this we must conclude that, unless there be some secret way of understanding the 16th and 17th verses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span> which God has nowhere revealed, taken in their sober and rational sense and meaning they must for ever settle this very important point. Let any man of common sense and reason hear these words, whose mind had not been previously warped by any sentiment on the subject, and who only knew, in religious matters, this one great truth, that there is a God, and that he made and governs all things; and then let him be asked, Of whom doth the apostle speak this? Would he not immediately answer, <i>He</i> <i>speaketh of God</i>? As to the difficulties on this subject, we must consider them difficulties rather to our limited intellect, than as belonging to the subject. We can know but little of an infinite and eternal Being; nothing, properly speaking, but what himself is pleased to reveal. Let us receive, <i>this</i> with gratitude and reverence. See my discourse on the sum and substance of apostolic preaching.</p>
