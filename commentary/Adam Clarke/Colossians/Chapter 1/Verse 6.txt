<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Which is come unto you</b></i> — The doctrine of the Gospel is represented as a <i>traveller</i>, whose object it is to visit the whole habitable earth; and, having commenced his journey in Judea, had proceeded through Syria and through different parts of Asia Minor, and had lately arrived at their city, every where proclaiming glad tidings of great joy to all people.</p>
<p><i><b>As</b></i><b> it is </b><i><b>in all the world</b></i> — So rapid is this <i>traveller</i> in his course, that he had already gone nearly through the whole of the countries under the Roman dominion; and will travel on till he has proclaimed his message to every people, and kindred, and nation, and tongue.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the apostolic age, the word of the Lord had certainly <i>free course</i>, did <i>run</i> and was <i>glorified</i>. Since that time the population of the earth has increased greatly; and, to follow the metaphor, the <i>traveller</i> still continues in his great journey. It is, the glory of the present day that, by means of the <i>British and Foreign Bible Society</i>, Bibles are multiplied in all the languages of Europe; and by means of the Christian missionaries, <i>Carey, Marshman</i>, and <i>Ward</i>, whose zeal, constancy, and ability, have been rarely equalled, and perhaps never surpassed, the sacred writings have been, in the compass of a few years, translated into most of the written languages of India, in which they were not previously extant. In this labour they have been ably seconded by the Rev. Henry Martyn, one of the East India Company's chaplains, who was taken to his great reward just when he had <i>completed</i> a pure and accurate version of the New Testament into <i>Persian</i>. The Rev. R. Morrison, at Canton, has had the honour to present the whole of the New Testament, in Chinese, to the immense population of that greatest empire of the earth. May that dark people receive it, and walk in the light of the Lord! And, by means of the <i>Wesleyan missionaries</i>, the sacred writings have been printed and widely circulated in the Singhalese and Indo- Portuguese, through the whole of the island of Ceylon, and the pure word of the Gospel has been preached there, and also on the whole continent of India, to the conversion of multitudes. Let every reader pray that all these noble attempts may be crowned with unlimited success, till the earth is filled both with the knowledge and glory of the Lord. <i>Talia secla currite</i>! Amen.</p>
<p><i><b>And bringeth forth fruit</b></i> — Wherever the pure Gospel of Christ is preached, it is the <i>seed of the kingdom</i>, and must be fruitful in all those who receive it by faith, in simplicity of heart.</p>
<p>After καρποφορουμενον, <i>bringeth forth fruit</i>, ABCD*EFG, many others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic, Sahidic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Armenian, Slavonic, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, together with many of the <i>fathers</i>, add και αυξανομενον, <i>and increaseth</i>. It had not only <i>brought forth fruit</i>, but was <i>multiplying</i> its own kind; every fruit containing <i>seed</i>, and every seed producing thirty, sixty, or a hundredfold. This reading is very important, and is undoubtedly <i>genuine</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The grace of God in truth</b></i> — Ye were <i>fruitful</i>, and went on <i>increasing</i> in the salvation of God, from the time that ye heard and acknowledged this doctrine to be of God, to spring from the grace or <i>benevolence</i> of God; and received it in truth, sincerely and uprightly, as his greatest gift to man.</p>
