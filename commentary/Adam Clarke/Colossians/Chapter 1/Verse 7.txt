<p>Verse 7. <i><b>As ye also learned of Epaphras - who is for you</b></i> — Who this Epaphras was we cannot tell; only it is likely that he was a Colossian, and became, by the call and grace of Christ, a deacon of this Church, faithfully labouring with the apostle, to promote its best interests. Some think that he is the same with <i>Epaphroditus, Epaphras</i> being a contraction of that name, as <i>Demas</i> is of <i>Demetrius</i>; and it is remarkable that one of the <i>Slavonic</i> versions has <i>Epaphroditus</i> in this place. That he was a Colossian is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>: <i>Epaphras, who is</i> one <i>of you</i>, οεξυμων. some think that he was the first who preached the Gospel among this people, and hence called an <i>apostle</i>. He was raised up among themselves to be their minister in the absence of the apostle, and he showed himself to be worthy of this calling by a faithful discharge of his ministry, and by <i>labouring fervently for them all</i>, and pressing them forward, that <i>they might stand perfect and complete in all the</i> <i>will of God</i>.</p>
