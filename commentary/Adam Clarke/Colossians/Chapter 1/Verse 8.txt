They enjoyed a spiritual, energetic ministry, and they were a <i>spiritual</i> people; they had a <i>loving spirit</i>, and <i>love</i> through the <i>Spirit</i> of God which dwelt in them. And of this love of theirs in the Spirit, and particularly towards the apostle, Epaphras gave full proof, not only by describing to the apostle the affection they felt for him, but in presenting to him those <i>supplies</i> which their love to him caused them to furnish.</p>
