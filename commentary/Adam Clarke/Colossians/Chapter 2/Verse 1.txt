<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>. <i><b>What great conflict</b></i> — The word αγων, which we here render <i>conflict</i>, is to be understood as implying <i>earnest care</i> and <i>solicitude</i>, accompanied, undoubtedly, with the most fervent application to the throne of grace in their behalf. The αγωνιζομενος of the preceding verse gave the apostle occasion to use the word αγων here. He <i>agonized</i> with God, and his <i>agony</i> was for them.</p>
<p><i><b>Laodicea</b></i> — A city of Asia Minor, on the borders of <i>Caria,</i> <i>Phrygia</i>, and <i>Lydia</i>. It was originally called <i>Diospolis</i>, or the city of Jupiter, and afterwards <i>Rhoas</i>; but obtained the name of <i>Laodicea</i> from <i>Laodice</i>, the wife of Antiochus. It is now called <i>Ladik</i>. It was formerly celebrated for its commerce, and the fine black wool of its sheep. Colosse, or the city of the Colossians, lay between it and Hierapolis. This <i>Hierapolis</i> was also a town of Phrygia, famous for its hot baths: it is now called <i>Bambukholasi</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>As many as have not seen my face in the flesh</b></i> — From this it has been conjectured that St. Paul had never been at either Colosse or Laodicea, and this, from the letter of the text, appears probable; and yet, his having passed more than once through this country, preaching and strengthening the Churches, renders it very improbable. It is, therefore, most likely that we should understand the apostle as speaking collectively; that he had the most earnest concern, not only for the welfare of those Churches with which he was acquainted, such as Colosse and Laodicea, but also for those to whom he was not personally known.</p>
