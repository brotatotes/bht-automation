<p>Verse 10. <i><b>And ye are complete in him</b></i> — και εστε εν αυτω πεπληρωμενοι. And, ye are filled with him. Our word <i>complete</i> quite destroys the connection subsisting in the apostle's ideas. The philosophy of the world was <i>empty</i>, κενη, but there was a πληρωμα, or <i>fulness</i>, in Christ; the Colossians were <i>empty</i>-spoiled and deprived of every good, while following the <i>empty</i> philosophy and groundless traditions of Jewish and Gentile teachers; but since they had received Christ Jesus they were πεπληρωμενοι, <i>filled</i> with him. This is the true meaning of the word, and by this the connection and assemblage of ideas in the apostle's mind are preserved. No fanciful <i>completeness in Christ</i>, of a believer, while incomplete in himself, is either expressed or intended by St. Paul. It is too bad a doctrine to exist in the oracles of God.</p>
