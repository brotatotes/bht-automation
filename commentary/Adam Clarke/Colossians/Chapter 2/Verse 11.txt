<p>Verse 11. <i><b>In whom also ye are circumcised</b></i> — All that was designed by circumcision, literally performed, is accomplished in them that believe through the Spirit and power of Christ. It is not a cutting off of a <i>part</i> of the flesh, but a <i>putting off</i> the <i>body</i> of the <i>sins</i> of the flesh, through the circumcision of Christ; he having undergone and performed this, and all other rites necessary to qualify him to be a mediator between God and man; for, being made under the <i>law</i>, he was subject to all its ordinances, and every act of his contributed to the salvation of men. But by the circumcision of Christ, the operation of his grace and Spirit may be intended; the law required the circumcision of the flesh, the Gospel of Christ required the circumcision of the heart. The words των αμαρτιων, <i>of the sins</i>, are omitted by ABCD*EFG, several others, by the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>; and by <i>Clement, Athanasius, Basil,</i> <i>Cyril</i>, and several others. Griesbach has omitted them.</p>
