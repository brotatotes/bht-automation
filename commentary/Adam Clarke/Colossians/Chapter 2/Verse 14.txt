<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances</b></i> — By the hand-writing of ordinances the apostle most evidently means the <i>ceremonial law</i>: this was against them, for they were bound to fulfil it; and it was contrary to them, as condemning them for their neglect and transgression of it. This law God himself has blotted out.</p>
<p><i>Blotting out the hand-writing</i> is probably an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+5:23">Numbers 5:23</span>, where the curses written in the book, in the case of the woman suspected of adultery, are directed to be blotted out with the bitter waters. And there can be little doubt of a farther allusion, viz., to the custom of discharging the writing from parchment by the application of such a fluid as the <i>muriatic acid</i>, which immediately dissolves those ferruginous calces which constitute the <i>blackening</i> principle of most inks. But the East India inks, being formed only of simple <i>black</i>, such as burnt <i>ivory</i>, or <i>cork</i>, and gum water, may be wiped clean off from the surface of the paper or parchment by the application of a <i>wet</i> <i>sponge</i>, so as to leave not one legible vestige remaining: this I have often proved.</p>
<p><i><b>Nailing it to his cross</b></i> — When Christ was nailed to the cross, our obligation to fulfil these ordinances was done away. There may be another reference here to some ancient mode of <i>annulling</i> legal obligations, by <i>nailing them to a post</i>; but I do not recollect at present an instance or example. Antiquated <i>laws</i> are said to have been thus abrogated.</p>
