<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And having spoiled principalities and powers</b></i> — Here is an allusion to the treatment of enemies when conquered: they are <i>spoiled of their armour</i>, so much the word απεκδυειν implies; and they are <i>exhibited</i> with contumely and reproach to the populace, especially when the victor has the honour of a <i>triumph</i>; to the former of which there is an allusion in the words εδειγματισεν εν παρρησια, <i>making a public exhibition of them</i>; and to the latter in the words θριαμβευσας αυτους, <i>triumphing over</i> <i>them</i>. And the <i>principalities</i> and <i>powers</i> refer to the emperors, kings, and generals taken in battle, and reserved to grace the victor's triumph. It is very likely that by the αρχας και εξουσιας, <i>principalities</i> and <i>powers</i>, over whom Christ triumphed, the apostle means the נשיאות <i>nesioth</i> and רשות <i>roshoth</i>, who were the <i>rulers</i> and <i>chiefs</i> in the <i>Sanhedrin</i> and <i>synagogues</i>, and who had great authority among the people, both in making constitutions and explaining traditions. The propagation of <i>Christianity</i> in Judea quite destroyed their spiritual power and domination; just as the propagation of <i>Protestantism</i>, which was Christianity revived, destroyed, wherever it appeared, the false doctrine and domination of the pope of Rome.</p>
<p><i><b>In it.</b></i> — The words εναυτω refer rather to <i>Christ</i>, than to the <i>cross</i>, if indeed they be genuine; of which there is much reason to doubt, as the <i>versions</i> and <i>fathers</i> differ so greatly in quoting them. Griesbach has left them out of the text.</p>
