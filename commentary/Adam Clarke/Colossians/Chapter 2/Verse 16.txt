<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Let no man - judge you in meat, or in drink</b></i> — The apostle speaks here in reference to some particulars of the <i>hand-writing of ordinances</i>, which had been <i>taken away</i>, viz., the distinction of <i>meats</i> and <i>drinks</i>, what was <i>clean</i> and what <i>unclean</i>, according to the law; and the necessity of observing certain <i>holydays</i> or <i>festivals</i>, such as the <i>new moons</i> and particular <i>sabbaths</i>, or those which should be observed with more than ordinary solemnity; all these had been taken out of the way and nailed to the cross, and were no longer of moral obligation. There is no intimation here that the <i>Sabbath</i> was done away, or that its moral use was superseded, by the introduction of Christianity. I have shown elsewhere that, <i>Remember the Sabbath</i> <i>day, to keep it holy</i>, is a command of <i>perpetual obligation</i>, and can never be superseded but by the final termination of time. As it is a <i>type</i> of that rest which remains for the people of God, of an eternity of bliss, it must continue in full force till that eternity arrives; for no <i>type</i> ever ceases till the <i>antitype</i> be come. Besides, it is not clear that the apostle refers at all to the <i>Sabbath</i> in this place, whether Jewish or Christian; his σαββατων, <i>of sabbaths</i> or <i>weeks</i>, most probably refers to their <i>feasts of weeks</i>, of which much has been said in the notes on the Pentateuch.</p>
