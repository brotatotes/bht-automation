<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Which are a shadow</b></i> — All these things were <i>types</i>, and must continue in force till the Christ, whom they represented, came; the apostle therefore says that the <i>body</i> - the <i>substance</i> or <i>design</i> of them was <i>of Christ</i> - pointed him out, and the excellent blessings which he has procured. The word σκια, <i>shadow</i>, is often used to express any thing <i>imperfect</i> or <i>unsubstantial</i>; while the term σωμα, <i>body</i>, was used in the opposite sense, and expressed any thing <i>substantial, solid</i>, and <i>firm</i>. The law was but the <i>shadow</i> or <i>representation</i> of good things to come; none should rest in it; all that it pointed out is to be sought and obtained in Christ.</p>
