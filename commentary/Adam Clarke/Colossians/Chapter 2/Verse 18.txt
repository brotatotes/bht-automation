<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Let no man beguile you</b></i> — μηδειςυμαςκαταβραβευετω. Let no man take the <i>prize</i> from you which the βραβευς, <i>brabeus</i>, or judge in the contests, has assigned you, in consequence of your having obtained the victory. This any reader will see, is an allusion to the Olympic and Isthmian games, and to the prizes assigned to these who had obtained the victory in one or more of the contests which there took place. The Colossians had fought and conquered under the direction of Christ, and he, as the sole judge in this contest, had assigned to them the prize; the false teachers, affecting great modesty, humility, and sanctity, endeavoured to turn them aside from the Gospel, and to induce them to end in the <i>flesh</i> who had begun in the <i>Spirit</i>. Against these the apostle warns them.</p>
<p><i><b>In a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels</b></i> — This is a difficult passage, and in order to explain it, I shall examine the meaning of some of the principal terms of the original. The word θελειν, <i>to will</i>, signifies also <i>to delight</i>; and ταπειμοφροσυνη signifies not only <i>lowliness</i> or <i>humility of mind</i>, but also <i>affliction of mind</i>; and ταπεινουν την ψυχην, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:20">Leviticus 16:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:31">Leviticus 16:31</span>, and in many other places, signifies to <i>afflict the soul by</i> <i>fasting</i>, and <i>self-abnegation</i>; and θρησκεια signifies <i>reverence</i> and <i>modesty</i>. Hence the whole passage has been paraphrased thus: Let no man spoil you of the prize adjudged to you, who delights in mortifying his body, and walking with the apparent <i>modesty of an</i> <i>angel</i>, affecting superior sanctity in order to gain disciples; <i>intruding into things which he has not seen</i>; and, notwithstanding his apparent humility, his mind is <i>carnal</i>, and he is <i>puffed up</i> with a sense of his superior knowledge and piety. It is very likely that the apostle here alludes to the <i>Essenes</i>, who were remarkably strict and devout, spent a principal part of their time in the contemplation of the Divine Being, abstained from all sensual gratifications, and affected to live the <i>life of angels</i> upon earth. With <i>their</i> pretensions all the apostle says here perfectly agrees, and on this one supposition the whole of the passage is plain and easy. Many have understood the passage as referring to the <i>adoration of angels</i>, which seems to have been practised among the Jews, who appear (from <i>Tobit</i>, xii. 15; <i>Philo</i>, in lib. <i>de Somn</i>.; <i>Josephus</i>, War. lib. ii. cap. 8, sec. 7) to have considered them as a sort of <i>mediators</i> between God and man; presenting the prayers of men before the throne; and being, as Philo says, μεγαλου βασιλεως οφθαλμοι και ωτα, <i>the eyes and ears</i> <i>of the great King</i>. But this interpretation is not so likely as the foregoing.</p>
