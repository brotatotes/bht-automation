<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>. <i><b>That their hearts might be comforted</b></i> — That they might have continual happiness in God, having constant affiance in him.</p>
<p><i><b>Being knit together in love</b></i> — The word συμβιβασθεντων, or συμβιβασθεντες, which is the true reading, but both of equal import here, signifies being united, as the beams or the timbers of a building, by mortices and pins. The visible Church of Christ cannot be in <i>union</i> with God unless it have <i>unity</i> in itself, and without <i>love</i> this unity is impossible.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding</b></i> — That is, that they might have the most indubitable certainty of the truth of Christianity, of their own salvation, and of the general design of God to admit the Gentiles into his Church. This is the grand mystery of God, which was now laid open by the preaching of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>And of the Father, and of Christ</b></i> — These words are variously written in different MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers: The mystery of</i> <i>God-of God in Christ-of God who is in Christ-of God concerning</i> <i>Christ-of God who is Christ-of the God Christ-of God and Christ-of</i> <i>God the Father of Christ-of God the Father, and our Lord Christ-of</i> <i>God and the Father of Christ-of God the Father, in Christ-of the</i> <i>God Christ Jesus, Father and Lord</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>This great variety of versions leaves the strongest presumption that the words in question are glosses which have crept into the text, and are of no authority. <i>Griesbach</i> has left them out of the text.</p>
