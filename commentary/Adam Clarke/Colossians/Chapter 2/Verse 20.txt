<p>Verse 20. <i><b>If ye be dead with Christ</b></i> — See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3">Romans 6:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>From the rudiments of the world</b></i> — Ye have renounced all hope of salvation from the observance of Jewish rites and ceremonies, which were only <i>rudiments, first elements</i>, or the <i>alphabet</i>, out of which the whole science of Christianity was composed. We have often seen that <i>the world</i> and <i>this world</i> signify the Jewish dispensation, or the rites, ceremonies, and services performed under it.</p>
<p><i><b>Why, as though living in the world</b></i> — Why, as if ye were still under the same dispensation from which you have been already freed, are ye subject to its ordinances, performing them as if expecting salvation from this performance?</p>
