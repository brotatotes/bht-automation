<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Touch not; taste not; handle not</b></i> â€” These are forms of expression very frequent among the Jews. In <i>Maccoth</i>, fol. xxi. 1: "If they say to a Nazarite, <i>Don't drink, don't drink</i>; and he, notwithstanding, drinks; he is guilty. If they say, <i>Don't shave,</i> <i>don't shave</i>; and he shaves, notwithstanding; he is guilty. If they say, <i>Don't put on these clothes, don't put on these clothes</i>; and he, notwithstanding, puts on heterogeneous garments; he is guilty." See more in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
