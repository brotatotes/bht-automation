<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Which all are to perish with the using</b></i> — These are not matters of eternal moment; the different kinds of meats were made for the body, and go with it into corruption: in like manner, all the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish religion now perish, having accomplished the <i>end</i> of their institution; namely, to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</p>
<p><i><b>After the commandments and doctrines of men?</b></i> — These words should follow the 20th verse, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span> of which they form a part; and it appears from them that the apostle is here speaking of the traditions of the elders, and the load of cumbrous ceremonies which they added to the significant rites prescribed by Moses.</p>
