<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:4">Colossians 2:4</span>. <i><b>Lest any man should beguile you</b></i> — The word παραλογιζηται means to deceive by sophistry or subtle reasoning, in which all the <i>conclusions</i> appear to be fairly drawn from the <i>premises</i>, but the premises are either <i>assumed</i> without evidence, or <i>false</i> in themselves; but this not being easily discovered, the unthinking or unwary are carried away by the conclusions which are drawn from these premises. And this result is clearly intimated by the term πιθανολογια, <i>enticing words, plausible conclusions</i> or <i>deductions</i> from this mode of reasoning. The apostle seems to allude to the Gentile philosophers, who were notorious for this kind of argumentation. Plato and Socrates are not free from it.</p>
