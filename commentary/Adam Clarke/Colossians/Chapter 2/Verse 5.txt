Verse 5. For though I be absent in the flesh — It is hardly possible that such words as these in this verse could have been used to perfect strangers; they argue a considerable knowledge of the people, and a knowledge founded on personal acquaintance. The original is exceedingly soft and musical:-  Ει γαρ και τη σαρκι απειμι, Αλλα τῳ πνευματι συν ὑμιν ειμι, Χαιρων και βλεπων ὑμων την ταξιν, κ.τ.λ. The whole verse shows that this Church was sound in doctrine, and strict in discipline. They had steadfast faith in Christ, and regular order or discipline among themselves.
