<p>Verse 5. <i><b>For though I be absent in the flesh</b></i> — It is hardly possible that such words as these in this verse could have been used to perfect <i>strangers</i>; they argue a considerable knowledge of the people, and a knowledge founded on personal acquaintance. The original is exceedingly soft and musical:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Ει γαρ και τη σαρκι απειμι,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Αλλα τῳ πνευματι συν ὑμιν ειμι,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Χαιρων και βλεπων ὑμων την ταξιν, κ.τ.λ. </p>
<p>The whole verse shows that this Church was <i>sound</i> in <i>doctrine</i>, and <i>strict</i> in <i>discipline</i>. They had <i>steadfast faith</i> in Christ, and regular <i>order</i> or discipline among themselves.</p>
