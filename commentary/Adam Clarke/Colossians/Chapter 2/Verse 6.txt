<p>Verse 6. <i><b>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus</b></i> â€” Many persons lay a certain stress on the words <i>as</i> and <i>so</i>, and make various fine heads of discourses from them; viz. <i>As</i> ye received Christ in a spirit of <i>humility, so</i> walk in him; <i>as</i> ye received him in a spirit of <i>faith, so</i> walk in him, c., &amp;c. This may be all proper in itself but nothing of the kind was intended by the apostle. His meaning is simply this: Seeing ye have embraced the doctrine of Christ, continue to hold it fast, and not permit yourselves to be turned aside by sophistical or Judaizing teachers.</p>
