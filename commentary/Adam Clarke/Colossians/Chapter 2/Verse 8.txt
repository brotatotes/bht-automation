<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Beware lest any man spoil you</b></i> — The word συλαγωγων, from συλη, <i>prey</i>, and αγειν, <i>to lead</i> or <i>carry away</i>, signifies to <i>rob</i>, or <i>spoil</i> of their goods, as if by <i>violence</i> or rapine. Their goods were the salvation they had received from Christ; and both the Gentile and Jewish teachers endeavoured to deprive them of these, by perverting their minds, and leading them off from the truths of Christianity.</p>
<p><i><b>Philosophy and vain deceit</b></i> — Or, the <i>vain</i> or <i>empty deceit of</i> <i>philosophy</i>; such philosophizing as the Jewish and Gentile teachers used. As the term <i>philosophy</i> stood in high repute among the Gentiles, the Jews of this time affected it; and both <i>Philo</i> and <i>Josephus</i> use the word to express the whole of the Mosaic institutions. So the former: Ὁι κατα Μωσην φιλοσοφουντες· "Those who embraced the philosophy of Moses;" PHIL., De Nomin. Mutand. And the latter; Τρια παρα Ιουδαιοις ειδη φιλοσοφειται· "There are three systems of philosophy among the Jews," (Bell. Jud., lib. ii. cap 8, sec. 2,) meaning the <i>Pharisees, Sadducees</i>, and <i>Essenes</i>, as immediately follows. The Jewish philosophy, such as is found in the <i>Cabala, Midrashim</i>, and other works, deserves the character of <i>vain deceit</i>, in the fullest sense and meaning of the words. The inspired writers excepted, the Jews have ever been the most puerile, absurd, and ridiculous reasoners in the world. Even <i>Rabbi Maymon</i>, or <i>Maimonides</i>, the most intelligent of them all, is often in his master piece (the <i>Moreh Nevochim</i>, the <i>Teacher of the</i> <i>Perplexed</i>) most deplorably empty and vain.</p>
<p><i><b>After the rudiments of the world</b></i> — According to the doctrine of the <i>Jewish teachers</i>; or, according to the <i>Mosaic institutions</i>, as explained and glossed by the scribes, Pharisees, and rabbins in general. We have often seen that העולם הזה <i>haolam hazzeh, this</i> <i>world</i>, of which του κοσμου τουτου is a literal translation, is frequently used to express the Jewish system of rites, ceremonies, and institutions in general; what the apostle calls <i>the tradition</i> <i>of men</i>, namely, what men, unauthorized by God, have taught as doctrines received from him. Our Lord frequently refers to and condemns these traditions.</p>
<p><i><b>Not after Christ.</b></i> — Not according to the simple doctrine of Christ, viz.: HE died for our offences; believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.</p>
