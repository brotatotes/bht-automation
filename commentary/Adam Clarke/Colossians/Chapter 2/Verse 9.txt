<p>Verse 9. <i><b>For in him dwelleth all the fulness</b></i> — This is opposed to the <i>vain</i> or <i>empty</i> doctrine of the Gentile and Jewish philosophers: there is a <i>fulness</i> in Christ suited to the <i>empty,</i> <i>destitute</i> state of the human soul, but in the philosophy of the Jews and Gentiles nothing like this was found; nor indeed in the more refined and correct philosophy of the present day. No substitute has ever been found for the grace of the Lord Jesus, and those who have sought for one have disquieted themselves in vain.</p>
<p>By the <i>Godhead</i> or <i>Deity</i>, Θεοτης, we are to understand the <i>state or being of the Divine nature</i>; and by the <i>fulness</i> of that <i>Deity</i>, the infinite attributes essential to such a nature.</p>
<p><i><b>Bodily.</b></i> — Συματικως signifies <i>truly, really</i>; in opposition to <i>typically, figuratively</i>. There was a <i>symbol</i> of the Divine presence in the Hebrew <i>tabernacle</i>, and in the Jewish <i>temple</i>; but in the <i>body</i> of CHRIST the <i>Deity</i>, with all its plenitude of attributes, dwelt <i>really</i> and <i>substantially</i>: for so the word σωματικως means; and so it was understood by the ancient Greek fathers, as is fully shown by SUICER, in his <i>Thesaurus</i>, under the word.</p>
<p>"The fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Christ '<i>bodily</i>,' as opposed to the Jewish <i>tabernacle</i>, or <i>temple; truly</i> and <i>really</i>, in opposition to <i>types</i> and <i>figures</i>; not only effectively, as God dwells in good men, but <i>substantially</i> or <i>personally</i>, by the strictest union, as the soul dwells in the body; so that God and man are one Christ."
