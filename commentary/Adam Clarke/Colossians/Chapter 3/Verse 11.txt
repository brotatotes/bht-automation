<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew</b></i> — In which new creation no inquiry is made what <i>nation</i> the persons belonged to, or from what <i>ancestry</i> they had sprung, whether in <i>Judea</i> or <i>Greece</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Circumcision nor uncircumcision</b></i> — Nor is their peculiar form of religion of any consideration, whether <i>circumcised</i> like the <i>Jews</i>, or <i>uncircumcised</i> like the <i>heathens</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Barbarian, Scythtian</b></i> — Nor whether of the more or less tractable of the nations of the world; for although <i>knowledge</i>, and the most refined and sublime knowledge, is the object to be attained, yet, under the teaching and influence of the blessed Spirit, the most dull and least informed are perfectly capable of comprehending this Divine science, and becoming wise unto salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Bond</b></i><b> nor </b><i><b>free</b></i> — Nor does the particular <i>state</i> or <i>circumstances</i> in which a man may be found, either help him to or exclude him from the benefit of this religion; the <i>slave</i> having as good a title to <i>salvation by grace</i> as the <i>freeman</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But Christ</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>all, and in all.</b></i> — All <i>mankind</i> are his creatures, all <i>conditions</i> are disposed and regulated by his providence, and all <i>human</i> beings are equally purchased by his blood. He alone is the source whence all have proceeded, and to him alone all must return. He is the Maker, Preserver, Saviour, and Judge of all men.</p>
