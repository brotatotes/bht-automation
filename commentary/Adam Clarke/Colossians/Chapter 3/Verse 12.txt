<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Put on - as the elect of God</b></i> — As the principal design of the apostle was to show that God had <i>chosen the Gentiles</i>, and <i>called</i> them to the same privileges as the Jews, and intended to make them as truly his people as the Jews ever were, he calls them the <i>elect</i> or <i>chosen</i> of God; and as the Jews, who were formerly the <i>elect</i>, were still <i>beloved</i>, and called to be <i>holy</i>, so he calls the Colossians <i>beloved</i>, and shows them that <i>they</i> are called with the same <i>holy calling</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Bowels of mercies</b></i>, c.] Be merciful, not in <i>act</i> merely, but in <i>spirit</i> and <i>affection</i>. In all cases of this kind let your <i>heart</i> dictate to your <i>hand</i> be <i>clothed</i> with <i>bowels of mercy</i>-let your tenderest feelings come in contact with the miseries of the distressed as soon as ever they present themselves. Though I know that to <i>put on</i>, and to be <i>clothed with</i>, are figurative expressions, and mean to <i>assume</i> such and such characters and <i>qualities</i>; yet there may be a higher meaning here. The apostle would have them to <i>feel</i> the <i>slightest touch</i> of another's misery; and, as their clothes are put over their body, so their tenderest feeling should be always within the reach of the miserable. Let your feelings be at hand, and feel and commiserate as soon as touched. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>. Instead of οικτιρμον <i>mercies</i>, in the <i>plural</i>, almost every MS. of importance, with many of the fathers, read οικτιρμου, bowels of <i>mercy</i>, in the <i>singular</i>. This various reading makes scarcely any alteration in the sense.</p>
