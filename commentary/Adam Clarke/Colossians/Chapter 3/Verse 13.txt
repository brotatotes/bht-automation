Verse 13. Forbearing one another — Avoid all occasions of irritating or provoking each other.Forgiving one another — If ye receive offence, be instantly ready to forgive on the first acknowledgment of the fault.Even as Christ forgave you — Who required no satisfaction, and sought for nothing in you but the broken, contrite heart, and freely forgave you as soon as you returned to Him. No man should for a moment harbour ill will in his heart to any; but the offended party is not called actually to forgive, till the offender, with sorrow, acknowledges his fault. He should be ready to forgive, and while he is so, he can neither feel hatred nor malice towards the offender; but, as Christ does not forgive us till with penitent hearts we return unto him, acknowledging our offences, so those who have trespassed against their neighbour are not to expect any act of forgiveness from the person they have injured, till they acknowledge the offence. Forgive, says the apostle, καθως και ο χριστος even as Christ forgave you-show the same disposition and the same readiness to forgive your offending brethren, as Christ showed towards you.
