<p>Verse 14. <i><b>And above all these things</b></i> — επι πασι δε τουτοις. <i>Upon all, over all</i>; as the <i>outer garment</i> envelopes all the clothing, so let <i>charity</i> or <i>love</i> invest and encompass all the rest. Even <i>bowels of mercy</i> are to be set in motion by <i>love</i>; from love they derive all their <i>feeling</i>, and all their <i>power</i> and <i>promptitude</i> to action. Let this, therefore, be as the <i>upper garment</i>; the <i>surtout</i> that invests the whole man.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is the bond of perfectness.</b></i> — Love to God and man is not only to <i>cover</i> all, but also to <i>unite</i> and <i>consolidate</i> the whole. It is therefore represented here under the notion of a <i>girdle</i>, by which all the rest of the clothing is <i>bound</i> close about the body. To love God with all the heart, soul, mind, and strength, and one's neighbour as one's self, is the <i>perfection</i> which the new covenant requires, and which the grace and Spirit of Christ work in every sincerely obedient, humble believer; and that very love, which is the fulfilling of the law and the <i>perfection</i> itself which the Gospel requires, is also the <i>bond</i> of that <i>perfection</i>. It is by love to God and man that love is to be preserved. <i>Love begets</i> <i>love</i>; and the more a man loves God and his neighbour, the more he is enabled to do so. Love, while properly exercised, is ever <i>increasing</i> and <i>reproducing</i> itself.</p>
<p>Instead of τελειοτητος, <i>perfection</i>, several reputable MSS., with the <i>Itala</i>, read ενοτητος, <i>unity</i>; but the former is doubtless the genuine reading.</p>
