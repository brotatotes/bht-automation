<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And let the peace of God</b></i> — Instead of θεου, <i>God</i>, ξριστου, <i>Christ</i>, is the reading of ABC*D*FG, several others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Arabic</i> of Erpen, <i>Coptic, AEthopic, Armenian,</i> <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, with several of the <i>fathers</i>; on this evidence <i>Griesbach</i> has inserted it in the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Rule in your hearts</b></i> — βραβευετω. Let the peace of Christ <i>judge,</i> <i>decide</i>, and <i>govern</i> in your hearts, as the <i>brabeus</i>, or judge, does in the Olympic contests. No heart is right with God where the <i>peace of Christ</i> does not rule; and the continual prevalence of the peace of Christ is the decisive proof that the heart <i>is</i> right with God. When a man loses his <i>peace</i>, it is an awful proof that he has lost something else; that he has given way to evil, and grieved the Spirit of God. While peace rules, all is safe.</p>
<p><i><b>In one body</b></i> — Ye cannot have peace with God, in yourselves, nor among each other, unless ye continue in <i>unity</i>; and, as <i>one body</i>, continue in <i>connection</i> and <i>dependence</i> on him who is your only <i>head</i>: to this <i>ye are called</i>; it is a glorious state of salvation, and ye should be for ever <i>thankful</i> that ye are thus privileged.</p>
