<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly</b></i> — I believe the apostle means that the Colossians should be <i>well</i> <i>instructed in the doctrine of Christ</i>; that it should be their constant study; that it should be frequently preached, explained, and enforced among them; and that <i>all</i> the <i>wisdom</i> comprised in it should be well understood. Thus the doctrine of God would dwell richly, that is, abundantly, among them. But there appears to be here an allusion to the <i>Shechinah</i>, or symbol of the Divine presence, which <i>dwelt</i> in the <i>tabernacle</i> and first <i>temple</i>; and to an opinion common among the Jews, which is thus expressed in <i>Melchita</i>, fol. 38, 4: כל מקום שהתורה שם שבינה שם עמה; <i>In whatever</i> <i>place the</i> LAW <i>is, there the</i> SHECHINAH <i>is present with it</i>. Nor is this a vain supposition; wherever God's word is seriously read, heard, or preached, <i>there</i> is God himself; and in that Church or religious society where the truth of God is proclaimed and conscientiously believed, there is the <i>constant dwelling of God</i>. Through bad <i>pointing</i> this verse is not very intelligible; the several members of it should be distinguished thus: <i>Let the</i> <i>doctrine of Christ dwell richly among you; teaching and</i> <i>admonishing each other in all wisdom; singing with grace in your</i> <i>hearts unto the Lord, in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs</i>. This arrangement the original will not only bear, but it absolutely requires it, and is not sense without it. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>singing</i> which is here recommended is widely different from what is commonly used in most Christian congregations; a congeries of <i>unmeaning</i> sounds, associated to bundles of nonsensical, and often ridiculous, <i>repetitions</i>, which at once both deprave and disgrace the Church of Christ. <i>Melody</i>, which is allowed to be the most proper for devotional music, is now sacrificed to an exuberant <i>harmony</i>, which requires, not only many <i>different kinds</i> of <i>voices</i>, but <i>different musical instruments</i> to support it. And by these preposterous means the <i>simplicity</i> of the Christian worship is destroyed, and all <i>edification</i> totally prevented. And this kind of singing is amply proved to be very injurious to the personal piety of those employed in it; even of those who enter with a considerable share of humility and Christian meekness, how few continue <i>to sing with</i> GRACE <i>in their</i> <i>hearts unto the Lord</i>?</p>
