<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Whatsoever ye do in word or deed</b></i> — Let your words be right, and your actions upright.</p>
<p><i><b>Do all in the name of the Lord Jesus</b></i> — Begin with him, and end with him; invoke his name, and pray for his direction and support, in all that ye do; and thus every work will be crowned with all requisite success. Doing every thing in the name of God, and referring every thing to his glory, is as rational as it is pious. Could it be ever supposed that any person would begin a <i>bad</i> work in God's name? However, it is so. No people in the universe more strictly adhere to the <i>letter</i> of this advice than the <i>Mohammedans</i>; for they never undertake a work, eat meat, nor write a book, without prefacing all with:- </p>
<p><i><b>Giving thanks to God</b></i> — Even <i>praises</i>, as well as <i>prayers</i>, must ascend to God through this <i>Mediator</i>. We have no authority to say that God will accept even our <i>thanksgiving</i>, unless it ascend to him through Christ Jesus.</p>
