<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Wives, submit yourselves</b></i> — Having done with <i>general</i> directions, the apostle comes to <i>particular</i> duties, which are commonly called <i>relative</i>; because they only belong to persons in certain <i>situations</i>; and are not incumbent on all. No <i>woman</i> has the duty of a <i>wife</i> to perform but she who is one, and no <i>man</i> has the duty of a <i>husband</i> to perform but he who is married.</p>
<p>The directions here to wives, husbands, children, parents, servants, and masters, are so exactly the same in substance with those in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22-33">Ephesians 5:22-33</span>(note); <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:1-9">Ephesians 6:1-9</span> (note), that there is no need to repeat what has been said on those passages; and to the notes there the reader is requested to refer.</p>
<p><i><b>As it is fit in the Lord.</b></i> — God commands it; and it is both <i>proper</i> and <i>decent</i>.</p>
