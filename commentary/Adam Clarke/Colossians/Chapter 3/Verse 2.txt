<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+3:2">Colossians 3:2</span>. <i><b>Set your affection on things above</b></i> — τα αςω φρονειτε. Love <i>heavenly things; study</i> them; let your hearts be entirely <i>engrossed</i> by them. Now, that ye are converted to God, act in reference to heavenly things as ye did formerly in reference to those of earth; and <i>vice versa</i>. This is a very good general rule: "Be as much in earnest for heavenly and eternal things, as ye formerly were for those that are earthly and perishing."</p>
