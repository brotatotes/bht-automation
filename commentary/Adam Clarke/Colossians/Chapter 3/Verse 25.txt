<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+3:25">Colossians 3:25</span>. <i><b>But he that doeth wrong</b></i> — It is possible for an unfaithful servant to wrong and defraud his master in a great variety of ways without being detected; but let all such remember what is here said: He that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done; God sees him, and will punish him for his breach of honesty and trust. Wasting, or not taking proper care of the goods of your master, is such a <i>wrong</i> as God will resent. He that is unfaithful in that which is <i>little</i>, will be unfaithful in <i>much</i>, if he have opportunity; and God alone is the defence against an unfaithful servant.</p>
<p><i><b>There is no respect</b></i> — God neither <i>esteems</i> nor <i>despises</i> any man because of his <i>outward condition</i> and <i>circumstances</i>; for there is no respect of persons with him. Every man is, in the eye of God, what he is in his soul: if <i>holy</i>, loved; if <i>wicked</i>, despised and rejected.</p>
