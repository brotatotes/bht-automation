<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>. <i><b>For ye are dead</b></i> — To all hopes of happiness from the present world; and, according to your profession, should feel no more appetite for the things of this life, than he does whose soul is departed into the invisible state.</p>
<p><i><b>Your life is hid with Christ in God.</b></i> — Christ is your <i>treasure</i>; and where your treasure is, there is your heart. Christ lives in the bosom of the Father; as your heart is in him, ye also sit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. Christ is the <i>life</i> of your souls; and as <i>he</i> is hidden in the bosom of the Father, so are ye, who live through and in him.</p>
