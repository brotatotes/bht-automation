<p>Verse 5. <i><b>Mortify, therefore, you members</b></i> — νεκρωσατε. <i>Put them</i> <i>to death</i>: the verb is used metaphorically to signify, to <i>deprive a</i> <i>thing of its power</i>, to <i>destroy its strength</i>. Use no member of your body to sin against God; keep all under dominion; and never permit the <i>beast</i> to run away with the <i>man</i>. To <i>gratify</i> any sensual appetite is to give it the very food and nourishment by which it lives, thrives, and is active. However the body may suffer by excessive sensual indulgences, the <i>appetite</i> increases with the indulgence. Deny yourselves, and let reason rule; and the <i>animal</i> will not get the ascendency over the <i>rational man</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:11">Romans 6:11</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Inordinate affection</b></i> — παθος. <i>Unnatural</i> and degrading <i>passion</i> bestial lusts. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:27">Romans 1:27</span>; and the notes there.</p>
<p><i><b>Evil concupiscence</b></i> — επιθυμιαν κακην. As επιθυμια signifies <i>strong</i> and <i>vehement desire</i> of any kind, it is here joined with κακη, <i>evil</i>, to show the sense more particularly in which the apostle uses it.</p>
<p><i><b>Covetousness, which is idolatry</b></i> — For the covetous man makes his money his god. Now, it is the prerogative of God to confer happiness; every godly man seeks his happiness in God; the covetous man seeks that in his money which God alone can give; therefore his covetousness is properly <i>idolatry</i>. It is true his idol is of <i>gold</i> and <i>silver</i>, but his idolatry is not the less criminal on that account.</p>
