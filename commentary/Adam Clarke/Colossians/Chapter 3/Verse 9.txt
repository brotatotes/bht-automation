<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Lie not one to another</b></i> — Do not deceive each other; speak the truth in all your dealings; do not say, "My goods are so and so," when you know them to be otherwise; do not undervalue the goods of your neighbour, when your conscience tells you that you are not speaking the truth. <i>It is naught, it is naught, saith the</i> <i>buyer; but afterwards he boasteth</i>; i.e. he underrates his neighbour's property till he gets him persuaded to part with it for less than its worth; and when he has thus got it, he boasts what a good bargain he has made. Such a knave speaks not truth with his neighbour.</p>
