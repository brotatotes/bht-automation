Verse 9. Lie not one to another — Do not deceive each other; speak the truth in all your dealings; do not say, "My goods are so and so," when you know them to be otherwise; do not undervalue the goods of your neighbour, when your conscience tells you that you are not speaking the truth. It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer; but afterwards he boasteth; i.e. he underrates his neighbour's property till he gets him persuaded to part with it for less than its worth; and when he has thus got it, he boasts what a good bargain he has made. Such a knave speaks not truth with his neighbour.Ye have put off the old man — Romans 6:6; Romans 6:6; and particularly on Romans 13:11-14. Ye have received a religion widely different from that ye had before; act according to its principles.
