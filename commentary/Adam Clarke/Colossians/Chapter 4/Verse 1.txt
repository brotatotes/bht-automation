<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:1">Colossians 4:1</span>. <i><b>Masters, give unto your servants</b></i> — This verse should have been added to the preceding, to which it properly belongs; and this chapter should have begun with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:2">Colossians 4:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That which is just and equal</b></i> — As they are <i>bondmen</i> or <i>slaves</i> of whom the apostle speaks, we may at once see with what propriety this exhortation is given. The condition of <i>slaves</i> among the Greeks and Romans was wretched in the extreme; they could appeal to no law; and they could neither expect justice nor equity. The apostle, therefore, informs the proprietors of these slaves that they should act towards them both according to <i>justice</i> and <i>equity</i>; for God, their Master, required this of them, and would at last call them to account for their conduct in this respect. Justice and equity required that they should have proper food, proper raiment, due rest, and no more than moderate work. This is a lesson that all masters throughout the universe should carefully learn. Do not treat your servants as if God had made them of an inferior blood to yours.</p>
