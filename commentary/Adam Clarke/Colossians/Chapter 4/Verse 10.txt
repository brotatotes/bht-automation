<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner</b></i> — Concerning Aristarchus, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>; and see the note on this latter place (<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span></span>. Aristarchus and Epaphras are mentioned as saluters in this epistle, and in that to Philemon written at the same time; but here he is said to be a <i>prisoner</i>, and Epaphras not. In that to Philemon, Epaphras is called a <i>prisoner</i>, and Aristarchus not. One of them is wrong, though it is uncertain which; unless both were prisoners. See <i>Wall's</i> Crit. Notes. As Aristarchus had been a zealous and affectionate adherent to St. Paul, and followed him in all his journeys, ministering to him in prison, and assisting him in preaching the Gospel in Rome, he might have been imprisoned on this account. We need not suppose that both he and Epaphras were imprisoned <i>at</i> the same time; <i>about</i> the same time they might be imprisoned, but it might be so ordered by the providence of God that when Aristarchus was imprisoned Epaphras was at liberty, and while Epaphras was in prison Aristarchus was at liberty. This is a very possible and easily to be conceived case.</p>
<p><i><b>Marcus</b></i> — See the account of this person, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span>. Though there had been some difference between the apostle and this <i>Mark</i>, yet from this, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>, we find that they were fully reconciled, and that Mark was very useful to St. Paul in the work of the ministry.</p>
<p><i><b>Touching whom ye received commandments</b></i> — What these were we cannot tell; it was some private communication which had been previously sent to the Colossian Church.</p>
