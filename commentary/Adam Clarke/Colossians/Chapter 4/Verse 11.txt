<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Jesus, which is called Justus</b></i> — Jesus, Joshua, or Jehoshua, was his name among his countrymen the Jews; <i>Justus</i> was the name which he bore among the Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p><i><b>These only</b></i> — That is, only Aristarchuss Marcus, and Jesus Justus, who were formerly Jews or proselytes; for οι οντες εκ περιτομης, <i>they were of the circumcision</i>, and assisted the apostle in preaching the Gospel. There were others who did preach Christianity, but they did it from envy and strife, in order to add affliction to the apostle's bonds. It is evident, therefore, that St. Peter was not now at Rome, else he certainly would have been mentioned in this list; for we cannot suppose that he was in the list of those who preached Christ in an exceptionable way, and from impure and unholy motives: indeed, there is no evidence that St. Peter ever saw Rome. And as it cannot be <i>proved</i> that he ever was bishop or pope of that city, the <i>keystone</i> of the triumphal arch of the pope of Rome is pulled out; this building, therefore, of his <i>supremacy</i>, cannot stand.</p>
