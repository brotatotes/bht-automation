<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Epaphras, who is</b></i><b> one </b><i><b>of you</b></i> — A native of some part of Phrygia, and probably of Colosse itself.</p>
<p><i><b>A servant of Christ</b></i> — A minister of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Labouring fervently for you</b></i> — αγωνιζομενος. <i>Agonizing</i>; very properly expressed by our translators, <i>labouring fervently</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye may stand perfect and complete</b></i> — ινα στητε τελειοι και πεπληρμενοι. That ye may stand firm, perfectly instructed, and fully persuaded of the truth of those doctrines which have been taught you as the revealed will of God: this I believe to be the meaning of the apostle.</p>
<p>Instead of πεπληρωμενοι, <i>complete</i> or <i>filled up</i>, almost all the MSS. of the Alexandrian rescension, which are considered the most authentic and correct, have πεπληροφορημενοι, <i>that ye may be fully</i> <i>persuaded</i>. The word πληροφορια signifies such a complete persuasion of the certainty of a thing, as leaves the mind which has it neither room nor inclination to doubt; and πληροφορεω, the verb, has the same meaning, viz., to be thus persuaded, or to persuade thus, by demonstrative argumentation and exhibition of unquestionable facts.</p>
<p>This is such a persuasion as the Spirit of God, by means of the Gospel, gives to every sincere and faithful man; and from which arises the solid happiness of the genuine Christian. They who argue against it, prove, at least, that they have not got it.</p>
