<p>Verse 13. <i><b>He hath a great zeal for you</b></i> — Instead of ζηλον πολυν, much zeal, ABCD**, several others, with <i>versions</i> and <i>fathers</i>, read πολυν πονον, <i>much labour</i>; they are here nearly of the same meaning, though the latter appears to be the better and genuine reading.</p>
<p><i><b>Laodicea, and-Hierapolis</b></i> — These were both cities of Phrygia, between which Colosse, or the city of <i>Colassa</i>, was situated. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>. The latter was called <i>Hierapolis</i>, or the <i>holy city</i>, from the multitude of its temples. Apollo, Diana, AEsculapius, and Hygeia, were all worshipped here, as appears by the coins of this city still extant.</p>
