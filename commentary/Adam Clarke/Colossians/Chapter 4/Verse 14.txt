<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Luke, the beloved physician</b></i> — This is generally supposed to be the same with Luke the evangelist. See the preface to the notes on this gospel. Some, however, suppose them to be different persons; because, where it is evident that Luke the evangelist is meant, he never has more than his simple name Luke; and because the apostle is supposed to intend a different person here, he adds, ο ιατρος ο αγαπητος, the beloved physician. The word ιατρος signifies a <i>healer</i>, and must not be restricted to <i>physician</i>, in the sense in which we use that word; he was surgeon, physician, and dispenser of medicines, &amp;c., for all these were frequently combined in the same person.</p>
