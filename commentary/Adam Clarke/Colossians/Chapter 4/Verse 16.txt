<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Cause that it be read also in the Church of the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Laodiceans</b></i> — That is: Let a copy be taken, and sent to them, that it may be read there also. This appears to have been a regular custom in the apostolic Church.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye likewise read the</b></i><b> epistle </b><i><b>from Laodicea</b></i> — Some suppose that this was an epistle sent from Laodicea to the apostle, which he now sent by Aristarchus to the Colossians, that they might peruse it; that thereby they might see the propriety of sending a copy of his epistle to them, to the Laodicean Church. Many eminent critics are of this opinion, which appears to me to be both forced and far fetched. Others think that the Epistle to the Ephesians is the epistle in question, and that it was originally directed to them, and not to the Ephesians. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span>, c. But others, equally learned, think that there was an epistle, different from that to the Ephesians, sent by St. Paul to the Laodiceans, which is now lost. There was an epistle under this direction in the times of Theodoret and Jerome, for both of them mention it but the latter mentions it as apocryphal, <i>Legunt</i> <i>quidam et ad Laodicenses Epistolam, sed ab omnibus exploditur</i>; "Some read an Epistle to the Laodiceans, but it is exploded by all." The seventh OEcumenic council, held in 787, states that the ancients allowed that there was an epistle with this direction, but that all the orthodox rejected it as supposititious.</p>
<p>An epistle <i>ad Laodicenses</i> is still extant in the Latin language, a very ancient copy of which is in the library <i>Sancti Albani</i> <i>Andegavensis</i>, St. Alban's of Anjou. Hutter has translated it into Greek, but his translation is of no authority. Calmet has published this epistle, with various readings from the above MS. I shall subjoin it at the end of this epistle, and give my opinion relative to its use and authenticity. A copy of this epistle stands in this place as a portion of Divine revelation in one of my own MSS. of the Vulgate.</p>
