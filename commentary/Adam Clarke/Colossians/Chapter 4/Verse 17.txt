<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Say to Archippus</b></i> â€” Who this person was we cannot tell; there have been various conjectures concerning him; some think he was bishop, or overseer of the Church at Colosse, in the absence of Epaphras. Whatever he was, it has been supposed that he had been remiss in discharging the duties of his office; and hence this direction of the apostle, which appears here in the light of a <i>reprehension</i>. But if the same person be meant as in the Epistle to Philemon, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span>, whom St. Paul calls his <i>fellow labourer</i> and <i>fellow soldier</i>, it cannot be supposed that any reproof is here intended; for, as the Epistle to the Colossians, and that to Philemon, were evidently written about the end of the year 62, Archippus could not be a fellow labourer and fellow soldier of the apostle at Rome, and yet a delinquent at Colosse at the same time. It is more likely, therefore, that the words of the apostle convey no censure, but are rather intended to stir him up to farther diligence, and to encourage him in the work, seeing he had so much false doctrine and so many false teachers to contend with.</p>
