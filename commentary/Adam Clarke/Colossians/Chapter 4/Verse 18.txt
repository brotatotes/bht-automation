<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>. <i><b>The salutation by the hand of me Paul.</b></i> — The preceding part of the epistle was written by a scribe, from the mouth of the apostle: this, and what follows, was written by the hand of St. Paul himself. A similar distinction we find, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>; and this, it seems, was the means by which the apostle authenticated every epistle which he sent to the different Churches. <i>The salutation of Paul with mine own</i> <i>hand, which is the token in every epistle, so I write</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Remember my bonds</b></i> — See what proof ye have of the truth of the Gospel; I am in bonds on this account; I suffer patiently, yea, exult in the Lord Jesus, so perfectly am I upheld by the grace of the Gospel. Remember my bonds, and take courage. How eloquent were these concluding words! That such a man should be in bonds for the Gospel, was the fullest proof of the truth of the Gospel. A cunningly devised fable could not have imposed on Saul of Tarsus; he was fully satisfied of the truth of the doctrines of Christianity; he proclaimed them as truths from heaven; and for their sake cheerfully suffered the loss of all things. The bonds of such a man are a plenary proof of the truth of the doctrines for which he was bound.</p>
<p><i><b>Grace be with you.</b></i> — May you still possess the favour and blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ: the apostle ends, as he began, this epistle. Without the grace of Christ they could not have <i>become</i> a Church; without this grace they could not <i>continue</i> to be one.</p>
<p><i><b>Amen</b></i> — This is omitted by the most ancient and correct MSS.</p>
<p>The subscriptions, as usual, are various and uncertain: - </p>
<p>The common GREEK <i>text</i> has, <i>To the Colossians, written from Rome</i> <i>by Tychicus and Onesimus</i>.</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Colossians; written at Rome, and sent by the hand of Tychicus. SYRIAC.</p>
<p><i>To the Colossians</i>. AETHIOPIC.</p>
<p>In the <i>Vulgate</i> there is no subscription.</p>
<p>The end of the epistle; and it was written from Rome, and sent by the hand of Tychicus and Onesimus. Praise be to God for ever and ever; and may his mercy be upon us. Amen. ARABIC.</p>
<p>Written from Athens by Tychicus, and Onesimus, and Mark, his disciples. COPTIC.</p>
<p>The MSS. are not less various than the <i>versions</i>:</p>
<p><i>To the Colossians. - That to the Colossians is completed; that to</i> <i>the Philippians begins. - That to the Colossians is finished; the</i> <i>First Epistle to the Thessalonians begins. - To the Colossians, from</i> <i>Rome. - Written to the Colossians from Rome. - Written from Rome by</i> <i>Tychicus, and Timotheus, and Onesimus. - Written by Paul and</i> <i>Timothy, and sent by Tychicus, and Onesimus</i>.</p>
<p>That the epistle was written from <i>Rome</i> there is little cause to doubt: that Timothy might be the <i>scribe</i> is very probable, because it appears he was at Rome with the apostle in the same year in which this epistle was written. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19">Philippians 2:19</span>. And that it was sent by <i>Tychicus</i> and <i>Onesimus</i>, seems evident from the 8th and 9th verses of this chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:8">Colossians 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:9">Colossians 4:9</span></p>
<p>The common subscription has the consent of the greater number of the most recent and comparatively recent MSS., but this is not, in general, a proof of authenticity.</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>In the note on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span><i>"</i>, I promised to subjoin what is called the <i>Epistle to the Laodiceans</i>: I give it here from the best copies, and add a literal translation, that the curious, whether learned or unlearned, may have what some have believed to be authentic, and what has doubtless existed, in one form or other, from a very remote antiquity. </p>
<p>As to its being a work of St. Paul, little or nothing need be said; its barrenness of meaning, poverty of style, incoherency of manner, and total want of design and object, are a sufficient refutation of its pretensions. It is said to be the work of some <i>heretics</i> of ancient times: this is very unlikely, as there is no heresy, ever broached in the Christian Church, that could derive any support from any thing found in this epistle. It is a congeries of <i>scraps</i>, very injudiciously culled, here and there, from St. Paul's epistles; without arrangement, without connection, and, as they stand here, almost without sense. It is a poor, wretched tale, in no danger of ever being denominated even a <i>cunningly devised fable</i>. It should keep no company but that of the pretended <i>Epistles of Paul to Seneca</i>, to which I have in other cases referred, and of which I have given my opinion.</p>
<p>Should it be asked: "Why I have introduced it here?" I answer: To satisfy the curious reader, and to show how little ground there is for the opinion of some, that this epistle is of any importance; and to prove how miserably forgery itself succeeds when it endeavours to <i>add</i> to or <i>corrupt</i> the word of God. The sacred writings are of such a <i>peculiar character</i> that it is utterly impossible to <i>imitate</i> them with any kind of success. They bear, deeply impressed, the seal of infinite wisdom - a seal which no human art can counterfeit. This is the criterion by which the spurious gospels and apocryphal writings in general have been judged and detected; and this <i>heavenly stamp</i>, under the care of Divine Providence, will continue to be their chief preservative, as long as the sun and moon shall endure.</p>
