<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:2">Colossians 4:2</span>. <i><b>Continue in prayer</b></i> — This was the apostle's general advice to all; without this, neither wives, husbands, children, parents, servants, nor masters, could fulfil the duties which God, in their respective stations, required of them.</p>
<p>All might, power, and life come from God; his creatures are continually dependent upon him for all these: to earnest, persevering prayer, he has promised every supply; but he who prays not has no promise. How few <i>wives</i> feel it their duty to pray to God to give them grace to behave <i>as wives</i>! How few husbands pray for the grace suited to their situation, that they may be able to fulfill its duties! The like may be said of <i>children, parents,</i> <i>servants</i>, and <i>masters</i>. As every situation in life has its peculiar duties, trials, c. so to every situation there is peculiar grace appointed. No man can fulfil the duties of any station without the grace suited to that station. The grace suited to him, as a <i>member of society in general</i>, will not be sufficient for him as a husband, father, or master. Many proper marriages become unhappy in the end, because the parties have not earnestly besought God for the grace necessary for them as husbands and wives. This is the origin of family broils in general; and a proper attention to the apostle's advice would prevent them all.</p>
<p><i><b>Watch in the same</b></i> — Be always on your guard; and when you have got the requisite grace by praying, take care of it, and bring it into its proper action by watchfulness; by which you will know <i>when</i>, and <i>where</i>, and <i>how</i> to apply it.</p>
<p><i><b>With thanksgiving</b></i> — Being always grateful to God, who has called you into such a state of salvation, and affords you such abundant means and opportunities to glorify him.</p>
