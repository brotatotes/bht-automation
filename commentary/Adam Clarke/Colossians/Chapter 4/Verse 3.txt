<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:3">Colossians 4:3</span>. <i><b>Praying also for us</b></i> — Let the success and spread of the Gospel be ever dear to you; and neglect not to pray fervently to God that it may have free course, run, and be glorified.</p>
<p><i><b>A door of utterance</b></i> — θυραν του λογου. The word θυρα, which commonly signifies a <i>door</i>, or such like entrance into a house or passage through a wall, is often used metaphorically for an <i>entrance</i> to any business, <i>occasion</i> or <i>opportunity</i> to commence or perform any particular work. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:27">Acts 14:27</span>: <i>The</i> DOOR <i>of faith is opened to the Gentiles</i>; i.e. there is now an <i>opportunity</i> of preaching the Gospel to the nations of the earth. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>: <i>A great and effectual</i> DOOR <i>is opened unto me</i>; i.e. I have now a glorious <i>opportunity</i> of preaching the truth to the people of Ephesus. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>: <i>When I came to Troas-a</i> DOOR <i>was opened unto me</i>; I had a fine <i>opportunity</i> of preaching Christ crucified at that place. So, here, the θυρατου λογου, which we translate <i>door of utterance</i>, signifies an <i>occasion, opportunity</i>, or <i>entrance</i>, for the <i>doctrine</i> of the Gospel. The same metaphor is used by the best Latin writers. Cicero, xiii. Ep. 10: <i>Amiciliae</i> fores <i>aperiuntur; the</i> DOORS <i>of friendship are opened</i>-there is now an <i>opportunity</i> of reconciliation. And Ovid, Amor. Iib. iii., Eleg. xii. ver. 12:- </p>
<p><i><b>The mystery of Christ</b></i> — The Gospel, which had been <i>hidden</i> from all former times, and which revealed that purpose long hidden in the Divine councils, that the Gentiles should be called to enjoy the same privileges with the Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>For which I am also in bonds</b></i> — He was suffering under Jewish malice, and for preaching this very mystery; for they could not bear to hear announced, as from heaven, that the <i>Gentiles</i>, whom they considered eternally shut out from any participation of the Divine favour, should be made fellow heirs with them of the grace of life; much less could they bear to hear that <i>they</i> were about to be <i>reprobated</i>, and the Gentiles <i>elected</i> in their place. It was for asserting these things that they persecuted Paul at Jerusalem, so that to save his life he was obliged to appeal to Caesar; and being taken to Rome, he was detained a prisoner till his case was fully heard; and he was a prisoner at Rome on this very account when he wrote this Epistle to the Colossians. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>.</p>
