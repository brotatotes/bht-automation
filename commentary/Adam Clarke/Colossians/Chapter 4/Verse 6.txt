<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with</b></i><b> </b><i><b>salt</b></i> — Let it be such as has a tendency to oppose and preserve from the corruption of sin. The rabbins say: "He who, in prayer, omits any word, should begin again at the beginning; for he who does not is like boiled pottage, in which there is no salt." <i>Berachoth</i>, fol. 34, 1. Let all your conversation be such as may tend to exemplify and recommend Christianity; let it not only be <i>holy</i>, but wise, gracious, and intelligent. <i>A harsh method</i> of <i>proposing</i> or <i>defending</i> the doctrines of Christianity only serves to repel men from those doctrines, and from the way of salvation. <i>Salt</i>, from its use in preserving food from corruption, and rendering it both savoury and wholesome, has always been made the emblem of <i>wisdom</i>. The word has been also used to express in composition or conversation what is terse, comprehensive, useful, elegant, and impressive. The term <i>Attic salt</i> has been used to express some of the principal beauties of the Greek tongue; of such beauties the Gospel of Christ has an endless store. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13">Matthew 5:13</span>, and <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:50">Mark 9:50</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>How ye ought to answer every man.</b></i> — That your discourse may be so judiciously managed, that ye may discern how to treat the prejudices and meet the objections both of <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
