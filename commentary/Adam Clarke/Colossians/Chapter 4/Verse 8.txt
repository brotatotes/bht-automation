<p>Verse 8. <i><b>That he might know your estate</b></i> — Instead of ινα γνω τα περι υμων, <i>that</i> HE <i>may know</i> YOUR <i>affairs</i>, ABD*FG, many others, with the <i>AEthiopic, Itala, Theodoret</i>, and <i>Damascenus</i>, read ινα γνωτε τα περι ημων, that YE may know OUR affairs; which is probably the true reading. Tychicus was sent to them, not to know their affairs, but with Onesimus, to carry this epistle and make the apostle's state known to them, and comfort their hearts by the good news which he brought. The next verse confirms this meaning.</p>
