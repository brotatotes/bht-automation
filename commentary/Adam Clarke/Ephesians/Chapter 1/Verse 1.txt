<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span>. <i><b>To the saints which are at Ephesus</b></i> — As some learned men think that this epistle was written to the Church of the <i>Laodiceans</i>, and that the words εν εφεσω, <i>in Ephesus</i>, were not originally in this epistle, the consideration of the subject has appeared to be more proper for the <i>preface</i>; and to that the reader is referred for a particular discussion of this opinion. By the term <i>saints</i> we are to understand those who in that place <i>professed</i> Christianity, and were members of the Christian Church. <i>Saint</i> properly signifies a <i>holy person</i>, and such the Gospel of Christ requires every man to be, and such every true believer <i>is</i>, both in heart and life; but <i>saint</i> appears to have been as ordinary a denomination of a believer in Christ in those primitive times, as the term <i>Christian</i> is now. Yet many had the <i>name</i> who had not the <i>thing</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The faithful in Christ Jesus</b></i> — πιστοις. the <i>believers</i>-the persons who received Christ as the promised Messiah, and the Saviour of the world, and continued in the grace which they had received.</p>
