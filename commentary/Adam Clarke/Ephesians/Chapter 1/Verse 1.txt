Verse Ephesians 1:1. To the saints which are at Ephesus — As some learned men think that this epistle was written to the Church of the Laodiceans, and that the words εν εφεσω, in Ephesus, were not originally in this epistle, the consideration of the subject has appeared to be more proper for the preface; and to that the reader is referred for a particular discussion of this opinion. By the term saints we are to understand those who in that place professed Christianity, and were members of the Christian Church. Saint properly signifies a holy person, and such the Gospel of Christ requires every man to be, and such every true believer is, both in heart and life; but saint appears to have been as ordinary a denomination of a believer in Christ in those primitive times, as the term Christian is now. Yet many had the name who had not the thing.The faithful in Christ Jesus — πιστοις. the believers-the persons who received Christ as the promised Messiah, and the Saviour of the world, and continued in the grace which they had received.
