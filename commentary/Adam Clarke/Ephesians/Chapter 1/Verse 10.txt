<p>Verse 10. <i><b>In the dispensation of the fulness of times</b></i> — εις οικονομιαν του πληρωματος των καιρων. The word οικονομια, which is the same as our word <i>economy</i>, signifies, as Dr. Macknight has well observed, "the plan which the master of a family, or his steward, has established for the management of the family;" it signifies, also, a plan for the management of any sort of business: and here it means the dispensation of the Gospel, that <i>plan</i> by which God has provided salvation for a lost world; and according to which he intends to gather all believers, both Jews and Gentiles, into one Church under Jesus Christ, their head and governor. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:45">Matthew 24:45</span>, where the <i>word</i> and the <i>office</i> are particularly explained.</p>
<p><i>The fulness of times</i>-By this phrase we are to understand either the <i>Gospel dispensation</i>, which is the consummation of all preceding dispensations, and the last that shall be afforded to man; or that <i>advanced state</i> of the world which God saw to be the most proper for the full manifestation of those benevolent purposes which he had formed in himself relative to the salvation of the world by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>That he might gather together in one</b></i> — ανακεφαλαιωσασθαι, from ανα, <i>again</i>, and κεφαλαιοω, <i>to reduce to one sum; to add up; to</i> <i>bring different sums together</i>, and fractions of sums, so as to reduce them under one <i>denomination; to recapitulate</i> the <i>principal</i> <i>matters</i> contained in a <i>discourse</i>. Here it means the <i>gathering</i> <i>together</i> both Jews and Gentiles, who have believed in Christ, into one Church and flock. See the preceding note.</p>
<p><i><b>All things-which are in heaven, and which are on earth</b></i> — This clause is variously understood: some think, by <i>things in heaven</i> the <i>Jewish state</i> is meant and by <i>things on earth</i> the <i>Christian</i>. The Jews had been long considered a <i>Divine</i> or <i>heavenly people</i>; their doctrine, their government, their constitution, both civil and ecclesiastical, were all Divine or heavenly: as the <i>powers of</i> <i>the heavens</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:26">Luke 21:26</span>, mean the <i>Jewish rulers</i> in <i>Church and state</i>, it is very possible that <i>the things which are in heaven</i> mean this same state; and as the Gentiles were considered to have nothing <i>Divine</i> or <i>heavenly</i> among them, they may be here intended by the <i>earth</i>, out of the corruption of which they are to be gathered by the preaching of the Gospel. But there are others who imagine that the <i>things in</i> <i>heaven</i> mean the <i>angelical hosts</i>; and the <i>things on earth</i> believers of <i>all nations</i>, who shall all be joined together at last in one assembly to worship God throughout eternity. And some think that the <i>things in heaven</i> mean the <i>saints</i> who <i>died before</i> <i>Christ's advent</i>, and who are not to be made perfect till the resurrection, when the full power and efficacy of Christ shall be seen in raising the bodies of believers and uniting them with their holy souls, to reign in his presence for ever. And some think that, as the Hebrew phrase שמים והארץ <i>shamayim vehaarets</i>, the <i>heavens and the earth</i>, signifies <i>all creatures</i>, the words in the text are to be understood as signifying <i>all mankind</i>, without discrimination of peoples, kindreds, or tongues; Jews, Greeks, or barbarians. All that are saved of all nations, (being saved in the <i>same way</i>, viz. by <i>faith</i> in Christ Jesus, without any distinction of nation or previous condition,) and all gathered into <i>one Church</i> or <i>assembly</i>.</p>
<p>I believe that the forming one Church out of both Jews and Gentiles is that to which the apostle refers. This agrees with what is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14-17">Ephesians 2:14-17</span>.</p>
