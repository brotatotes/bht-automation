<p>Verse 11. <i><b>In whom</b></i> — Christ Jesus; <i>also we</i>-believing <i>Jews have</i> <i>obtained an inheritance</i>-what was promised to Abraham and his spiritual seed, viz. the <i>adoption of sons</i>, and the <i>kingdom of</i> <i>heaven</i>, signified by the privileges under the Mosaic dispensation, and the possession of the promised land, but all these privileges being forfeited by the rebellion and unbelief of the Jews, they are now about to be finally cut off, and the believing part to be re-elected, and put in possession of the blessings promised to Abraham and his spiritual seed, by faith; for without a re-election, they cannot get possession of these spiritual privileges.</p>
<p><i><b>Being predestinated</b></i> — God having determined to bring both Jews and Gentiles to salvation, not by <i>works</i>, nor by any human <i>means</i> or <i>schemes</i>, but by Jesus Christ; that salvation being <i>defined</i> and <i>determined before</i> in the Divine mind, and the means by which it should be brought about all being according to his purpose, who consults not his creatures, but operates according to the <i>counsel</i> <i>of his own will</i>, that being ever wise, gracious, and good.</p>
<p>The original reference is still kept up here in the word προορισθεντες, <i>being predestinated</i>, as in the word προορισας <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>. And as the apostle speaks of <i>obtaining the inheritance</i>, he most evidently refers to that of which the <i>promised land</i> was the <i>type</i> and <i>pledge</i>. And as that land was <i>assigned</i> to the Israelites by <i>limit</i> and <i>lot</i>, both of which were <i>appointed</i> by God so the salvation now sent to the Gentiles was as expressly <i>their lot</i> or <i>portion</i>, as the <i>promised land</i> was <i>that</i> of the people of Israel. All this shows that the Israelites were a <i>typical people</i>; their <i>land</i>, the <i>manner</i> of possessing it, their <i>civil and religious code,</i> c., c., all typical and that <i>in, by</i>, and <i>through</i> them, God had <i>fore-determined, fore-described</i>, and <i>fore-ascertained</i> a greater and more glorious people, among whom the deepest counsels of his wisdom should be manifested, and the most powerful works of his eternal mercy, grace, holiness, goodness, and truth, be fully exhibited. Thus there was nothing <i>fortuitous</i> in the Christian scheme all was the result of infinite counsel and design. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span></span>.</p>
