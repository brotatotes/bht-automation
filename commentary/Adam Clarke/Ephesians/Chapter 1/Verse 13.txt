<p>Verse 13. <i><b>In whom ye also trusted</b></i> — Ye Gentiles, having heard from us the <i>word</i>, τονλογον, the doctrine, <i>of the truth</i>, which is the <i>Gospel</i>, or glad tidings, <i>of your salvation</i>, have believed, as we Jews have done, and received similar blessings to those with which God has favoured us.</p>
<p><i>In whom also</i>, εν ω, <i>through whom</i>, Christ Jesus, <i>after that ye</i> <i>had believed</i>, viz. that he was the only Saviour, and that through his blood redemption might be obtained, <i>ye were sealed with that</i> <i>holy Spirit of promise</i>; that is, The Holy Spirit, which is promised to them who believe on Christ Jesus, was given to you, and thus you were <i>ascertained</i> to be the children of God, for God has no child who is not a partaker of the Holy Ghost, and he who has this Spirit has God's <i>seal</i> that he belongs to the heavenly family. It was customary among all nations, when a person purchased goods of any kind, to mark with his seal that which he had bought, in order that he might know it, and be able to claim it if mixed with the goods of others; to this custom the apostle may here allude but it was also customary to set a <i>seal</i> upon what was <i>dedicated to God</i>, or what was to be <i>offered to him in</i> <i>sacrifice</i>. See this proved in the note on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27">John 6:27</span><i>"</i>. The Jews themselves speak of the <i>seal of God</i>, which they term <i>emeth</i>, truth, and which they consider as a representation of the unoriginated and endless perfections of God. As the apostle is here speaking of the <i>doctrine of truth</i>, which came by the Holy Spirit, and is <i>sealed</i> on the souls of believers by this Spirit, he may have in view the Jewish notion, which is at once both correct and elevated. This <i>Spirit of truth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:17">John 14:17</span>, <i>who leads into all truth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span>, and <i>teaches all things</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>, makes the impression of his own eternal purity and truth in the souls of them who believe, and thus they bear the <i>seal</i> of God Almighty. And they who in the day of judgment are found to bear this <i>seal</i>-TRUTH; <i>truth</i> in the inward parts, having <i>truly</i> repented, <i>truly</i> believed, and having been in consequence <i>truly</i> justified, and <i>truly</i> sanctified; and having walked in <i>truth</i> and <i>sincerity</i> towards God and man; these are <i>sealed</i> to the day of redemption; for, having this <i>seal</i>, they are seen to have a right to eternal life.</p>
