<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Which is the earnest of our inheritance</b></i> — This Holy Spirit, sealing the soul with truth and righteousness, is the <i>earnest, foretaste</i>, and <i>pledge</i> of the heavenly inheritance. And he who can produce this <i>earnest</i> - this <i>witness of the Spirit</i>, in the day of judgment, shall have an abundant entrance into the holiest. On the αρραβων, or <i>earnest</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:13">Genesis 38:13</span>, c., and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The redemption of the purchased possession</b></i> — That is, till the time when body and soul are redeemed from all their miseries, and glorified in the kingdom on heaven.</p>
<p><i>The redemption of the purchased possession</i> - απολυτρωσις της περιποιησεως is variously understood and indeed the original is variously translated. Dr. <i>Whitby</i> has observed that the verb πεειποιεις signifies to <i>save alive</i>; and he refers the περιποιησις, here, to the redemption of the body from corruption, and to its final glorification with the soul.</p>
<p>All those who believe in Christ Jesus are considered as his peculiar people and property, and to them eternal glory is promised. The Spirit of promise, which is given them, is a pledge that they shall have a resurrection from the dead, and eternal blessedness; the <i>redemption</i>, or bringing to life of the body, cannot take place till the day of judgment, but the Holy Spirit promises this redemption, and is now in their hearts an <i>earnest</i> or <i>pledge</i> of this complete restoration at the great day, which will then be, in an especial manner, <i>to the praise of his glory</i>, viz. of Christ, who has bought them by his blood.</p>
