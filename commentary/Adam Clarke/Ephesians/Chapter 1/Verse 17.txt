<p>Verse 17. <i><b>That the God of our Lord Jesus</b></i> — Jesus Christ, as <i>man</i> and <i>mediator</i>, has the <i>Father</i> for his God and Father: and it is in reference to this that he himself says: <i>I ascend unto my Father</i> <i>and your Father, and to my God and your God</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Father of glory</b></i> — The <i>author</i> and giver of that glory which you expect at the end of your Christian race. This may be a Hebraism for <i>glorious Father</i>, but the former appears to be the best sense.</p>
<p><i><b>The Spirit of wisdom and revelation</b></i> — I pray that God may give you his Holy Spirit, by whom his will is <i>revealed</i> to men, that he may <i>teach</i> and make you <i>wise</i> unto salvation, that you may continue to <i>acknowledge</i> him, Christ Jesus, as your only Lord and Saviour.</p>
