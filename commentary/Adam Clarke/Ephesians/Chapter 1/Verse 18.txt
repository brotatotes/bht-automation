<p>Verse 18. <i><b>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened</b></i> — The <i>understanding</i> is that <i>power</i> or <i>faculty</i> in the soul by which <i>knowledge</i> or <i>information</i> is <i>received</i>, and the recipient power is here termed the EYES of the understanding; and we learn from this that ὁπερ ὁ οφθαλμος εν τῳ σωματι, τουτο ὁ νους εν τῃ ψυχη, as <i>Philo</i> expresses it: <i>What the eye</i> is to the <i>body</i>, the <i>understanding</i> is to the <i>soul</i>; and that as the eye is not light in itself, and can discern nothing but by the means of <i>light</i> shining, not only on the objects to be viewed, but into the eye itself; so the understanding of man can discern no sacred thing of or by itself, but sees by the influence of the Spirit of wisdom and revelation; for without the influence of God's <i>Holy Spirit</i> no man ever became wise unto salvation, no more than a man ever discerned an <i>object</i>, (no matter how perfect soever his eye might have been,) without the instrumentality of <i>light</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of της διανοιας, <i>of</i> your <i>understanding</i>, της καρδιας, <i>of</i> your <i>heart</i>, is the reading of ABDEFG, and several others; also both the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic</i>, the <i>AEthiopic, Armenian, Sahidic, Slavonian, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, besides several of the <i>fathers</i>. <i>The eyes of your</i> HEART is undoubtedly the true reading.</p>
<p><i><b>The hope of his calling</b></i> — That you may clearly discern the glorious and important <i>objects</i> of your <i>hope</i>, to the enjoyment of which God has <i>called</i> or <i>invited</i> you.</p>
<p><i><b>The riches of the glory of his inheritance</b></i> — That you may understand what is the <i>glorious abundance</i> of the spiritual things to which you are entitled, in consequence of being made children of God; for if <i>children</i>, then <i>heirs</i>, heirs of that glorious inheritance which God has provided for the <i>saints</i>-for all genuine Christians, whether formerly <i>Jews</i> or <i>Gentiles</i>.
