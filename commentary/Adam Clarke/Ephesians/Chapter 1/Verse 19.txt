<p>Verse 19. <i><b>The exceeding greatness of his power</b></i> — As the apostle is here speaking of the glorious state of believers after death, <i>the exceeding greatness of his power</i>, or that power which surpasses all difficulties, being itself omnipotent, is to be understood of that <i>might</i> which is to be exerted in raising the body at the last day; as it will require the same power or energy which he wrought in Christ, when he raised <i>his</i> body from the grave, to raise up the bodies of all mankind; the resurrection of the human nature of Christ being a proof of the resurrection of mankind in general.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the working of his mighty power</b></i> — Κατα την ενεργειαν του κρατους της ισχυος αυτου· <i>According to the energy</i> <i>of the power of his might</i>. We may understand these words thus: MIGHT, ισχυς, is the <i>state</i> or simple <i>efficiency</i> of this attribute in God; POWER, κρατος, is this <i>might</i> or <i>efficiency</i> in <i>action</i>; ENERGY, ενεργεια, is the quantum of <i>force, momentum</i>, or <i>velocity</i>, with which the power is <i>applied</i>. Though they appear to be synonymous terms they may be thus understood: <i>passive power</i> is widely different from <i>power</i> in <i>action</i>; and power in action will be in its results according to the <i>energy</i> or <i>momentum</i> with which it is applied. The resurrection of the dead is a stupendous work of God; it requires his <i>might</i> in sovereign action; and when we consider that all mankind are to be raised and changed in a <i>moment</i>, in the <i>twinkling of an eye</i>, then the <i>momentum</i>, or <i>velocity</i>, with which the power is to be applied must be inconceivably great. All motion is in proportion to the <i>quantity</i> <i>of matter</i> in the <i>mover</i>, and the <i>velocity</i> with which it is applied. The <i>effect</i> here is in proportion to the <i>cause</i> and the <i>energy</i> he puts forth in order to produce it. But such is the nature of God's power in action, that it is perfectly inconceivable to us; and even these astonishingly <i>strong</i> words of the apostle are to be understood as used in condescension to human <i>weakness</i>.</p>
