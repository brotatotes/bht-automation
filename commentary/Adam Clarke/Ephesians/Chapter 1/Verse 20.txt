Verse 20. Set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places â€” Gave him, as mediator between God and man, the highest honours and dignities, Philippians 2:9; in which state of exaltation he transacts all the affairs of his Church, and rules the universe. The right hand is the place of friendship, honour, confidence, and authority.
