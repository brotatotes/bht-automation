<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Far above all principality</b></i> — The difficulty in this verse does not arise from the <i>words</i> themselves, the meaning of each being easily understood, but from the <i>sense</i> in which the apostle uses them. Some think he has reference here to the different orders among good and evil angels; he is superior to all the <i>former</i>, and rules all the <i>latter</i>. Others think he refers to <i>earthly governments</i>; and as απχη, <i>principality</i>, the first word, signifies the most sovereign and extensive kind of dominion; and κυριοτης, <i>lordship</i>, the last word, signifies the <i>lowest degree</i> of authority; hence we are to understand that to our Lord, in his human nature, are subjected the <i>highest</i>, the <i>intermediate</i>, and the <i>lowest</i> orders of beings in the universe.-<i>Chandler</i>. Others imagine that the apostle has in view, by whatsoever is <i>named in this</i> <i>world</i>, all the dignitaries of the <i>Jewish Church</i>; and by what is named <i>in the world to come</i>, all the dignities that should be found in the Christian Church.</p>
<p><i>Schoettgen</i> supposes that the "apostle's αρχη (for αρχοντες, the abstract for the concrete) means the same as the נשיאים <i>Nesiim</i> among the Jews, whose chief business it was to clear and decide all contentions which arose concerning traditions and legal controversies.</p>
<p>"That εξουσια, <i>power</i>, is the same as צורבא <i>tsorba</i>, he who possesses <i>authority</i> to propound, expound, persuade, convince, and refute.</p>
<p>"That δυναμις, <i>might</i>, answers to רבנות <i>rabbanoth</i>, signifying all the class of rabbins, whose office it was to expound the law, and teach the people generally.</p>
<p>"And that κυριοτης, <i>dominion</i>, answers to מר <i>mar</i>, which signifies a person above the lower orders of men. And he observes that Jesus Christ, after his resurrection, called fishermen, publicans, and men from the lowest orders of the people, to the work of the ministry; and made them instruments of confounding and overturning all the Jewish rulers, rabbins, and doctors. And that in <i>the world which is to come</i>-the successive ages of Christianity, he should ever be exalted above all those powers and authorities which Antichrist might bring into the Christian Church; such as popes, cardinals, wicked archbishops, bishops, deans, and canons; and all those who among the schoolmen were termed seraphic doctors, angelic doctors, most illuminated, most perfect, and irrefragable doctors. And although <i>Wiclif, Huss, Luther,</i> <i>Melancthon</i>, and the rest of the <i>reformers</i>, were men of little or no note when compared with the rulers of the popish Church, so eminently did the power of Christ work in and by them, that the pope and all his adjutants were every where confounded, and their power and authority annihilated in several entire regions."</p>
<p>It is certain that the apostle means that all created power, glory, and influence, are under Christ; and hence it is added:</p>
