Verse 22. And hath put all things under his feet â€” All beings and things are subject to him, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers, 1 Corinthians 1:16-18; 2 Corinthians 2:10; for he, God the Father, has given him to be head-chief, and supreme, over all, to the Church, the Church having no ruler but Jesus Christ; others may be officers in his Church, but he alone is head and supreme.
