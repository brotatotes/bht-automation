<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>. <i><b>Which is his body</b></i> — As he is <i>head over all</i> things, he is <i>head</i> to the <i>Church</i>; and this Church is considered as the <i>body</i> of which he is <i>especially</i> the head; and from him, as the head, the Church receives light, life, and intelligence.</p>
<p><i><b>And is the fulness of him</b></i> — That in which he especially manifests his power, goodness, and truth; for though he <i>fills</i> all the world with his presence, yet he fills all the members of his mystical body with wisdom, goodness, truth, and holiness, in an especial manner. Some understand the <i>fulness</i> or πληρωμα, here, as signifying the <i>thing to be filled</i>; so the Christian Church is to be filled by him, whose fulness fills all his members, with all spiritual gifts and graces. And this corresponds with what St. John says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>: <i>And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace</i>. And with what is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:9">2 Corinthians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>: <i>Ye are complete in him</i>; και εστε εν αυτῳ πεπληρωμενοι· <i>And ye are</i> <i>in him filled full</i>; i.e. with <i>gifts</i> and <i>grace</i>.</p>
<p>How, in any other sense, the Church can be said to be <i>the</i> <i>fulness of him who fills all in all</i>, is difficult to say. However, as Jesus Christ is represented to be the <i>head</i>, and the Church, the <i>body</i> under that head, the <i>individuals</i> being so many <i>members</i> in that <i>body</i>; and as it requires a <i>body</i> and <i>members</i> to make a <i>head</i> complete; so it requires a Church, or <i>general</i> <i>assembly</i> of believers, to make up the <i>body</i> of Christ. When, therefore, the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i> are brought into this Church, the <i>body</i> may be said to be complete; and thus Christ has his visible <i>fulness</i> upon earth, and the Church may be said to be the <i>fulness</i> <i>of him</i>, &amp;c. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>.</p>
