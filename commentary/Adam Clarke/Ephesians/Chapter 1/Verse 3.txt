<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>. <i><b>Blessed be the God</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:3">2 Corinthians 1:3</span>, where the same form is used.</p>
<p><i><b>With all spiritual blessings</b></i> — With the pure <i>doctrines</i> of the Gospel, and the <i>abundant gifts</i> and <i>graces</i> of the Holy Ghost, justifying, sanctifying, and building us up on our most holy faith.</p>
<p><i><b>In heavenly places</b></i> — εν τοις επουρανιοις. <i>In heavenly things</i>, such as those mentioned above; they were not yet in <i>heavenly</i> <i>places</i>, but they had abundance of <i>heavenly things</i> to prepare them for heavenly places. Some think the word should be understood as signifying <i>blessings</i> of the most <i>exalted</i> or <i>excellent</i> kind, such as are <i>spiritual</i> in opposition to those that are <i>earthly</i>, such as are <i>eternal</i> in opposition to those that are <i>temporal</i>; and all these <i>in, through</i> and <i>by</i> CHRIST. We have already seen, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>, that the <i>heavenly Jerusalem</i>, or <i>Jerusalem which is from above</i>, is used by the Jews to signify the days of the Messiah, and that state of grace and glory which should follow the Levitical worship and ceremonies; and it is possible that St. Paul may use the word επουρανια, <i>heavenly things</i>, in this sense: <i>God hath blessed us</i> <i>with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things</i>, or <i>in this</i> <i>heavenly state</i>, in which life and immortality are brought to light by the Gospel. This is apparently the preferable sense.</p>
