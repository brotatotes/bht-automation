<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>. <i><b>According as he hath chosen us in him</b></i> — As he has decreed from the beginning of the world, and has kept in view from the commencement of the <i>religious system of the Jews</i>, (which the phrase sometimes means,) to bring us Gentiles to the knowledge of this glorious state of salvation by Christ Jesus. The Jews considered themselves an <i>elect</i> or <i>chosen</i> people, and wished to monopolize the whole of the Divine love and beneficence. The apostle here shows that God had the Gentiles as much in the contemplation of his mercy and goodness as he had the Jews; and the blessings of the Gospel, now so freely dispensed to them, were the proof that God had <i>thus</i> chosen them, and that his end in giving them the Gospel was the same which he had in view by giving the law to the Jews, viz. that they might be holy and without blame before him. And as his object was the same in respect to them <i>both</i>, they should consider that, as he loved <i>them</i>, so they should love <i>one another</i>: God having provided for each the same blessings, they should therefore be αγιους, <i>holy</i>-fully <i>separated</i> from <i>earth</i> and <i>sin</i>, and consecrated to God and αμωμους, <i>without</i> <i>blame</i>-having no <i>spot</i> nor imperfection, their inward <i>holiness</i> agreeing with their outward <i>consecration</i>. The words are a metaphor taken from the <i>perfect</i> and <i>immaculate</i> sacrifices which the law required the people to bring to the altar of God. But as <i>love</i> is the <i>fulfilling of the law</i>, and <i>love</i> the <i>fountain</i> whence their salvation flowed, therefore <i>love</i> must fill their hearts towards God and each other, and <i>love</i> must be the <i>motive</i> and <i>end</i> of all their <i>words</i> and <i>works</i>.</p>
