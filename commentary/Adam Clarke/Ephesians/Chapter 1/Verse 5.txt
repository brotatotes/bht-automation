<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>. <i><b>Having predestinated us</b></i> — προορισας. As the doctrine of eternal <i>predestination</i> has produced much controversy in the Christian world, it may be necessary to examine the meaning of the term, that those who do use it may employ it according to the sense it has in the oracles of God. The verb προοπζω, from προ, <i>before</i>, and οριζω, I <i>define, finish, bound</i>, or <i>terminate</i>, whence ορος, <i>a boundary</i> or <i>limit</i>, signifies to <i>define</i> <i>beforehand</i>, and <i>circumscribe by certain bounds or limits</i>; and is originally a geographical term, but applied also to any thing concluded, or determined, or demonstrated. Here the word is used to point out God's fixed purpose or predetermination to bestow on the <i>Gentiles</i> the blessing of <i>the adoption of sons</i> by Jesus Christ, which adoption had been before granted to the <i>Jewish</i> people; and without <i>circumcision</i>, or any other Mosaic rite, to admit the Gentiles to all the privileges of his Church and people. And the apostle marks that all this was <i>fore-determined</i> by God, as he had fore-determined the bounds and precincts of the land which he gave them according to the promise made to their fathers; that the Jews had no reason to complain, for God had formed this purpose <i>before</i> he had given the <i>law</i>, or called them out of Egypt; (for it was <i>before</i> the <i>foundation of the world</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>;) and that, therefore, the conduct of God in calling the Gentiles <i>now</i>-bringing them into his Church, and conferring on them the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, was in pursuance of his <i>original design</i>; and, if he did not do so, his eternal purposes could not be fulfilled; and that, as the Jews were taken to be his <i>peculiar</i> people, not because they had any <i>goodness</i> or <i>merit</i> in themselves; so the Gentiles were <i>called</i>, not for any merit they had, <i>but according to</i> <i>the good pleasure of his will</i>; that is, according to his <i>eternal</i> <i>benevolence</i>, showing mercy and conferring privileges in this new creation, as he had done in the original creation; for as, in creating man, he drew every consideration from his own innate eternal benevolence, so now, in redeeming man, and sending the glad tidings of salvation both to the Jews and the Gentiles, be acted on the same principles, deriving all the reasons of his conduct from his own infinite <i>goodness</i>.</p>
<p>This argument was exceedingly conclusive, and must silence the Jews on the ground of their <i>original, primitive</i>, and <i>exclusive</i> rights, which they were ever ready to plead against all pretensions of the Gentiles. If therefore God, <i>before the</i> <i>foundation of the Jewish economy</i>, had determined that the Gentiles, in the <i>fulness of time</i>, should be called to and admitted into all the privileges of the Messiah's kingdom, then the <i>exclusive</i> salvation of the Jews was chimerical; and what God was doing now, by the preaching of the apostles in the Gentile world, was in pursuance of his original design. This same argument St. Paul repeatedly produces in his Epistle to the Romans; and a proper consideration of it <i>unlocks</i> many difficulties in that epistle. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>; and elsewhere, in the course of that epistle, where this subject is handled. But why is the word προορισας, <i>fore-determined, limited</i>, or <i>circumscribed</i>, used here? Merely in reference to the settlement of the Israelites in the promised land. God <i>assigned</i> to them the <i>portions</i> which they were to <i>inherit</i>; and these portions were <i>described</i>, and their <i>bearings, boundaries, vicinities</i> to other <i>portions, extent</i> and <i>length</i>, as <i>exactly ascertained</i> as they could be by the most correct <i>geographical</i> map. As God, therefore, had dealt with the Jews in making them his peculiar people, and when he divided the earth among the sons of Noah reserved to himself the <i>twelve portions</i> which he afterwards gave to the twelve tribes; (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:8">Deuteronomy 32:8</span>;) and as his dealings with <i>them</i> were typical of what he intended to do in the calling and salvation of the Gentiles; so he uses the terms by which their allotment and settlement were pointed out to show that, what he had thus designed and typified, he had now fulfilled according to the original predetermination; the Gentiles having now the spiritual inheritance which God had pointed out by the grant <i>made</i> of the promised land to the children of Israel. This is the grand key by which this predestination business is unlocked. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>.</p>
