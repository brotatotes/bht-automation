<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>. <i><b>To the praise of the glory of his grace</b></i> — Δοξης της χαριτος αὑτου· <i>The glory of his grace</i>, for χαρις ενδοξος, <i>his</i> <i>glorious</i> or <i>illustrious grace</i>, according to the Hebrew idiom. But the grace or mercy of God is peculiarly illustrated and glorified in the plan of redemption by Christ Jesus. By the giving of the LAW, God's <i>justice</i> and <i>holiness</i> were rendered most glorious; by the giving of the GOSPEL, his <i>grace</i> and <i>mercy</i> are made equally conspicuous.</p>
<p><i><b>Wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved</b></i> — This translation of εν ᾑ εχαριτωσεν ἡμας εν τῳ Ηγαπημενῳ is not clear; <i>with which he has graciously favoured us through the Beloved</i>, is at once more literal and more intelligible. <i>Whitby, Macknight</i>, and <i>Wakefield</i> translate the passage in nearly the same way.</p>
<p><i>In the Beloved</i> must certainly mean <i>in Christ</i>, who is termed God's <i>beloved Son</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>; but several excellent MSS., such as D*EFG, the later <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>AEthiopic, Vulgate, Itala</i>, with several of the <i>fathers</i>, add, υιωαυτου, <i>his beloved Son</i>. This is the <i>meaning</i>, whether the <i>reading</i> be received or rejected.</p>
