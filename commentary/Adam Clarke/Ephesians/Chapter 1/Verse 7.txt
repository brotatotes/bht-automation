<p>Verse 7. <i><b>In whom we have redemption</b></i> — God has glorified his grace by giving us redemption by the blood of his Son, and this redemption consists in forgiving and delivering us from our sins; so then Christ's blood was the <i>redemption price</i> paid down for our salvation: and this was according to the riches of his grace; as his grace is <i>rich</i> or <i>abundant</i> in <i>benevolence</i>, so it was manifested in <i>beneficence</i> to mankind, in their redemption by the sacrifice of Christ, the <i>measure</i> of redeeming grace being the measure of God's own eternal goodness.</p>
<p>It may not be useless to remark that, instead of της χαριτος αυτου, <i>his grace</i>, the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> and the <i>Coptic</i> version have της χρηστοτητος, his <i>goodness</i>.</p>
