<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Wherein he hath abounded</b></i> — That is, in the dispensation of mercy and goodness by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>In all wisdom and prudence</b></i> — Giving us apostles the most complete instructions in heavenly things by the inspiration of his Spirit; and at the same time <i>prudence</i>, that we might know <i>when</i> and <i>where</i> to preach the Gospel so that it might be effectual to the salvation of those who heard it. Nothing less than the <i>Spirit</i> of <i>God</i> could teach the apostles that <i>wisdom</i> by which they were to instruct a dark and sinful world; and nothing less than the same Spirit could inspire them with that <i>prudence</i> which was necessary to be exercised in every step of their life and ministry. Every wise man is not a prudent man, and every prudent man is not a wise man. <i>Wisdom</i> and <i>prudence</i> may be expected in an apostle who is constantly living under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. "<i>Wisdom</i>," according to <i>Sir William Temple</i>, "is that which makes men judge what are the best ends, and what the best means to attain them; and gives a man advantage of counsel and direction." "<i>Prudence</i> is wisdom applied to practice; or that discreet, apt suiting as well of actions as words, in their due place, time, and manner. Every minister of Christ needs these still; and if he abide not under the influence of both, not only his <i>prayers</i> but his <i>ministerial</i> labours will be all hindered,</p>
