<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>. <i><b>And you hath he quickened</b></i> — This chapter should not have been separated from the preceding, with which it is most intimately connected. As Christ fills the whole body of Christian believers with his fulness, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>,) so had he dealt with the converted Ephesians, who before were <i>dead in trespasses, and dead</i> <i>in sins</i>. DEATH is often used by all writers, and in all nations, to express a state of extreme misery. The Ephesians, by trespassing and sinning, had brought themselves into a state of deplorable wretchedness, as had all the heathen nations; and having thus sinned against God, they were condemned by him, and might be considered as <i>dead in law</i>-incapable of performing any legal act, and always liable to the punishment of death, which they had deserved, and which was ready to be inflicted upon them.</p>
<p><i>Trespasses</i>, παραπτωμασι, may signify the <i>slightest deviation</i> from the line and rule of moral equity, as well as any <i>flagrant</i> offence; for these are equally <i>transgressions</i>, as long as the <i>sacred line</i> that separates between vice and virtue is <i>passed over</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sins</i>, αμαρτιαις, may probably mean here habitual transgression; sinning <i>knowingly</i> and <i>daringly</i>.</p>
