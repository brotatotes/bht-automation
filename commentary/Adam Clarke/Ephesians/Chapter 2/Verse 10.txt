<p>Verse 10. <i><b>For we are his workmanship</b></i> — So far is this salvation from being <i>our own work</i>, or granted for our own <i>works' sake</i>, that we are ourselves not only the <i>creatures</i> of God, but our <i>new</i> <i>creation</i> was produced by his power; for we are <i>created in Christ</i> <i>Jesus unto good works</i>. He has saved us that we may show forth the virtues of Him who called us from darkness into his marvellous light. For though we are not saved <i>for</i> our good works, yet we are saved that we <i>may perform good works</i>, to the glory of God and the benefit of man.</p>
<p><i><b>Which God hath before ordained</b></i> — οις προητοιμασες. <i>For which</i> <i>God before prepared us, that we might walk in them</i>. For being saved from sin we are made partakers of the Spirit of holiness; and it is natural to that Spirit to lead to the <i>practice</i> of holiness; and he who is not holy in his life is not saved by the grace of Christ. The <i>before ordaining</i>, or rather <i>preparing</i>, must refer to the time when God began the new creation in their hearts; for from the first inspiration of God upon the soul it begins to love holiness; and obedience to the will of God is the very <i>element</i> in which a holy or regenerated soul lives.</p>
