<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Wherefore remember</b></i> â€” That ye may ever see and feel your obligations to live a pure and holy life, and be unfeignedly <i>thankful</i> to God for your salvation, remember that ye <i>were once</i> <i>heathens</i> in the <i>flesh</i>-without the pure doctrine, and under the influence of your corrupt nature; such as by the Jew's (who gloried, in consequence of their <i>circumcision</i>, to be in covenant with God) were called <i>uncircumcision</i>; i.e. persons out of the Divine covenant, and having no right or title to any blessing of God.</p>
