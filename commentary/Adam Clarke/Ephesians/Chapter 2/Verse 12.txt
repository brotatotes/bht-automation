<p>Verse 12. <i><b>That at that time ye were without Christ</b></i> — Not only were not <i>Christians</i>, but had no knowledge of the <i>Christ</i> or <i>Messiah</i>, and no title to the blessings which were to proceed from him.</p>
<p><i><b>Aliens from the commonwealth of Israel</b></i> — Ye were by your birth, idolatry, c., <i>alienated</i> from the commonwealth of Israel-from the <i>civil</i> and <i>religious privileges</i> of the Jewish people.</p>
<p><i><b>Strangers from the covenants of promise</b></i> — Having no part in the <i>promise</i> of the covenant made with Abraham, whether considered as relating to his <i>natural</i> or <i>spiritual</i> seed and no part in that of the covenant made at Horeb with the Israelites, when a holy law was given them, and God condescended to dwell among them, and to lead them to the promised land.</p>
<p><i><b>Having no hope</b></i> — Either of the <i>pardon</i> of <i>sin</i> or of the <i>resurrection</i> of the <i>body</i>, nor indeed of the <i>immortality</i> of the <i>soul</i>. Of all these things the Gentiles had no rational or well-grounded hope.</p>
<p><i><b>Without God in the world</b></i> — They had gods many, and lords many; but in no Gentile nation was the true God known: nor indeed had they any correct notion of the Divine nature. Their idols were by <i>nature no gods</i>-they could neither do evil nor good, and therefore they were properly <i>without</i> God, having no true object of worship, and no source of comfort. He who has neither <i>God</i> nor <i>Christ</i> is in a most deplorable state; he has neither a God to worship, nor a Christ to justify him. And this is the state of every man who is living without the grace and <i>Spirit of Christ</i>. All such, whatever they may profess, are no better than practical atheists.</p>
