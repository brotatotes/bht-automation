<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Ye who sometimes were far off</b></i> â€” To be <i>far off</i>, and to be <i>near</i>, are sayings much in use among the Jews; and among them, to be <i>near</i> signifies,</p>
<p>1. To be in the <i>approbation</i> or <i>favour</i> of God; and to be <i>far off</i> signifies to be under his <i>displeasure</i>. So a <i>wicked</i> Jew might be said to be <i>far off</i> from God when he was exposed to his <i>displeasure</i>; and a <i>holy man</i>, or a genuine <i>penitent,</i> might be said to be <i>nigh to God</i>, because such persons are in his <i>favour</i>.</p>
<p>2. Every person who offered a <i>sacrifice</i> to God was considered as having <i>access</i> to him by the <i>blood</i> of that <i>sacrifice:</i> hence the priests, whose office it was to offer sacrifices, were considered as being <i>nigh to God</i>; and all who brought gifts to the altar were considered as <i>approaching</i> the Almighty.</p>
<p>3. Being <i>far</i> <i>off</i>, signified the state of the <i>Gentiles</i> as contradistinguished from the <i>Jews</i>, who were nigh. And these expressions were used in reference to the tabernacle, God's dwelling-place among the Israelites, and the sacrifices there offered. All those who had <i>access</i> to this <i>tabernacle</i>, or were <i>nigh to it</i> or encamped about it, were said to be <i>nigh to God</i>; those who had <i>no access</i> to it were said to be <i>far off</i>.</p>
<p>Hence the latter phrase is used to distinguish the <i>Gentiles</i> from the <i>Jewish</i> people; and this appears to be the meaning of the prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:19">Isaiah 57:19</span>: <i>I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to</i> him that is <i>far</i> <i>off, and to</i> him that is <i>near, saith the Lord</i>; i.e. I give cause of <i>praise</i> and <i>rejoicing</i> to the <i>Gentile</i> as well as to the <i>Jew</i>. And to this scripture, and to this thing, the apostle seems here to allude. You Gentiles, who were <i>unacquainted</i> with God, and were even <i>without God in the world</i>, are brought to an <i>acquaintance</i> with him; and are now, through Christ Jesus, brought into the favour and fellowship of God. And as the Jews of old <i>approached</i> God by the <i>blood</i> of their <i>sacrifices</i>, so <i>you approach</i> him <i>by the blood</i> <i>of Christ</i>.</p>
