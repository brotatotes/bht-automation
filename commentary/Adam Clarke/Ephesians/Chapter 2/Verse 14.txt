<p>Verse 14. <i><b>For he is our peace</b></i> — Jesus Christ has died for both Jews and Gentiles, and has become a <i>peace-offering</i>, <i>shalom</i>, to reconcile both to God and to each other.</p>
<p><i><b>Who hath made both one</b></i> — Formed one Church out of the believers of both people.</p>
<p><i><b>The middle wall of partition</b></i> — By abolishing the law of Jewish ordinances, he has removed that which kept the two parties, not only in a state of <i>separation</i>, but also at <i>variance</i>.</p>
<p>This expression, the <i>middle wall</i>, can refer only to that most marked <i>distinction</i> which the Jewish laws and customs made between them and all other nations whatsoever.</p>
<p>Some think it refers to their ancient manner of living among the Gentiles, as they always endeavoured to live in some place <i>by</i> <i>themselves</i>, and to have a <i>river</i> or a <i>wall</i> between them and their heathen neighbours. Indeed, wherever they went, their own rites, ordinances, and customs were a sufficient separation between them and others; and as Jesus Christ abolished those customs, admitting all into his Church, both Jews and Gentiles, by <i>repentance</i> and <i>faith</i>, he may be said to have <i>broken down the middle wall of</i> <i>partition</i>. When, at the death of Christ, the <i>veil</i> of the temple was <i>rent</i> from the top to the bottom, it was an emblem that <i>the way</i> <i>to the holiest was laid open</i>, and that the people at large, both Jews and Gentiles, were to have <i>access</i> to the <i>holiest</i> by the <i>blood</i> <i>of Jesus</i>.</p>
<p>Some think there is an allusion here to the wall called <i>chel</i>, which separated the <i>court of Israel</i> from the <i>court of the</i> <i>Gentiles</i>; but this was not broken down till the temple itself was destroyed: and to this transaction the apostle cannot be supposed to allude, as it did not take place till long after the writing of this epistle.</p>
