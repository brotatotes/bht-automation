<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Having abolished in his flesh</b></i> — By his <i>incarnation</i> and <i>death</i> he not only made an atonement for sin, but he appointed the <i>doctrine of reconciliation</i> to God, and of <i>love to each other</i>, to be preached in all nations; and thus glory was brought to God in the highest, and on earth, peace and good will were diffused among men.</p>
<p>The <i>enmity</i> of which the apostle speaks was reciprocal among the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>. The <i>former</i> detested the <i>Gentiles</i>, and could hardly allow them the denomination of <i>men</i>; the <i>latter</i> had the <i>Jews</i> in the most sovereign contempt, because of the peculiarity of their religious rites and ceremonies, which were different from those of all the other nations of the earth.</p>
<p><i><b>The law of commandments</b></i> — Contained in, or rather <i>concerning</i>, <i>ordinances</i>; which law was made merely for the purpose of keeping the Jews a <i>distinct</i> people, and pointing out the Son of God till he should come. When, therefore, the <i>end</i> of its institution was answered, it was no longer <i>necessary</i>; and Christ by his death abolished it.</p>
<p><i><b>To make in himself</b></i> — To make one Church out of both people, which should be considered the <i>body</i> of which Jesus Christ is the <i>head</i>. Thus he makes <i>one new man</i>-one new Church; and thus he <i>makes</i> and establishes <i>peace</i>. I think the apostle still alludes to the <i>peace-offering</i>, שלום shalom, among the Jews. They have a saying, <i>Sephra</i>, fol. 121: <i>Whosoever offers a peace-offering sacrifice,</i> <i>brings peace to the world</i>. Such a peace-offering was the death of Christ, and by it <i>peace</i> is restored to the earth.</p>
