<p>Verse 16. <i><b>That he might reconcile both - in one body</b></i> — That the Jews and Gentiles, believing on the Lord Jesus, might lay aside all their causes of contention, and become one spiritual <i>body</i>, or <i>society</i> of men, influenced by the <i>Spirit</i>, and acting according to the <i>precepts</i> of the <i>Gospel</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Having slain the enmity thereby</b></i> — Having, by his death upon the cross, made reconciliation between God and man, and by his Spirit in their hearts removed the <i>enmity</i> of their fallen, sinful nature. Dr. Macknight thinks that <i>abolishing the enmity</i> is spoken of the removal of the <i>hatred</i> which the Jews and Gentiles mutually bore to each other, because of the <i>difference</i> of their <i>respective</i> <i>religious worship</i>; and that <i>slaying</i> the <i>enmity</i> refers to the <i>removal</i> of evil <i>lusts</i> and <i>affections</i> from the heart of man, by the power of Divine grace. This is nearly the sense given above.</p>
