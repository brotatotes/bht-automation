<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For through him</b></i> â€” Christ Jesus, <i>we both</i>-Jews and Gentiles, <i>have access by one Spirit</i>-through the influence of the Holy Ghost, <i>unto the Father</i>-God Almighty. This text is a plain proof of the <i>holy Trinity</i>. Jews and Gentiles are to be presented unto <i>God the</i> FATHER; the SPIRIT of God works in their hearts, and prepares them for this presentation; and JESUS CHRIST himself <i>introduces</i> them. No soul can have access to God but by Jesus Christ, and he introduces none but such as receive his <i>Holy</i> <i>Spirit</i>. All who receive that Spirit are equally dear to him; and, whatever their names be among men, they are known in heaven as <i>children of God</i>, and <i>heirs of eternal glory</i>.</p>
