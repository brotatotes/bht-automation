<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Ye are no more strangers</b></i> — In this chapter the <i>Church</i> of God is compared to a <i>city</i>, which, has a variety of privileges, rights, c., founded on regular <i>charters</i> and <i>grants</i>. The <i>Gentiles</i>, having believed in Christ, are all incorporated with the believing <i>Jews</i> in this holy city. Formerly, when any of them came to Jerusalem, being ξενοι, <i>strangers</i>, they had no kind of rights whatever nor could they, as <i>mere heathens</i>, settle among them. Again, if any of them, convinced of the errors of the Gentiles, acknowledged the God of Israel, but did not receive <i>circumcision</i>, he might dwell in the land, but he had no right to the blessings of the covenant; such might be called παροικοι, <i>sojourners</i>-persons who have no property in the land, and may only rent a house for the time being.</p>
<p><i><b>Fellow citizens with the saints</b></i> — Called to the enjoyment of <i>equal privileges</i> with the <i>Jews</i> themselves, who, by profession, were a <i>holy</i> people; who were bound to be <i>holy</i>, and therefore are often called <i>saints</i>, or <i>holy persons</i>, when both their hearts and conduct were far from being right in the sight of God. But the <i>saints</i> spoken of here are the <i>converted</i> or <i>Christianized Jews</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the household of God</b></i> — The <i>house of God</i> is the <i>temple</i>; the temple was a <i>type</i> of the Christian <i>Church</i>; this is now become God's house; all genuine believers are considered as being οικειοι, <i>domestics</i>, of this house, the <i>children</i> and <i>servants</i> of God Almighty, having all equal rights, privileges, and advantages; as all, through one Spirit, by the sacred head of the family, had equal access to God, and each might receive as much grace and as much glory as his soul could possibly contain.</p>
