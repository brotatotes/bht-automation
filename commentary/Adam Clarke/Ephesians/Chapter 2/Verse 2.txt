<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>. <i><b>Wherein in time past ye walked</b></i> — There is much <i>force</i> in these expressions; the Ephesians had not sinned <i>casually</i>, or <i>now</i> and <i>then</i>, but <i>continually</i>; it was their continual employment; they <i>walked in trespasses and sins</i>: and this was not a <i>solitary</i> case, all the nations of the earth acted in the same way; it was the <i>course of this world</i>, κατα τον αιωνα του κοσμου τουτου, <i>according to the life</i>, mode of living, or <i>successive ages of this</i> <i>world</i>. The word αιων, the literal meaning of which is <i>constant</i> <i>duration</i>, is often applied to things which have a <i>complete course</i>, as the Jewish dispensation, a particular government, and the <i>term</i> <i>of human life</i>; so, here, the <i>whole of life</i> is a tissue of sin, from the cradle to the grave; every human soul, unsaved by Jesus Christ, continues to transgress. And the <i>nominally</i> Christian world is in the same state to the present day. Age after age passes on in this way and the living lay it not to heart!</p>
<p><i><b>The prince of the power of the air</b></i> — As the former clause may have particular respect to the <i>Jewish</i> people, who are frequently denominated עולם הזה <i>olam hazzeh, this world</i>, this latter clause may especially refer to the <i>Gentiles</i>, who were most manifestly under the power of the devil, as almost every object of their worship was a <i>demon</i>, to whom the worst of passions and practices were attributed, and whose conduct his votaries took care to copy.</p>
<p>Satan is termed <i>prince of the power of the air</i>, because the <i>air</i> is supposed to be a region in which malicious spirits dwell, all of whom are under the direction and influence of Satan, their chief.</p>
<p><i><b>The spirit that now worketh</b></i> — του νυν ενεργουντος The operations of the prince of the aerial powers are not confined to <i>that</i> <i>region</i>; he has <i>another</i> sphere of action, viz. the wicked heart of man, and <i>in</i> this he <i>works</i> with <i>energy</i>. He seldom inspires <i>indifference</i> to religion; the subjects <i>in</i> whom he works are either <i>determinate</i> opposers of true religion, or they are systematic and energetic transgressors of God's laws.</p>
<p><i><b>Children of disobedience</b></i> — Perhaps a Hebraism for <i>disobedient</i> <i>children</i>; but, taken as it stands here, it is a strong expression, in which <i>disobedience</i>, η απειθεια, appears to be <i>personified</i>, and wicked men exhibited as her children; the <i>prince of the power of</i> <i>the air</i> being their <i>father</i>, while <i>disobedience</i> is their <i>mother.</i> Thus they are emphatically, what our Lord calls them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:38">Matthew 13:38</span>, <i>children of the wicked</i> one; for they show themselves to be of their <i>father the devil</i>, because they <i>will</i> do his <i>works</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>. Some think that by <i>children of disobedience</i> the apostle means particularly the disobedient, unbelieving, refractory, and persecuting <i>Jews</i>; but I rather think he speaks this <i>generally</i>, and refers to the Jews in the following verse.</p>
