<p>Verse 20. <i><b>And are built upon the foundation</b></i> — Following the same metaphor, comparing the Church of Christ to a <i>city</i>, and to the <i>temple</i>, the believing Ephesians are represented as <i>parts of</i> <i>that building</i>; the <i>living stones</i> out of which it is principally formed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4-5">1 Peter 2:4-5</span>, having for <i>foundation</i>-the ground plan, specification, and principle on which it was builded, the <i>doctrine</i> taught by the <i>prophets</i> in the <i>Old Testament</i>, and the <i>apostles</i> in the <i>New</i>. Jesus Christ being that <i>corner stone</i>, or ακρογωνιαιος, the chief angle or foundation corner stone, the <i>connecting</i> medium by which both Jews and Gentiles were united in the same building. Elsewhere Jesus Christ is termed the <i>foundation stone. Behold I</i> <i>lay in Zion a foundation stone, a tried stone, a precious corner</i> <i>stone</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>; but the meaning is the <i>same</i> in all the places where these terms, <i>foundation</i> and <i>corner stone</i>, occur; for in laying the foundation of a building, a large stone is generally placed at one of the <i>angles</i> or <i>corners</i>, which serves to form a part of the two walls which meet in that angle. When, therefore, the apostle says that Jesus Christ is the <i>chief corner stone</i>, it means such a foundation stone as that above mentioned.</p>
