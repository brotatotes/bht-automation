<p>Verse 21. <i><b>In whom</b></i> — By which foundation corner stone, Christ Jesus, <i>all the building</i>, composed of converted Jews and Gentiles, <i>fitly framed together</i>, συναρμολογουμενη, <i>properly jointed and</i> <i>connected together, groweth unto a holy temple</i>-is <i>continually</i> <i>increasing</i>, as new converts from Judaism or heathenism flock into it. It is not a <i>finished</i> building, but will continue to <i>increase</i>, and be <i>more</i> and <i>more perfect</i>, till the day of judgment.</p>
