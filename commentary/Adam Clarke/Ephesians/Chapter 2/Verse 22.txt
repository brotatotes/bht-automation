<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span>. <i><b>In whom ye also are builded</b></i> â€” The apostle now applies the <i>metaphor to the purpose for which he produced it, retaining</i> <i>however some of the</i> figurative expressions. As the stones in a temple are all properly placed so as to form a complete house, and be a habitation for the <i>Deity</i> that is worshipped there, so ye are all, both believing Jews and Gentiles, prepared by the doctrine of the prophets and apostles, under the influence of the Spirit of Christ, to become a habitation of God, a Church in which God shall be worthily worshipped, and in which he can continually dwell.</p>
<p>1. MANY suppose that the apostle in the preceding chapter alludes to the splendour of the <i>temple of Diana</i> at <i>Ephesus</i>, which was reputed one of the <i>wonders of the world</i>. But to me this opinion does not seem sufficiently founded. I believe he has the <i>Jewish temple</i> continually in view; for that temple, above all in the universe, could alone be said to be <i>a habitation of God</i>. Both in the tabernacle and temple <i>God dwelt</i> between the cherubim; <i>there</i> was the <i>symbol</i> of his <i>presence</i>, and there was the <i>worship</i> performed which himself had prescribed. After the <i>model</i> of this was the spiritual temple, the Christian Church, constructed; and God was to <i>dwell</i> in the <i>one</i>, as he had dwelt in the <i>other</i>. This simile, drawn from the temple at Jerusalem, was alone worthy of the apostle's design; to have alluded to the temple of <i>Diana</i> would have disgraced his subject. And as many at Ephesus were <i>Jews</i>, and well acquainted with the temple at Jerusalem, they would both feel and venerate the apostle's simile, and be led to look for the <i>indwelling of God</i>; that which distinguished the Jewish temple from all others on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>3. Of this glorious Church every Christian soul is an <i>epitome</i>; for as God dwells in the Church at large, so he dwells in every believer in particular: each is a <i>habitation of God through the</i> <i>Spirit</i>. In vain are all pretensions among sects and parties to the privileges of the Church of Christ, if they have not the <i>doctrine</i> and <i>life</i> of Christ. <i>Traditions</i> and <i>legends</i> are not <i>apostolic doctrines</i>, and <i>showy ceremonies</i> are not the <i>life of God</i> in the soul of man.</p>
<p>4. <i>Religion</i> has no need of human ornaments or trappings; it shines by its own light, and is refulgent with its own glory. Where it is not in life and power, men have endeavoured to produce a <i>specious image</i>, dressed and ornamented with their own hands. Into this God never breathed, therefore it can do no good to man, and only imposes on the ignorant and credulous by a vain show of lifeless pomp and splendour. This phantom, called <i>true religion</i> and <i>the Church</i> by its votaries, is in heaven denominated <i>vain</i> <i>superstition</i>; the speechless symbol of departed piety.</p>
