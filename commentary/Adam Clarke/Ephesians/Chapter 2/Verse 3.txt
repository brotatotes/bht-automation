<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>. <i><b>Among whom also we all had our conversation</b></i> — <i>We</i> JEWS, as well as you <i>Gentiles</i>, have lived in transgressions and sins; ανεστραφημεν, this was the <i>course</i> of our <i>life</i>; we lived in sin, walked in sin, it was woven through our whole constitution, it tinged every temper, polluted every faculty, and perverted every transaction of life. <i>The lusts</i> - the evil, irregular, and corrupt affections of the <i>heart</i>, showed themselves in the perversion of the <i>mind</i> as well as in our general conduct. The <i>mind</i> was <i>darkened</i> by the <i>lusts</i> of the <i>flesh</i>, and both conjoined to produce acts of unrighteousness. It was not the <i>will of God</i> that was done by us, but the <i>will of the flesh and of the mind</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And were by nature the children of wrath</b></i> — For the import of the phrase, <i>by nature</i>, φυσει, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:15">Galatians 2:15</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>. To what is said on those passages, I may add, from Dr. <i>Macknight</i>: - "<i>Nature</i> often signifies one's <i>birth</i> and <i>education</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:15">Galatians 2:15</span>: <i>We, who are Jews</i> BY NATURE. Also, men's natural <i>reason</i> and <i>conscience</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>: <i>The Gentiles who have not the law, do</i> BY NATURE <i>the things</i> <i>contained in the law</i>, c. Also, the <i>general sense</i> and <i>practice</i> of mankind, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:14">1 Corinthians 11:14</span>: <i>Doth not even</i> NATURE <i>itself teach you, that if a man have long</i> <i>hair</i>, c. Also, the <i>original constitution</i> of any thing, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8">Galatians 4:8</span>: <i>Who are not gods</i> BY NATURE, Also, a <i>disposition</i> formed by <i>custom</i> and <i>habit</i> thus Demetrius Phalereus said of the Lacedemonians: φυσει εβραχυλογουν λακωνες. The Lacedemonians had <i>naturally</i> a concise mode of speaking. Hence our word <i>laconic</i> a short speech, or much sense conveyed in a few words." The words in the text have often been quoted to prove the doctrine of <i>original sin</i>, but, though that doctrine be an <i>awful truth</i>, it is not, in my opinion, intended here; it is rather found in the <i>preceding</i> words, <i>the</i> <i>lusts of the flesh</i>, and <i>the desires of the flesh and of the mind</i>. The apostle appears to speak of sinful <i>habits</i>; and as we say HABIT is a <i>second nature</i>, and as these persons acted from their <i>originally corrupt nature</i> - from the <i>lusts of the flesh</i> and <i>of the</i> <i>mind</i>, they thus became, by their vicious habits, or <i>second nature,</i> <i>children of wrath</i> - persons exposed to perdition, because of the impurity of their hearts and the wickedness of their lives. Here we see that the fallen, apostate nature produces the fruits of unrighteousness. The <i>bad tree</i> produces <i>bad fruit</i>.</p>
<p><i>Children of wrath</i> is the same as <i>son of perdition, son of death</i>, c. i.e. persons exposed to God's displeasure, because of their sins.</p>
