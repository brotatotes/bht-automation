<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:4">Ephesians 2:4</span>. <i><b>But God, who is rich in mercy</b></i> — As they were <i>corrupt</i> in their <i>nature</i>, and <i>sinful</i> in their <i>practice</i>, they could possess no <i>merit</i>, nor have any <i>claim</i> upon God; and it required much <i>mercy</i> to remove so much <i>misery</i>, and to pardon such transgressions.</p>
<p><i><b>His great love</b></i> — God's infinite love is the groundwork of our salvation; in reference to <i>us</i> that love assumes the form of <i>mercy</i>, and that mercy provides the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore the apostle adds, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>: <i>By grace ye are saved</i>-it is by God's free mercy in Christ that ye are brought into this state of salvation. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span></span>.</p>
