Verse Ephesians 2:4. But God, who is rich in mercy — As they were corrupt in their nature, and sinful in their practice, they could possess no merit, nor have any claim upon God; and it required much mercy to remove so much misery, and to pardon such transgressions.His great love — God's infinite love is the groundwork of our salvation; in reference to us that love assumes the form of mercy, and that mercy provides the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore the apostle adds, Ephesians 2:5: By grace ye are saved-it is by God's free mercy in Christ that ye are brought into this state of salvation. Ephesians 2:8; Ephesians 2:8.
