Verse Ephesians 2:5. Even when we were dead in sins — Dead in our souls; dead towards God; dead in law; and exposed to death eternal,Hath quickened us together with Christ — God has given us as complete a resurrection from the death of sin to a life of righteousness, as the body of Christ has had from the grave. And as this quickening, or making alive, was most gratuitous on God's part, the apostle, with great propriety, says; By grace ye are saved.
