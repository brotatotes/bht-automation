<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>. <i><b>Even when we were dead in sins</b></i> — Dead in our souls; dead towards God; dead in law; and exposed to death eternal,</p>
<p><i><b>Hath quickened us together with Christ</b></i> — God has given us as complete a <i>resurrection</i> from the <i>death of sin</i> to a <i>life of</i> <i>righteousness</i>, as the body of Christ has had from the grave. And as this <i>quickening</i>, or <i>making alive</i>, was most gratuitous on God's part, the apostle, with great propriety, says; <i>By grace ye are</i> <i>saved</i>.</p>
