<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>. <i><b>And hath raised us up together in Christ</b></i> â€” Or rather, <i>by Christ</i>; his resurrection being the proof that he had made the full atonement, and that we might be justified by his blood. Believing, therefore, the record which God gave of his Son, we received this atonement, and were raised from a death of sin to a life of righteousness; and now we <i>sit in heavenly</i> places-we have a <i>right</i> to the kingdom of God, anticipate this glory, and are indescribably happy in the possession of this salvation, and in our fellowship with Christ Jesus.</p>
