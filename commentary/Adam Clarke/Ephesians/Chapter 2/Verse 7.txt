<p>Verse 7. <i><b>That in the ages to come</b></i> â€” God has produced us an <i>example</i>, and one which shall be on record through all generations, that he quickens dead souls; that he forgives the sins of the most sinful, when they repent and believe in Christ Jesus. So that what God has done for the sinners at <i>Ephesus</i> will serve as an encouragement to all ages of the world; and on this <i>evidence</i> every preacher of the Gospel may boldly proclaim that Christ saves unto the uttermost all that come unto God through him. And thus the <i>exceeding riches</i> of his grace will appear in the provision he has made for the salvation of both Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p>This observation of the apostle is of great use and importance; because we are authorized to state, in all the successive ages of the world, that he who saved the sinners at Ephesus is ever ready to save all who, like them, repent of their sins, and believe in Christ Jesus.</p>
