<p>Verse 8. <i><b>For by grace are ye saved, through faith</b></i> — As ye are now brought into a state of salvation, your sins being all blotted out, and you made partakers of the Holy Spirit; and, having a hope full of immortality, you must not attribute this to any <i>works</i> or <i>merit</i> of yours; for when this Gospel reached you, you were all found <i>dead in trespasses and dead in sins</i>; therefore it was God's free mercy to you, manifested through Christ, in whom ye were commanded to believe; and, having believed by the power of the Holy Spirit, ye received, and were sealed by, the Holy Spirit of promise; so that this salvation is in no sense <i>of yourselves</i>, but is the <i>free gift of God</i>; and not of any kind of <i>works</i>; so that no man can <i>boast</i> as having <i>wrought out his own salvation</i>, or even contributed any thing towards it. <i>By grace are ye saved, through</i> <i>faith</i> in Christ. This is a true doctrine, and continues to be essential to the salvation of man to the end of the world.</p>
<p>But whether are we to understand, <i>faith</i> or <i>salvation</i> as being the <i>gift of God</i>? This question is answered by the Greek text: τῃ γαρ χαριτι εστε σεσωσμενοι δια της πιστεως· και τουτο ουκ εξ ὑμων· Θεου το δωρον, ουκ εξ εργων· ἱνα μη τις καυχησηται· "By this grace ye are saved through faith; and THIS (τουτο, <i>this</i> <i>salvation</i>) not of you; it is the gift of God, not of works: so that no one can boast." "The relative τουτο, <i>this</i>, which is in the <i>neuter gender</i>, cannot stand for πιστις, <i>faith</i>, which is the <i>feminine</i>; but it has the whole sentence that goes before for its antecedent." But it may be asked: Is not <i>faith</i> the <i>gift of God</i>? Yes, as to the <i>grace</i> by which it is produced; but the <i>grace</i> or <i>power</i> to believe, and the <i>act</i> of <i>believing</i>, are two different things. Without the <i>grace</i> or <i>power</i> to believe no man ever did or can believe; but with that <i>power</i> the act of <i>faith</i> is a man's own. God never believes <i>for</i> any man, no more than he <i>repents</i> for him: the penitent, through this grace enabling him, believes for himself: nor does he believe <i>necessarily</i>, or <i>impulsively</i> when he has that power; the power to believe may be present long before it is exercised, else, why the solemn warnings with which we meet every where in the word of God, and threatenings against those who do not believe? Is not this a proof that such persons have the <i>power</i> but do not <i>use</i> it? <i>They believe not</i>, and therefore <i>are</i> <i>not established</i>. This, therefore, is the true state of the case: God gives the power, man uses the power thus given, and brings glory to God: without the power no man can believe; with it, any man may.</p>
