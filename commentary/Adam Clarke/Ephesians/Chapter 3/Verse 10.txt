<p>Verse 10. <i><b>That now unto the principalities and powers in</b></i><b> </b><i><b>heavenly places</b></i> — <i>Who</i> are these principalities and powers? Some think <i>evil angels</i> are intended, because they are thus denominated, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>. Others think <i>good angels</i> are meant; for as these heavenly beings are curious to investigate the wondrous economy of the Gospel, though they are not its <i>immediate objects</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>, it is quite consistent with the goodness of God to give them that satisfaction which they require. And in this discovery of the Gospel plan of salvation, which <i>reconciles things in heaven and</i> <i>things on earth</i>-both men and angels, these pure spirits are greatly interested, and their praises to the Divine Being rendered much more abundant. Others imagine the <i>Jewish rulers</i> and <i>rabbins</i> are intended, particularly those of them who were converted to Christianity, and who had now learned from the preaching of the Gospel what, as <i>Jews</i>, they could never have known. I have had several opportunities of showing that this sort of phraseology is frequent among the Jews, and indeed not seldom used in the New Testament. Dr. Macknight, whose mode of arguing against this opinion is not well chosen, supposes that "the different orders of angels in heaven are intended, whose knowledge of God's dispensations must be as gradual as the dispensations themselves; consequently their knowledge of the manifold wisdom of God must have been greatly increased by the constitution of the Christian Church." Of this there can be no doubt, whether the terms in the text refer to them or not.</p>
<p><i><b>By the Church</b></i> — That is, by the <i>Christians</i> and by the wonderful things done in the Church; and by the apostles, who were its pastors.</p>
<p><i><b>The manifold wisdom of God</b></i> — Ἡ πολυποικιλος σοφια· <i>That</i> <i>multifarious and greatly diversified wisdom of God</i>; laying great and infinite plans, and accomplishing them by endless means, through the whole lapse of ages; making every occurrence subservient to the purposes of his infinite mercy and goodness. God's gracious design to save a lost world by Jesus Christ, could not be defeated by any cunning skill or malice of man or devils: whatever hinderances are thrown in the way, his wisdom and power can remove; and his infinite wisdom can never want <i>ways</i> or <i>means</i> to effect its gracious designs.</p>
