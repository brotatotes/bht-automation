<p>Verse 11. <i><b>According to the eternal purpose</b></i> — κατα προθεσιν των αιωνων. <i>According to the purpose concerning the periods</i>. This seems to refer to the <i>complete round</i> of the <i>Jewish system</i>, and to that of the <i>Gospel</i>. I have often observed, that though the proper grammatical meaning of the word is <i>ever-during</i> or <i>endless</i> <i>duration</i>, yet it is often applied to those <i>systems, periods,</i> <i>governments</i>, c., which have a <i>complete duration</i>, taking in the whole of them, from their <i>commencement</i> to their <i>termination</i>, leaving nothing of their duration unembraced. So, here, God purposed that the Jewish dispensation should commence at such a time, and terminate at such a time that the Gospel dispensation should commence when the Jewish ended, and terminate only with life itself; and that the <i>results</i> of both should be <i>endless</i>. This is probably what is meant by the above phrase.</p>
<p><i><b>Which he purposed in Christ Jesus</b></i> — ην εποιησεν. <i>Which he made</i> or <i>constituted in</i> or <i>for Christ Jesus</i>. The manifestation of Christ, and the glory which should follow, were the grand objects which God kept in view in all his dispensations.</p>
