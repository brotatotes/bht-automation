<p>Verse 12. <i><b>In whom we have boldness</b></i> — <i>By whom we</i>, Gentiles, <i>have</i> την παρρησιαν, <i>this liberty of speech</i>; so that we may <i>say</i> any thing by <i>prayer</i> and supplication, and την προσαγωγην, <i>this</i> <i>introduction</i>, into the Divine presence by faith in Christ. It is only in <i>his name</i> we can <i>pray</i> to God, and it is only <i>by him</i> that we can <i>come</i> to God; none can give us an <i>introduction</i> but Christ Jesus, and it is only for his sake that God will either <i>hear</i> or <i>save</i> us. It is on the ground of such scriptures as these that we conclude all our prayers <i>in the name, and for the sake, of Jesus</i> <i>Christ our Lord</i>.</p>
