<p>Verse 14. <i><b>For this cause I bow my knees</b></i> — That you may not faint, but persevere, I frequently pray to God, who is our God and the Father of our Lord Jesus. Some very ancient and excellent MSS. and <i>versions</i> omit the words του Κυριου ἡμων Ιησου Χριστου, <i>of</i> <i>our Lord Jesus Christ</i>. And in them the passage reads: <i>I bow my</i> <i>knees unto the Father</i>. The apostle prays to God the Father, that they may not <i>faint</i>; and he bows his knees in this praying. What can any man think of himself, who, in his addresses to God, can either <i>sit</i> on his seat or <i>stand</i> in the presence of the <i>Maker</i> and <i>Judge</i> of all men? Would they <i>sit</i> while addressing any person of ordinary respectability? If they did so they would be reckoned very <i>rude</i> indeed. Would they <i>sit</i> in the presence of the <i>king</i> of their own land? They would not be permitted so to do. Is God then to be treated with less respect than a <i>fellow mortal? Paul</i> kneeled in praying, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:36">Acts 20:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:5">Acts 21:5</span>. <i>Stephen</i> kneeled when he was stoned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>. And <i>Peter</i> kneeled when he raised Tabitha, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:40">Acts 9:40</span>.</p>
<p>Many parts of this prayer bear a strict resemblance to that offered up by Solomon, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+6:1">2 Chronicles 6:1</span>, c., when dedicating the temple: <i>He kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of</i> <i>Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+6:13">2 Chronicles 6:13</span>. The apostle was now dedicating the Christian Church, that then was and that ever should be, to God; and praying for those blessings which should ever rest on and distinguish it; and he kneels down after the example of Solomon, and invokes him to whom the first temple was dedicated, and who had made it a type of the Gospel Church.</p>
