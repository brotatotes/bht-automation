<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Of whom the whole family</b></i> â€” <i>Believers</i> in the Lord Jesus Christ on <i>earth</i>, the <i>spirits</i> of <i>just men made perfect</i> in a <i>separate state</i>, and all the holy <i>angels</i> in heaven, make but <i>one</i> <i>family</i>, of which God is the Father and Head. St. Paul does not say, of whom the <i>families</i>, as if each order formed a <i>distinct</i> <i>household</i>; but he says <i>family</i>, because they are all <i>one</i>, and of <i>one</i>. And all this family is <i>named</i>-derives its <i>origin</i> and <i>being</i>, from God, as children derive their name from him who is the father of the family: holy persons in heaven and earth derive their being and their holiness from God, and therefore his name is called upon them. <i>Christ</i> gives the name of <i>Christians</i> to all the real members of his Church upon earth; and to all the spirits of just men (saved since his advent, and through his blood) in heaven. They are all the <i>sons and daughters</i> of God Almighty.</p>
