<p>Verse 16. <i><b>That he would grant you</b></i> — This prayer of the apostle is one of the most grand and sublime in the whole oracles of God. The riches of the grace of the Gospel, and the extent to which the soul of man may be saved here below, are most emphatically pointed out here. Every word seems to have come immediately from heaven; labouring to convey ideas of infinite importance to mankind. No paraphrase can do it justice, and few commentators seem to have entered into its spirit; perhaps deterred by its unparalleled sublimity. I shall only attempt a few observations upon the <i>terms</i>, to show their force and meaning; and leave all the rest to that Spirit by which these most important words were dictated. In the mean time referring the reader to the discourse lately published on this prayer of the apostle, entitled, <i>The Family of</i> <i>God and its Privileges</i>.</p>
<p><i>That he would grant you</i>-You can expect nothing from him but as a <i>free gift</i> through Christ Jesus; let this be a ruling sentiment of your hearts when you pray to God.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the riches of his glory</b></i> — According to the measure of his own eternal <i>fulness</i>; God's infinite mercy and goodness being the <i>measure</i> according to which we are to be saved. In giving alms it is a maxim that every one should act according to his <i>ability</i>. It would be a disgrace to a <i>king</i> or a <i>noble-man</i> to give no more than a <i>tradesman</i> or a <i>peasant</i>. God acts up to the dignity of his infinite perfections; he gives <i>according</i> to the <i>riches</i> of his <i>glory</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To be strengthened with might</b></i> — Ye have <i>many enemies</i>, cunning and <i>strong; many trials</i>, too great for your <i>natural strength</i>; many <i>temptations</i>, which no <i>human power</i> is able successfully to <i>resist</i>; many <i>duties</i> to <i>perform</i>, which cannot be accomplished by the <i>strength</i> of <i>man</i>; therefore you need <i>Divine strength</i>; ye must have might; and ye must be <i>strengthened every where</i>, and <i>every way</i> <i>fortified</i> by that might; <i>mightily</i> and most <i>effectually</i> <i>strengthened</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>By his Spirit</b></i> — By the sovereign energy of the Holy Ghost. This fountain of spiritual <i>energy</i> can alone supply the <i>spiritual</i> <i>strength</i> which is necessary for this <i>spiritual work</i> and <i>conflict.</i></p>
<p><i><b>In the inner man</b></i> — In the <i>soul</i>. Every man is a <i>compound</i> being; he has a <i>body</i> and a <i>soul</i>. The <i>outward man</i> is that alone which is <i>seen</i> and <i>considered</i> by men; the <i>inward man</i> is that which stands particularly in reference to God and eternity. The outward man is strengthened by <i>earthly food</i>, c. the inward man, by <i>spiritual</i> and <i>heavenly influences</i>. Knowledge, love, peace, and holiness, are the food of the inward man; or rather Jesus Christ, that bread of life which came down from heaven: he that eateth this bread shall live and be strengthened by it. The soul must be as truly fed and nourished by Divine food as the body by natural food.</p>
