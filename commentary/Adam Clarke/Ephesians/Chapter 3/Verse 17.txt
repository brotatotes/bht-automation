<p>Verse 17. <i><b>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith</b></i> — In this as well as in many other passages, and particularly that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span>, (where see the note,) the apostle compares the <i>body</i> or <i>Church</i> of true believers to a <i>temple</i>, which, like that of Solomon, is built up to be a <i>habitation of God</i> through the Spirit. Here, as Solomon did at the dedication of the temple at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+6:1">2 Chronicles 6:1</span>, c., Paul, having considered the Church at Ephesus <i>completely formed</i>, as to every external thing, prays that God may come down and <i>dwell in</i> <i>it</i>. And as there could be no indwelling of God but by <i>Christ</i>, and no indwelling of Christ but by <i>faith</i>, he prays that they may have such <i>faith</i> in Christ, as shall keep them in constant possession of his love and presence. God, at the beginning, formed man to be his <i>temple</i>, and while in a state of purity he inhabited this temple when the temple became defiled, God left it. In the order of his eternal mercy, Christ, the repairer of the breach, comes to purify the temple, that it may again become a fit habitation for the blessed God. This is what the apostle points out to the believing Ephesians, in praying that Christ κατοικησαι, might <i>intensely</i> and <i>constantly dwell in their hearts by faith</i>: for the man's heart, which is not God's house, must be a hold of every foul and unclean spirit; as Satan and his angels will endeavour to <i>fill</i> what God does not.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye, being rooted and grounded in love</b></i> — Here is a <i>double</i> metaphor; one taken from <i>agriculture</i>, the other, from <i>architecture</i>. As <i>trees</i>, they are to be <i>rooted in love</i>-this is the <i>soil</i> in which their souls are to <i>grow</i>; into the infinite love of God their souls by faith are to strike their <i>roots</i>, and from this love derive all that nourishment which is essential for their full growth, till they have the mind in them that was in Jesus, or, as it is afterwards said, till they are <i>filled with all the</i> <i>fulness of God</i>. As a <i>building</i>, their <i>foundation</i> is to be laid in <i>this love. God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten</i> <i>Son</i>, c. Here is the <i>ground</i> on which alone the soul, and all its hopes and expectations, can be safely <i>founded</i>. This is a <i>foundation</i> that cannot be shaken and it is from this alone that the doctrine of redemption flows to man, and from this alone has the soul its form and comeliness. IN this, as its proper <i>soil</i>, it <i>grows</i>. ON this, as its only <i>foundation</i>, it <i>rests</i>.</p>
