<p>Verse 18. <i><b>May be able to comprehend with all saints</b></i> — ινα εξισχυσητε καταλαβεσθαι. These words are so exceedingly nervous and full of meaning, that it is almost impossible to translate them. The first word, εξισχυσητε, from εξ, <i>intensive</i>, and ισχυω, <i>to be strong</i>, signifies that they might be <i>thoroughly able,</i> by having been <i>strengthened with might</i>, by God's <i>power</i>. The second word καταλαβεσθαι, from κατα, <i>intensive</i>, and λαμβανω, to <i>take, catch</i>, or <i>seize on</i>, may be translated, <i>that ye may fully</i> <i>catch, take in</i>, and <i>comprehend this wonderful mystery of God</i>. The mind must be rendered apt, and the soul invigorated, to take in and <i>comprehend</i> these mysteries.</p>
<p><i><b>What</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the breadth, and length, and depth, and height</b></i> — Here the apostle still keeps up the metaphor, comparing the Church of God to a building; and as, in order to rear a proper building, formed on scientific principles, a <i>ground plan</i> and <i>specification</i> must be previously made, according to which the building is to be constructed, the apostle refers to this; for this must be thoroughly understood, without which the building could not be formed. They were to be builded up a <i>heavenly house</i>, a <i>habitation</i> <i>of God through the Spirit</i>; and this must have its <i>latitude</i> or <i>breadth</i>, its <i>longitude</i> or <i>length</i>, its <i>altitude</i> or <i>height</i>, and its <i>profundity</i> or <i>depth</i>.</p>
<p>It is supposed by some that the apostle is here alluding to the famous <i>temple of Diana</i> at Ephesus, which, as I have already had occasion to remark, was reputed one of the <i>wonders of the world</i>, being in length 425 feet, in breadth 220; it was supported by 127 pillars, each 60 feet high; was builded at the expense of all Asia; and was 220 years in being completed. I cannot, however, allow of this allusion while the apostle had a <i>nobler model</i> at hand, and one every way more worthy of being brought into the comparison. The temple at Jerusalem was that alone which he had in view; that alone could be fitly compared here; for that was built to be a habitation of God; that was his house, and that the place of his rest: so the Christian temple, and the believing heart, are to be the constant, the endless residence of God; and how august must that edifice be in which the eternal Trinity dwells!</p>
<p>But what can the apostle mean by the <i>breadth, length, depth</i>, and <i>height</i>, of <i>the love of God</i>? Imagination can scarcely frame any satisfactory answer to this question. It takes in the <i>eternity</i> of God. GOD is LOVE; and in that, an infinity of <i>breadth, length,</i> <i>depth</i>, and <i>height</i>, is included; or rather all <i>breadth, length,</i> <i>depth</i>, and <i>height</i>, are lost in this <i>immensity</i>. It comprehends all that is <i>above</i>, all that is <i>below</i>, all that is <i>past</i>, and all that is to <i>come</i>. In reference to human beings, the love of God, in its BREADTH, is a girdle that encompasses the globe; its LENGTH reaches from the <i>eternal</i> purpose of the mission of Christ, to the <i>eternity</i> of blessedness which is to be spent in his ineffable glories; its DEPTH reaches to the <i>lowest fallen</i> of the sons of Adam, and to the <i>deepest</i> depravity of the human heart; and its HEIGHT to the infinite dignities of the throne of Christ. <i>He that</i> <i>overcometh will I give to sit dawn with me upon my throne, as I</i> <i>have overcome and sat down with the Father upon his throne</i>. Thus we see that the <i>Father</i>, the <i>Son</i>, and all true believers in him, are to be seated on the <i>same throne</i>! This is the <i>height</i> of the love of God, and the <i>height</i> to which that love raises the souls that believe in Christ Jesus!</p>
