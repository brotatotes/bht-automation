<p>Verse 19. <i><b>To know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge</b></i> — It is only by the <i>love of Christ</i> that we can know the <i>love of God</i>: the love of God to man induced him to give Christ for his redemption; Christ's love to man induced him to give his life's blood for his salvation. The gift of Christ <i>to</i> man is the <i>measure</i> of God's love; the <i>death</i> of Christ <i>for</i> man is the <i>measure</i> of Christ's love. <i>God so loved the world</i>, c. <i>Christ loved us</i>, and <i>gave himself for us</i>.</p>
<p>But how can the love of Christ, <i>which passeth knowledge</i>, be <i>known</i>? Many have laboured to <i>reconcile</i> this seeming <i>contradiction</i>. If we take the verb γνωναι in a sense in which it is frequently used in the New Testament, to <i>approve, acknowledge</i>, or <i>acknowledge with approbation</i>, and γνωσις to signify <i>comprehension</i>, then the difficulty will be partly removed: "That ye may <i>acknowledge, approve</i>, and <i>publicly acknowledge</i>, that love of God which surpasseth knowledge." We can <i>acknowledge</i> and <i>approve</i> of that which <i>surpasses</i> our <i>comprehension</i>. We cannot comprehend GOD yet we can <i>know</i> that he is; <i>approve</i> of, <i>love,</i> <i>adore</i>, and <i>serve</i> him. In like manner, though we cannot <i>comprehend</i>, the immensity of the <i>love of Christ</i>, yet we <i>know</i> that he <i>has loved us, and washed us from our sins</i> in his <i>own blood</i>; and we <i>approve</i> of, and <i>acknowledge</i>, him as our only Lord and Saviour. In this sense we may be said to <i>know</i> the love of Christ that passeth <i>knowledge</i>.</p>
<p>But it is more likely that the word γνωσις, which we translate <i>knowledge</i>, signifies here <i>science</i> in general, and particularly that <i>science</i> of which the <i>rabbins</i> boasted, and that in which the Greeks greatly exulted. The former professed to have the <i>key of</i> <i>knowledge</i>; the <i>secret</i> of all Divine mysteries; the latter considered their <i>philosophers</i>, and their <i>systems of philosophy</i>, superior to every thing that had ever been known among men, and reputed on this account all other nations as <i>barbarians</i>. When the apostle prays that they <i>may know the love of Christ which passeth</i> <i>knowledge</i>, he may refer to all the boasted knowledge of the Jewish doctors, and to all the greatly extolled science of the Greek philosophers. To know the love of Christ, infinitely surpasseth all other science. This gives a clear and satisfactory sense.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</b></i> — Among all the great sayings in this prayer, this is the greatest. To be FILLED <i>with God</i> is a great thing; to be <i>filled with the</i> FULNESS <i>of</i> <i>God</i> is still greater; but to be <i>filled with</i> ALL <i>the fulness of</i> <i>God</i>, παν το πληρωμα του θεου, utterly bewilders the sense and confounds the understanding.</p>
<p>Most people, in quoting these words, endeavour to <i>correct</i> or <i>explain</i> the apostle, by adding the word <i>communicable</i>; but this is as idle as it is useless and impertinent. The apostle <i>means what</i> <i>he says</i>, and would be <i>understood in his own meaning</i>. By the <i>fulness of God</i>, we are to understand all those gifts and graces which he has promised to bestow on man, and which he dispenses to the Church. To be <i>filled with all the fulness of God</i>, is to have the whole soul filled with meekness, gentleness, goodness, love, justice, holiness, mercy, and truth. And as what God <i>fills</i>, neither sin nor Satan can fill; consequently, it implies that the soul shall be emptied of sin, that sin shall neither have dominion <i>over</i> it, nor a being <i>in</i> it. It is impossible for us to understand these words in a <i>lower</i> sense than this. But <i>how much more</i> they imply, (for more they do imply,) I cannot tell. As there is no end to the merits of <i>Christ</i>, no bounds to the mercy and love of God, no limits to the improvability of the human soul, so there can be no bounds set to the saving influence which God will dispense to the heart of every believer. We may <i>ask</i>, and we shall <i>receive</i>, and our joy shall be <i>full</i>.</p>
