<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:2">Ephesians 3:2</span>. <i><b>If ye have heard of the dispensation</b></i> — The compound particle ειγε, which is commonly translated <i>if indeed</i>, in several places means <i>since indeed, seeing that</i>, and should be translated so in this verse, and in several other places of the New Testament. <i>Seeing ye have heard of the dispensation of God, which</i> <i>is given me to you-ward</i>: this they had amply learned from the apostle during his stay at Ephesus, for <i>he had not shunned to</i> <i>declare unto them the whole counsel of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:27">Acts 20:27</span>, and <i>kept nothing back that was profitable to them</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span>. And this was certainly among those things that were <i>most profitable</i>, and most necessary to be known.</p>
<p>By the <i>dispensation of the grace of God</i> we may understand, either the <i>apostolic office</i> and <i>gifts</i> granted to St. Paul, for the purpose of preaching the Gospel among the Gentiles, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>; or the <i>knowledge</i> which God gave him of that gracious and Divine <i>plan</i> which he had formed for the conversion of the Gentiles. For the meaning of the word <i>economy</i>, <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span></span>.</p>
