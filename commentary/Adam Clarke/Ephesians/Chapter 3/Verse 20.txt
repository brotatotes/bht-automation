<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Now unto him</b></i> — Having finished his short, but most wonderfully comprehensive and energetic <i>prayer</i>, the apostle brings in his <i>doxology</i>, giving praise to Him from whom all blessings come, and to whom all thanks are due.</p>
<p><i><b>That is able to do exceeding abundantly</b></i> — It is impossible to express the full meaning of these words, God is <i>omnipotent</i>, therefore he is able to do all things, and able to do υπερ εκ περισσου, <i>superabundantly above the greatest abundance</i>. And who can doubt this, who has any rational or Scriptural views of his power or his love?</p>
<p><i><b>All that we ask or think</b></i> — We can <i>ask</i> every good of which we have heard, every good which God has promised in his word; and we can <i>think</i> of, or <i>imagine</i>, goods and blessings beyond all that we have either <i>read</i> of or <i>seen</i>: yea, we can <i>imagine</i> good things to which it is impossible for us to give a <i>name</i>; we can go beyond the limits of all human descriptions; we can imagine more than even God has specified in his word; and can feel no <i>bounds</i> to our imagination of good, but <i>impossibility</i> and <i>eternity</i>: and after all, <i>God is able to do more for us than we can ask or think</i>; and his <i>ability</i> here is so necessarily connected with his <i>willingness</i>, that the one indisputably implies the other; for, of what consequence would it be to tell the Church of God that he had <i>power to do</i> so and so, if there were not implied an assurance that he <i>will</i> do what his power <i>can</i>, and what the soul of man needs to have done?</p>
<p><i><b>According to the power that worketh in us</b></i> — All that he can do, and all that he has promised to do, will be done <i>according</i> to what he has done, by that <i>power</i> of the holy Ghost την ενεργουμενην, <i>which worketh strongly in us</i>-acts with <i>energy</i> in our hearts, expelling evil, purifying and refining the affections and desires, and implanting good.</p>
