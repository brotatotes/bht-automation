<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:4">Ephesians 3:4</span>. <i><b>Whereby, when ye read</b></i> — When ye refer back to them.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye may understand my knowledge</b></i> — Ye may see what God has given me to know concerning what has been hitherto a <i>mystery</i>-the calling of the Gentiles, and the breaking down the <i>middle wall</i> between them and the Jews, so as to make <i>both one spiritual body</i>, and on the same conditions.</p>
