<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>. <i><b>Which in other ages was not made known</b></i> â€” That the calling of the Gentiles was made known by the prophets in different ages of the Jewish Church is exceedingly clear; but it certainly was not made known in that <i>clear and precise manner</i> in which it was now revealed by the Spirit unto the ministers of the New Testament: nor was it made known unto them at all, that the Gentiles should find salvation <i>without coming under the yoke of</i> <i>the Mosaic law</i>, and that the <i>Jews</i> themselves should be <i>freed from</i> <i>that yoke of bondage</i>; these were <i>discoveries</i> totally <i>new</i>, and now revealed for the first time by the Spirit of God.</p>
