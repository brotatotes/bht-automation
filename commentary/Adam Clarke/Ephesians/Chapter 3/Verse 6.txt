<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:6">Ephesians 3:6</span>. <i><b>That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs</b></i> — This is the <i>substance</i> of that mystery which had been hidden from all ages, and which was now made known to the New Testament apostles and prophets, and more particularly to St. Paul.</p>
<p><i><b>His promise in Christ</b></i> — That the promise made to Abraham extended to the <i>Gentiles</i>, the apostle has largely proved in his Epistle to the Romans; and that it was to be fulfilled to them <i>by</i> and <i>through Christ</i>, he proves there also; and particularly in his Epistle to the Galatians, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:14">Galatians 3:14</span>. And that these blessings were to be announced in the preaching of the Gospel, and received on believing it, he every where declares, but more especially in <i>this</i> epistle.</p>
