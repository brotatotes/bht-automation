A <i>deacon</i>, a <i>servant</i> acting <i>under</i> and by the <i>direction</i> of the <i>great</i> <i>Master</i>, Jesus Christ; from whom, by an especial call and revelation, I received the apostolic gifts and office, and by την ενεργειαντηςδυναμεωςαυτου, the <i>energy</i>, the <i>in-working of his</i> <i>power</i>, this Gospel which I preached was made effectual to the salvation of vast multitudes of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
