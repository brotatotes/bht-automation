<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Less than the least of all saints</b></i> — ελαχιστοτερω παντων αγιων. As the design of the apostle was to <i>magnify</i> the grace of Christ in the salvation of the world, he uses every precaution to prevent the eyes of the people from being turned to <i>any thing but Christ crucified</i>; and although he was obliged to speak of <i>himself</i> as the particular instrument which God had chosen to bring the Gentile world to the knowledge of the truth, yet he does it in such a manner as to show that the excellency of the power was of God, and not of him; and that, highly as he and his follow apostles were honoured; they had the <i>heavenly treasure</i> in <i>earthen vessels</i>. To lay himself as <i>low</i> as possible, consistently with his being in the number of Divinely commissioned men, he calls himself <i>less than the least</i>; and is obliged to make a <i>new</i> <i>word</i>, by strangely forming a <i>comparative</i> degree, not from the <i>positive</i>, which would have been a regular grammatical procedure, but from the <i>superlative</i>. The adjective ελαχυς signifies <i>little</i>, ελασσων or ελαττων, <i>less</i>, and ελαχιστος, <i>least</i>. On this latter, which is the <i>superlative</i> of ελαχυς, <i>little</i>, St. Paul forms his <i>comparative</i>, ελαχιστοτερος, <i>less than the least</i>, a word of which it would be vain to attempt a better translation than that given in our own version. It most strongly marks the unparalleled <i>humility</i> of the apostle; and the amazing condescension of God, in favouring him, who had been before a persecutor and blasphemer, with the knowledge of this glorious scheme of human redemption, and the power to preach it so successfully among the Gentiles.</p>
<p><i><b>The unsearchable riches of Christ</b></i> — The word ανεξιχνιαστος, from α, <i>privative</i>, and εξιχνιαζω, <i>to trace out</i>, from ιχνος, a <i>step</i>, is exceedingly well chosen here: it refers to the <i>footsteps</i> of God, the <i>plans</i> he had formed, the <i>dispensations</i> which he had published, and the innumerable <i>providences</i> which he had combined, to prepare, mature, and bring to full effect and view his gracious designs in the salvation of a ruined world, by the incarnation, passion, death, and resurrection of his Son. There were in these schemes and providences such <i>riches</i>-such an abundance, such a variety, as could not be comprehended even by the naturally vast, and, through the Divine inspiration, unparalleledly capacious mind of the apostle.</p>
<p>Yet he was to proclaim among the Gentiles these astonishing wonders and mysteries of grace; and as he proceeds in this great and glorious work, the Holy Spirit that dwelt in him opens to his mind more and more of those <i>riches</i>-leads him into those <i>footsteps</i> of the Almighty which could not be <i>investigated</i> by man nor angel, so that his preaching and epistles, taken all in their chronological order, will prove that his views brighten, and his discoveries become more numerous and more distinct in proportion as he advances. And had he lived, preached, and written to the present day, he had not <i>exhausted</i> the subject, nor fully declared to the Gentiles the <i>unsearchable riches of Christ</i>-the endless depths of wisdom and knowledge treasured up in him, and the infinity of saving acts and saving power displayed by him.</p>
