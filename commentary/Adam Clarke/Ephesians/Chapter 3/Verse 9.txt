<p>Verse 9. <i><b>And to make all men see</b></i> — και φωτισαι παντας. <i>And to</i> <i>illuminate all</i>; to give <i>information</i> both to Jews and Gentiles; to afford them a <i>sufficiency of light</i>, so that they might be able distinctly to discern the great objects exhibited in this Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>What</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the fellowship of the mystery</b></i> — The word κοινωνια, which we properly translate <i>fellowship</i>, was used among the Greeks to signify their <i>religious communities</i>; here it may intimate the <i>association</i> of Jews and Gentiles in <i>one Church</i> or <i>body</i>, and their <i>agreement</i> in that glorious mystery which was now so fully opened relative to the salvation of both. But instead of κοινωνια, <i>fellowship</i>, οικονομια, <i>dispensation</i> or <i>economy</i>, is the reading of ABCDEFG, and more than fifty others; both the <i>Syriac,</i> <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Slavonian, Vulgate</i> and <i>Itala</i>, with the chief of the <i>Greek fathers</i>. Some of the best <i>printed editions</i> of the Greek text have the same reading, and that in our common text has very little authority to support it. <i>Dispensation</i> or <i>economy</i> is far more congenial to the scope of the apostle's declaration in this place; he wished to show them the <i>economy</i> of that <i>mystery</i> of bringing Jews and Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ Jesus, which God from the beginning of the world had kept hidden in his own infinite mind, and did not think proper to reveal even when he projected the creation of the world, which had respect to the economy of human redemption. And although the <i>world was made by Jesus Christ</i>, the great Redeemer, yet at that period this revelation of the <i>power</i> of God, the design of saving men, whose fall infinite wisdom had foreseen, was not then revealed. This reading <i>Griesbach</i> has received into the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Who created all things by Jesus Christ</b></i> — Some very judicious critics are of opinion that this does not refer to the <i>material</i> <i>creation</i>; and that we should understand the whole as referring to the <i>formation of all God's dispensations of grace, mercy</i>, and <i>truth</i>, which have been <i>planned, managed</i>, and <i>executed</i> by Christ, from the foundation of the world to the present time. But the words δια ιησου χριστου, <i>by Jesus Christ</i>, are wanting in ABCD*FG, and several others; also in the <i>Syriac, Arabic</i> of Erpen, <i>Coptic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>; as also in several of the <i>fathers</i>. Griesbach has thrown the words out of the text; and <i>Professor</i> <i>White</i> says, "certissime delenda," <i>they are indisputably spurious</i>. The text, therefore, should be read: <i>which from the beginning of</i> <i>the world had been hidden in God who created all things</i>. No <i>inferiority</i> of Christ can be argued from a clause of whose spuriousness there is the strongest evidence.</p>
