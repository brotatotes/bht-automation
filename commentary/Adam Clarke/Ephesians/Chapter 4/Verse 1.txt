<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>. <i><b>I therefore</b></i> — Therefore, because God has provided for you such an abundant salvation, and ye have his testimonies among you, and have full liberty to use all the means of grace;</p>
<p><i><b>The prisoner of the Lord</b></i> — Who am deprived of my liberty for the Lord's sake.</p>
<p><i><b>Beseech you that ye walk</b></i> — Ye have your liberty, and may <i>walk</i>; I am deprived of mine, and <i>cannot</i>. This is a fine stroke, and wrought up into a strong argument. You who are at <i>large</i> can show forth the virtues of him who called you into his marvellous <i>light</i>; I am in <i>bondage</i>, and can only exhort others by my writing, and show my submission to God by my <i>patient suffering</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The vocation wherewith ye are called</b></i> — The <i>calling</i>, κλησις, is the free invitation they have had from God to receive the privileges of the Gospel, and become his sons and daughters, without being obliged to observe Jewish rites and ceremonies. Their vocation, or calling, took in their Christian profession, with all the doctrines, precepts, privileges, duties, c., of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>Among us, a man's <i>calling</i> signifies his <i>trade</i>, or <i>occupation</i> in life that at which he <i>works</i>, and by which he <i>gets his bread</i>; and it is termed his <i>calling</i>, because it is supposed that God, in the course of his providence, calls the person to be thus employed, and thus to acquire his livelihood. Now, as it is a very poor <i>calling</i> by which a man <i>cannot live</i>, so it is a poor <i>religion</i> by which a man cannot get his soul <i>saved</i>. If, however, a man have an honest and useful trade, and employ himself diligently in labouring at it, he will surely be able to maintain himself by it; but without care, attention, and industry, he is not likely to get, even by this <i>providential calling</i>, the necessaries of life. In like manner, if a man do not walk worthy of his heavenly calling, i.e. suitable to its prescriptions, spirit, and design, he is not likely to get his soul saved unto eternal life. The best <i>trade</i>, unpractised, will not support any man; the most pure and holy religion of the Lord Jesus, unapplied, will save no soul. Many suppose, because they have a <i>sound faith</i>, that all is safe and well: as well might the mechanic, who knows he has a <i>good trade</i>, and that he understands the principles of it well, suppose it will maintain him, though he brings none of its principles into action by honest, assiduous, and well-directed labour.</p>
<p>Some suppose that the <i>calling</i> refers to the epithets usually given to the Christians; such as <i>children of Abraham, children of</i> <i>God, true Israel of God, heirs of God, saints, fellow citizens</i> <i>with the saints</i>, c., c. and that these honourable appellations must be a strong excitement to the Ephesians to walk worthy of these exalted characters But I do not find that the word κλησις, <i>calling</i>, is taken in this sense any where in the New Testament but that it has the meaning which I have given it above is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:20">1 Corinthians 7:20</span>: Εκαστος εν τη κλησει ᾑ εκληθη, εν ταυτῃ μενετω· <i>Let every man abide in the calling to which he hath been called</i>. The context shows that <i>condition, employment</i>, or <i>business of life</i>, is that to which the apostle refers.</p>
