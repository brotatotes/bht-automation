<p>Verse 10. <i><b>He that descended</b></i> — And he who descended <i>so low</i> is the same who has ascended <i>so high</i>. He came to the <i>lower parts of</i> <i>the earth</i>-the very deepest abasement; having emptied himself; taken upon him; the form of a servant, and humbled himself unto death, even the death of the cross; now he is ascended <i>far above</i> <i>all heavens</i>-higher than all height; he has a name above every name. Here his descending into the <i>lower parts of the earth</i> is put in opposition to his ascending <i>far above all heavens</i>. His abasement was unparalleled; so also is his exaltation.</p>
<p><i><b>That he might fill all things.</b></i> — That he might be the fountain whence all blessings might flow; dispensing all good things to all his creatures, according to their several capacities and necessities; and, particularly, fill both converted Jews and Gentiles with all the gifts and graces of his Holy Spirit. Hence it follows: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span></p>
