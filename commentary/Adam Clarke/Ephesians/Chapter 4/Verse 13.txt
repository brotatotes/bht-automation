<p>Verse 13. <i><b>In the unity of the faith</b></i> — Jews and Gentiles being all converted according to the doctrines laid down in the <i>faith</i>-the Christian system.</p>
<p><i><b>The knowledge of the Son of God</b></i> — A trite understanding of the mystery of the incarnation; why God was manifest in the flesh, and why this was necessary in order to human salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto a perfect man</b></i> — εις ανδρα τελειον. One thoroughly instructed; the whole body of the Church being fully taught, justified, sanctified, and sealed.</p>
<p><i><b>Measure of the stature</b></i> — The full measure of knowledge, love, and holiness, which the Gospel of Christ requires. Many preachers, and multitudes of professing people, are studious to find out how many imperfections and infidelities, and how much inward sinfulness, is consistent with a <i>safe state</i> in religion but how few, very few, are bringing out the fair Gospel standard to try the height of the members of the Church; whether they be fit for the heavenly army; whether their stature be such as qualifies them for the ranks of the Church militant! The <i>measure of the</i> <i>stature of the fulness</i> is seldom seen; the <i>measure of the stature</i> <i>of littleness, dwarfishness</i>, and <i>emptiness</i>, is often exhibited.</p>
