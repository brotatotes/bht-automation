<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Be no more children</b></i> — <i>Children</i>, here, are opposed to the <i>perfect man</i> in the preceding verse; and the state of both is well explained by the apostle's allusions. The man is grown up strong and healthy, and has attained such a measure or height as qualifies him for the most respectable place in the ranks of his country.</p>
<p>The child is ignorant, weak, and unsteady, tossed about in the nurse's arms, or whirled round in the giddy sports or mazes of youth; this seems to be the apostle's allusion. Being tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, refers to some kind of ancient play, but <i>what</i> I cannot absolutely determine; probably to something similar to a <i>top</i>, or to our paper <i>kite</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>By the sleight of men</b></i> — The words εν τη κυβεια refer to the arts used by gamesters, who employ false <i>dice</i> that will always throw up one kind of number, which is that by which those who play with them cannot win.</p>
<p><i><b>Cunning craftiness</b></i> — It is difficult to give a literal translation of the original words: εν πανουργια προς τηνμεθοδειαν της πλανης. "By cunning, for the purpose of using the various means of deception." πανουργια signifies <i>craft</i> and <i>subtlety</i> in general, <i>cheating</i> and <i>imposition</i>: μεθοδεια, from which we have our term <i>method</i>, signifies a <i>wile</i>, a <i>particular sleight, mode of</i> <i>tricking</i> and <i>deceiving</i>; it is applied to the <i>arts</i> which the devil uses to deceive and destroy souls; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>, called there the WILES <i>of the devil</i>. From this it seems that various arts were used, both by the Greek sophists and the Judaizing teachers, to render the Gospel of none effect, or to adulterate and corrupt it.</p>
