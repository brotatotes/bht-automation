<p>Verse 15. <i><b>But, speaking the truth in love</b></i> — The <i>truth</i> recommended by the apostle is the whole system of Gospel doctrine; this they are to teach and preach, and this is opposed to the <i>deceit</i> mentioned above. This truth, as it is the doctrine of God's eternal love to mankind, must be preached in <i>love</i>. Scolding and abuse from the pulpit or press, in matters of religion, are truly <i>monstrous</i>. He who has the truth of God has no need of any means to defend or propagate it, but those which love to God and man provides.</p>
<p><i><b>Grow up into him</b></i> — This is a continuance of the metaphor taken from the members of a human body receiving nourishment equally and growing up, each in its due proportion to other parts, and to the body in general. The truth of God should be so preached to all the members of the Church of God, that they may all receive an increase of grace and life; so that each, in whatever state he may be, may get forward in the way of truth and holiness. In the Church of Christ there are persons in various states: the <i>careless</i>, the <i>penitent</i>, the <i>lukewarm</i>, the <i>tempted</i>, the <i>diffident</i>, the <i>little child</i>, the <i>young man</i>, and the <i>father</i>. He who has got a talent for the edification of only one of those classes should not stay long in a place, else the whole body cannot grow up in all things under <i>his</i> ministry.</p>
