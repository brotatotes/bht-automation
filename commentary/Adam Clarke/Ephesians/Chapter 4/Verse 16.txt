<p>Verse 16. <i><b>From whom the whole body</b></i> — Dr. Macknight has a just view of this passage, and I cannot express my own in more suitable terms: "The apostle's meaning is, that, as the human body is formed by the union of all the members to each other, under the head, and by the fitness of each member for its own office and place in the body, so the Church is formed by the union of its members under Christ, the head. Farther, as the human body increases till it arrives at maturity by the energy of every part in performing its proper function, and by the sympathy of every part with the whole, so the body or Church of Christ grows to maturity by the proper exercise of the gifts and graces of individuals for the benefit of the whole."</p>
<p>This verse is another proof of the wisdom and learning of the apostle. Not only the general ideas here are anatomical, but the whole phraseology is the same. The <i>articulation</i> of the <i>bones</i>, the <i>composition</i> and <i>action</i> of the <i>muscles</i>, the <i>circulation</i> of the <i>fluids</i>, carrying nourishment to every part, and depositing some in every place, the <i>energy</i> of the <i>system</i> in keeping up all the functions, being particularly introduced, and the whole terminating in the general process of <i>nutrition</i>, increasing the body, and supplying all the <i>waste</i> that had taken place in consequence of labour, &amp;c. Let any medical man, who understands the apostle's language, take up this verse, and he will be convinced that the apostle had all these things in view. I am surprised that some of those who have looked for the discoveries of the <i>moderns</i> among the <i>ancients</i>, have not brought in the apostle's word επιχορηγια, <i>supply</i>, from επιχορηγεω, to <i>lead up,</i> <i>lead along, minister, supply</i>, &amp;c., as some proof that the <i>circulation of the blood</i> was not unknown to St. Paul!</p>
