<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Walk not as other Gentiles walk</b></i> — Ye are called to holiness by the Gospel, the other Gentiles have no such calling; walk not as <i>they</i> walk. In this and the two following verses the apostle gives a most awful account of the conduct of the heathens who were without the knowledge of the true God. I shall note the particulars.</p>
<p>1. They walked <i>in the vanity of their mind</i>, εν ματαιοτητι του νοος αυτων. <i>In the foolishness of their mind</i>; want of <i>genuine</i> <i>wisdom</i> is that to which the apostle refers, and it was through this that the Gentiles became addicted to every species of <i>idolatry</i>; and they fondly imagined that they could obtain help from gods which were the work of their own hands! Here their foolishness was manifested.</p>
