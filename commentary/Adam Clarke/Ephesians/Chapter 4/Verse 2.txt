<p><i><b>Forbearing one another</b></i> — ανεχομενοι αλληλων. <i>Sustaining one</i> <i>another</i>-helping to <i>support</i> each other in all the miseries and trials of life: or, if the word be taken in the sense of <i>bearing</i> <i>with each other</i>, it may mean that, through the love of God working in our hearts, we should bear with each other's infirmities, ignorance, &amp;c., knowing how much others have been or are still obliged to bear with us.</p>
