<p>Verse 20. <i><b>But ye have not so learned Christ</b></i> — Ye have received the doctrines of Christianity, and therefore are taught differently; ye have received the Spirit of Christ, and therefore are saved from such dispositions. Some would point and translate the original thus: Ὑμεις δε ουχ οὑτως· εμαθετε τον Χριστον· <i>But</i> <i>ye are not thus; ye have learned Christ</i>.</p>
