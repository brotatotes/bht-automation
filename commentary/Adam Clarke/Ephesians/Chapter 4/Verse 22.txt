<p>Verse 22. <i><b>That ye put off</b></i> — And this has been one especial part of our teaching, that ye should abandon all these, and live a life totally opposite to what it was before.</p>
<p><i><b>The old man</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>, and especially the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:14">Romans 13:14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is corrupt</b></i> — The whole of your former life was corrupt and abominable; ye lived in the pursuit of <i>pleasure</i> and <i>happiness</i>; ye sought this in the <i>gratification</i> of the <i>lusts</i> of the <i>flesh</i>; and were ever <i>deceived</i> by these lusts, and <i>disappointed</i> in your expectations.</p>
