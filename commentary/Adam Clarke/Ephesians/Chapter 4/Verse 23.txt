<p>Verse 23. <i><b>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind</b></i> â€” Their <i>old</i> <i>mode</i> of living was to be abandoned; a <i>new</i> one to be assumed. The <i>mind</i> is to be renovated; and not only its <i>general</i> complexion, but the very <i>spirit</i> of it; all its faculties and powers must be thoroughly, completely, and universally renewed. Plautus uses a similar expression describing deep distress, and answerable to our phrase <i>innermost soul</i>: - </p>
