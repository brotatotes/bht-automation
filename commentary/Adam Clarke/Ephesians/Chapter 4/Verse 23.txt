Verse 23. And be renewed in the spirit of your mind â€” Their old mode of living was to be abandoned; a new one to be assumed. The mind is to be renovated; and not only its general complexion, but the very spirit of it; all its faculties and powers must be thoroughly, completely, and universally renewed. Plautus uses a similar expression describing deep distress, and answerable to our phrase innermost soul: -  Paupertas, pavor territat mentem animi.  Poverty and dread alarm my innermost soul. Epid., l. 519.
