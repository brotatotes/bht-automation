<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Put on the new man</b></i> — Get a new nature; for in Christ Jesus-under the Christian dispensation, neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new <i>creation</i>. Therefore ye must be renewed in the spirit of your mind.</p>
<p><i><b>Which after God is created in righteousness</b></i> — Here is certainly an allusion to the creation of man. Moses tells us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:27">Genesis 1:27</span>, that <i>God created man in his</i> own <i>image</i>; that is, God was the <i>model</i> according to which he was <i>formed</i> in the spirit of his mind. St. Paul says here that they <i>should put on the new man, which after</i> <i>God is created in righteousness and true holiness</i>, or, οσιοτητι της αληθειας, in the holiness of truth. Both certainly refer to the same thing, and the one illustrates the other. From the apostle we learn what Moses meant by the <i>image of God</i>; it was <i>righteousness and the truth of holiness</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>. It is not this or the other <i>degree</i> of moral good which the soul is to receive by Jesus Christ, it is the <i>whole image of God</i>; it is to be formed κατα θεου, <i>according to God</i>; the likeness of the Divine Being is to be traced upon his soul, and he is to bear that as fully as his first father Adam bore it in the beginning.</p>
