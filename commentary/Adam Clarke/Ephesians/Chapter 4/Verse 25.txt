<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Wherefore putting away lying</b></i> — All <i>falsity</i>, all <i>prevarication</i>, because this is opposite to the <i>truth</i> as it is in Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:21">Ephesians 4:21</span>, and to the <i>holiness</i> of <i>truth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Speak every man truth with his neighbour</b></i> — Truth was but of small account among many of even the best heathens, for they taught that on many occasions a <i>lie</i> was to be <i>preferred</i> to the <i>truth</i> itself. Dr. <i>Whitby collects</i> some of their maxims on this head.</p>
<p>Κρειττον δε ελεσθαι ψευδος, η αληθες κακον· "A lie is better than a hurtful truth."-<i>Menander</i>.</p>
<p>Το γαρ αγαθον κρειττον εστι της αληθειας· "<i>Good</i> is better than <i>truth</i>."-<i>Proclus</i>.</p>
<p>Ενθα γαρ τι δει και ψευδος λεγεσθαι, λεγεσθω. "When telling a lie will be profitable, let it be told."-<i>Darius</i> in <i>Herodotus</i>, lib. iii. p. 101.</p>
<p>"He may lie who knows how to do it εν δεοντι καιρῳ, in a suitable time."-<i>Plato</i> apud <i>Stob</i>., ser. 12.</p>
<p>"There is nothing decorous in truth but when it is profitable; yea, sometimes και ψευδος ωνησεν ανθρωπους, και τ' αληθες εβλαψεν, truth is hurtful, and lying is profitable to men."-<i>Maximus Tyrius</i>, Diss. 3, p. 29.</p>
<p>Having been brought up in such a loose system of morality, these converted Gentiles had need of these apostolic directions; <i>Put</i> <i>away lying; speak the truth</i>: Let lying never come near you; let truth be ever present with you.</p>
<p><i><b>We are members one of another.</b></i> — Consider yourselves as <i>one</i> <i>body</i>, of which Jesus Christ is the <i>head</i>; and as a man's right hand would not deceive or wrong his left hand, so deal honestly with each other; <i>for ye are members one of another</i>.</p>
