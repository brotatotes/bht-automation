<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Neither give place to the devil.</b></i> — Your adversary will strive to influence your mind, and irritate your spirit; watch and pray that he may not get any place <i>in</i> you, or ascendancy <i>over</i> you.</p>
<p>As the word διαβολος is sometimes used to signify a <i>calumniator,</i> <i>tale-bearer, whisperer</i>, or <i>backbiter</i>; (see in the original, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:2">2 Timothy 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:3">Titus 3:3</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>;) here it may have the same signification. Do not open your ear to the <i>tale-bearer</i>, to the <i>slanderer</i>, who comes to you with accusations against your brethren, or with surmisings and evil speakings. These are human devils; they may be the means of making you angry, even without any solid pretence; therefore give them no place, that you may not be angry at any time; but if, unhappily, you should be overtaken in this fault, let not the sun go down upon your wrath; go to your brother, against whom you have found your spirit irritated; tell him what you have heard, and what you fear; let your ears be open to receive his own account; carefully listen to his own explanation; and, if possible, let the matter be finally settled, that Satan may not gain advantage over either.</p>
