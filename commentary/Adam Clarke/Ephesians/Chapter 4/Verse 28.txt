<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Let him that stole steal no more</b></i> â€” It is supposed that, among the rabbins, stealing was not entirely discountenanced, provided a portion was given to the poor. The apostle here teaches them a different doctrine: as they should speak truth every man with his neighbour, so they should in every respect act <i>honestly</i>, for nothing contrary to <i>truth</i> and <i>righteousness</i> could be tolerated under the Christian system. Let no man, under pretence of helping the poor, defraud another; but let him <i>labour, working with his hands</i> to provide that which is <i>good</i>, that he may have to give to him who is in necessity. <i>Stealing, overreaching, defrauding, purloining</i>, &amp;c., are consistent with no kind of religion that acknowledges the <i>true</i> <i>God</i>. If Christianity does not make men honest, it does nothing for them. Those who are not saved from dishonesty <i>fear</i> not <i>God</i>, though they may <i>dread man</i>.</p>
