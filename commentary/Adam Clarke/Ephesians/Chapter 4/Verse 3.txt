<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>. <i><b>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>bond of peace.</b></i> — There can be no doubt that the Church at Ephesus was composed partly of converted <i>Jews</i>, as well as <i>Gentiles</i>. Now, from the different manner in which they had been brought up, there might be frequent causes of <i>altercation</i>. Indeed, the Jews, though converted, might be envious that the Gentiles were admitted to the same glorious privileges with themselves, without being initiated into them by bearing the <i>yoke</i> and <i>burden</i> of the Mosaic law. The apostle guards them against this, and shows them that they should <i>intensely labour</i> (for so the word σπουδαζειν implies) to promote and preserve <i>peace</i> and <i>unity</i>. By the <i>unity of the Spirit</i> we are to understand, not only a <i>spiritual</i> unity, but also a unity of sentiments, desires, and affections, such as is worthy of and springs from the Spirit of God. By the <i>bond of peace</i> we are to understand a peace or union, where the interests of all parties are concentrated, cemented, and sealed; the Spirit of God being the seal upon this knot.</p>
