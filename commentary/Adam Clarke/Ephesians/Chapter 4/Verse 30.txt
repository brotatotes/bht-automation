<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God</b></i> — By giving way to any wrong temper, unholy word, or unrighteous action. Even those who have already a measure of the light and life of God, both of which are not only brought in by the Holy Spirit, but maintained by his constant indwelling, may give way to sin, and so grieve this Holy Spirit that it shall <i>withdraw</i> both its <i>light</i> and <i>presence</i>; and, in proportion as it withdraws, then <i>hardness</i> and <i>darkness</i> take place; and, what is still worse, a state of <i>insensibility</i> is the consequence; for the <i>darkness</i> prevents the fallen state from being <i>seen</i>, and the <i>hardness</i> prevents it from being <i>felt</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whereby ye are sealed</b></i> — The Holy Spirit in the soul of a believer is <i>God's seal</i>, set on his heart to testify that he is God's property, and that he should be wholly <i>employed</i> in God's <i>service</i>. It is very likely that the apostle had in view the words of the prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:10">Isaiah 63:10</span>: <i>But they rebelled</i>, and VEXED <i>his</i> HOLY SPIRIT; <i>therefore he was</i> <i>turned to be their enemy, and fought against them</i>. The psalmist refers to the same fact in nearly the same words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:40">Psalms 78:40</span>: <i>How oft did they</i> PROVOKE <i>him in the wilderness, and</i> GRIEVE <i>him in</i> <i>the desert</i>! Let every man, therefore, take heed that he grieve not the Spirit of God, lest God <i>turn to be his enemy</i>, and <i>fight</i> <i>against him</i>.</p>
