<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Let all bitterness</b></i> — πασα πικρια. It is astonishing that any who profess the Christian name should indulge <i>bitterness</i> of spirit. Those who are <i>censorious</i>, who are <i>unmerciful</i> to the <i>failings</i> of others, who have fixed a <i>certain standard</i> by which they measure all persons in all circumstances, and unchristian every one that does not come up to this standard, these have the <i>bitterness</i> against which the apostle speaks. In the last century there was a compound medicine, made up from a variety of drastic acrid drugs and ardent spirits, which was called <i>Hiera Picra</i>, ιερα πικρα, the <i>holy bitter</i>; this medicine was administered in a multitude of cases, where it did immense evil, and perhaps in scarcely any case did it do good. It has ever appeared to me to furnish a proper epithet for the disposition mentioned above, the <i>holy bitter</i>; for the religiously censorious act under the pretence of superior <i>sanctity</i>. I have known such persons do much evil in a Christian society, but never knew an instance of their doing any good.</p>
<p><i><b>And wrath</b></i> — θυμος is more properly <i>anger</i>, which may be considered the <i>commencement</i> of the passion.</p>
<p><i><b>Anger</b></i> — οργν is more properly <i>wrath</i>-the passion carried to its <i>highest pitch</i>, accompanied with <i>injurious words</i> and <i>outrageous</i> <i>acts</i>, some of which are immediately specified.</p>
<p><i><b>And clamour</b></i> — κραυγη Loud and obstreperous speaking, brawling, railing, <i>boisterous</i> talk, often the offspring of <i>wrath</i>; all of which are highly unbecoming the <i>meek, loving, quiet, sedate</i> mind of Christ and his followers.</p>
<p><i><b>And evil speaking</b></i> — βλασφημια. <i>Blasphemy</i>; that is, <i>injurious</i> <i>speaking</i>-words which tend to hurt those <i>of</i> whom or <i>against</i> whom they are spoken.</p>
<p><i><b>With all malice</b></i> — κακια. <i>All malignity</i>; as <i>anger</i> produces <i>wrath</i>, and wrath <i>clamour</i>, so all together produce <i>malice</i>; that is, settled, sullen, fell wrath, which is always looking out for opportunities to revenge itself by the destruction of the object of its indignation. No state of society can be even <i>tolerable</i> where these prevail; and, if <i>eternity</i> were out of the question, it is of the utmost consequence to have these banished from <i>time</i>.</p>
