<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:6">Ephesians 4:6</span>. <i><b>One God</b></i> — The fountain of all being, self-existent and eternal; and <i>Father of all</i>, both Jews and Gentiles, because he is the Father of the spirits of all flesh.</p>
<p><i><b>Who</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>above all</b></i> — ο επι παντων. <i>Who is over all</i>; as the King of kings, and Lord of lords.</p>
<p><i><b>And through all</b></i> — Pervading every thing; being present with every thing; providing for all creatures; and by his energy supporting all things.</p>
<p><i><b>And in you all.</b></i> — By the energy of his Spirit, enlightening, quickening, purifying, and comforting; in a word, making your hearts the temples of the Holy Ghost. Some think the mystery of the blessed Trinity is contained in this verse: God is over all, as <i>Father</i>; <i>through all</i>, by the <i>Logos</i> or <i>Word</i>; and <i>in all</i>, by the <i>Holy Spirit</i>.</p>
