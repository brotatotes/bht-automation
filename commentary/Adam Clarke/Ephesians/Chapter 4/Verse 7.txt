<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Unto every one of us is given grace</b></i> â€” <i>Grace</i> may here signify a particular <i>office</i>; as if the apostle had said: Though we are all <i>equal</i> in the respects already mentioned, yet we have all different offices and situations to fill up in the Church and in the world; and we receive a <i>free gift</i> from Christ, according to the nature of the <i>office</i>, that we may be able to discharge it according to his own mind. So the <i>free gift</i>, which we receive from Christ, is according to the office or function which he has given us to fulfil; and the <i>office</i> is according to that <i>free gift</i>, each suited to the other.</p>
