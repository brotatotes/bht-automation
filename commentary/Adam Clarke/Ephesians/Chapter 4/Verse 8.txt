<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Wherefore he saith</b></i> — The reference seems to be to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:18">Psalms 68:18</span>, which, however it may speak of the removal of the tabernacle, appears to have been intended to point out the glorious ascension of Christ after his resurrection from the dead. The expositions of various commentators have made the place extremely difficult. I shall not trouble my reader with them; they may be seen in <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>When he ascended up on high</b></i> — The whole of this verse, as it stands in the psalm, seems to refer to a military triumph. Take the following paraphrase: <i>Thou hast ascended on high</i>: the conqueror was placed in a very <i>elevated</i> chariot. <i>Thou hast led</i> <i>captivity captive</i>: the conquered kings and generals were usually bound behind the chariot of the conqueror, to grace the triumph. <i>Thou host received gifts for</i> (Paul, <i>given gifts unto</i>) <i>men</i>: at such times the conqueror was wont to throw <i>money</i> among the crowd. <i>Even to the rebellious</i>: those who had fought against him now submit unto him, and share his munificence; for it is the property of a hero to be generous. <i>That the Lord God might dwell among</i> <i>them</i>: the conqueror being now come to fix his abode in the conquered provinces, and subdue the people to his laws.</p>
<p>All this the apostle applies to the resurrection, ascension, and glory of Christ; though it has been doubted by some learned men whether the psalmist had this in view. I shall not dispute about this; it is enough for me that the apostle, under the inspiration of God, applied the verse in this way; and whatever David might intend, and of whatever event he might have written, we see plainly that the sense in which the apostle uses it was the sense of the Spirit of God; for the Spirit in the Old and New Testaments is the same. I may venture a short criticism on a few words in the original: <i>Thou hast received gifts for men</i>, לקחת מתנות באדם lakachta mattanoth baadam, thou hast taken gifts in man, in Adam. The gifts which Jesus Christ distributes <i>to man</i> he has received <i>in man</i>, in and by virtue of his <i>incarnation</i>; and it is in consequence of his being made man that it may be said, <i>The Lord</i> <i>God dwells among them</i>; for Jesus was called <i>Immanuel</i>, God with us, in consequence of his incarnation. This view of the subject is consistent with the whole economy of grace, and suits well with the apostle's application of the words of the psalmist in this place.</p>
