<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1">Ephesians 5:1</span>. <i><b>Be ye therefore followers of God</b></i> — The beginning of this chapter is properly a continuation of the preceding, which should have ended with the second verse of this. The word μιμηται, which we translate <i>followers</i>, signifies such as <i>personate others</i>, assuming their gait, mode of speech, accent, carriage, c. and it is from this Greek word that we have the word <i>mimic</i>. Though this term is often used in a ludicrous sense, yet here it is to be understood in a very solemn and proper sense. Let your whole conduct be like that of your Lord; <i>imitate</i> him in all your actions, words, spirit, and inclinations; imitate him as children do their beloved parents, and remember that you stand in the relation of <i>beloved children</i> to him. It is natural for children to imitate their parents; it is their constant aim to learn of them, and to copy them in all things; whatever they see the parent do, whatever they hear him speak, that they endeavour to copy and imitate; yea, they go farther, they insensibly copy the very <i>tempers</i> of their parents. If ye therefore be children of God, show this love to your heavenly Father, and imitate all his moral perfections, and acquire the mind that was in Jesus.</p>
