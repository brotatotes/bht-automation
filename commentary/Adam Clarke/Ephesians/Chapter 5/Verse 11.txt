<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Have no fellowship</b></i> — Have no religious connection whatever with heathens or their worship.</p>
<p><i><b>Unfruitful works of darkness</b></i> — Probably alluding to the <i>mysteries</i> among the heathens, and the different lustrations and rites through which the <i>initiated</i> went in the caves and dark recesses where these mysteries were celebrated; all which he denominates <i>works of darkness</i>, because they were destitute of true <i>wisdom</i>; and <i>unfruitful works</i>, because they were of no use to mankind; the initiated being obliged, on pain of death, to keep secret what they had <i>seen, heard</i>, and <i>done</i>: hence they were called απορρητα μυστηρια, <i>unspeakable mysteries</i>-things that were <i>not to</i> <i>be divulged</i>. That the apostle may refer to magic and incantations is also probable, for to these the Ephesians were greatly addicted. <i>See the proofs in Clarke's notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Rather reprove them.</b></i> — Bear a <i>testimony</i> against them; <i>convince</i> them that they are wrong; <i>confute</i> them in their vain reasons; <i>reprove</i> them for their vices, which are flagrant, while pretending to superior illumination. All these meanings has the Greek word ελεγχω, which we generally render to <i>convince</i> or <i>reprove</i>.</p>
