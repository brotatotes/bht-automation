<p>Verse 13. <i><b>But all things that are reproved</b></i> — Dr. Macknight paraphrases this verse as follows: "<i>Now all these reprovable</i> <i>actions</i>, ελεγχομενα, which are practised in celebrating these mysteries, <i>are made manifest</i> as sinful <i>by the Gospel</i>; and, seeing <i>every thing which discovers the true nature of actions is light</i>, the Gospel, which discovers the evil nature of the actions performed in these mysteries, is light."</p>
<p>The apostle speaks against these mysteries as he speaks against fornication, uncleanness, and covetousness; but by no means either borrows expression or similitude from them to illustrate Divine truths; for, as it would be a <i>shame</i> even <i>to speak of those things</i>, surely it would be an <i>abomination</i> to allude to them in the illustration of the doctrines of the Gospel.</p>
