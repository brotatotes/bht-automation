<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Wherefore he saith</b></i> â€” It is a matter of doubt and controversy whence this saying is derived. Some think it taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+26:19">Isaiah 26:19</span>: <i>Thy dead men shall live; with my dead body shall they arise; Awake</i> <i>and sing, ye that dwell in the dust</i>, c. Others think that it is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1-3">Isaiah 60:1-3</span>: <i>Arise, shine for thy light is come</i>, c. But these passages neither give the words nor the meaning of the apostle. <i>Epiphanius</i> supposed them to be taken from an ancient prophecy of <i>Elijah</i>, long since lost: <i>Syncellus</i> and <i>Euthalius</i> think they were taken from an apocryphal work attributed to <i>Jeremiah</i> the prophet: others, that they made part of a <i>hymn</i> then used in the Christian Church for that there were, in the apostle's time, hymns and spiritual songs, as well as psalms, we learn from himself, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span>, and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+3:16">Colossians 3:16</span>. The hymn is supposed to have begun thus:- </p>
<p>As a man <i>asleep</i> neither knows nor does any thing that can be called good or useful, so the Gentiles and all others, while without the knowledge of Christianity, had not only no proper knowledge of vice and virtue, but they had no correct notion of the true God.</p>
<p>As the <i>dead</i> can perform no function of life, so the Gentiles and the unconverted were incapable of performing any thing worthy either of <i>life</i> or <i>being</i>. But though they were asleep-in a state of complete spiritual torpor, yet they might be awoke by the voice of the Gospel; and though <i>dead</i> to all goodness, and to every function of the spiritual life, yet, as their <i>animal life</i> was whole in them, and <i>perception</i> and <i>reason</i> were still left, they were capable of hearing the Gospel, and under that influence which always accompanies it when faithfully preached, they could discern its excellency, and find it to be the power of God to their salvation. And they are addressed by the apostle as possessing this capacity; and, on their using it properly, have the promise that Christ shall enlighten them.</p>
