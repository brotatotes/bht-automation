<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Walk circumspectly</b></i> — Our word <i>circumspect</i>, from the Latin <i>circirmspicio</i>, signifies to look round about on all hands; to be every way watchful, wary, and cautious, in order to avoid danger, discern enemies before they come too nigh, and secure a man's interest by every possible and lawful means. But the original word ακριβως signifies <i>correctly, accurately,</i> <i>consistently</i>, or <i>perfectly</i>. Be ye, who have received the truth, careful of your conduct; walk by the rule which God has given you; do this as well in little as in great matters; exemplify your principles, which are holy and good, by a corresponding conduct; do not only profess, but <i>live</i> the Gospel. As you embrace all its <i>promises</i>, be careful also to embrace all its <i>precepts</i>; and behave yourselves so, that your enemies may never be able to say that ye are <i>holy</i> in your <i>doctrines</i> and <i>profession</i>, but <i>irregular</i> in your <i>lives</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Not as fools, but as wise</b></i> — Μη ὡς ασοφοι, αλλ' ὡς σοφοι. The heathens affected to be called σοφοι, or <i>wise men</i>. Pythagoras was perhaps the first who corrected this vanity, by assuming the title of φιλοσοφος, <i>a lover of wisdom</i>; hence our term <i>philosopher</i>, used now in a much <i>prouder</i> sense than that in which the great Pythagoras wished it to be applied. The apostle here takes the term σοφος, and applies it to the <i>Christian</i>; and, instead of it, gives the empty Gentile philosopher the title of ασοφος, <i>without</i> <i>wisdom, fool</i>.</p>
