<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Redeeming the time</b></i> — Εξαγοραζομενοι τον καιρον· Buying up those moments which others seem to throw away; steadily improving every present moment, that ye may, in some measure, <i>regain</i> the time ye have <i>lost</i>. Let <i>time</i> be your chief commodity; deal in that alone; buy it all up, and use every portion of it yourselves. <i>Time</i> is that on which <i>eternity depends</i>; in <i>time</i> ye are to get a preparation for the kingdom of God; if you get not this <i>in</i> time, your ruin is inevitable; therefore, buy up the time.</p>
<p>Some think there is an allusion here to the case of <i>debtors</i>, who, by giving some valuable consideration to their creditors, obtain farther time for paying their debts. And this appears to be the sense in which it is used by the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+2:8">Daniel 2:8</span>: Επ' αληθειας οιδα εγω, ὁτι καιρον ὑμεις εξαγοραζετε· <i>I know certainly</i> <i>that ye would gain</i> or <i>buy time</i>-ye wish to have the time <i>prolonged,</i> that ye may seek out for some plausible explanation of the dream. Perhaps the apostle means in general, <i>embrace</i> every <i>opportunity</i> to glorify God, save your own souls, and do good to men.</p>
<p><i><b>Because the days are evil.</b></i> — The present times are dangerous, they are full of trouble and temptations, and only the watchful and diligent have any reason to expect that they shall keep their garments unspotted.</p>
