<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Wherefore be ye not unwise</b></i> — Μη γινεσθε αφρονες· <i>Do</i> <i>not become madmen</i>. Here is a most evident allusion to the <i>orgies</i> <i>of Bacchus</i>, in which his votaries acted like madmen; running about, tossing their heads from shoulder to shoulder, appearing to be in every sense completely frantic. See the whole of the passage in <i>Livy</i>, to which I have referred on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:12">Ephesians 5:12</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>But understanding what the will of the Lord</b></i><b> is.</b>] It is the will of God that ye should be <i>sober, chaste, holy</i>, and <i>pure</i>. Get a thorough understanding of this; acquaint yourselves with God's will, that ye may know how to glorify him.</p>
