<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess</b></i> — This is a farther allusion to the <i>Bacchanalian mysteries</i>; in them his votaries got drunk, and ran into all manner of excesses. <i>Plato</i>, though he forbade <i>drunkenness</i> in general, yet allowed that the people should get drunk in the solemnities of that god who invented wine. And indeed this was their common custom; when they had offered their sacrifices they indulged themselves in drunkenness, and <i>ran</i> into all kinds of extravagance. Hence it is probable that μεθυω, <i>to get drunk</i>, is derived from μετα, <i>after,</i> and θυω, <i>to sacrifice</i>; for, having <i>completed</i> their <i>sacrifices,</i> they indulged themselves in <i>wine</i>. The word ασωτια, which we translate <i>excess</i>, means profligacy and debauchery of every kind; such as are the general concomitants of drunkenness, and especially among the votaries of Bacchus in Greece and Italy.</p>
<p><i><b>But be filled with the Spirit</b></i> — The heathen priests pretended to be filled with the influence of the god they worshipped; and it was in these circumstances that they gave out their oracles. See a remarkable instance of this quoted in the note on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:39">Luke 9:39</span><i>"</i>, where the case of a <i>Bacchanalian</i> is described. The apostle exhorts the Ephesians not to resemble these, but, instead of being filled with wine, to be filled with the Spirit of God; in consequence of which, instead of those <i>discoveries</i> of the Divine will to which in their drunken worship the votaries of Bacchus pretended, they should be wise indeed, and should understand what the will of the Lord is.</p>
