<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Speaking to yourselves in psalms</b></i> — We can scarcely say what is the exact difference between these three expressions. <i>Psalms</i>, ψαλμοι, may probably mean those of David.</p>
<p><i><b>Hymns</b></i> — υμνοις. Extemporaneous effusions in praise of God, uttered under the influence of the Divine Spirit, or a sense of his especial goodness. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:25">Acts 16:25</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Songs</b></i> — ωιδαις. <i>Odes</i>; premeditated and regular poetic compositions; but, in whatever form they were composed, we learn that they were all πνευματικα, <i>spiritual</i>-tending to magnify God and edify men.</p>
<p><i><b>Singing and making melody in your heart</b></i> — The <i>heart</i> always going with the <i>lips</i>. It is a shocking profanation of Divine worship to draw nigh to God with the <i>lips</i>, while the <i>heart</i> is far from him. It is too often the case that, in public worship, men are carried off from the <i>sense</i> of the words by the <i>sounds</i> that are put to them. And how few choirs of singers are there in the universe whose <i>hearts</i> ever accompany them in what <i>they</i> call <i>singing the</i> <i>praises of God</i>!</p>
