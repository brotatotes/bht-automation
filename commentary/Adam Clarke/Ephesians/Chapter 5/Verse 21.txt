<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Submitting - one to another</b></i> — Let no man be so tenacious of his own will or his opinion in matters indifferent, as to disturb the peace of the Church; in all such matters <i>give</i> <i>way</i> to each other, and let <i>love</i> rule.</p>
<p><i><b>In the fear of God.</b></i> — Setting him always before your eyes, and considering that he has commanded you to <i>love one another</i>, and <i>to</i> <i>bear each other's burdens</i>; and that what you do in this or any other commanded case, you do as unto the Lord. Instead of εν φοβω θεου, <i>in the fear of</i> GOD, εν φοβω χριστου, <i>in the fear of</i> CHRIST, is the reading of ABDEFG, with all others of most value; besides the <i>Syriac, Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate,</i> and <i>Itala; Basil</i> the Great, and <i>Chrysostom</i>. Neither reading makes any difference in the <i>sense</i>.</p>
