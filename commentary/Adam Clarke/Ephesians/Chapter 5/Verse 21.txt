Verse 21. Submitting - one to another — Let no man be so tenacious of his own will or his opinion in matters indifferent, as to disturb the peace of the Church; in all such matters give way to each other, and let love rule.In the fear of God. — Setting him always before your eyes, and considering that he has commanded you to love one another, and to bear each other's burdens; and that what you do in this or any other commanded case, you do as unto the Lord. Instead of εν φοβω θεου, in the fear of GOD, εν φοβω χριστου, in the fear of CHRIST, is the reading of ABDEFG, with all others of most value; besides the Syriac, Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, and Itala; Basil the Great, and Chrysostom. Neither reading makes any difference in the sense.
