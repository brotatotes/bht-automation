<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands</b></i> — As the <i>Lord</i>, viz. <i>Christ</i>, is the <i>head</i> or governor of the <i>Church</i>, and the head of the man, so is the man the <i>head</i> or <i>governor</i> of the <i>woman</i>. This is God's ordinance, and should not be transgressed. The husband should not be a <i>tyrant</i>, and the wife should not be the <i>governor</i>. Old <i>Francis Quarles</i>, in his homely rhymes, alluding to the superstitious notion, that the <i>crowing</i> of a <i>hen bodes ill luck</i> to the family, has said:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Ill thrives the hapless family that shows</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> A <i>cock</i> that's <i>silent</i>, and a <i>hen</i> that <i>crows</i>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> I know not which live most <i>unnatural</i> lives,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>Obeying</i> husbands or <i>commanding</i> wives." </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p><i><b>As unto the Lord.</b></i> — The word <i>Church</i> seems to be necessarily understood here; that is: Act under the authority of your husbands, as the <i>Church</i> acts under the authority of Christ. As the <i>Church</i> submits to the Lord, so let wives submit to their husbands.</p>
