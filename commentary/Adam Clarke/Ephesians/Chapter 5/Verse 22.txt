Verse 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands — As the Lord, viz. Christ, is the head or governor of the Church, and the head of the man, so is the man the head or governor of the woman. This is God's ordinance, and should not be transgressed. The husband should not be a tyrant, and the wife should not be the governor. Old Francis Quarles, in his homely rhymes, alluding to the superstitious notion, that the crowing of a hen bodes ill luck to the family, has said:-  "Ill thrives the hapless family that shows A cock that's silent, and a hen that crows: I know not which live most unnatural lives, Obeying husbands or commanding wives."  As unto the Lord. — The word Church seems to be necessarily understood here; that is: Act under the authority of your husbands, as the Church acts under the authority of Christ. As the Church submits to the Lord, so let wives submit to their husbands.
