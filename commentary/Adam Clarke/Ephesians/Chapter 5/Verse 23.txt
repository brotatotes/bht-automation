<p>Verse 23. <i><b>For the husband is the head of the wife</b></i> — This is the reason which the apostle gives for his injunctions. See above.</p>
<p><i><b>He is the Saviour of the body.</b></i> — As Christ exercises authority over the Church so as to <i>save</i> and <i>protect</i> it, so let the husband exercise authority over his wife by <i>protecting, comforting</i>, and <i>providing</i> her with every <i>necessary</i> and <i>comfort</i> of life, according to his power.</p>
