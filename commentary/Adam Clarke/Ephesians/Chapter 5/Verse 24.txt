<p>Verse 24. <i><b>In every thing.</b></i> â€” That is, every <i>lawful thing</i>; for it is not intimated that they should obey their husbands in any thing <i>criminal</i>, or in any thing detrimental to the <i>interests of their</i> <i>souls</i>. The husband may be profligate, and may wish his wife to become such also; he may be an enemy to true religion, and use his authority to prevent his wife from those means of grace which she finds salutary to her soul; in <i>none</i> of <i>these things</i> should she obey him.</p>
