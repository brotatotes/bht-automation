<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Husbands, love your wives</b></i> â€” Here is a grand rule, according to which every husband is called to act: <i>Love your wife</i> <i>as Christ loved the Church</i>. But <i>how</i> did Christ love the Church? <i>He gave himself for it</i>-he laid down his life for it. So then husbands should, if necessary, lay down their lives for their wives: and there is more implied in the words than mere protection and support; for, as Christ gave himself for the Church to <i>save</i> it, so husbands should, by all means in their power, labour to promote the salvation of their wives, and their constant edification in righteousness. Thus we find that the authority of the man over the woman is founded on his <i>love</i> to her, and this love must be such as to lead him to risk his life for her. As the care of the family devolves on the wife, and the children must owe the chief direction of their minds and formation of their manners to the mother, she has need of all the assistance and support which her husband can give her; and, if she performs her duty well, she deserves the utmost of his love and affection.</p>
