Verse 26. That he might sanctify and cleanse it — The Church is represented as the spouse of Christ, as the woman is the spouse of the man; and, to prepare this Church for himself, he washes, cleanses, and sanctifies it. There is certainly an allusion here to the ancient method of purifying women, who were appointed to be consorts to kings; twelve months, it appears, were in some instances spent in this purification: Six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours and with other things, for the purifying of women. See the case of Esther, Esther 2:12; see also Psalms 45:13; Psalms 45:14; Ezekiel 16:7-14.With the washing of water — Baptism, accompanied by the purifying influences of the Holy Spirit.By the word — The doctrine of Christ crucified, through which baptism is administered, sin cancelled, and the soul purified from all unrighteousness; the death of Christ giving efficacy to all.
