<p>Verse 26. <i><b>That he might sanctify and cleanse it</b></i> — The Church is represented as the <i>spouse of Christ</i>, as the woman is the <i>spouse</i> of the man; and, to prepare this Church for himself, he <i>washes,</i> <i>cleanses</i>, and <i>sanctifies</i> it. There is certainly an allusion here to the ancient method of <i>purifying women</i>, who were appointed to be consorts to kings; <i>twelve months</i>, it appears, were in some instances spent in this purification: <i>Six months with oil of</i> <i>myrrh, and six months with sweet odours and with other things, for</i> <i>the purifying of women</i>. See the case of Esther, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="es+2:12">Esther 2:12</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:13">Psalms 45:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:14">Psalms 45:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:7-14">Ezekiel 16:7-14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>With the washing of water</b></i> — Baptism, accompanied by the purifying influences of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>By the word</b></i> — The <i>doctrine</i> of Christ crucified, through which baptism is administered, sin cancelled, and the soul purified from all unrighteousness; the <i>death of Christ</i> giving efficacy to all.</p>
