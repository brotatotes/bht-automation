<p>Verse 27. <i><b>That he might present it to himself</b></i> — It was usual to bring the royal bride to the king in the most <i>sumptuous apparel</i>; and is there not here an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:13">Psalms 45:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:14">Psalms 45:14</span>: <i>The king's daughter</i> (Pharaoh's) is <i>all glorious within, her</i> <i>clothing is of wrought gold; she shall be brought unto the king</i> (Solomon) <i>in raiment of needlework</i>? This <i>presentation</i> here spoken of by the apostle will take place on the last day. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>A glorious Church</b></i> — Every way splendid and honourable, because pure and holy.</p>
<p><i><b>Not having spot</b></i> — σπιλος. No <i>blemish</i> on the <i>face</i>; no spots upon the <i>garment</i>; the <i>heart</i> and <i>life</i> both holy.</p>
<p><i><b>Wrinkle</b></i> — ρυτιδα. No mark of <i>superannuation</i> or <i>decay</i>. The word is commonly applied to <i>wrinkles on the face</i>, indicative of <i>sickness</i> or <i>decrepitude</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Holy and without blemish.</b></i> — In every sense holy, pure, and perfect. Now it was for this purpose that <i>Christ gave himself for</i> <i>the Church</i>; and for this purpose he continues the different ordinances which he has appointed; and, particularly, the preaching of the <i>word</i>-the doctrine of reconciliation through faith in his blood. And it is in <i>this life</i> that all this purification is to take place; for none shall be <i>presented</i> at the day of judgment to him who has not here been <i>sanctified, cleansed,</i> <i>washed</i>, made <i>glorious</i>, having neither <i>spot, wrinkle, blemish</i>, nor <i>any such thing</i>. How vain is the pretension of multitudes to be members of the true Church while full of <i>spots, wrinkles,</i> <i>blemishes</i>, and MANY <i>such things</i>; fondly supposing that their holiness is in their surety, because not in themselves! Reader, lay thy hand on thy conscience and say, Dost thou believe that this is St. Paul's meaning? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14">Ephesians 3:14</span>, &amp;c.</p>
