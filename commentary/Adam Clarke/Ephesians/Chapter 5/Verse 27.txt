Verse 27. That he might present it to himself — It was usual to bring the royal bride to the king in the most sumptuous apparel; and is there not here an allusion to Psalms 45:13; Psalms 45:14: The king's daughter (Pharaoh's) is all glorious within, her clothing is of wrought gold; she shall be brought unto the king (Solomon) in raiment of needlework? This presentation here spoken of by the apostle will take place on the last day. 2 Corinthians 11:2.A glorious Church — Every way splendid and honourable, because pure and holy.Not having spot — σπιλος. No blemish on the face; no spots upon the garment; the heart and life both holy.Wrinkle — ρυτιδα. No mark of superannuation or decay. The word is commonly applied to wrinkles on the face, indicative of sickness or decrepitude.Holy and without blemish. — In every sense holy, pure, and perfect. Now it was for this purpose that Christ gave himself for the Church; and for this purpose he continues the different ordinances which he has appointed; and, particularly, the preaching of the word-the doctrine of reconciliation through faith in his blood. And it is in this life that all this purification is to take place; for none shall be presented at the day of judgment to him who has not here been sanctified, cleansed, washed, made glorious, having neither spot, wrinkle, blemish, nor any such thing. How vain is the pretension of multitudes to be members of the true Church while full of spots, wrinkles, blemishes, and MANY such things; fondly supposing that their holiness is in their surety, because not in themselves! Reader, lay thy hand on thy conscience and say, Dost thou believe that this is St. Paul's meaning? Ephesians 3:14, &c.
