<p>Verse 28. <i><b>As their own bodies</b></i> â€” For the woman is, properly speaking, a <i>part</i> of the man; for God made man <i>male and female</i>, and the woman was taken out of his side; therefore is she <i>flesh of his</i> <i>flesh, and bone of his bone</i>; and therefore, he that loveth his wife loveth himself, for they two are one flesh. The apostle, in all these verses, refers to the creation and original <i>state</i> of the first human pair.</p>
