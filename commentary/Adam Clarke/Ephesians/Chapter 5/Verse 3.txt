<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>. <i><b>But fornication</b></i> — It is probable that the <i>three</i> terms used here by the apostle refer to different species of the same thing. The word <i>fornication</i>, πορνεια, may imply not only <i>fornication</i> but <i>adultery</i> also, as it frequently does; <i>uncleanness,</i> ακαθαρσια may refer to all abominable and unnatural lusts-sodomy, bestiality, &amp;c., and <i>covetousness</i>, πλεονεξια, to <i>excessive</i> <i>indulgence</i> in that which, moderately used, is lawful. As the covetous man never has enough of wealth, so the pleasure-taker and the libertine never have enough of the gratifications of sense, the appetite increasing in proportion to its indulgence. If, however, simple <i>covetousness</i>, i.e. the <i>love of gain</i>, be here intended, it shows from the connection in which it stands, (for it is linked with <i>fornication, adultery</i>, and <i>all uncleanness</i>,) how degrading it is to the soul of man, and how abominable it is in the eye of God. In other places it is ranked with <i>idolatry</i>, for the man who has an inordinate love of gain makes <i>money</i> his <i>god</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Let it not be once named</b></i> — Let no such things ever exist among you, for ye are called to be saints.</p>
