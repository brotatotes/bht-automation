<p>Verse 30. <i><b>We are members of his body</b></i> â€” He has partaken of <i>our</i> nature, as we have partaken of the nature of <i>Adam</i>. And as he is the head of the Church and the Saviour of this <i>body</i>; so we, being members of the Church, are members of his mystical body. That is, we are united to him by one Spirit in the closest intimacy, even similar to that which the members have with the body.</p>
