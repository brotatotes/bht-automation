Verse 31. Shall be joined unto his wife — προσκολληθησεται. He shall be glued or cemented to her; and, as a well-glued board will sooner break in the whole wood than in the glued joint, so death alone can part the husband and wife; and nothing but death should dissolve their affection. See Clarke's notes on Genesis 2:21-24.
