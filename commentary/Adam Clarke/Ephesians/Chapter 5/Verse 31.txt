<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Shall be joined unto his wife</b></i> — προσκολληθησεται. He shall be <i>glued</i> or <i>cemented</i> to her; and, as a <i>well-glued</i> board will sooner <i>break</i> in the <i>whole wood</i> than in the <i>glued joint</i>, so death alone can <i>part</i> the husband and wife; and nothing but <i>death</i> should dissolve their <i>affection</i>.
