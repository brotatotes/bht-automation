<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:33">Ephesians 5:33</span>. <i><b>Nevertheless</b></i> — πλην. <i>Moreover</i>, or <i>therefore</i>, on the consideration of God's design in the institution of marriage, let every one of you love his wife as himself, because she is both <i>naturally</i> and by a <i>Divine ordinance</i> a part of himself.</p>
<p><i><b>That she reverence</b></i><b> her </b><i><b>husband.</b></i> — Let the wife ever consider the husband as her head, and this he is, not only by nature, but also by the ordinance of God. These are very important matters, and on them the apostle lays great stress. See the following <i>observations</i>.</p>
<p>THERE is one subject in the preceding verse on which I could not enlarge sufficiently in the notes, and which I have reserved for this place; viz. what the apostle says concerning the <i>mystery of</i> <i>marriage</i>, which certainly has a deeper meaning than what is generally apprehended. Dr. Macknight has some good observations on this part of the subject, which I shall beg leave to lay before my readers.</p>
<p>1. "The apostle calls the formation of Eve from Adam's body, his marriage with her; and the intimate union established between them by that marriage, <i>a great mystery</i>, because it contained an important emblematical meaning concerning the regeneration of believers, and their union with Christ, which hitherto had been kept secret, but which he had discovered in the 30th verse. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:30">Ephesians 5:30</span> For there, in allusion to what Adam said concerning Eve, 'This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,' the apostle says, concerning Christ and believers: We are bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh: that is, we are parts of his body, the Church. And by this application of Adam's words concerning Eve to Christ and to his Church, he intimates, First, That the formation of Eve of a rib taken out of Adam's body was a figure of the regeneration of believers by the breaking of Christ's body, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>. Secondly, That Adam's love to Eve, on account of her being formed of his body, was a figure of Christ's love to believers because they are become his body, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:30">Ephesians 5:30</span>. Thirdly, That Adam's marriage with Eve was a figure of the eternal union of Christ with believers in heaven, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>. For he left his Father to be united to his Church.</p>
<p>2. "In giving this emblematical representation of these ancient facts, the apostle has not exceeded the bounds of probability. In the first age, neither the art of writing, nor any permanent method of conveying instruction, being invented, it was necessary to make such striking actions and events as could not easily be forgotten emblems of the instruction meant to be perpetuated. On this supposition, Adam, in whom the human race began, was a natural image of Christ, in whom the human race was to be restored; and his deep sleep, the opening of his side, and the formation of Eve of a rib taken out of his side, were fit emblems of Christ's death, of the opening of his side on the cross, and of the regeneration of believers by his death. The love which Adam expressed towards Eve, and his union with her by marriage, were lively images of Christ's love to believers, and of his eternal union with them in one society after their resurrection; and Eve herself, who was formed of a rib taken from Adam's side, was a natural image of believers, who are regenerated, both in their body and in their mind, by the breaking of Christ's side on the cross. Thus, the circumstances which accompanied the formation of Eve being fit emblems of the formation of the Church, we may suppose they were brought to pass to prefigure that great event; and, by prefiguring it, to show that it was decreed of God from the very beginning.</p>
<p>3. "The aptness, however, of these images is not the only reason for supposing that the formation of Eve, and her marriage with Adam in paradise, were emblems of the regeneration of believers by the death of Christ, and of their eternal union with him in heaven. The singular manner in which Eve was formed, and the declaration at her marriage with Adam, 'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh,' strongly lead to that conclusion. Eve was not formed of the dust of the earth, as all other living things were made, (not excepting Adam himself,) but of a rib taken from Adam's side while he was in a deep sleep. Now, for this diversity, what reason can be assigned, if that which the apostle hath suggested is not admitted? Farther: unless some deep instruction were couched under the formation of Eve, what occasion was there for Adam, at his marriage with her, to declare, 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man: therefore shall a man leave,' c.? For although the taking of Eve out of Adam might be a reason for Adam's affection towards her, it was no reason for the affection of his posterity towards their wives, who were not so formed. The reason of their love to their wives is their being creatures of the same species with themselves. This Eve might have been, though, like Adam, she had been formed of the dust of the earth. Wherefore Adam's declaration concerning Eve being taken out of his body, and concerning his love to her on that account, was intended for some purpose peculiar to himself namely, as he was a type of Him who was to restore the human race by the breaking of his body on the cross, and who on that account loves them, and will unite them to himself for ever. Upon the whole, the formation of Eve and her marriage with Adam, and his love to and union with her because she was taken out of his side, and the declaration that, on that account, all his posterity should love their wives, and continue united to them through life, (a union which does not subsist among other animals,) are events so singular, that I do not see what account can be given of them, unless, with the Apostle Paul, we suppose that, agreeably to the most ancient method of instruction, God intended these things as figurative representations of the regeneration of believers by the death of Christ, and of his eternal union with them in heaven; and that Adam and Eve were taught by God himself to consider them as such.</p>
<p>4. "It is no small confirmation of the apostle's emblematical interpretation of the formation and marriage of Eve, that in Scripture we find a variety of images and expressions founded on that interpretation. For example, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span>, Adam is expressly called <i>a type of him who was to come</i>, on which account, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, Christ is called <i>the last Adam</i>. Next, the catholic Church, consisting of believers of all nations, is called <i>the body of</i> <i>Christ</i>, and the members thereof are said to be <i>members of his</i> <i>body, of his flesh, and of his bones</i>; in allusion to the formation of Eve, the emblem of the Church. For, as Eve was formed of a rib taken out of Adam's body during his deep sleep, so believers are regenerated both in mind and body, and formed into one great society, and united to Christ as their head and governor, by the breaking of his body on the cross. Thirdly, to this emblematical meaning of the formation of Eve, our Lord, I think, alluded when he instituted his supper. For instead of appointing one symbol only of his death, he appointed two; and, in explaining the first of them, he expressed himself in such a manner as to show that he had his eye on what happened to Adam when Eve was formed: <i>This is</i> <i>my body which is broken for you</i>-for your regeneration. Fourthly, the eternal union of the regenerated with Christ after the resurrection is called a marriage, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>; and the <i>new Jerusalem</i>, that is, the <i>inhabitants</i> of the new Jerusalem, the society of the redeemed, is termed <i>the bride, the</i> <i>Lamb's wife</i>; and the preparing of men for that happy union, by introducing them into the Church upon earth through faith, and by sanctifying them through the word, is called, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>, <i>A fitting them for one husband</i>, that at the resurrection <i>they may</i> <i>be presented a chaste virgin to Christ</i>; in allusion, I suppose, to the presenting of Eve to Adam, in order to her marriage with him; and to show that, in this expression, the apostle had the figurative meaning of Eve's marriage in his mind, he mentions, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span>, the subtlety of the devil in deceiving Eve. Finally, the union of the Jewish Church with God, as the figure of the catholic Church, consisting of the regenerated of all nations, is by God himself termed <i>a marriage</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:14">Jeremiah 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:8-32">Ezekiel 16:8-32</span>; and God is called the <i>husband</i> of that people, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:5">Isaiah 54:5</span>; and their union to him by the law of Moses is termed, <i>The day of their</i> <i>espousals</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span>."</p>
<p>1. A truly Christian marriage has an excellence, holiness, and unity in it, that cannot be easily described; and let it be observed that, while it prefigures the union of Christ with his Church, it is one means of giving children to the Church, and members to the mystical body of Christ. It is an ordinance of God, and, cannot be too highly honoured; endless volumes might be written on its utility to man: without marriage, by which every man is assigned <i>his own wife</i>, and every woman <i>her own husband</i>, even the multitude of spurious births which would take place would fail to keep up the population of the earth; and natural, moral, and political wretchedness would be the consequence of promiscuous, fortuitous, and transitory connections. For without that ascertainment of peculiar property which marriage gives to every man in his wife, and to every woman in her husband, the human progeny would be unnoticed, unclaimed, uneducated, and totally neglected. This would continually increase the wretchedness, and in process of time bring about the total depopulation of the world.</p>
<p>2. The husband is to love his wife, the wife to obey and venerate her husband; love and protection on the one hand, affectionate subjection and fidelity on the other. The husband should provide for his wife without encouraging profuseness; watch over her conduct without giving her vexation; keep her in subjection without making her a slave; love her without jealousy; oblige her without flattery; honour her without making her proud; and be hers entirely, without becoming either her footman or her slave. In short, they have equal rights and equal claims; but superior strength gives the man dominion, affection and subjection entitle the woman to love and protection. Without the woman, man is but half a human being; in union with the man, the woman finds her safety and perfection.</p>
<p>In the above remarks there are many things <i>solid</i> and <i>useful</i>; there are others which rest more on <i>fancy</i> than <i>judgment</i>.</p>
<p>3. Of marriage the Church of Rome has made a <i>sacrament</i>, and it is one of the <i>seven</i> which that Church acknowledges. That it is an <i>ordinance</i> of <i>God</i> is sufficiently evident; that <i>he</i> has <i>not</i> made it a <i>sacrament</i> is not less so. Though the <i>minister</i> of <i>religion</i> celebrates it, yet the regulation of it, in reference to inheritance, c., is assumed by the <i>state</i>. This is of great moment, as by it many evils are prevented, and many political and domestic advantages secured. If a man enter hastily into this state it is at his own risk after he has once entered it, the seal of the legislature is imposed upon it, and with his engagements, he cannot trifle. A consideration of this has prevented many hasty and disproportionate alliances. Though they might hope to trifle with the <i>Church</i>, they dare not do it with the <i>state</i>.</p>
