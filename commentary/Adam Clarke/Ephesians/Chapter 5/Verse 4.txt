<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span>. <i><b>Neither filthiness</b></i> — αισχροτης. Any thing base or vile in words or acts.</p>
<p><i><b>Foolish talking</b></i> — μωρολογια. Scurrility, buffoonery, ridicule, or what tends to expose another to contempt.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor jesting</b></i> — ευτραπελια. Artfully turned discourses or words, from ευ, <i>well</i> or <i>easily</i>, and τρεπω, <i>I turn</i>; words that can be easily turned to other meanings; double <i>entendres</i>; chaste words which, from their connection, and the manner in which they are used, convey an obscene or offensive meaning. It also means jests, puns, <i>witty sayings</i>, and <i>mountebank repartees</i> of all kinds.</p>
<p><i><b>Which are not convenient</b></i> — ουκ ανηκοντα. <i>They do not come up</i> to the proper standard; they are utterly improper in themselves, and highly unbecoming in those who profess Christianity.</p>
<p><i><b>But rather giving of thanks.</b></i> — ευχαριστια. <i>Decent</i> and <i>edifying discourse</i> or thanksgiving to God. <i>Prayer</i> or <i>praise</i> is the most suitable language for man; and he who is of a trifling, light disposition, is ill fitted for either. How can a man, who has been talking foolishly or jestingly in company, go in private to magnify God for the use of his tongue which he has abused, or his rational faculties which he has degraded?</p>
