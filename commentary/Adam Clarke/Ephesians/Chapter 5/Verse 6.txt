Verse Ephesians 5:6. Let no man deceive you â€” Suffer no man to persuade you that any of these things are innocent, or that they are unavoidable frailties of human nature; they are all sins and abominations in the sight of God; those who practise them are children of disobedience; and on account of such practices the wrath of God-Divine punishment, must come upon them.
