Verse 7. Be not ye therefore partakers with them — Do not act as your fellow citizens do; nor suffer their philosophy, to it in vain words, κενοις λογοις, with empty and illusive doctrines, to lead you astray from the path of truth.That there was much need for such directions and cautions to the people of Ephesus has been often remarked.
