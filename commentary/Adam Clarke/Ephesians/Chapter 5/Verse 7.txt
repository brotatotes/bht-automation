<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Be not ye therefore partakers with them</b></i> — Do not act as your fellow citizens do; nor suffer their philosophy, to it in <i>vain words</i>, κενοις λογοις, with <i>empty</i> and illusive <i>doctrines</i>, to lead you astray from the path of truth.</p>
<p>That there was much need for such directions and cautions to the people of Ephesus has been often remarked. It appears, from Athenaeus, that these people were addicted to <i>luxury, effeminacy</i> c. He tells us that the famous <i>Aspasia</i>, who was herself of the <i>Socratic sect</i>, brought a vast number of beautiful women into Greece, and <i>by their means filled the country with prostitutes</i>, και επληθυνεν απο των ταυτης ἑταιριδων ἡ Ελλας, lib. xiii. cap. 25. Ibid. cap. 31, he observes that the Ephesians had dedicated temples εταιρα αφροδιτη, to the prostitute Venus and again, cap. 32, he quotes from Demosthenes, in <i>Orat. contra Neaeram</i>: τας μεν ἑταιρας ἡδονης ἑνεκα εχομεν, τας δε παλλακας της καθ' ἡμεραν παλλακειας, τας δε γυναικας του παιδοποιεισθαι γνησιως, και των ενδον φυλακα πιστην εχειν· "We have <i>whores</i> for our pleasure, <i>harlots</i> for daily use, and <i>wives</i> for the procreation of legitimate children, and for the faithful preservation of our property." Through the whole of this 13th book of Athenaeus the reader will see the most melancholy proofs of the most abominable practices among the <i>Greeks</i>, and the high estimation in which public prostitutes were held; the greatest <i>lawgivers</i> and the wisest <i>philosophers</i> among the Greeks supported this system both by their authority and example. Is it not in reference to their <i>teaching</i> and <i>laws</i> that the apostle says: <i>Let no man deceive you with vain</i> <i>words</i>?</p>
