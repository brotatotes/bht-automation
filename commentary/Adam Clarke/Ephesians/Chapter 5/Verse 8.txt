<p>Verse 8. <i><b>For ye were sometimes</b></i><b> (ποτε, </b><i><b>formerly</b></i><b>) </b><i><b>darkness</b></i> — While ye lived in darkness, ye lived in these crimes.</p>
<p><i><b>But now</b></i> are ye <i>light in the Lord</i>] When ye were in heathenish <i>darkness</i> ye served divers lusts and pleasures, but now ye have the <i>light</i>-the wisdom and teaching which come from God; therefore <i>walk</i> <i>as children of the light</i>-let the world see that ye are not slaves to the flesh, but free, willing, rational servants of the Most High; not brutish followers of devil gods.</p>
