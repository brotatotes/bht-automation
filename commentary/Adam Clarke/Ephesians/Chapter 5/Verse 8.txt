Verse 8. For ye were sometimes (ποτε, formerly) darkness — While ye lived in darkness, ye lived in these crimes.But now are ye light in the Lord] When ye were in heathenish darkness ye served divers lusts and pleasures, but now ye have the light-the wisdom and teaching which come from God; therefore walk as children of the light-let the world see that ye are not slaves to the flesh, but free, willing, rational servants of the Most High; not brutish followers of devil gods.
