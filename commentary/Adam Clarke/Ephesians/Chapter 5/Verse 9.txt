<p>Verse 9. <i><b>For the fruit of the Spirit</b></i> — Instead of <i>Spirit</i>, πνευματος, ABD*EFG, the <i>Syriac, Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, together with several of the <i>fathers</i>, read φωτος, <i>light</i>, which is supposed by most critics to be the <i>true</i> reading, because there is no mention made of the <i>Spirit</i> in any part of the context. As light, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:8">Ephesians 5:8</span>, not only means the Divine influence upon the soul, but also the <i>Gospel</i>, with great propriety it may be said: <i>The fruit of the light</i>, i.e. of the <i>Gospel, is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth.</i> <i>Goodness</i>, αγαθωσυνη, in the <i>principle</i> and <i>disposition;</i> <i>righteousness</i>, δικαιοσυνη, the <i>exercise</i> of that <i>goodness</i> in the whole <i>conduct</i> of life; <i>truth</i>, αληθεια, the <i>director</i> of that <i>principle</i>, and its <i>exercise</i>, to the glorification of God and the good of mankind.</p>
