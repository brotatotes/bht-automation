<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Finally</b></i> — Having laid before you, your great and high calling, and all the doctrines and precepts of the Gospel, it is necessary that I should show you the enemies that will oppose you, and the strength which is requisite to enable you to repel them.</p>
<p><i><b>Be strong in the Lord</b></i> — You must have strength, and strength of a <i>spiritual</i> kind, and such strength too as the <i>Lord</i> himself can furnish; and you must have this strength through an <i>indwelling</i> <i>God, the power of his might</i> working in you.</p>
