Verse 11. Put on the whole armour of God — Ενδυσασθε την πανοπλιαν του Θεου. The apostle considers every Christian as having a warfare to maintain against numerous, powerful, and subtle foes; and that therefore they would need much strength, much courage, complete armour, and skill to use it. The panoply which is mentioned here refers to the armour of the heavy troops among the Greeks; those who were to sustain the rudest attacks, who were to sap the foundations of walls, storm cities, c. Their ordinary armour was the shield, the helmet, the sword, and the greaves or brazen boots. To all these the apostle refers below. Ephesians 6:13.The wiles of the devil. — Τας μεθοδειας του διαβολου· The methods of the devil the different means, plans, schemes, and machinations which he uses to deceive, entrap, enslave, and ruin the souls of men. A man's method of sinning is Satan's method of ruining his soul. Ephesians 4:14.
