<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Put on the whole armour of God</b></i> — Ενδυσασθε την πανοπλιαν του Θεου. The apostle considers every Christian as having a warfare to maintain against numerous, powerful, and subtle foes; and that therefore they would need much strength, much courage, complete armour, and skill to use it. The <i>panoply</i> which is mentioned here refers to the armour of the <i>heavy troops</i> among the Greeks; those who were to sustain the rudest attacks, who were to sap the foundations of walls, storm cities, c. Their ordinary armour was the <i>shield</i>, the <i>helmet</i>, the <i>sword</i>, and the <i>greaves</i> or <i>brazen boots</i>. To all these the apostle refers below. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The wiles of the devil.</b></i> — Τας μεθοδειας του διαβολου· <i>The</i> <i>methods of the devil</i> the different <i>means, plans, schemes</i>, and <i>machinations</i> which he uses to deceive, entrap, enslave, and ruin the souls of men. A <i>man's method</i> of sinning is <i>Satan's method</i> of ruining his soul. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>.</p>
