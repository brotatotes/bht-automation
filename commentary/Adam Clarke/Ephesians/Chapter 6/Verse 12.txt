<p>Verse 12. <i><b>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood</b></i> — Ουκ εστιν ἡμιν ἡ παλη προς αἱμα και σαρκα· Our <i>wrestling</i> or <i>contention is not with men</i> like ourselves: <i>flesh and blood</i> is a Hebraism for <i>men</i>, or <i>human beings</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>.</p>
<p>The word παλη implies the athletic exercises in the Olympic and other national games; and παλαιστρα was the <i>place</i> in which the contenders exercised. Here it signifies warfare in general.</p>
<p><i><b>Against principalities</b></i> — αρχας. <i>Chief rulers</i>; beings of the first rank and order in their own kingdom.</p>
<p><i><b>Powers</b></i> — εξουσιας, <i>Authorities</i>, derived from, and constituted by the above.</p>
<p><i><b>The rulers of the darkness of this world</b></i> — Τους κοσμοκρατορας του σκοτους του αιωνος τουτου· The <i>rulers of the world</i>; the <i>emperors of the darkness of this state of things</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Spiritual wickedness</b></i> — Τα πνευματικα της πονηριας· <i>The</i> <i>spiritual things of wickedness</i>; or, <i>the spiritualities of</i> <i>wickedness</i>; highly refined and sublimed evil; disguised <i>falsehood</i> in the garb of <i>truth; Antinomianism</i> in the guise of <i>religion</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>In high places.</b></i> — Εν τοις επουρανιοις· <i>In the most sublime</i> <i>stations</i>. But who are <i>these</i> of whom the apostle speaks? <i>Schoettgen</i> contends that the <i>rabbins</i> and <i>Jewish</i> rulers are intended. This he thinks proved by the words τουαιωνοςτουτου, <i>of this world</i>, which are often used to designate the <i>Old</i> <i>Testament</i>, and the <i>Jewish system</i>; and the words εντοις επουρανιοις, <i>in heavenly places</i>, which are not unfrequently used to signify the time of the NEW TESTAMENT, and the <i>Gospel system</i>.</p>
<p>By the spiritual wickedness in heavenly places, he thinks false teachers, who endeavoured to corrupt Christianity, are meant; such as those mentioned by St. John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:19">1 John 2:19</span>: <i>They went out from us, but they were not of us</i>, c. And he thinks the meaning may be extended to all corrupters of Christianity in all succeeding ages. He shows also that the Jews called their own city שר של עולם <i>sar shel olam</i>, κοσμοκρατωρ, <i>the ruler of the</i> <i>world</i> and proves that David's words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:2">Psalms 2:2</span>, <i>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel</i> <i>together</i>, are applied by the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:26">Acts 4:26</span>, to the Jewish <i>rulers</i>, αρχοντες, who persecuted Peter and John for preaching Christ crucified. But commentators in general are not of this mind, but think that by <i>principalities</i>, c., we are to understand different orders of evil spirits, who are all employed under the devil, their great head, to prevent the spread of the Gospel in the world, and to destroy the souls of mankind.</p>
<p>The <i>spiritual wickedness</i> are supposed to be the <i>angels</i> which kept not their first estate who fell from the <i>heavenly places</i> but are ever longing after and striving to regain them; and which have their station in the <i>regions of the air</i>. "Perhaps," says Mr. Wesley, "the <i>principalities and powers</i> remain mostly in the citadel of their kingdom of <i>darkness</i>; but there are other spirits which range abroad, to whom the provinces of the <i>world</i> are committed; <i>the darkness</i> is chiefly <i>spiritual</i> darkness which prevails during the present state of things, and the <i>wicked</i> <i>spirits</i> are those which continually oppose faith, love, and holiness, either by force or fraud; and labour to infuse unbelief, pride, idolatry, malice, envy, anger, and hatred." Some translate the words εντοιςεπουρανιοις, <i>about heavenly things</i>; that is: We contend with these fallen spirits for the heavenly things which are promised to us; and we strive against them, that we may not be deprived of those we have.</p>
