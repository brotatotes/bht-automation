<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Wherefore</b></i> — Because ye have such enemies to contend with, <i>take unto you</i>-assume, as provided and prepared for you, <i>the</i> <i>whole armour of God</i>; which armour if you put on and use, you shall be both invulnerable and immortal. The ancient heroes are fabled to have had armour sent to them by the <i>gods</i>; and even the great armour-maker, <i>Vulcan</i>, was reputed to be a <i>god</i> himself. This was <i>fable</i>: What Paul speaks of is <i>reality</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye may be able to withstand</b></i> — That ye may not only stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, but also discomfit all your spiritual foes; and continuing in your ranks, maintain your ground against them, never putting off your armour, but standing always ready prepared to repel any new attack.</p>
<p><i><b>And having done all, to stand.</b></i> — Και ἁπαντα κατεργασαμενοι στηναι· rather, <i>And having conquered all, stand</i>: this is a military phrase, and is repeatedly used in this sense by the best Greek writers. So <i>Dionys. Hal</i>. Ant., lib. vi., page 400: Και παντα πολεμια εν ολιγῳ κατεργασαμενοι χρονῳ· "Having in a short time <i>discomfited</i> all our enemies, we returned with numerous captives and much spoil." See many examples in <i>Kypke</i>. By <i>evil</i> <i>day</i> we may understand any time of trouble, affliction, and sore temptation.</p>
<p>As there is here allusion to some of the most important parts of the Grecian armour, I shall give a short account of the whole. It consisted properly of two sorts:</p>
<p>1. Defensive armour, or that which protected themselves.</p>
<p>2. Offensive armour, or that by which they injured their enemies. The apostle refers to both.</p>
<p>I. <i>Defensive armour</i>:</p>
<p>περικεφαλαια, the HELMET; this was the armour for the head, and was of various forms, and embossed with a great variety of figures. Connected with the helmet was the <i>crest</i> or <i>ridge</i> on the top of the helmet, adorned with several emblematic figures; some for <i>ornament</i>, some to strike <i>terror</i>. For crests on ancient helmets we often see the winged lion, the griffin, chimera, c. St. Paul seems to refer to one which had an emblematical representation of <i>hope</i>.</p>
<p>ζωμα, the GIRDLE this went about the loins, and served to brace the armour tight to the body, and to support daggers, short swords, and such like weapons, which were frequently stuck in it. This kind of girdle is in general use among the Asiatic nations to the present day.</p>
<p>θωραξ, the BREAST-PLATE; this consisted of two parts, called πτερυγες or <i>wings</i>: one covered the whole region of the thorax or <i>breast</i>, in which the principal viscera of life are contained; and the other covered the back, as far down as the front part extended.</p>
<p>κνημιδες, GREAVES or <i>brazen boots</i>, which covered the shin or front of the leg; a kind of <i>solea</i> was often used, which covered the sole, and laced about the instep, and prevented the foot from being wounded by rugged ways, thorns, stones, c.</p>
<p>χειριδες, GAUNTLETS a kind of <i>gloves</i> that served to defend the hands, and the arm up to the elbow.</p>
<p>ασπις, the <i>clypeus</i> or SHIELD; it was perfectly round, and sometimes made of <i>wood</i>, covered with bullocks' hides; but often made of <i>metal</i>. The <i>aspis</i> or <i>shield</i> of Achilles, made by Vulcan, was composed of <i>five</i> plates, two of <i>brass</i>, two of <i>tin</i>, and one of <i>gold</i>; so Homer, Il. U. v. 270:- </p>
<p>γερρων or γερρα, the <i>gerron</i>; a small <i>square</i> shield, used first by the <i>Persians</i>.</p>
<p>λαισηιον, LAISEION; a sort of <i>oblong</i> shield, covered with rough hides, or skins with the hair on.</p>
<p>πελτη, the PELTA; a small <i>light shield</i>, nearly in the form of a demicrescent, with a small ornament, similar to the recurved leaves of a flower <i>de luce</i>, on the centre of a diagonal edge or straight line; this was the <i>Amazonian</i> shield.</p>
<p>θυρεος, the <i>scutum</i> or OBLONG SHIELD; this was always made of <i>wood</i>, and covered with hides. It was exactly in the shape of the <i>laiseion</i>, but differed in <i>size</i>, being much larger, and being covered with hides from which the hair had been taken off. It was called θυρεος from θυρα, a <i>door</i>, which it resembled in its oblong shape; but it was made curved, so as to embrace the whole forepart of the body. The <i>aspis</i> and the <i>thureos</i> were the shields principally in use; the former for light, the latter for <i>heavy</i> armed troops.</p>
<p>II. <i>Offensive armour</i>, or weapons; the following were chief:</p>
<p>εγχος, <i>enchos</i>, the SPEAR; which was generally a head of brass or iron, with a long shaft of <i>ash</i>.</p>
<p>δορυ, the LANCE; differing perhaps little from the former, but in its size and lightness; being a missile used, both by infantry and cavalry, for the purpose of annoying the enemy at a <i>distance</i>.</p>
<p>ξιφος, the SWORD; these were of various sizes, and in the beginning all of <i>brass</i>. The swords of Homer's heroes are all of this metal.</p>
<p>μαχαιρα, called also a <i>sword</i>, sometimes a <i>knife</i>; it was a <i>short sword</i>, used more frequently by gladiators, or in single combat. What other difference it had from the <i>xiphos</i> I cannot tell.</p>
<p>αξινη, from which our word AXE; the common <i>battle-axe</i>.</p>
<p>πελεκυς, the BIPEN; a sort of <i>battle-axe</i>, with double face, one opposite to the other.</p>
<p>κορυνη, an <i>iron club</i> or <i>mace</i>, much used both among the ancient Greeks and Persians.</p>
<p>τοξον, the BOW; with its <i>pharetra</i> or <i>quiver</i>, and its stock or sheaf of <i>arrows</i>.</p>
<p>σφενδονη, the SLING; an instrument in the use of which most ancient nations were very expert, particularly the Hebrews and ancient Greeks.</p>
<p>The arms and armour mentioned above were not always in use; they were found out and improved by degrees. The account given by <i>Lucretius</i> of the arms of the first inhabitants of the earth is doubtless as correct as it is natural. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> De Rerum Nat., lib. v. ver. 1282.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Whilst <i>cruelty</i> was not improved by <i>art</i>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And <i>rage</i> not furnished yet with <i>sword</i> or <i>dart</i>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> With <i>fists</i>, or <i>boughs</i>, or <i>stones</i>, the warriors fought;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> These were the only weapons <i>Nature</i> taught:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> But when <i>flames</i> burnt the trees and scorched the ground,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Then <i>brass</i> appeared, and <i>iron</i> fit to wound.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Brass first was used, because the softer ore,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And earth's cold veins contained a greater store.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> CREECH. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>I have only to observe farther on this head,</p>
<p>1. That the ancient Greeks and Romans went <i>constantly armed</i>;</p>
<p>2. That before they engaged they always <i>ate together</i>; and</p>
<p>3. That they commenced every attack with prayer to the gods for success.</p>
