<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Stand therefore</b></i> — Prepare yourselves for combat, <i>having your loins girt about with truth</i>. He had told them before <i>to take the whole armour of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>, and to <i>put on</i> this <i>whole armour</i>. Having got all the pieces of it <i>together</i>, and the defensive parts <i>put on</i>, they were then to gird them close to their bodies with the ζωμα or <i>girdle</i>, and instead of a fine ornamented <i>belt</i>, such as the ancient warriors used, they were to have <i>truth</i>. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the <i>truth of</i> <i>God</i>; unless this be <i>known</i> and <i>conscientiously believed</i> no man can enter the spiritual warfare with any advantage or prospect of success. By this alone we discover who our enemies are, and how they come on to attack us; and by this we know where our strength lies; and, as the truth is great, and must prevail, we are to gird ourselves with this against all false religion, and the various winds of doctrine by which cunning men and insidious devils lie in wait to deceive. Truth may be taken here for <i>sincerity</i>; for if a man be not conscious to himself that his <i>heart is right</i> before God, and that he makes no false pretences to religion, in vain does he enter the spiritual lists. This alone can give him confidence:- </p>
<p><i><b>The breast-plate of righteousness</b></i> — What the θωραξ or <i>breast-plate</i> was, see before. The word <i>righteousness</i>, δικαισυνη, we have often had occasion to note, is a word of very extensive import: it signifies the <i>principle</i> of <i>righteousness</i>; it signifies the <i>practice</i> of <i>righteousness</i>, or living a <i>holy</i> life; it signifies <i>God's method</i> of <i>justifying sinners</i>; and it signifies <i>justification</i> itself. Here it may imply a consciousness of justification through the blood of the cross; the principle of righteousness or true holiness implanted in the heart; and a holy life, a life regulated according to the testimonies of God. As the <i>breast-plate</i> defends the heart and lungs, and all those vital functionaries that are contained in what is called the <i>region of</i> <i>the thorax</i>; so this righteousness, this life of God in the soul of man, defends every thing on which the man's spiritual existence depends. While he possesses this principle, and acts from it, his spiritual and eternal life is secure.</p>
