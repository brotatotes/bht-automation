<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Your feet shod</b></i> — The κνημιδες, or <i>greaves</i>, have been already described; they were deemed of essential importance in the ancient armour; if the feet or legs are materially wounded, a man can neither stand to resist his foe, pursue him if vanquished, nor flee from him should he have the worst of the fight.</p>
<p>That the apostle has <i>obedience to the Gospel</i> in general in view, there can be no doubt; but he appears to have more than this, a <i>readiness</i> to <i>publish</i> the Gospel: for, <i>How beautiful upon the</i> <i>mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that</i> <i>publisheth</i> PEACE; <i>that bringeth good tidings of good, that</i> <i>publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth</i>! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:7">Isaiah 52:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:15">Romans 10:15</span>.</p>
<p>The lsraelites were commanded to eat the passover with their <i>feet shod</i>, to show that they were <i>ready</i> for their journey. And our Lord commands his disciples to be <i>shod with sandals</i>, that they might be ready to go and publish the Gospel, as the Israelites were to go to possess the promised land. Every Christian should consider himself on his journey from a strange land to his own country, and not only stand every moment prepared to proceed, but be every moment in actual progress towards his home.</p>
<p><i><b>The preparation of the Gospel</b></i> — The word ετοιμασια which we translate <i>preparation</i>, is variously understood: some think it means an <i>habitual readiness</i> in walking in the way prescribed by the Gospel; others that <i>firmness</i> and <i>solidity</i> which the Gospel gives to them who conscientiously believe its doctrines; others, those <i>virtues</i> and <i>graces</i> which in the <i>first planting</i> of Christianity were indispensably necessary to those who published it.</p>
<p>Should we take the word <i>preparation</i> in its common acceptation, it may imply that, by a conscientious belief of the Gospel, receiving the salvation provided by its author, and walking in the way of obedience which is pointed out by it, the soul is <i>prepared</i> for the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>The Gospel is termed the <i>Gospel of peace</i>, because it establishes peace between God and man, and proclaims peace and good will to the universe. Contentions, strife, quarrels, and all wars, being as alien from its nature and design, as they are opposed to the nature of Him who is love and compassion to man.</p>
