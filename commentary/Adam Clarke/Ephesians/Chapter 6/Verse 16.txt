<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Above all</b></i><b>, (επι πασιν, </b><i><b>over all</b></i><b> the rest of the armour,) </b><i><b>taking the shield of faith</b></i> — In the word θυρεος, <i>thureos,</i> the apostle alludes to the great <i>oblong shield</i>, or <i>scutum</i>, which covers the whole body. See its description before. And as <i>faith</i> is the grace by which all others are preserved and rendered active, so it is properly represented here under the notion of a <i>shield</i>, by which the whole body is covered and protected. Faith, in this place, must mean that evidence of things unseen which every genuine believer has, that God, for Christ's sake, has blotted out his sins, and by which he is enabled to call God his Father, and feel him to be his portion. It is such an <i>appropriating</i> faith as this which can quench any dart of the devil.</p>
<p><i><b>The fiery darts of the wicked.</b></i> — βελος, <i>a dart</i>, signifies any kind of <i>missile weapon</i>; every thing that is projected to a distance by the hand, as a <i>javelin</i>, or short spear; or by a <i>bow</i>, as an <i>arrow</i>; or a stone by a <i>sling</i>.</p>
<p><i>The fiery darts </i>- Τα βελη τα πεπυρωμενα. It is probable that the apostle alludes to the darts called <i>falarica</i>, which were headed with lead, in or about which some combustible stuff was placed that took fire in the passage of the arrow through the air, and often burnt up the enemy's engines, ships, c. they were calculated also to stick in the shields and set them on fire. Some think that <i>poisoned arrows</i> may be intended, which are called <i>fiery</i> from the burning heat produced in the bodies of those who were wounded by them. To quench or extinguish such fiery darts the shields were ordinarily covered with metal on the outside, and thus the fire was prevented from catching hold of the shield. When they stuck on a shield of another kind and set it on fire, the soldier was obliged to cast it away, and thus became defenceless.</p>
<p>The fiery darts of the <i>wicked</i>, του πονηρου, or <i>devil</i>, are evil thoughts, and strong <i>injections</i>, as they are termed, which in the unregenerate inflame the passions, and excite the soul to acts of transgression. While the <i>faith</i> is strong in Christ it acts as a shield to quench these. He who walks so as to feel the witness of God's Spirit that he is his child, has all evil thoughts in abhorrence; and, though they pass through his mind, they never fix in his passions. They are caught on this shield, blunted, and extinguished.</p>
