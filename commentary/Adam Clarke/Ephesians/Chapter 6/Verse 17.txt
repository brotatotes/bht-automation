<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Take the helmet of salvation</b></i> — Or, as it is expressed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>, <i>And for a helmet, the hope of salvation</i>. It has already been observed, in the description of the Grecian armour, that on the crest and other parts of the helmet were a great variety of emblematical figures, and that it is very likely the apostle refers to helmets which had on them an emblematical representation of <i>hope</i>; viz. that the person should be <i>safe</i> who wore it, that he should be prosperous in all his engagements, and ever escape safe from battle. So the <i>hope</i> of conquering every adversary and surmounting every difficulty, through the blood of the Lamb, is as a helmet that protects the head; an impenetrable one, that the blow of the battle-axe cannot cleave. The <i>hope</i> of continual safety and protection, built on the promises of God, to which the upright follower of Christ feels he has a Divine right, protects the <i>understanding</i> from being darkened, and the judgment from being confused by any temptations of Satan, or subtle arguments of the sophistical ungodly. He who carries Christ in his heart cannot be cheated out of the hope of his heaven,</p>
<p><i><b>The sword of the Spirit</b></i> — See what is said before on ξιφος and μαχαιρα, in the account of the Greek armour (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span> (note)). The <i>sword</i> of which St. Paul speaks is, as he explains it, <i>the word of God</i>; that is, the revelation which God has given of himself, or what we call the <i>Holy Scriptures</i>. This is called <i>the sword of the Spirit</i>, because it comes from the Holy Spirit, and receives its fulfilment in the soul through the operation of the Holy Spirit. An ability to quote this on proper occasions, and especially in times of temptation and trial, has a wonderful tendency to cut in pieces the snares of the adversary. In God's word a genuine Christian may have unlimited confidence, and to every purpose to which it is applicable it may be brought with the greatest effect. The <i>shield, faith</i>, and the <i>sword</i>-the <i>word of God</i>, or faith in God's unchangeable word, are the principal armour of the soul. He in whom the word of God dwells richly, and who has that faith by which he knows that he has redemption, even the forgiveness of sins, need not fear the power of any adversary. He stands fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made him free. Some suppose that του πνευματος, <i>of the Spirit</i>, should be understood of our <i>own</i> <i>spirit</i> or <i>soul</i>; the word of God being the proper sword of the soul, or that offensive weapon the only one which the soul uses. But though it is true that every Christian soul has this for its sword, yet the first meaning is the most likely.</p>
