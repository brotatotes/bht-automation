<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Praying always</b></i> — The apostle does not put praying among the armour; had he done so he would have referred it, as he has done all the rest, to some of the Grecian armour; but as he does not do this, therefore we conclude that his account of the armour is ended, and that now, having equipped his spiritual soldier, he shows him the necessity of <i>praying</i>, that he may successfully resist those principalities, powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and the spiritual wickednesses in heavenly places, with whom he has to contend. The <i>panoply</i>, or <i>whole armour</i> of God, consists in,</p>
<p>1. the <i>girdle</i>;</p>
<p>2. the <i>breast-plate</i>;</p>
<p>3. the <i>greaves</i>;</p>
<p>4. the <i>shield</i>;</p>
<p>5. the <i>helmet</i>; and</p>
<p>6. the <i>sword</i>. He who had these was completely armed.</p>
<p>And as it was the custom of the Grecian armies, before they engaged, to <i>offer prayers</i> to the gods for their success, the apostle shows that these spiritual warriors must depend on the Captain of their salvation, and pray with all prayer, i.e. incessantly, being always in the spirit of prayer, so that they should be ever ready for public, private, mental, or ejaculatory prayer, always depending on HIM who can alone <i>save</i>, and who alone can <i>destroy</i>.</p>
<p>When the apostle exhorts Christians to <i>pray with all prayer</i>, we may at once see that he neither means <i>spiritual</i> nor <i>formal</i> prayer, in exclusion of the other. <i>Praying</i>, προσευχομενοι, refers to the <i>state</i> of the <i>spirit</i> as well as to the <i>act</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>With all prayer</b></i> — Refers to the different <i>kinds</i> of prayer that is performed in <i>public</i>, in the <i>family</i>, in the <i>closet</i>, in <i>business</i>, on the <i>way</i>, in the <i>heart</i> without a <i>voice</i>, and <i>with</i> the <i>voice</i> from the heart. All those are necessary to the genuine Christian; and he whose heart is right with God will be frequent in the whole. "Some there are," says a very pious and learned writer, who use only <i>mental</i> prayer or ejaculations, and think they are in a state of grace, and use a way of worship far superior to any other; but such only fancy themselves to be <i>above</i> what is really above <i>them</i>; it requiring far more grace to be enabled to pour out a fervent and continued prayer, than to offer up mental aspirations." Rev. <i>J. Wesley</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And supplication</b></i> — There is a difference between προσευχη, <i>prayer</i>, and δεησις, <i>supplication</i>. Some think the former means prayer for the <i>attainment of good</i>; the latter, prayer for <i>averting</i> <i>evil</i>. Supplication however seems to mean <i>prayer continued in</i>, strong and <i>incessant pleadings</i>, till the <i>evil</i> is <i>averted</i>, or the <i>good communicated</i>. There are two things that must be attended to in prayer.</p>
<p>1. That it be εν παντι καιρω, in every <i>time, season</i>, or <i>opportunity</i>;</p>
<p>2. That it should be εν πνευματι, <i>in</i> or <i>through</i> <i>the Spirit</i>-that the <i>heart</i> should be engaged in it, and that its infirmities should be helped by the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p><i><b>Watching thereunto</b></i> — Being always on your <i>guard</i> lest your enemies should surprise you. Watch, not only against evil, but also for opportunities to do good, and for opportunities to receive good. Without watchfulness, prayer and all the spiritual armour will be ineffectual.</p>
<p><i><b>With all perseverance</b></i> — Being always intent on your object, and never losing sight of your <i>danger</i>, or of your <i>interest</i>. The word implies <i>stretching out the neck</i>, and <i>looking about</i>, in order to discern an enemy at a distance.</p>
<p><i><b>For all saints</b></i> — For all <i>Christians</i>; for this was the character by which they were generally distinguished.</p>
