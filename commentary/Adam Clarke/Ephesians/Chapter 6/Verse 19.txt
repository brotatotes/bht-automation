<p>Verse 19. <i><b>And for me, that utterance may be given unto me</b></i> — ινα μοι δοθειη λογος. Kypke has proved by many examples that λογον διδοναι signifies permission and power to defend one's self in a court of justice; and this sense of the phrase is perfectly applicable to the case of St. Paul, who was an ambassador in bonds, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:20">Ephesians 6:20</span>,) and expected to be called to a public hearing, in which he was not only to <i>defend himself</i>, but to prove the <i>truth</i> and <i>excellency</i> of the <i>Christian religion</i>. And we learn, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:12-14">Philippians 1:12-14</span>, that he had his desire in this respect; for <i>the things which happened to him fell out to the furtherance</i> <i>of the Gospel, so that his bonds in Christ were manifest in all</i> <i>the palace, and in all other places</i>. Thus God had enabled him to make a most noble defence, by which the Gospel acquired great credit.</p>
<p><i><b>The mystery of the Gospel</b></i> — The whole <i>doctrine</i> of Christ, not fully revealed previously to that time.</p>
