<p>Verse 21. <i><b>That ye also</b></i> — As well as other Churches to whom I have communicated the dealings both of God and man to me.</p>
<p><i><b>May know my affairs</b></i> — May be acquainted with my situation and circumstances.</p>
<p><i><b>And how I do</b></i> — How I employ my time, and what fruit there is of my apostolical labours.</p>
<p><i><b>Tychicus, a beloved brother</b></i> — We learn, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>, that Tychicus was of Asia, and that he was a useful companion of St. Paul. See the note on the above place.</p>
<p>This same person, and with the same character and commendation, is mentioned in the Epistle to the Colossians, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7">Colossians 4:7</span>. He is mentioned also in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12">Titus 3:12</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:12">2 Timothy 4:12</span>; from all these places it is evident that he was a person in whom the apostle had the highest confidence, and that he was a very eminent minister of Christ.</p>
