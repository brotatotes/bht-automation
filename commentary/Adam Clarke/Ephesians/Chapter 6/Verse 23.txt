<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Peace be to the brethren</b></i> — If the epistle were really sent to the <i>Ephesians</i>, a people with whom the apostle was so intimately acquainted, it is strange that he mentions no person by name. This objection, on which Dr. Paley lays great stress, (see the preface to this epistle,) has not been successfully answered.</p>
<p><i><b>Peace</b></i> — All <i>prosperity</i>, and continual union with God and among yourselves; <i>and love</i> to God and man, the principle of all obedience and union; <i>with faith</i>, continually increasing, and growing stronger and stronger, <i>from God the Father</i>, as the fountain of all our mercies, <i>and the Lord Jesus Christ</i>, through whose sacrifice and mediation they all come.</p>
