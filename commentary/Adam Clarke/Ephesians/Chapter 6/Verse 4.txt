<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4">Ephesians 6:4</span>. <i><b>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath</b></i> — Avoid all <i>severity</i>; this will hurt your own souls, and do them no good; on the contrary, if punished with <i>severity</i> or <i>cruelty</i>, they will be only hardened and made desperate in their sins. <i>Cruel parents</i> generally have <i>bad children</i>. He who corrects his children according to God and reason will feel every blow on his own heart more sensibly than his child feels it on his body. Parents are called to <i>correct</i>; not to <i>punish</i>, their children. Those who <i>punish</i> them do it from a principle of <i>revenge</i>; those who <i>correct</i> them do it from a principle of <i>affectionate concern</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Bring them up,</b></i> c.] Εκτρεφετε αυτα εν παιδειᾳ και νουθεσια Κυριου· literally, <i>Nourish them in the discipline and instruction</i> <i>of the Lord</i>. The <i>mind</i> is to be nourished with wholesome discipline and instruction, as the body is with proper food. παιδεια, <i>discipline</i>, may refer to all that knowledge which is proper for children, including elementary principles and rules for behaviour, c. νουθεσια, <i>instruction</i>, may imply whatever is necessary to form the mind to touch, regulate, and purify the passions and necessarily includes the whole of religion. Both these should be administered <i>in the Lord</i>-according to his will and word, and in reference to his eternal glory. All the important lessons and doctrines being derived from his revelation, therefore they are called <i>the discipline and instruction of the Lord</i>.</p>
