Verse Ephesians 6:4. Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath — Avoid all severity; this will hurt your own souls, and do them no good; on the contrary, if punished with severity or cruelty, they will be only hardened and made desperate in their sins. Cruel parents generally have bad children. He who corrects his children according to God and reason will feel every blow on his own heart more sensibly than his child feels it on his body. Parents are called to correct; not to punish, their children. Those who punish them do it from a principle of revenge; those who correct them do it from a principle of affectionate concern.Bring them up, c.] Εκτρεφετε αυτα εν παιδειᾳ και νουθεσια Κυριου· literally, Nourish them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. The mind is to be nourished with wholesome discipline and instruction, as the body is with proper food. παιδεια, discipline, may refer to all that knowledge which is proper for children, including elementary principles and rules for behaviour, c. νουθεσια, instruction, may imply whatever is necessary to form the mind to touch, regulate, and purify the passions and necessarily includes the whole of religion. Both these should be administered in the Lord-according to his will and word, and in reference to his eternal glory. All the important lessons and doctrines being derived from his revelation, therefore they are called the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
