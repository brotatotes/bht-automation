<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>. <i><b>Servants, be obedient</b></i> — Though δουλος frequently signifies a <i>slave</i> or <i>bondman</i>, yet it often implies a <i>servant</i> in general, or any one bound to another, either for a limited time, or for life. Even a <i>slave</i>, if a Christian, was bound to serve him faithfully by whose money he was bought, howsoever illegal that traffic may be considered. In heathen countries slavery was in some sort excusable; among Christians it is an enormity and a crime for which perdition has scarcely an adequate state of punishment.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the flesh</b></i> — Your masters in secular things; for they have no authority over your religion, nor over your souls.</p>
<p><i><b>With fear and trembling</b></i> — Because the law gives them a power to punish you for every act of disobedience.</p>
<p><i><b>In singleness of your heart</b></i> — Not merely through fear of punishment, but from a principle of uprightness, serving them as you would serve Christ.</p>
