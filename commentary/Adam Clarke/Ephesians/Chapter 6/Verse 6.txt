Verse Ephesians 6:6. Not with eye-service — Not merely in their presence, when their eye is upon you, as unfaithful and hypocritical servants do, without consulting conscience in any part of their work.Doing the will of God — Seeing that you are in the state of servitude, it is the will of God that you should act conscientiously in it.
