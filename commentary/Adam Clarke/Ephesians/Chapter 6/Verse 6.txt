<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:6">Ephesians 6:6</span>. <i><b>Not with eye-service</b></i> — Not merely in their presence, when their eye is upon you, as unfaithful and hypocritical servants do, without consulting conscience in any part of their work.</p>
<p><i><b>Doing the will of God</b></i> — Seeing that you are in the state of servitude, it is the will of God that you should act conscientiously in it.</p>
