<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Ye masters, do the same things unto them</b></i> — Act in the same affectionate, conscientious manner towards your slaves and servants, as they do towards you.</p>
<p><i><b>Forbearing threatening</b></i> — If they should transgress at any time, lean more to the side of <i>mercy</i> than <i>justice</i>; and when ye are obliged to punish, let it be as light and as moderate as possible; and let <i>revenge</i> have no part in the chastisement, for that is of the devil, and not of God.</p>
<p>The words, <i>forbearing threatening</i>; ανιεντες την απειλην, signify to mitigate, relax, or not exact threatening; that is, the <i>threatened punishment</i>. The sense is given above.</p>
<p>In <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sect. 21, fol. 120, there is a good saying concerning <i>respect of persons</i>: "If a poor man comes to a rich man to converse with him, he will not regard him; but if a rich man comes he will hear and rehear him. The holy and blessed God acts not thus; for all are alike before him, women, slaves, the poor, and the rich."</p>
<p><i><b>Knowing that your Master also is in heaven</b></i> — <i>You</i> are <i>their</i> masters, GOD is <i>yours</i>. As <i>you</i> deal with <i>them</i>, so GOD will deal with <i>you</i>; for do not suppose, because their condition on earth is inferior to yours, that God considers them to be less worthy of his regard than you are; this is not so, for <i>there is no respect</i> <i>of persons with Him</i>.</p>
