<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>. <i><b>Paul, an apostle, not of men</b></i> — Not commissioned by any <i>assembly</i> or <i>council</i> of the <i>apostles</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither by man</b></i> — Nor by any <i>one</i> of the <i>apostles</i>; neither by <i>James</i>, who seems to have been <i>president</i> of the apostolic council at Jerusalem; nor by <i>Peter</i>, to whom, in a particular manner, the keys of the kingdom were intrusted.</p>
<p><i><b>But by Jesus Christ</b></i> — Having his mission immediately from Christ himself, and <i>God the Father who raised him from the dead</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:15">Acts 22:15</span>, and commanded him to go both to the Jews and to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might obtain remission of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:1">Acts 9:1</span>, &amp;c., and the notes there.</p>
