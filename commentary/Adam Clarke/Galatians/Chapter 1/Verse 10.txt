<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Do I now persuade men, or God?</b></i> — The words πειθειν τον θεον may be rendered <i>to court or solicit the favour of God</i> as the after clause sufficiently proves. This acceptation of πειθειν is very common in Greek authors. While the apostle was a persecutor of the Christians, he was the <i>servant of men</i>, and <i>pleased men</i>. When he embraced the Christian doctrine, he became the <i>servant</i> of GOD, and <i>pleased</i> HIM. He therefore intimates that he was a widely different person now from what he had been while a Jew.</p>
