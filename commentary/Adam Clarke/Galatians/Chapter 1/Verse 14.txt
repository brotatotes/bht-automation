<p>Verse 14. <i><b>And profited in the Jews' religion</b></i> — The apostle does not mean that he became more exemplary in the <i>love</i> and <i>practice</i> of the <i>pure law</i> of God than any of his countrymen, but that he was more profoundly skilled in the <i>traditions</i> of the <i>fathers</i> than most of his <i>fellow students</i> were, or, as the word συνηλικιωτας may mean his <i>contemporaries</i>.</p>
