<p>Verse 16. <i><b>To reveal his Son in me</b></i> — To make me know Jesus Christ, and the power of his resurrection.</p>
<p><i><b>That I might preach him among the heathen</b></i> — For it was to the <i>Gentiles</i>, and the <i>dispersed Jews among the Gentiles</i>, that St. Paul was especially sent. Peter was sent more particularly to the <i>Jews</i> in the <i>land of Judea</i>; Paul to those in the different Greek provinces.</p>
<p><i><b>I conferred not with flesh and blood</b></i> — I did not take counsel with <i>men</i>; σαρξ και αιμα, which is a literal translation of the Hebrew בשר ודם <i>basar vedam</i>, flesh and blood, is a periphrasis for <i>man, any man</i>, a <i>human being</i>, or <i>beings</i> of <i>any kind</i>. Many suppose that the apostle means he did not dally, or take counsel, with the erroneous suggestions and <i>unrenewed propensities</i> of <i>his</i> <i>own heart</i>, or those of others; but no such thing is intended by the text. St. Paul was satisfied that his <i>call</i> was of God; he had therefore no occasion to consult man.</p>
