<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Neither went I up to Jerusalem</b></i> — The aim of the apostle is to show that he had his call so immediately and pointedly from God himself, that he had no need of the concurrence even of the apostles, being appointed by the same authority, and fitted to the work by the same grace and Spirit, as they were.</p>
<p><i><b>But I went into Arabia.</b></i> — That part of <i>Arabia</i> which was contiguous to <i>Damascus</i>, over which <i>Aretas</i> was then king. Of this journey into Arabia we have no other account. As St. Luke was not then with him, it is not inserted in the Acts of the Apostles. See <i>introduction</i> to this epistle. Jerusalem was the stated residence of the apostles; and, when all the other believers were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, we find the apostles still remaining, unmolested, at Jerusalem! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>.</p>
