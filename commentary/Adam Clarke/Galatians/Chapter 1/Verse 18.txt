<p>Verse 18. <i><b>After three years I went up to Jerusalem to see</b></i> <i>Peter</i>] These three years may be reckoned either from the departure of Paul from Jerusalem, or from his return from Arabia to Damascus.</p>
<p><i>To see Peter</i> - Ιστορησαι Πετρον, to become <i>personally acquainted</i> with Peter; for this is the proper import of the verb ιστορειν, from which we have the word ιστορια, <i>history</i>, which signifies a <i>relation of things from personal knowledge</i> and <i>actual</i> <i>acquaintance</i>. How far this is, <i>now</i>, from the sense in which we must take the word, <i>ninety-nine</i> of every <i>hundred</i> of our <i>histories</i> sufficiently show. They are any thing but <i>true</i> relations of <i>facts</i> and <i>persons</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And abode with him fifteen days.</b></i> — It was not, therefore, to get religious knowledge from him that he paid him this visit. He knew as much of the <i>Jewish religion</i> as Peter did, if not more; and as to the <i>Gospel</i>, he received that from the same source, and had preached it <i>three years</i> before this.</p>
