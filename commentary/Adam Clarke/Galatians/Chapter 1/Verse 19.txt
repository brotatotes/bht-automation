Verse 19. James the Lord's brother. â€” Dr. Paley observes: There were at Jerusalem two apostles, or at least two eminent members of the Church, of the name of James. This is distinctly inferred from the Acts of the Apostles, Acts 12:2, where the historian relates the death of James, the brother of John; and yet, in Acts 15:13-21, and in Acts 21:18, he records a speech delivered by James in the assembly of the apostles and elders. In this place JAMES, the Lord's brother, is mentioned thus to distinguish him from JAMES the brother of John. Some think there were three of this name:-1. JAMES, our Lord's brother, or cousin, as some will have it;2. JAMES, the son of Alphaeus; and3. JAMES, the son of Zebedee. But the two former names belong to the same person.
