<p>Verse 19. <i><b>James the Lord's brother.</b></i> â€” Dr. Paley observes: There were at Jerusalem <i>two apostles</i>, or at least <i>two</i> eminent members of the Church, of the name of <i>James</i>. This is distinctly inferred from the Acts of the Apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>, where the historian relates the death of <i>James</i>, the <i>brother of John</i>; and yet, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:13-21">Acts 15:13-21</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:18">Acts 21:18</span>, he records a speech delivered by <i>James</i> in the assembly of the apostles and elders. In this place JAMES, the <i>Lord's brother</i>, is mentioned thus to distinguish him from JAMES the <i>brother of John</i>. Some think there were <i>three</i> of this name:-</p>
<p>1. JAMES, our <i>Lord's brother</i>, or <i>cousin</i>, as some will have it;</p>
<p>2. JAMES, the son of <i>Alphaeus</i>; and</p>
<p>3. JAMES, the son of <i>Zebedee</i>. But the two former names belong to the same person.</p>
