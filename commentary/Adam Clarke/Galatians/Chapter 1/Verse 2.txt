<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:2">Galatians 1:2</span>. <i><b>And all the brethren which are with me</b></i> — It is very likely that this refers to those who were his <i>assistants</i> in preaching the Gospel, and not to any <i>private members</i> of the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Churches of Galatia</b></i> — Galatia was a <i>region</i> or <i>province</i> of Asia Minor; there was neither <i>city</i> nor <i>town</i> of this name. See the <i>preface</i>. But as, in this province, St. Paul had planted several Churches, he directs the epistle to the whole of them; for it seems they were all pretty nearly in the same state, and needed the same instructions.</p>
