<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria</b></i>, c.] The course of the apostle's travels, after his conversion, was this: He went from Damascus to Jerusalem, and from Jerusalem into Syria and Cilicia. "At Damascus the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket and when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples;" <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25-26">Acts 9:25-26</span>. Afterwards, when the brethren knew the conspiracy formed against him at Jerusalem, they brought him down to <i>Caesarea</i>, and sent him forth to <i>Tarsus</i>, a city of <i>Cilicia</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span>. This account in the <i>Acts</i> agrees with that in this <i>epistle</i>.</p>
