<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:24">Galatians 1:24</span>. <i><b>They glorified God in me.</b></i> â€” Hearing now that I preached that faith which before I had persecuted and endeavoured to destroy, they glorified God for the grace which had wrought my conversion. I owe nothing to them; I owe all to God; and they themselves acknowledge this. I received all from God, and God has all the glory.</p>
<p>1. IT appeared of great importance to St. Paul to defend and vindicate his Divine mission. As he had <i>none</i> from <i>man</i>, it was the more necessary that he should be able to show plainly that he had <i>one from God</i>. Paul was not brought into the Christian ministry by any <i>rite</i> ever used in the Christian Church. Neither <i>bishop</i> nor <i>presbyter</i> ever <i>laid hands</i> on him; and he is more anxious to prove <i>this</i>, because his chief honour arose from being sent immediately by God himself: his conversion and the purity of his doctrine showed whence he came. Many since his time, and in the present day, are <i>far more anxious</i> to show that they are legitimately appointed by MAN than by GOD; and are fond of displaying their <i>human credentials</i>. <i>These</i> are easily shown; those that come from God are out of their reach. How idle and vain is a boasted <i>succession from the apostles</i>, while ignorance, intolerance, pride, and vain-glory prove that those very persons have no commission from heaven! Endless cases may occur where <i>man sends</i> and yet <i>God</i> will not <i>sanction</i>. And <i>that man</i> has no right to preach, nor administer the sacraments of the Church of Christ, whom God <i>has</i> <i>not sent</i>; though the whole assembly of <i>apostles</i> had <i>laid their</i> <i>hands</i> on him. God never sent, and never will send, to convert others, a man who is not converted himself. He will never send him to teach <i>meekness, gentleness</i>, and <i>long suffering</i>, who is <i>proud, overbearing, intolerant</i>, and <i>impatient</i>. He, in whom the Spirit of Christ does not dwell, never had a commission to preach the Gospel; he may boast of his human authority, but God will laugh him to scorn. On the other hand, let none run before he is sent; and when he has got the authority of <i>God</i>, let him be careful to take that of the <i>Church</i> with him also.</p>
<p>2. The apostle was particularly anxious that the Gospel should not be corrupted, that the Church might not be perverted. Whatever <i>corrupts</i> the GOSPEL, <i>subverts</i> the CHURCH. The Church is a spiritual building, and stands on a spiritual foundation. Its members are compared to <i>stones in a building</i>, but they are <i>living</i> <i>stones</i>-each instinct with the spirit of a Divine life; Jesus is not only the <i>foundation</i> and the <i>head-stone</i>, but the <i>spirit</i> that <i>quickens</i> and <i>animates</i> all. A Church, where the <i>members</i> are not <i>alive to God</i>, and where the <i>minister</i> is not <i>filled with the</i> <i>meekness and gentleness of Jesus</i>, differs as much from a <i>genuine</i> <i>Church</i> as a <i>corpse</i> does from an <i>active human being</i>. False teachers in Galatia corrupted the Church, by introducing those Jewish ceremonies which God had abolished; and the doctrine of <i>justification</i> by the <i>use of those ceremonies</i> which God had shown by the death of his Son to be of none effect. "If those," says Quesnel, "are justly said to pervert the Gospel of Christ, who were for joining with it human ceremonies which God himself instituted, what do those do, who would fondly reconcile and blend it with the <i>pomps of the devil</i>? The purity of the Gospel cannot admit of any mixture. Those who do not love it, are so far from building up that they <i>trouble</i> and <i>overturn</i> all. There is no ground of trust and confidence for such workmen."</p>
<p>3. If he be a dangerous man in the Church who introduces <i>Jewish</i> or human <i>ceremonies</i> which God has not appointed, how much more is he to be dreaded who introduces any <i>false doctrine</i>, or who <i>labours</i> to <i>undermine</i> or <i>lessen</i> the <i>influence</i> of that which is <i>true</i>? And even he who does not faithfully and earnestly preach and inculcate the true doctrine is not a true pastor. It is not sufficient that a man preach <i>no error</i>; he must preach the <i>truth</i>, the whole <i>truth</i>, and <i>nothing but the truth</i>.</p>
<p>4. How is it that we have so many Churches like those in <i>Galatia</i>? Is it not because, on one hand, we <i>disturb</i> the simplicity of the Christian worship by Jewish, heathenish, or improper rites and ceremonies; and on the other, <i>corrupt</i> the <i>purity</i> of its doctrines by the inventions of men? How does the apostle speak of such corrupters? <i>Let them be accursed</i>. How awful is this! Let every man who officiates as a Christian minister look well to this. His own soul is at stake; and, if any of the flock perish through his ignorance or neglect, their blood will God require at the watchman's hand.</p>
<p>5. St. Paul well knew that, if he endeavoured to <i>please man</i>, he could <i>not be the servant of Christ</i>. Can any minor minister hope to succeed, where even an apostle, had he followed that line, could not? The interests of <i>Christ</i> and those of the <i>world</i> are so opposite, that it is impossible to reconcile them; and he who attempts it shows thereby that he knows neither <i>Christ</i> nor the <i>world</i>, though so deeply immersed in the spirit of the latter.</p>
<p>6. God generally confounds the expectations of men-pleasing ministers; they never ultimately succeed even with men. God abhors them, and those whom they have flattered find them to be dishonest, and cease to trust them. He who is unfaithful to his God should not be trusted by man.</p>
