<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>. <i><b>Who gave himself for our sins</b></i> — Who became a <i>sin-offering</i> to God in behalf of mankind, that they might be saved from their sins.</p>
<p><i><b>Deliver us from this present evil world</b></i> — These words cannot mean <i>created nature</i>, or the <i>earth and its productions</i>, nor even <i>wicked men</i>. The former we shall need while we live, the <i>latter</i> we cannot <i>avoid</i>; indeed they are those who, when converted, form the Church of God; and, by the successive conversion of sinners is the Church of Christ maintained; and the followers of God must live and labour <i>among them</i>, in order to their conversion. The apostle, therefore, must mean the <i>Jews</i>, and their <i>system of carnal</i> <i>ordinances; statutes which were not good, and judgments by which</i> <i>they could not live</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:25">Ezekiel 20:25</span>; and the whole of their ecclesiastical economy, which was a burden neither they nor their fathers were able to bear, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>. <i>Schoettgen</i> contends that the word πονηρος, which we translate <i>evil</i>, should be translated <i>laborious</i> or <i>oppressive</i>, as it comes from πονοσ, <i>labour, trouble</i>, c. The apostle takes occasion, in the very commencement of the epistle, to inform the Galatians that it was according to the <i>will</i> and counsel of God that <i>circumcision</i> should cease, and all the other <i>ritual parts</i> of the Mosaic economy and that it was for this express purpose that Jesus Christ <i>gave himself</i> a sacrifice for <i>our sins</i>, because <i>the law</i> <i>could not make the comers thereunto perfect</i>. It had pointed out the <i>sinfulness</i> of sin, in its various <i>ordinances, washings</i>, c. and it had showed forth the <i>guilt</i> of sin in its numerous <i>sacrifices</i>; but the common sense, even of its own votaries, told them that it <i>was impossible that the blood of bulls and goats</i> <i>should take away sin</i>. A higher atonement was necessary; and when God provided <i>that</i>, all its shadows and representations necessarily ceased. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span></span>.</p>
