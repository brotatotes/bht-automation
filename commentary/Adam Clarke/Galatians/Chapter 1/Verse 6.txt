<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>. <i><b>I marvel that ye are so soon removed</b></i> — It was a matter of <i>wonder</i> to the apostle that a people, so soundly converted to God, should have so soon made shipwreck of their faith. But <i>mutability</i> itself has not a more apt subject to work upon than the <i>human heart</i>; the alternate workings of different passions are continually either <i>changing the character</i>, or giving it a <i>different colouring. Reason</i>, not <i>passion</i>, the <i>word</i> of <i>God</i>, not the <i>sayings</i> of <i>men</i>, should alone be consulted in the concerns of our salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>From him that called you</b></i> — The apostle seems here to mean <i>himself</i>. HE called them <i>into the grace of Christ</i>; and they not only abandoned that grace, but their hearts became greatly <i>estranged</i> from him; so that, though at first they would have <i>plucked out their eyes</i> for him, they at last counted him their <i>enemy</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:14-16">Galatians 4:14-16</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Another gospel</b></i> — It is certain that in the very earliest ages of the Christian Church there were several <i>spurious gospels</i> in circulation, and it was the multitude of these <i>false</i> or <i>inaccurate</i> <i>relations</i> that induced St. Luke to write his own. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>. We have the names of more than <i>seventy</i> of these <i>spurious</i> <i>narratives</i> still on record, and in ancient writers many fragments of them remain; these have been collected and published by <i>Fabricius</i>, in his account of the <i>apocryphal books</i> of the <i>New</i> <i>Testament</i>, 3 vols. 8vo. In some of these gospels, the necessity of circumcision, and subjection to the Mosaic law in unity with the Gospel, were strongly inculcated. And to one of these the apostle seems to refer.</p>
