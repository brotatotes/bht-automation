<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Which is not another</b></i> â€” It is called a <i>gospel</i>, but it differs most essentially from the <i>authentic narratives</i> published by the <i>evangelists</i>. It is not <i>gospel</i>, i.e. <i>good tidings</i>, for it loads you again with the <i>burdens</i> from which the <i>genuine Gospel</i> has disencumbered you. Instead of giving you <i>peace, it troubles you</i>; instead of being a useful <i>supplement</i> to the Gospel of Christ, it <i>perverts</i> that Gospel. You have gained nothing but loss and damage by the change.</p>
