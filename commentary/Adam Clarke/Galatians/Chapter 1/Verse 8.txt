<p>Verse 8. <i><b>But though we, or an angel</b></i> â€” That Gospel which I have already preached to you is the only true Gospel; were I to preach <i>any other</i>, I should incur the curse of God. If your false teachers pretend, as many in early times did, that they received their accounts by the <i>ministry of an angel</i>, let them be accursed; <i>separate them</i> from your company, and have no <i>religious communion</i> with them. Leave them to that God who will show his displeasure against all who <i>corrupt</i>, all who <i>add</i> to, and all who <i>take from</i> the word of his revelation.</p>
<p>Let all those who, from the fickleness of their own minds, are ready to favour the <i>reveries</i> of every pretended <i>prophet</i> and <i>prophetess</i> who starts up, consider the awful words of the apostle. As, in the law, the <i>receiver</i> of stolen goods is as bad as the <i>thief</i>; so the <i>encouragers</i> of such <i>pretended</i> revelations are as bad, in the sight of God, as those impostors themselves. What says the word of God to them? <i>Let them be accursed</i>. Reader, lay these things to heart.</p>
