<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Let him be accursed.</b></i> — Perhaps this is not designed as an <i>imprecation</i>, but a simple direction; for the word here may be understood as implying that such a person should, have no countenance in his bad work, but let him, as Theodoret expresses it, Αλλοτριος εστω του κοινου σωματος της εκκλησιας, <i>be separated</i> from the communion of the Church. This, however, would also imply that unless the person repented, the Divine judgments would soon follow.</p>
