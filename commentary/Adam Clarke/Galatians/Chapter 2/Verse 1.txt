<p>NOTES ON CHAP. II.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span>. <i><b>Then fourteen years after</b></i> â€” There is a considerable difference among critics concerning the time specified in this verse; the apostle is however generally supposed to refer to the journey he took to Jerusalem, about the question of circumcision, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:4-5">Acts 15:4-5</span>, c. These years, says Dr. Whitby, must be reckoned from the time of his conversion, mentioned here <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>, which took place A.D. 35 (33) his journey to Peter was A.D. 38 (36,) and then between that and the council of Jerusalem, assembled A.D. 49 (52,) will be <i>fourteen</i> intervening years. The dates in brackets are according to the chronology which I follow in the <i>Acts</i> of the Apostles. Dr. Whitby has some objections against this chronology, which may be seen in his notes.</p>
<p>Others contend that the journey of which the apostle speaks is that mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:27">Acts 11:27</span>, c., when Barnabas and Saul were sent by the Church of Antioch with relief to the poor Christians in Judea there being at that time a great <i>dearth</i> in that land. St. Luke's not mentioning <i>Titus</i> in that journey is no valid objection against it: for he does not mention him in any part of his history, this being the first place in which his name occurs. And it does seem as if St. Paul did intend purposely to supply that defect, by his saying, <i>I went up with Barnabas</i>, and <i>took Titus with me also</i>. The former St. Luke relates, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>; the latter St. Paul supplies.</p>
