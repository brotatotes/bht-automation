<p>Verse 11. <i><b>When Peter was come to Antioch</b></i> — There has been a controversy whether πετρος, <i>Peter</i>, here should not be read κηφας, <i>Kephas</i>; and whether this <i>Kephas</i> was not a <i>different person</i> from <i>Peter</i> the <i>apostle</i>. This controversy has lasted more than 1500 years, and is not yet settled. Instead of πετρος, <i>Peter</i>, ABCH, several others of good note, with the <i>Syriac, Erpenian, Coptic,</i> <i>Sahidic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, <i>Vulgate,</i> and several of the Greek <i>fathers</i>, read κηφας. But whichsoever of these readings we adopt, the controversy is the same; for the great question is, whether this <i>Peter</i> or <i>Kephas</i>, no matter which name we adopt, be the same with <i>Peter the apostle</i>?</p>
<p>I shall not introduce the arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, which may be all seen in Calmet's dissertation on the subject, but just mention the side where the strength of the evidence appears to lie.</p>
<p>That <i>Peter</i> the <i>apostle</i> is meant, the most sober and correct writers of antiquity maintain; and though some of the <i>Catholic</i> writers have fixed the whole that is here <i>reprehensible</i> on one <i>Kephas</i>, one of the seventy disciples, yet the most learned of their writers and of their popes, believe that <i>St. Peter</i> is meant. Some apparently plausible arguments support the contrary opinion, but they are of no weight when compared with those on the opposite side.</p>
