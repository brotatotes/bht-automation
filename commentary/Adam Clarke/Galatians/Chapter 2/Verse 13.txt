<p>Verse 13. <i><b>And the other Jews dissembled likewise</b></i> — That is: Those who were converted to Christianity from among the <i>Jews</i>, and who had also been convinced that the obligation of the Jewish ritual had ceased, seeing Peter act this part, and also <i>fearing</i> <i>them that were of the circumcision</i>, they separated themselves from the converted Gentiles, and acted so as to convince the Jews that <i>they</i> still believed the law to be of moral obligation; and so powerful was the torrent of such an example, that the gentle, loving-hearted <i>Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation</i>, αυτωντηυποκρισει, <i>with their hypocrisy</i>-feigning to be what they really were not.</p>
