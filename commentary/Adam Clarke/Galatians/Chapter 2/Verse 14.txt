<p>Verse 14. <i><b>That they walked not uprightly</b></i> — ουκ ορθοποδουσι. They did not walk with a <i>straight step</i>-they did not maintain a firm footing.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the truth of the Gospel</b></i> — According to that <i>true</i> <i>doctrine</i>, which states that <i>Christ is the end of the law for</i> <i>justification to every one that believes</i>; and that such are under no obligation to observe circumcision and the other peculiar <i>rites</i> and ceremonies of the law.</p>
<p><i><b>If thou, being a Jew, livest</b></i> — This was a cutting reproof. He was a Jew, and had been circumstantially scrupulous in every thing relative to the law, and it required a miracle to convince him that the Gentiles were admitted, on their believing in Christ, to become members of the same Church, and fellow heirs of the hope of eternal life; and in consequence of this, he went in with the Gentiles and ate with them; i.e. associated with them as he would with Jews. But now, <i>fearing them of the circumcision</i>, he withdrew from this fellowship.</p>
<p><i><b>Why compellest thou the Gentiles</b></i> — Thou didst once consider that <i>they</i> were not under such an obligation, and <i>now</i> thou actest as if thou didst consider the law in full force; but thou art convinced that the contrary is the case, yet actest differently! This is <i>hypocrisy</i>.</p>
