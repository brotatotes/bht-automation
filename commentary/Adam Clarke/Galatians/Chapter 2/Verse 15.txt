<p>Verse 15. <i><b>We</b></i><b> who are </b><i><b>Jews by nature</b></i> — We who belong to the Jewish <i>nation</i>-who have been <i>born, bred</i>, and <i>educated</i> Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>And not sinners of the Gentiles</b></i> — αμαρτωλοι. Not <i>without the</i> <i>knowledge of God</i>, as they have been. αμαρτωλος often signifies a <i>heathen</i>, merely one who had no knowledge of the true God. But among the <i>nations</i> or <i>Gentiles</i> many <i>Jews</i> sojourned; who in Scripture are known by the name of <i>Hellenists</i>, and these were distinguished from those who were termed εξ εθνων αμαρτωλοι, <i>sinners of the Gentiles-heathens</i>, in our common sense of the word; while the others, though living among them, were worshippers of the true God, and addicted to no species of idolatry. Some have translated this passage thus: <i>We Jews, and not Gentiles, by nature</i> <i>sinners</i>; for it is supposed that φυσει here refers to that <i>natural</i> <i>corruption</i> which every man brings into the world. Now, though the <i>doctrine</i> be true, (and the state of man, and universal experience confirm it,) yet it can neither be supported from this place, nor even from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>. It appears, from the use of this word by some of the best Greek authors, that φυσει did not signify <i>by nature</i>, as we use the word, but expressed the <i>natural birth, family</i>, or <i>nation</i> of a man; to distinguish him from any <i>other family</i> or <i>nation</i>. I can give a few instances of this, which are brought to my hand in a small elegant pamphlet, written by Dr. <i>Munter</i>, the present bishop of Zealand, entitled <i>Observationum ex marmoribus Graecis Sacrarum Specimen</i>, and which has been lent to me by the right honourable Lord Teignmouth, to whose condescension, kindness, and learning, many of my studies have been laid under particular obligation.</p>
<p>The word in question is the xxviiith example in the above pamphlet, the substance of which is as follows: In an inscription on a Greek marble, given by Dr. <i>Chandler</i>, page 27, we find these words Ὁ γαμβρος μου Λεων Αρτεμεισιου, ὁ επικαλουμενος Ιασων, οικονει μεν Μειλησιος, φυσει δε Ιασευς· "My son-in-law, Leo, the son of Artemisius, who is called a Jasian, is of the house of Milesius, though <i>by nature</i> he is from Jaso." That is: Jaso being a town of Caria, this Leo is said to be φυσειιασευς, by nature a Jasian, although he sprang from the <i>Milesian</i> family. The following examples will place this in a clearer light. <i>Josephus</i>, Ant. Jud., lib. xi. cap. vi. sec. 5, speaking of <i>Amanes</i>, the Amalekite, says: Και γαρ φυσει τοις Ιουδαιοις απηχθανετο, ὁτι και το γενος των Αμαλεκιτων, εξ ὡν ην αυτος, ὑπ' αυτων διεφθαρτο· "For he was <i>by nature</i> incensed against the Jews, because the nation of the Amalekites, from whom he sprang, had been destroyed by them;" that is, he had a <i>national</i> prejudice or hatred to the Jewish people on the above account. The following example from <i>Dio</i> <i>Chrysostom</i>, Orat. xxxi., is also to the point: Οἱγε (Αθηναιοι) τον δεινα μεν Ολυμπιον κεκληκασι, ουδε φυσει πολιτην ἑαυτων· "For they (the Athenians) called this person an Olympian, though <i>by</i> <i>nature</i> he was not their citizen;" that is, he was called an Olympian, though he was not <i>naturally</i> of that city, or, in other words, he was not <i>born</i> there. From these examples, and the scope of the place, we may argue that the words, <i>we</i> who are <i>Jews by</i> <i>nature</i>, mean, we who were <i>born</i> in the <i>land</i> of <i>Judea</i>, and of <i>Jewish parents</i>. And hence the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>, which speaks most evidently of the <i>heathens</i>, "<i>and were by nature the children</i> <i>of wrath, even as others</i>," may be thus understood: Being <i>Gentiles</i>, and brought up in gross darkness, without any knowledge of God, abandoned to all sensual living, we were, from our very <i>condition</i>, and practical state, exposed to punishment. This sense is at least equally good with that given of the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>, where it is proved that φυσει, in several connections, means <i>truly,</i> <i>certainly, incontestably</i>; "we were, <i>beyond all controversy</i>, exposed to punishment, because we had been <i>born</i> among idolaters, and have <i>lived</i> as they did. Here both senses of the word apply.</p>
