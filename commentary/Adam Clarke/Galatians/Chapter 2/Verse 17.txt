<p>Verse 17. <i><b>But if while we seek to be justified</b></i> â€” If, while we acknowledge that we must be justified by faith in Christ, <i>we</i> <i>ourselves are found sinners</i>, enjoining the necessity of observing the rites and ceremonies of the law, which never could and never can justify, and yet, by submitting to circumcision, we lay ourselves under the necessity of <i>fulfilling the law</i>, which is impossible, we thus constitute ourselves <i>sinners; is, therefore,</i> <i>Christ the minister of sin</i>? Christ, who has taught us to renounce the law, and expect justification through his death?. <i>God forbid</i>! that we should either act so, or think so.</p>
