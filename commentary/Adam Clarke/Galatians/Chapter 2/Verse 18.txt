<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For if I build again the things which I destroyed</b></i> â€” If I act like a Jew, and enjoin the observance of the law on the Gentiles, which I have repeatedly asserted and proved to be <i>abolished</i> by the death of Christ, then I <i>build up what I</i> <i>destroyed</i>, and thus <i>make myself a transgressor</i>, by not observing the law in that way in which I appear to enjoin the observance of it upon others.</p>
