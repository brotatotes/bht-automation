<p>Verse 19. <i><b>For I through the law am dead to the law</b></i> — In consequence of properly considering the <i>nature</i> and <i>requisitions</i> of the law, <i>I am dead</i> to all hope and expectation of help or salvation from <i>the law</i>, and have been obliged to take refuge in the Gospel of Christ. Or, probably the word νομος, LAW, is here put for a <i>system of doctrine</i>; as if he had said, <i>I through the</i> <i>Gospel am dead to the law</i>. The law itself is consigned to death, and another, the Gospel of Christ, is substituted in its stead. The <i>law</i> condemns to death, and I have embraced the <i>Gospel</i> that I might be saved from <i>death</i>, and <i>live unto God</i>.</p>
