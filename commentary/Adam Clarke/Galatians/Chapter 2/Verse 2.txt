<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>. <i><b>I went up by revelation</b></i> — This either means, that he went up at that time by an <i>express revelation</i> from God that it was his duty to do so, made either to the Church of Antioch to send these persons to Jerusalem, or to these persons to go according to the directions of that Church; or the apostle here wishes to say, that, having received the Gospel <i>by revelation</i> from God, to preach Christ among the Gentiles, he went up <i>according</i> to that revelation, and told what God had done by him among the Gentiles: or it may refer to the revelation made to <i>certain prophets</i> who came to Antioch, and particularly <i>Agabus</i>, who signified by the Spirit that there would be a dearth; in consequence of which the disciples purposed to send relief to their poor brethren at Jerusalem. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:27-30">Acts 11:27-30</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>But privately to them which were of reputation</b></i> — τοις δοκουσι. To the <i>chief men</i>; those who were <i>highest</i> in <i>reputation</i> among the apostles. δοκουντες, according to <i>Hesychius</i>, is οι ενδοξοι, <i>the honourable</i>. With these the apostle intimates that he had some private conferences.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest by any means</b></i> — And he held these private conferences with those more eminent men, to give them information how, in consequence of his Divine call, he had preached the Gospel to the Gentiles, and the great good which God had wrought by his ministry; but they, not knowing the nature and end of his call, might be led to suppose he had acted wrong, and thus <i>laboured in</i> <i>vain</i>; and that, if he still continued to act thus, he <i>should</i> <i>labour in vain</i>. It was necessary, therefore, that he should give the apostolic council the fullest information that he had acted according to the Divine mind in every respect, and had been blessed in his deed.</p>
