<p>Verse 20. <i><b>I am crucified with Christ</b></i> — The death of Christ on the cross has showed me that there is no hope of salvation by the law; I am therefore as truly <i>dead</i> to all expectation of justification by the law, as Christ was <i>dead</i> when he gave up the ghost upon the cross. Through him alone <i>I live</i> - enjoy a present life, and have a prospect of future glory.</p>
<p><i><b>Yet not I</b></i> — It is not of my <i>natural life</i> I speak, nor of any <i>spiritual things</i> which I myself have procured; <i>but Christ liveth</i> <i>in me</i>. God made man to be a <i>habitation of his own Spirit</i>: the <i>law</i> cannot <i>live</i> in me so as to give me a <i>Divine life</i>; it does not <i>animate</i>, but <i>kill</i>; but Christ <i>lives</i> in me; he is the <i>soul</i> of my <i>soul</i>; so that I now live to God. But this <i>life</i> I have <i>by the</i> <i>faith of the Son of God</i> - by believing on Christ as a sacrifice for sin; for he <i>loved me</i>, and because he did so <i>he gave himself for</i> <i>me</i> - made himself a sacrifice unto death, that I might be saved from the bitter pains of death eternal.</p>
