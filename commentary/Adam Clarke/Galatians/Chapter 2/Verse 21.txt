<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span>. <i><b>I do not frustrate</b></i> — ουκ αθετω. I do not <i>contemn,</i> <i>despise</i>, or <i>render useless, the grace of God</i>-the doctrine of Christ crucified; which I must do if I preach the necessity of observing the <i>law</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>For if righteousness</b></i> — If <i>justification</i> and salvation <i>come by</i> an observance of <i>the law, then Christ is dead in vain</i>; his death is <i>useless</i> if an observance of the law can save us; but no observance of the law can save us, and therefore there was an <i>absolute necessity</i> for the <i>death</i> of <i>Christ</i>.</p>
<p>1. THE account of the <i>prevarication</i> of Peter in the preceding chapter teaches us a most useful lesson. Let him who assuredly standeth take heed lest he fall. No person in a state of <i>probation</i> is infallible; a man may fall into sin every moment; and he will, if he do not walk with God. Worldly prudence and fleshly wisdom would have concealed this account of the prevarication of Peter; but God tells truth. This the fountain of it; and from him we are to expect not only <i>nothing but the truth</i>, but also the <i>whole truth</i>. If the Gospel were not of God we had never heard of the <i>denial</i> and <i>prevarication</i> of Peter, nor of the <i>contention</i> between Paul and Barnabas. And these accounts are recorded, not that men may <i>justify</i> or <i>excuse</i> their own delinquencies by them, but that they may avoid them; for he must be inexcusable who, with these histories before his eyes, ever <i>denies his Master</i>, or <i>acts</i> <i>the part of a hypocrite</i>. Had the apostles acted in concert to impose a <i>forgery</i> on the world as a Divine revelation, the imposture would have now come out. The falling out of the parties would have led to a discovery of the cheat. This relation, therefore, is an additional evidence of the truth of the Gospel.</p>
<p>2. On, <i>I through the law am dead to the law</i>, c., pious <i>Quesnel</i> makes the following useful reflections:</p>
<p>"The <i>ceremonial law</i>, which is no more than a <i>type</i> and <i>shadow</i> of him, destroys itself by showing us <i>Jesus Christ</i>, who is the <i>truth</i> and the <i>substance</i>. The <i>moral law</i>, by leaving us under our own inability under sin and the curse, makes us perceive the necessity of the <i>law of the heart</i>, and of a <i>Saviour</i> to give it. The <i>law</i> is for the <i>old man</i>, as to its terrible and servile part and it was <i>crucified</i> and <i>died</i> with Christ upon the cross as well as the <i>old</i> <i>man</i>. The <i>new man</i>, and the <i>new law</i>, require a <i>new sacrifice</i>. What need has he of other sacrifices who has <i>Jesus Christ</i>? They <i>in</i> whom this sacrifice <i>lives</i>, do themselves live to God alone; but none can live to him except by <i>faith</i>; and this <i>life of faith</i> consists in <i>dying with Christ</i> to the things of the present world, and in expecting, as co-heirs with him, the blessings of the eternal world. And who can work all this in us but only he who lives in us? That man has arrived to a high degree of <i>mortification</i>, who can say <i>Christ liveth in me, and I am crucified</i> <i>to the world</i>. Such a one must have renounced not only <i>earthly</i> <i>things</i>, but <i>his own self</i> also."</p>
<p>3. Is there, or can there be, any well grounded hope of eternal life but what comes through the <i>Gospel</i>? In vain has the ingenuity of man tortured itself for more than 5000 years, to find out some method of <i>mending</i> the human heart: none has been discovered that even <i>promised</i> any thing likely to be effectual. The <i>Gospel of</i> <i>Christ</i> not only <i>mends</i> but completely <i>cures</i> and <i>new makes</i> infected nature. Who is duly apprised of the infinite excellency and importance of the Gospel? What was the world before its appearance? What would it be were this light extinguished? Blessed Lord! let neither <i>infidelity</i> nor <i>false doctrine</i> rise up to obscure this heavenly <i>splendour</i>!</p>
