Verse Galatians 2:6. Those who seemed to be somewhat — των δοκουντων ειναι τι. Those who were of acknowledged reputation; so the words should be understood, see Galatians 2:2. The verb δοκειν, to seem, is repeatedly used by the best Greek writers, not to call the sense in question, or to lessen it, but to deepen and extend it. Luke 8:18. Perhaps this verse had best be translated thus, connecting διαφερει with απο των δοκουντων: But there is no difference between those who were of acknowledged reputation and myself; God accepts no man's person; but, in the conferences which I held with then, they added nothing to me-gave me no new light; did not attempt to impose on me any obligation, because they saw that God had appointed me my work, and that his counsel was with me.
