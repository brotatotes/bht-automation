<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</span>. <i><b>Those who seemed to be somewhat</b></i> — των δοκουντων ειναι τι. <i>Those who were of acknowledged reputation</i>; so the words should be understood, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>. The verb δοκειν, <i>to seem</i>, is repeatedly used by the best Greek writers, not to call the sense in question, or to lessen it, but to <i>deepen</i> and <i>extend it</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>. Perhaps this verse had best be translated thus, connecting διαφερει with απο των δοκουντων: <i>But there is no difference between those who were</i> <i>of acknowledged reputation and myself; God accepts no man's</i> <i>person; but, in the conferences which I held with then, they added</i> <i>nothing to me</i>-gave me no <i>new light</i>; did not attempt to <i>impose</i> on me any obligation, because they saw that God had appointed me my work, and that his counsel was with me.</p>
