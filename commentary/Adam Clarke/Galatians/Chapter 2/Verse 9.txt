<p>Verse 9. <i><b>James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars</b></i> — Οἱ δοκουντες στυλοι ειναι· <i>Who were known to be very eminent</i>, and <i>acknowledged as chief men</i> among the apostles. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>, for the meaning of the verb δοκειν, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</span>.</p>
<p>Among the Jews, persons of great eminence and importance are represented as <i>pillars</i> and <i>foundations</i> of the world. So Abraham is said to be עמוד העולם <i>ammud heolam</i>, "the <i>pillar</i> of the universe; for by him to this day are the earth and heavens supported." <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 29. "Rabbi Simeon said, Behold, we are the <i>pillars</i> of the world." <i>Idra Rabba</i>, s. 23.</p>
<p>"When Rabbi Jochanan ben Zachai was near death, he wept with a loud voice. His disciples said unto him, O Rabbi, thou <i>high</i> <i>pillar</i>, thou light of the world, thou strong hammer, why dost thou weep?" <i>Aboth. R. Nathan</i>, chap. 24.</p>
<p>So, in <i>Sohar Genes</i>, fol. 5, it is said: "And he saw that Rab. Eleazar went up, and stood there, and with him שאר עמודין <i>shear</i> <i>ammudin</i>, the rest of the <i>pillars</i> (eminent men) who sat there."</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>., fol. 13: "These are the seven righteous men who cleave to the holy blessed God with a pure heart, and they are the seven <i>pillars</i> of the world."</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>., fol. 21, on the words <i>bearing fruit</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:11">Genesis 1:11</span>, it is said: "By this we are to understand the just one, who is the <i>pillar</i> of the world." See Schoettgen, who adds: "These <i>pillars</i> must be distinguished from the <i>foundation</i>. The <i>foundation</i> of the Church is Jesus Christ alone; the <i>pillars</i> are the more <i>eminent</i> <i>teachers</i>, which, without the <i>foundation</i>, are of no value."</p>
<p><i><b>The right hands of fellowship</b></i> — Giving the <i>right hand</i> to another was the mark of confidence, friendship, and fellowship. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+6:2">Leviticus 6:2</span>: <i>If a soul-lie unto his neighbor in that which was delivered him to</i> <i>keep, or in fellowship</i>, בתשומת יד bithsumeth yad, "in <i>giving</i> <i>the hand</i>."</p>
