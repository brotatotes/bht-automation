<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1">Galatians 3:1</span>. <i><b>O foolish Galatians</b></i> — O infatuated people; you make as little use of <i>reason</i> as those who have <i>none</i>; you have acted in this business as those do who are <i>fascinated</i>-they are led blindly and unresistingly on to their own destruction.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye should not obey the truth</b></i> — This clause is wanting in ABD*FG, some others, the <i>Syriac, Erpenian, Coptic, Sahidic, Itala,</i> <i>Vulgate</i> MS., and in the most important of the Greek and Latin <i>fathers</i>. Of the clause Professor <i>White</i> says, <i>Certissime</i> delenda, "It should <i>certainly</i> be expunged."</p>
<p>There are several various readings on this verse, from which it appears that the verse in the best ancient MSS. and versions was read thus: <i>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you? Before</i> <i>whose eyes Jesus Christ crucified hath been plainly set forth</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Among you?</b></i> — εν υμιν is wanting in ABC, several others, the <i>Syriac, Erpenian, Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i> MS., one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, and in several of the <i>fathers</i>. The words appear to disturb the sense, and have obliged commentators to have recourse to a sort of technical meaning; viz. "The doctrine of the Gospel had been so fully preached among these people that it might be said Jesus Christ had been crucified among them; so fully had his sufferings been detailed, and the design of them pointed out."</p>
