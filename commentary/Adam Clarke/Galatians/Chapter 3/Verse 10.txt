<p>Verse 10. <i><b>As many as are of the works of the law</b></i> — All that seek salvation by the performance of the works of the law are under the curse, because it is impossible for them to come up to the spiritual meaning and intent of the law; and the law pronounces them <i>cursed</i> that <i>continue not in all things which are</i> <i>written in the book of the law to do them</i>. Hence, every <i>Jew</i> is necessarily under the curse of God's broken law; and every <i>sinner</i> is under the same curse, though he be not a <i>Jew</i>, who does not take refuge in the salvation provided for him by the Gospel. It is worthy of remark that no printed copy of the Hebrew Bible preserves the word כל <i>col</i>, ALL, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+27:26">Deuteronomy 27:26</span>, which answers to the apostle's word πασι, <i>all</i>, here. St. Jerome says that the Jews suppressed it, lest it should appear that they were bound to perform <i>all</i> things that are written in the book of the law. Of the genuineness of the reading there is no cause to doubt: it exists in <i>six</i> MSS. of <i>Kennicott</i> and <i>De Rossi</i>, in the <i>Samaritan</i> text, in several copies of the <i>Targum</i>, in the <i>Septuagint</i>, and in the quotation made here by the apostle, in which there is no variation either in the MSS. or in the <i>versions</i>.</p>
