<p>Verse 11. <i><b>But that no man is justified by the law</b></i> â€” By the <i>observance</i> of the law, suppose he had even continued in all things that are written in it to do them, <i>is evident</i>; for the Prophet <i>Habakkuk</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span>, has declared, under the direct influence of the Spirit of God, <i>The just shall live by faith</i>; or, he who is just by faith shall live: therefore this justification comes not by <i>works</i>, or the observance of the law, but by <i>faith</i>.</p>
