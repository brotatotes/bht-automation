<p>Verse 12. <i><b>And the law is not of faith</b></i> â€” It promises no forgiveness to believing, but requires obedience. It is not, What do you <i>believe</i>? but, What have you <i>done? The man that doeth</i> <i>them</i> perfectly, at all times, and in all places, <i>he shall live in</i> <i>them</i>; but if in any case he fails, he forfeits his life. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span></span>, &amp;c.</p>
