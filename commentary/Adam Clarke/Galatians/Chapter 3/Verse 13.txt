<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Christ hath redeemed us</b></i> — εξηγορασεν. Hath bought us with a price; viz. his <i>blood</i>, or life.</p>
<p><i><b>Being made a curse for us</b></i> — Being made an <i>atonement</i> for our sins; for whatever was offered as an atonement for sin was considered as <i>bearing the punishment due to sin</i>, and the person who suffered for transgression was considered as bearing the <i>curse</i> in his body; therefore, in the same day in which a criminal was executed it was ordered that his body should be buried, that the land might not be polluted, <i>because he that was hanged</i>, which was the case with every heinous culprit, was considered <i>accursed of</i> <i>God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+21:22-23">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</span>; hence the necessity of <i>removing</i> the <i>accursed</i> THING <i>out of sight</i>.</p>
