Verse 13. Christ hath redeemed us — εξηγορασεν. Hath bought us with a price; viz. his blood, or life.Being made a curse for us — Being made an atonement for our sins; for whatever was offered as an atonement for sin was considered as bearing the punishment due to sin, and the person who suffered for transgression was considered as bearing the curse in his body; therefore, in the same day in which a criminal was executed it was ordered that his body should be buried, that the land might not be polluted, because he that was hanged, which was the case with every heinous culprit, was considered accursed of God, Deuteronomy 21:22-23; hence the necessity of removing the accursed THING out of sight.
