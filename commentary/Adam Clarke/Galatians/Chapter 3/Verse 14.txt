<p>Verse 14. <i><b>That the blessing of Abraham</b></i> — That is, justification or the pardon of sin, with all other blessings consequent on it, such as <i>peace with God, spiritual life</i>, and <i>eternal glory</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ</b></i> — So we find that he was made a <i>curse for us</i>, that the <i>blessings</i> promised to Abraham might be given to them who believe on him, as having been made a <i>curse</i>; i.e. an <i>expiatory victim</i> for them.</p>
<p><i><b>The promise of the Spirit</b></i> — The spirit of adoption, <i>sonship</i> with God; and the <i>Spirit</i> of God to attest that <i>sonship</i>. And all this was <i>through faith</i>. Hence, from the beginning God had purposed that salvation should be <i>through faith</i>, and never expected that any soul of man should be justified by the works of the law; and only gave that law that the exceeding sinfulness of sin might appear, and that man might be prepared to welcome the <i>Gospel</i>, which proclaimed salvation to a lost world through the atoning passion and death of Christ.</p>
