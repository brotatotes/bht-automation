<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Now to Abraham and his seed</b></i> — The promise of salvation by faith was made to Abraham and his posterity.</p>
<p><i><b>He saith not, And to seeds</b></i> — It was one particular kind of posterity which was intended: <i>but as of one-which is Christ</i>; i.e. to the spiritual head, and all believers in him, who are children of Abraham, because they are <i>believers</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>. But why does the apostle say, <i>not of seeds, as of many</i>? To this it is answered, that Abraham possessed in his family <i>two seeds</i>, one <i>natural</i>, viz. the members of his own household; and the other <i>spiritual</i>, those who were like himself because of their faith. The promises were not of a <i>temporal</i> nature; had they been so, they would have belonged to his <i>natural</i> seed; but they did not, therefore they must have belonged to the <i>spiritual</i> posterity. And as we know that promises of justification, c., could not properly be made to <i>Christ</i> in himself, hence we must conclude his <i>members</i> to be here intended, and the word <i>Christ</i> is put here for <i>Christians</i>. It is from Christ that the grace flows which constitutes Christians. Christians are those who believe after the example of Abraham they therefore are the spiritual seed. Christ, working in and by these, makes them the <i>light</i> and <i>salt</i> of the <i>world</i>; and through them, <i>under</i> and <i>by</i> Christ, are all the nations of the earth blessed. This appears to be the most consistent interpretation, though every thing must be understood of <i>Christ</i> in the first instance, and then of <i>Christians</i> only through him.</p>
