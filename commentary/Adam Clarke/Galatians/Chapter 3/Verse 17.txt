<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Confirmed before of God in Christ</b></i> — i.e. The promise of justification, c., made to believers in Christ Jesus, who are the spiritual seed of Christ, as they are children of Abraham, from the similitude of their faith. Abraham believed in God, and it was reckoned to him for justification the Gentiles believed in Christ, and received justification. Probably the word <i>Christ</i> is to be taken, both here and in the preceding verse, for <i>Christians</i>, as has already been hinted. However it be taken, the sense is plainly the same; the promise of salvation must necessarily be to them who believe in Christ, for he is the <i>promised seed</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, through whom every blessing is derived on mankind; and through his <i>spiritual seed</i>-the true <i>Christians</i>, the conquests of the cross are daily spreading over the face of the earth. The present unparalleled dispersion of the sacred writings, in all the regular languages of the universe, is a full proof that all the nations of the earth are likely to be blessed through them; but they have nothing but what <i>they</i> have received from and through Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Four hundred and thirty years after</b></i> — God made a covenant with Abraham that the Messiah should spring from his posterity. This covenant stated that justification should be obtained by faith in the Messiah. The Messiah did not come till 1911 years after the making of this covenant, and the law was given 430 years after the covenant with Abraham, therefore the law, which was given 1481 years before the promise to Abram <i>could be fulfilled</i>, (for so much time elapsed between the giving of the law and the advent of Christ,) could not possibly annul the Abrahamic covenant. This argument is absolute and conclusive. Let us review it. The promise to Abraham respects the Messiah, and cannot be fulfilled but in him. Christians say the Messiah <i>is come</i>, but the advent of him whom they acknowledge as the Messiah did not take place till 1911 years after the covenant was made, therefore no <i>intermediate</i> transaction can affect that covenant. But the law was an <i>intermediate</i> transaction, taking place 430 years after the covenant with Abraham, and could neither annul nor affect that which was not to have its fulfilment till 1481 years after. Justification by faith is promised in the Abrahamic covenant, and attributed to that alone, therefore it is not to be expected from the law, nor can its works justify any, for the law in this respect cannot annul or affect the Abrahamic covenant. But suppose ye say that the law, which was given 430 years after the covenant with Abraham, has superseded this covenant, and limited and confined its blessings to the Jews; I answer: This is impossible, for the covenant most specifically refers to the <i>Messiah</i>, and takes in, not the Jewish people only, <i>but all</i> <i>nations</i>; for it is written, <i>In thy seed-the Messiah</i> and his spiritual progeny, <i>shall all the nations of the earth be blessed</i>. This universal blessedness can never be confined, by any figure of speech, or by any legal act, to the <i>Jewish</i> people exclusively; and, as the covenant was legally made and confirmed, it cannot be annulled, it must therefore remain in reference to its object.</p>
<p>In opposition to us, the Jews assert that the Messiah is <i>not yet</i> <i>come</i>; then we assert, on that ground, that the promise is not yet fulfilled; for the giving of the law to <i>one people</i> cannot imply the fulfilment of the Abrahamic covenant, because that extends to <i>all nations</i>. However, therefore, the case be argued, the Jewish cause derives no benefit from it; and the conclusion still recurs, salvation cannot be attained by the works of the law, forasmuch as the covenant is of <i>faith</i>; and he only, as your prophets declare, who is <i>justified by faith, shall live</i>, or be <i>saved</i>. Therefore we still conclude that those who are only <i>under the law</i> are under the <i>curse</i>; and, as it says, <i>he that doeth these things shall live in</i> <i>them</i>, and <i>he that sinneth shall die</i>, there is no hope of salvation for any man from the law of Moses. And the Gospel of Jesus Christ, proclaiming salvation by faith to a sinful and ruined world, is absolutely necessary, nor can it be superseded by any other institution, whether human or Divine.</p>
<p>How we arrive at the sum of 430 years may be seen in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:40">Exodus 12:40</span>. Dr. Whitby also gives a satisfactory view of the matter. "The apostle refers to the promise made, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>, since from that only are the 430 years to be computed, for then Abraham was 75 <i>years old</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:4">Genesis 12:4</span>; from thence to the birth of Isaac, which happened when Abraham was 100 <i>years old</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:5">Genesis 21:5</span>,) 25 <i>years</i>; from his birth to the birth of Jacob, 60 <i>years</i>, for <i>Isaac</i> <i>was 60 years old when Rebecca bare him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:26">Genesis 25:26</span>. From Jacob's birth to the descent into Egypt, 130 <i>years</i>, as he said to Pharaoh, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:9">Genesis 47:9</span>. The abode of him and his posterity in Egypt was 215 <i>years</i>; so <i>that</i>, with their sojourning in Canaan, was 430 <i>years</i>;" the sum given here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:40">Exodus 12:40</span>, where see the notes.</p>
