<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Wherefore then</b></i><b> serveth </b><i><b>the law?</b></i> — If the law does not annul the Abrahamic covenant, and cannot confer salvation on its votaries, why did God give it? This was a very natural objection, and must arise in the mind of any Jew who had paid attention to the apostle's reasoning.</p>
<p><i><b>It was added because of transgressions</b></i> — It was given that we might know our sinfulness, and the need we stood in of the mercy of God. The law is the <i>right line</i>, the <i>straight edge</i>, that determines the <i>obliquity</i> of our conduct. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>; and especially <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>, where this subject is largely discussed, and the figure explained.</p>
<p><i><b>Till the seed should come</b></i> — The law was to be in force till the advent of the Messiah. After that it was to cease.</p>
<p><b>It was </b><i><b>ordained by angels</b></i> — The ministry of angels was certainly used in giving the law; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:17">Psalms 68:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:53">Acts 7:53</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>; but they were only <i>instruments</i> for <i>transmitting</i>; Moses was the <i>mediator</i> between God and the people, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+5:5">Deuteronomy 5:5</span>.</p>
