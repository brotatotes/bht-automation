<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:2">Galatians 3:2</span>. <i><b>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law</b></i> â€” This may refer to the <i>miraculous gifts</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>, which were very common in the apostolic Church. Did ye receive these extraordinary gifts in consequence of your circumcision, and observing the Mosaic precepts? or was it by the <i>hearing</i> of the Gospel, prescribing <i>faith</i> in Christ crucified? It may also refer to the <i>spirit of adoption</i>, and consequently to their <i>sonship</i>.</p>
