<p>Verse 20. <i><b>A mediator is not</b></i><b> a mediator </b><i><b>of one</b></i> — As a mediator, μεσιτης, signifies a <i>middle</i> person, there must necessarily be <i>two</i> parties, between whom he stands, and acts in reference to both, as he is supposed to have the interests of both equally at heart.</p>
<p>This verse is allowed to be both <i>obscure</i> and <i>difficult</i>; and it is certain that there is little consent among learned men and critics in their opinions concerning it. <i>Rosenmuller</i> thinks that the opinion of <i>Nosselt</i> is to be preferred to all others.</p>
<p>He first translates the words ὁ δε μεσιτης ἑνος ουκ εστιν thus: <i>But he</i> (viz. Moses) <i>is not the mediator of that one race</i> of Abraham, viz. the <i>Christians</i>; for ἑνος relates to the σπερμα ᾡ επηγγελται, <i>the seed that should come</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>, of which he said, ὡς εφ' ἑνος, <i>as of one</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>. If Paul had written ὁ δε μεσιτης του ἑνος εκεινου ουκ εστι, <i>he is not the mediator of</i> <i>one</i>, no person would have had any doubt that σπερματος, <i>seed</i>, ought to be supplied after ἑνος, <i>of one</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19-20">Galatians 3:19-20</span>. The same mode of speaking Paul uses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>; ὁ δε, <i>but he</i>, ὁ for αυτος, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:3">Matthew 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:11">Matthew 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:39">Matthew 12:39</span>, ὁ δε ειπεν, <i>but he said</i>. Though Moses was the Mediator between God and the Israelites, yet he was not the mediator between God and <i>that one</i> <i>seed which was to come</i>; viz. the Gentiles who should believe in Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>But God is one.</b></i> — He is the <i>one God</i>, who is the Father of the spirits of all flesh; the God of the Gentiles as well as the God of the Jews. That this is St. Paul's meaning is evident from his use of the same words in other places, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:5">1 Timothy 2:5</span>: ἑις γαρ Θεος, c., <i>for there is one God</i>, and <i>one mediator between God and man</i>, that is, there is <i>only</i> one God and one mediator for the whole human race <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:5-6">Ephesians 4:5-6</span>: <i>One Lord, one faith, one baptism</i>, εἱς Θεος και πατηρ παντων, ONE GOD <i>and Father of</i> ALL. The sense of the whole is: Moses was the mediator of <i>one part of Abraham's seed</i>, viz. the <i>Israelites</i>; but of the other seed, the <i>Gentiles</i>, he was certainly not the mediator; for the mediator of that seed, according to the promise of God, and covenant made with Abraham, is Christ.</p>
<p>Though <i>Nosselt</i> has got great credit for this interpretation, it was given in substance long before him by Dr. Whitby, as may be seen in the following words: "But this mediator (Moses) was only the mediator of the <i>Jews</i>, and so was only the mediator of <i>one</i> <i>party</i>, to whom belonged the blessings of Abraham, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:14">Galatians 3:14</span>. But GOD, who made the promise that in one should all the families of the earth be blessed, IS ONE; the God of the <i>other party</i>, the <i>Gentiles</i>, as well as of the <i>Jews</i>, επειπερ εἱς ὁ Θεος, <i>seeing he</i> <i>is</i> ONE GOD, <i>who will justify the circumcision by faith, and the</i> <i>uncircumcision through faith</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:30">Romans 3:30</span>." This exposition is so plain, and so well supported by the different scriptures already quoted, that there can be but small, if any, doubt of its propriety. The clause has been translated thus: "<i>Now a mediator</i> <i>supposes two parties, of which God is but one</i>."</p>
