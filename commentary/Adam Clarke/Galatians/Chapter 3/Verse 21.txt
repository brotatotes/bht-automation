<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Is the law then against the promises of God?</b></i> â€” Is it possible that the intervention of the law, in reference to one part of the Abrahamic seed, should annul the promise made to the other? It is impossible.</p>
<p><i><b>For if there had been a law</b></i>, &amp;c.] If any <i>law</i> or <i>rule</i> of life could have been found out that would <i>have given life</i>-saved sinners from death, and made them truly happy, then <i>righteousness</i>- justification, <i>should have been by that law</i>.</p>
