<p>Verse 22. <i><b>But the scripture hath concluded</b></i> — All the writings of the <i>prophets</i> have uniformly declared that men are all <i>sinners</i>, and the <i>law</i> declares the same by the continual <i>sacrifices</i> which it prescribes. All, therefore have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; and, being tried and found guilty, συνεκλεισεν ἡ γραφη, <i>the Scripture hath shut them up</i>-put them in <i>prison</i>, and <i>locked</i> them up, till the time should come in which the sentence of the law should be executed upon them: (See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:9-20">Romans 3:9-20</span>, and the notes there; and particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:32">Romans 11:32</span>, where the apostle uses the same metaphor, and which in the note is particularly explained.)</p>
<p><i>That the promise</i> of justification, <i>by faith of Jesus Christ,</i> <i>might be given to them that believe</i>.</p>
