Verse 23. But before faith came — Before the Gospel was published.We were kept under the law, shut up — εφρουρουμεθα. We were kept as in a strong hold, συγκεκλεισμενοι, locked up, unto the faith-the religion of the Lord Jesus, which should afterwards be revealed. Here the same metaphor is used as above, and for its explanation I must refer the reader to the same place, Romans 11:32.
