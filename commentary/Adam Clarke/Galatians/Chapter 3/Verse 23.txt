<p>Verse 23. <i><b>But before faith came</b></i> — Before the <i>Gospel</i> was published.</p>
<p><i><b>We were kept under the law, shut up</b></i> — εφρουρουμεθα. <i>We were</i> <i>kept as in a strong hold</i>, συγκεκλεισμενοι, <i>locked up, unto the</i> <i>faith</i>-the <i>religion</i> of the Lord Jesus, <i>which should afterwards be</i> <i>revealed</i>. Here the same metaphor is used as above, and for its explanation I must refer the reader to the same place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:32">Romans 11:32</span>.</p>
