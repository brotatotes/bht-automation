<p>Verse 24. <i><b>The law was our schoolmaster</b></i> — Ὁ νομος παιδαγωγος ἡμων γεγονεν εις Χριστον· <i>The law was our pedagogue unto Christ</i>. The παιδαγωγος, pedagogue, is not the <i>schoolmaster</i>, but the <i>servant</i> who had the <i>care of the children</i> to <i>lead them</i> to and <i>bring them back</i> from school, and had the care of them out of school hours. Thus the law did not <i>teach</i> us the <i>living, saving</i> knowledge; but, by its <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i>, and especially by its <i>sacrifices</i>, it directed us to <i>Christ</i>, that <i>we might be justified</i> <i>by faith</i>. This is a beautiful metaphor, and highly illustrative of the apostle's doctrine. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:4">Romans 10:4</span>, where this figure is farther explained.</p>
