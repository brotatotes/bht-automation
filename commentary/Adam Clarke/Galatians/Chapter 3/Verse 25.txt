Verse 25. But, after that faith is come — When Christ was manifested in the flesh, and the Gospel was preached, we were no longer under the pedagogue; we came to Christ, learned of him, became wise unto salvation, had our fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.It is worthy of remark that, as ὁ νομος, the LAW, is used by St. Paul to signify, not only the law, properly so called, but the whole of the Mosaic economy, so ἡ πιστις, the FAITH, is used by him to express, not merely the act of believing in Christ, but the whole of the Gospel.
