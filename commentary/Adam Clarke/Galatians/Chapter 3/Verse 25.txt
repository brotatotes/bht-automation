<p>Verse 25. <i><b>But, after that faith is come</b></i> — When Christ was manifested in the flesh, and the <i>Gospel</i> was preached, we were no longer under the pedagogue; we came to Christ, learned of him, became wise unto salvation, had our fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that, as ὁ νομος, the LAW, is used by St. Paul to signify, not only the <i>law</i>, properly so called, but the <i>whole of the Mosaic economy</i>, so ἡ πιστις, the FAITH, is used by him to express, not merely the <i>act of believing</i> in Christ, but the <i>whole</i> of the <i>Gospel</i>.</p>
