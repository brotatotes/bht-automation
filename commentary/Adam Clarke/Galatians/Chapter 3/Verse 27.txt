<p>Verse 27. <i><b>As many of you as have been baptized into Christ</b></i> â€” All of you who have believed in Christ as the promised Messiah, and received <i>baptism</i> as a public proof that ye had received Christ as your <i>Lord</i> and <i>Saviour, have put on Christ</i>-have received his Spirit, and entered into his interests, and copied his manners. To <i>put on</i>, or to be <i>clothed with one</i>, is to assume the <i>person</i> and <i>character</i> of that one; and they who do so are bound to act <i>his</i> part, and to <i>sustain</i> the <i>character</i> which they have <i>assumed</i>. The <i>profession</i> of <i>Christianity</i> is an assumption of the <i>character of</i> <i>Christ</i>; he has left us an example that we should follow his steps, and we should, as Christians, have that mind in us which was in him.
