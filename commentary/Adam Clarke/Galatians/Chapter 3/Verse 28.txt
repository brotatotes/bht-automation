<p>Verse 28. <i><b>There is neither Jew nor Greek</b></i> — ελλην, <i>Greek</i>, is put here for εθνικος, <i>heathen</i>. Under the Gospel all distinctions are done away, as either <i>helping</i> or <i>hindering</i>; all are equally welcome to Christ, and all have an equal need of him; all persons of all <i>sects</i>, and <i>conditions</i>, and <i>sexes</i>, who believe in him, become one family through him; they are <i>one body</i>, of which he is the <i>head</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither male nor female</b></i> — With great reason the apostle introduces this. Between the privileges of <i>men</i> and <i>women</i> there was a great disparity among the Jews. A <i>man</i> might shave his head, and rend his clothes in the time of mourning; a <i>woman</i> was not permitted to do so. A <i>man</i> might impose the vow of <i>nasirate</i> upon his son; a <i>woman</i> could not do this on her daughter. A <i>man</i> might be shorn on account of the <i>nasirate</i> of his father; a <i>woman</i> could not. A <i>man</i> might betroth his daughter; a <i>woman</i> had no such power. A <i>man</i> might sell his daughter; a <i>woman</i> could not. In many cases they were treated more like <i>children</i> than <i>adults</i>; and to this day are not permitted to assemble with the men in the synagogues, but are put up in galleries, where they can scarcely see, nor can they be seen. Under the blessed spirit of Christianity, they have equal <i>rights</i>, equal <i>privileges</i>, and equal <i>blessings</i>; and, let me add, they are equally <i>useful</i>.</p>
