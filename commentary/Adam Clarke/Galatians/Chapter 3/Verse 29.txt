<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:29">Galatians 3:29</span>. <i><b>And if ye</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>Christ's</b></i> â€” Or, as several good MSS. read, <i>If ye</i> be <i>one in Christ</i>. If ye have all received justification through his blood, and the mind that was in him, then are ye Abraham's seed; ye are that real, spiritual posterity of Abraham, that <i>other seed</i>, to whom the promises were made; and then heirs, according to that promise, being fitted for the rest that remains for the people of God, that heavenly inheritance which was typified by the earthly Canaan, even to the Jews.</p>
<p>1. THE Galatians, it appears, had <i>begun well</i>, and for a time <i>run</i> <i>well</i>, but they permitted Satan to <i>hinder</i>, and they stopped short of the prize. Let us beware of those <i>teachers</i> who would draw us away from trusting in Christ crucified. By listening to such the Galatians lost their religion.</p>
<p>2. The temptation that leads us astray may be as <i>sudden</i> as it is <i>successful</i>. We may lose in one <i>moment</i> the fruit of a <i>whole life</i>! How frequently is this the case, and how few lay it to heart! A man may fall by the means of his <i>understanding</i>, as well as by means of his <i>passions</i>.</p>
<p>3. How strange is it that there should be found any <i>backslider</i>! that one who once felt the power of Christ should ever turn aside! But it is still stranger that any one who has felt it, and given in his life and conversation full proof that he has felt it, should not only <i>let it slip</i>, but at last <i>deny</i> that he ever had it, and even ridicule a work of grace in the heart! Such instances have appeared among men.</p>
<p>4. The Jewish covenant, the sign of which was <i>circumcision</i>, is annulled, though the <i>people</i> with whom it was made are still preserved, and they preserve the <i>rite</i> or <i>sign</i>. Why then should the covenant be annulled? This question admits a twofold answer.</p>
<p>1. This covenant was designed to last only <i>for a time</i>, and when that time came, having waxed old, it vanished away.</p>
<p>2. It was long before that void, through want of the performance of the <i>conditions</i>.</p>
<p>The covenant did not state merely, ye shall be <i>circumcised</i>, and observe all the <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i> of the law; but, <i>ye shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul,</i> <i>mind, and strength, and your neighbour as yourself</i>. This condition, which was the very soul of the covenant, was universally broken by that people. Need they wonder, therefore, that God has cast then off? Jesus alone can restore them, and him they continue to reject. To <i>us</i> the <i>new covenant</i> says the same things: <i>Ye shall love the Lord</i>, c. if we do not so, we also shall be cut off. <i>Take heed, lest he who did not spare the</i> <i>natural branches, spare not thee</i>; therefore, make a profitable use of the <i>goodness</i> and <i>severity</i> of God.</p>
