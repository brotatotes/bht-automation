<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:3">Galatians 3:3</span>. <i><b>Having begun in the Spirit</b></i> — Having received a spiritual religion, which refined and purified your hearts; and having received the Holy Spirit of God, by which ye were endued with various miraculous influences; and the spirit of adoption, by which he were assured of the remission of sins, and incorporation with the family of God:</p>
<p><i><b>Are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</b></i> — Are ye seeking to complete that spiritual religion, and to perfect these spiritual gifts, by the <i>carnal</i> rite of circumcision? It appears that by the <i>Spirit</i>, here, not only the Holy Spirit, but his gifts, are to be understood; and by the <i>flesh, illud membrum in quo circumcisio</i> <i>peragitur</i>; and, by a metonymy, <i>circumcision</i> itself.</p>
