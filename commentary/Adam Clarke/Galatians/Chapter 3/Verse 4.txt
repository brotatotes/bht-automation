<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:4">Galatians 3:4</span>. <i><b>Have ye suffered so many things in vain?</b></i> — Have ye received and lost so much good? The verb πασχων, as compounded with ευ, <i>well</i>, or κακως, <i>ill</i>, and often without either, signifies to <i>suffer pain</i> or <i>loss</i>, or to <i>possess</i> and <i>enjoy</i>. In such a case the man is considered as the <i>patient</i>, and the good or ill <i>acts</i> upon him. Though it is possible that the Galatians had <i>suffered</i> some persecution for the truth of Christ, yet it is as likely that the apostle refers to the <i>benefits</i> which they had received. Ye have received faith, the pardon of your sins, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and with it many extraordinary gifts and graces; and have ye <i>suffered the loss</i> of all these things? Have ye <i>received</i> all these <i>in vain? if yet in vain</i>-if it be credible that ye have sacrificed so many excellent benefits for an imaginary good.</p>
