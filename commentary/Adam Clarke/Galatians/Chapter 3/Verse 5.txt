<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span>. <i><b>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit</b></i> — The apostle means himself: he had been the means of conveying the Holy Spirit to them, and by that <i>Spirit</i> he wrought miracles among them; and he did all this, not as a <i>Jew</i>, (for as <i>such</i> he had no <i>power</i>,) but he did all as a <i>believer in Christ</i>. The word επιχορηγων, which we translate <i>ministereth</i>, is very emphatic, and signifies <i>leading up the chorus</i>, bringing up <i>one after another, adding grace</i> <i>to grace, benefit to benefit</i>; so that it appears that they had not only some, but <i>many</i> benefits; God, by means of his apostle, having greatly enriched them with various spiritual blessings.</p>
