<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:6">Galatians 3:6</span>. <i><b>Abraham believed God</b></i> â€” This is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span>, where see the note; and St. Paul produces it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3-5">Romans 4:3-5</span>, where also see the notes. Abraham, while even uncircumcised, believed in God, and his faith was reckoned to him for justification; and Abraham is called the <i>father of the faithful</i>, or, <i>of believers</i>. If, then, he was justified without the deeds of the law, he was justified by <i>faith</i>; and if he was justified by faith, long before the law was given then the law is not necessary to salvation.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the Jews themselves maintained that Abraham was saved by faith. <i>Mehilta, in Yalcut Simeoni</i>, page 1, fol. 69, makes this assertion: "It is evident that Abraham could not obtain an inheritance either in this world or in the world to come, but by faith."</p>
