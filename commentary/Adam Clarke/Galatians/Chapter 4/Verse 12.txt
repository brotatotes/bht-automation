<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Be as I</b></i><b> am</b>] Thoroughly addicted to the Christian faith and worship, from the deepest conviction of its truth.</p>
<p><i><b>For I</b></i><b> am </b><i><b>as ye</b></i><b> are</b>] I was formerly a Jew, and as zealously addicted to the rites and ceremonies of Judaism as ye are, but I am saved from that mean and unprofitable dependence: "Be therefore as I am now; who was once as you now are." Others think the sense to be this: "Be as affectionate to me as I am to you; for ye were once as loving to me as I am now to you."</p>
<p><i><b>Ye have not injured me at all.</b></i> â€” I do not thus earnestly entreat you to return to your Christian profession because your perversion has been any loss to me, nor because your conversion can be to me any gain: ye have not injured me at all, ye only injure yourselves; and I entreat you, through the intense love I bear to you, as my once beloved brethren in Christ Jesus, to return to him from whom ye have revolted.</p>
