<p>Verse 14. <i><b>And my temptation which was in my flesh</b></i> — On this verse there are a great many various readings, as there are various opinions.</p>
<p>Instead of μου, MY <i>temptation</i>, ABC*D*FG, some others, with the <i>Coptic, Vulgate, Itala</i>, and several of the primitive <i>fathers</i>, have υμων, YOUR temptation.</p>
<p>The word πειρασμον, which we translate <i>temptation</i>, signifies <i>trial</i> of any kind. The verse therefore may be read, "Ye despised not the trial which was in my flesh;" or, "Ye despised not your trial, which was in my flesh:" i.e. what my flesh suffered on your account, the afflictions I passed through in consequence of my severe labours on your account. You did not consider me less an apostle of God on account of my sinking for a time under the weight of my work. Had they been disaffected towards him at that time, they would have used this to the prejudice of his apostolic mission. "What! do you pretend to be an extraordinary messenger from God, and yet are suffered to fall into sickness under the severity of your labour? If God sent you, would he not sustain you?" This would have been quite natural, had they not been well affected toward him. But, on the contrary, notwithstanding these afflictions, they <i>received him as an angel of God</i>-as a messenger from heaven, and <i>as Jesus Christ</i> himself. This appears to me to be the simple meaning of the apostle, and that he neither alludes to a <i>bodily</i> nor <i>mental</i> infirmity, which <i>generally</i> or <i>periodically</i> afflicted him, as some have imagined. Nor does he appear at all to speak of the <i>same case</i> as that mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>, where I wish the reader to consult the notes. That St. Paul had frequent and severe afflictions, in consequence of his constant and severe exertions in the Gospel ministry, we may readily believe, and of this his own words bear sufficient testimony.</p>
<p>See his affecting account, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23-29">2 Corinthians 11:23-29</span>, and the notes there.</p>
