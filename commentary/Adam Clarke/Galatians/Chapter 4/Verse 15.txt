<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?</b></i> — <i>Ye spake</i> <i>of</i> should be in italics, there being no corresponding word in the Greek text. Perhaps there is not a sentence in the New Testament more variously translated than this. I shall give the original: τις ουν ην ὁ μακαρισμος ὑμων· <i>What was then your blessedness</i>! Or, <i>How great was your happiness at that time</i>! Or, <i>What blessings</i> <i>did ye then pour on me</i>! It is worthy of remark, that, instead of τις, <i>what</i>, ABCFG, several others, the older <i>Syriac</i>, the later <i>Syriac</i> in the <i>margin</i>, the <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, and some of the <i>fathers</i>, have που, <i>where</i>; and ην, <i>was</i>, is omitted by ACD, several others, also the <i>Vulgate, Itala</i>, and the <i>Latin fathers</i>. According to these authorities the text should be read thus: <i>Where then is your blessedness</i>? Having renounced the Gospel, you have lost your <i>happiness</i>. What have your false teachers given you to compensate the loss of communion with God, or that <i>Spirit of adoption</i>, that <i>Spirit of Christ</i>, by which you cried <i>Abba, Father</i>! If, however, we understand the words as implying the <i>benedictions</i> they then heaped on the <i>apostle</i>, the sense will be sufficiently natural, and agree well with the concluding part of the verse; <i>for I bear you record,</i> <i>that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and</i> <i>have given them to me</i>. You had then the strongest affection for me; you loved God, and you loved me for God's sake, and were ready to give me the most unequivocal proof of your love.</p>
<p><i>Dearer than one's eyes</i>, or to profess to <i>give one's eyes</i> for the sake of a person, appears to have been a proverbial expression, intimating the highest tokens of the strongest affection. We find a similar form of speech in <i>Terence</i>, Adelphi, act iv., scene 5, ver. 67. </p>
