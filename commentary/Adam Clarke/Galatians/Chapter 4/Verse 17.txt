<p>Verse 17. <i><b>They zealously affect you</b></i><b>, but </b><i><b>not well</b></i> — It is difficult for common readers to understand the meaning of these words: perhaps it would be better to translate Ζηλουσιν ὑμας ου καλως, these false teachers <i>endeavour to conciliate your esteem,</i> <i>but not in honest</i> or true <i>principles</i>; they work themselves into your good graces; they wish you to place all your affection upon themselves.</p>
<p><i><b>They would exclude you</b></i> — They wish to <i>shut you out</i> from the affection of your apostle, <i>that you might affect them</i>, ἱνα αυτους ζηλουτε, that you might love them alone, hear them alone, abide by their directions only, and totally abandon him who called you into the grace of the Gospel of Christ. Some MSS. read ἡμας, <i>us</i>, instead of ὑμας, <i>you</i>; they wish to shut <i>us</i> entirely out from among you, that you may receive and believe <i>them</i> alone. The sense is nearly the same but the former appears to be the more authentic reading.</p>
