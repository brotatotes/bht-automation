<p>Verse 18. <b>It is </b><i><b>good to be zealously affected</b></i> — It is well to have a <i>determined mind</i> and an <i>ardent heart</i> in reference to things which are laudable and good.</p>
<p><i><b>Not only when I am present</b></i> — You were thus attached to me when I was among you, but now ye have lost both your reverence and affection for me. Your false teachers pretended great concern for you, that you might put all your confidence in <i>them</i>; they have gained their end; they have estranged you from me, and got you to renounce the Gospel, and have brought you again into your former bondage.</p>
