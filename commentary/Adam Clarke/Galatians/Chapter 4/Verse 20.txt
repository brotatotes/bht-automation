<p>Verse 20. <i><b>I desire to be present with you</b></i> — I wish to accommodate my doctrine to your state; I know not whether you need stronger reprehension, or to be dealt with more leniently.</p>
<p><i><b>I stand in doubt of you.</b></i> — I have doubts concerning your state; the progress of error and conviction among you, which I cannot fully know without being among you, This appears to be the apostle's meaning, and tends much to soften and render palatable the severity of his reproofs.</p>
