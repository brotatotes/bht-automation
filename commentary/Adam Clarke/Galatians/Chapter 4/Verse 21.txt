<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Ye that desire to be under the law</b></i> — Ye who desire to incorporate the Mosaic institutions with Christianity, and thus bring yourselves into bondage to circumcision, and a great variety of oppressive rites.</p>
<p><i><b>Do ye not hear the law?</b></i> — Do ye not understand what is written in the <i>Pentateuch</i> relative to Abraham and his children. It is evident that the word <i>law</i> is used in <i>two senses</i> in this verse. It first means the <i>Mosaic institutions</i>; secondly, the <i>Pentateuch</i>, where the history is recorded to which the apostle refers.</p>
