<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Was born after the flesh</b></i> — <i>Ishmael</i> was born <i>according</i> <i>to the course of nature</i>, his parents being both of a proper age, so that there was nothing uncommon or supernatural in his birth: this is the proper meaning of the apostle's κατα σαρκα, <i>after</i> or <i>according to the flesh</i>, and answers to the Hebrew phrase, על דרך בשר <i>al derec basar</i>, according to the manner of the flesh, i.e. <i>naturally, according to the common process of nature</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>By promise.</b></i> — Both Abraham and Sarah had passed that age in which the procreation of children was possible on <i>natural</i> <i>principles</i>. The birth, therefore, of Isaac was <i>supernatural</i>; it was the effect of an especial promise of God; and it was only on the ground of that promise that it was either credible or possible.</p>
