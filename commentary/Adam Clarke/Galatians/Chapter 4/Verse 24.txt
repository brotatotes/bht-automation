<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Which things are an allegory</b></i> — They are to be understood <i>spiritually</i>; more being intended in the account than meets the eye.</p>
<p><i>Allegory</i>, from αλλος, <i>another</i>, and αγορεω, or αγοπευω, <i>to speak</i>, signifies a <i>thing that is a representative of another</i>, where the <i>literal sense</i> is the representative of a <i>spiritual</i> <i>meaning</i>; or, as the glossary expresses it, ἑτερως κατα μεταφρασιν νοουμενα, και ου κατα την αναγνωσιν· "where the thing is to be understood differently in the interpretation than it appears in the reading."</p>
<p><i>Allegories</i> are frequent in all countries, and are used by all writers. In the life of <i>Homer</i>, the author, speaking of the marriage of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Juno</i>, related by that poet, says: δοκει ταυτα αλληγορεισθαι, ὁτι Ἡρα μεν νοειται ὁ αηρ-Ζευς δε, ὁ αιθηρ· "It appears that these things are to be understood <i>allegorically</i>; for Juno means the <i>air</i>, Jupiter the <i>aether</i>." <i>Plutarch</i>, in his treatise <i>De Iside et Osir</i>., says: ὡσπερ Ἑλληνες Κρονον αλληγορουσι τον χρονον· "As the Greeks allegorize <i>Cronos</i> (Saturn) into <i>Chronos</i> (Time.)" It is well known how fond the Jews were of <i>allegorizing</i>. Every thing in the <i>law</i> was with them an <i>allegory</i>. Their <i>Talmud</i> is full of these; and one of their most sober and best educated writers, <i>Philo</i>, abounds with them. Speaking (De <i>Migrat. Abrah</i>., page 420) of the five daughters of Zelophehad, he says: ἁς αλληγορουντες αισθησεις ειναι φαμεν· "which, <i>allegorizing</i>, we assert to be the <i>five senses</i>!"</p>
<p>It is very likely, therefore, that the allegory produced here, St. Paul had borrowed from the Jewish writings; and he brings it in to convict the <i>Judaizing</i> Galatians on their own principles; and neither he nor we have any thing farther to do with this allegory than as it applies to the subject for which it is quoted; nor does it give any license to those men of vain and superficial minds who endeavour to find out <i>allegories</i> in every portion of the sacred writings, and, by what they term <i>spiritualizing</i>, which is more properly <i>carnalizing</i>, have brought the testimonies of God into disgrace. May the <i>spirit of silence</i> be poured out upon all such <i>corrupters</i> of the word of God!</p>
<p><i><b>For these are the two covenants</b></i> — These <i>signify</i> two different systems of religion; the one by <i>Moses</i>, the other by the <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The one from the Mount Sinai</b></i> — On which the law was published; which was typified by <i>Hagar</i>, Abraham's bond maid.</p>
<p><i><b>Which gendereth to bondage</b></i> — For as the <i>bond maid</i> or <i>slave</i> could only <i>gender-bring forth her children</i>, in a <i>state of slavery</i>, and subject also to become <i>slaves</i>, so all that are born and live under those Mosaic institutions are <i>born</i> and <i>live</i> in a state of bondage-a bondage to various <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i>; under the <i>obligation</i> to keep the <i>whole law</i>, yet, from its severity and their frailness, obliged to live in the habitual breach of it, and in consequence exposed to the <i>curse</i> which it pronounces.</p>
