<p>Verse 25. <i><b>For this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia</b></i> — Το γαρ Αγαρ Σινα ορος εστιν εν τη Αραβια. This is the common reading; but it is read differently in some of the most respectable MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers</i>; thus: το γαρ Σινα ορος εστιν εν τῃ Αραβια, <i>for this Sinai is a mountain of Arabia</i>; the word Αγαρ, <i>Agar</i>, being omitted. This reading is supported by CFG, some others, the <i>AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and one copy of the <i>Itala</i>; by <i>Epiphanius, Damascenus, Ambrosiaster, Jerome, Augustine, Hilary,</i> <i>Sedulius</i>, and <i>Bede</i>; and the word is sometimes, though not always, omitted by <i>Cyril</i> and <i>Origen</i>, which proves that in their time there were doubts concerning the common reading.</p>
<p>Of the word <i>Agar</i> in this verse, which renders the passage very obscure and difficult, Professor <i>White</i> says, <i>forsitan</i> delendum, "probably it should be expunged." <i>Griesbach</i> has left it in the text with a note of <i>doubtfulness</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Answereth to Jerusalem</b></i> — Hagar, the bond maid, bringing forth children in a state of slavery, <i>answereth to Jerusalem that now</i> <i>is</i>, συστοιχει, <i>points out</i>, or, <i>bears a similitude</i> to, Jerusalem in her present state of subjection; which, with <i>her</i> <i>children</i>-her citizens, is not only in <i>bondage to the Romans</i>, but in a worse bondage to the <i>law</i>, to its oppressive <i>ordinances</i>, and to the heavy curse which it has pronounced against all those who do not keep them.</p>
