<p>Verse 26. <i><b>But Jerusalem which is above</b></i> — The apostle still follows the Jewish <i>allegory</i>, showing not only how the story of <i>Hagar</i> and <i>Sarah, Ishmael</i> and <i>Isaac</i>, was allegorized, but pointing out also that even <i>Jerusalem</i> was the subject of allegory; for it was a maxim among the rabbins, that "whatsoever was in the earth, the same was also found in heaven for there is no matter, howsoever small, in this world, that has not something similar to it in the spiritual world." On this maxim, the Jews imagine that every earthly thing has its <i>representative</i> in heaven; and especially whatever concerns <i>Jerusalem</i>, the <i>law</i>, and its <i>ordinances</i>. Rab. <i>Kimchi</i>, speaking of Melchizedec, king of Salem, says: זו ירושלם של מעלה <i>zu Yerushalem shel malah</i>, "This is the Jerusalem that is from above." This phrase frequently occurs among these writers, as may be seen in <i>Schoettgen</i>, who has written an express dissertation upon the subject. <i>Hor. Hebr</i>., vol. i. page 1205.</p>
<p><i><b>Is free, which is the mother of us all.</b></i> — There is a spiritual Jerusalem, of which this is the type; and this Jerusalem, in which the souls of all the righteous are, is free from all bondage and sin: or by this, probably, the kingdom of the Messiah was intended; and this certainly answers best to the apostle's meaning, as the subsequent verse shows. There is an <i>earthly</i> <i>Jerusalem</i>, but this earthly Jerusalem typifies a <i>heavenly</i> <i>Jerusalem</i>: the former, with all her <i>citizens</i>, is in <i>bondage</i>; the latter is a <i>free city</i>, and all her <i>inhabitants</i> are <i>free</i> also. And this Jerusalem is <i>our mother</i>; it signifies the Church of Christ, the metropolis of Christianity, or rather the <i>state</i> of <i>liberty</i> into which all true believers are brought. The word παντων, <i>of all</i>, is omitted by almost every MS. and <i>version</i> of antiquity and importance, and by the most eminent of the <i>fathers</i> who quote this place; it is undoubtedly spurious, and the text should be read thus: <i>But Jerusalem, which is above, is free, which</i> <i>is our mother</i>.</p>
