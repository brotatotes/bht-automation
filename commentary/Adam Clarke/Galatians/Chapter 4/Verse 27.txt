<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Rejoice</b></i><b>, thou </b><i><b>barren that bearest not</b></i> â€” This quotation is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:1">Isaiah 54:1</span>, and is certainly a promise which relates to the <i>conversion of the Gentiles</i>, as the following clause proves; for <i>the desolate</i> - the Gentile world, <i>hath many more</i> <i>children</i> - is a much larger and more numerous Church, than <i>she - Jerusalem</i>, the Jewish state, <i>which hath a husband</i> - has been so long in <i>covenant with God</i>, living under his continual protection, and in possession of a great variety of spiritual advantages; and especially those offered to her by the Gospel, which she has rejected, and which the Gentiles have accepted.</p>
