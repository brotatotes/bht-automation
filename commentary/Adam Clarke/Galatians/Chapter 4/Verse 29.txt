<p>Verse 29. <i><b>But as then he</b></i> — Ishmael, <i>who was born after the</i> <i>flesh</i>-whose birth had nothing <i>supernatural</i> in it, but was according to the ordinary course of nature,</p>
<p><i><b>Persecuted him</b></i> — Isaac, <i>who was born after the Spirit</i>-who had a supernatural birth, according to the <i>promise</i>, and through the efficacy, of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, giving effect to that promise-<i>Sarah</i> <i>shall have a son</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:16-21">Genesis 17:16-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:1">Genesis 21:1</span>, c.</p>
<p><i>Persecuted him</i> the persecution here referred to is that mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:9">Genesis 21:9</span>. It consisted in mocking his brother Isaac.</p>
<p><i><b>Even so</b></i><b> it is </b><i><b>now.</b></i> — So the Jews, in every place, persecute the Christians; and show thereby that they are rather of the posterity of <i>Hagar</i> than of <i>Sarah</i>.</p>
