<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span>. <i><b>Even so we</b></i> — The whole Jewish people were in a state of nonage while under the law.</p>
<p><i><b>The elements of the world</b></i> — A mere Jewish phrase, יסודי עולם הזה <i>yesodey olam hazzeh</i>, "the principles of this world;" that is, the <i>rudiments</i> or <i>principles</i> of the <i>Jewish religion</i>. The apostle intimates that the law was not the science of salvation, it was only the <i>elements</i> or <i>alphabet</i> of it; and in the <i>Gospel</i> this alphabet is composed into a most glorious system of Divine knowledge: but as the alphabet is nothing of itself, unless compounded into syllables, words, sentences, and discourses; so the <i>law</i>, taken by itself, gives no salvation; it contains indeed the <i>outlines</i> of the Gospel, but it is the Gospel alone that <i>fills</i> <i>up</i> these outlines.</p>
