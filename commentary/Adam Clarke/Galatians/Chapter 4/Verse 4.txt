<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>. <i><b>When the fulness of the time was come</b></i> — The time which God in his infinite wisdom counted best; in which all his counsels were <i>filled up</i>; and the time which his Spirit, by the prophets, had specified; and the time to which he intended the Mosaic institutions should extend, and beyond which they should be of no avail.</p>
<p><i><b>God sent forth his Son</b></i> — Him who came immediately from God himself, <i>made of a woman</i>, according to the promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>; produced by the power of God in the womb of the Virgin Mary without any intervention of man; hence he was called <i>the Son of</i> <i>God</i>. See Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>, and the note there.</p>
<p><i><b>Made under the law</b></i> — In subjection to it, that in him all its designs might be fulfilled, and by his <i>death</i> the whole might be abolished; the law <i>dying</i> when the Son of God expired upon the cross.</p>
