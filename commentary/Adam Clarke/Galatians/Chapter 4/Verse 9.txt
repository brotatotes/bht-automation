Verse 9. Now, after that ye have known God — After having been brought to the knowledge of God as your Saviour.Or rather are known of God — Are approved of him, having received the adoption of sons.To the weak and beggarly elements — After receiving all this, will ye turn again to the ineffectual rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic law-rites too weak to counteract your sinful habits, and too poor to purchase pardon and eternal life for you? If the Galatians were turning again to them, it is evident that they had been once addicted to them. And this they might have been, allowing that they had become converts from heathenism to Judaism, and from Judaism to Christianity. This makes the sense consistent between the 8th and 9th verses. Galatians 4:8-9.
