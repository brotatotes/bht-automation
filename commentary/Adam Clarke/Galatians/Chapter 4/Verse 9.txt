<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Now, after that ye have known God</b></i> — After having been brought to the knowledge of God as your Saviour.</p>
<p><i><b>Or rather are known of God</b></i> — Are <i>approved</i> of him, having received the adoption of sons.</p>
<p><i><b>To the weak and beggarly elements</b></i> — After receiving all this, <i>will ye turn again</i> to the ineffectual rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic law-<i>rites</i> too <i>weak</i> to counteract your sinful habits, and too <i>poor</i> to <i>purchase pardon</i> and <i>eternal life</i> for you? If the Galatians were <i>turning again</i> to them, it is evident that they had been <i>once</i> addicted to them. And this they might have been, allowing that they had become <i>converts</i> from <i>heathenism</i> to <i>Judaism,</i> and from Judaism to Christianity. This makes the sense consistent between the 8th and 9th verses. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8-9">Galatians 4:8-9</span>.</p>
