<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>. <i><b>Stand fast therefore in the liberty</b></i> — This is intimately connected with the preceding chapter: the apostle having said, just before, <i>So then, brethren, we are not children</i> <i>of the bond woman, but of the free</i>, immediately adds, <i>Stand fast</i> <i>therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free</i>. Hold fast your Christian profession; it brings spiritual liberty: on the contrary, Judaism brings spiritual bondage. Among the Jews, the Messiah's reign was to be a reign of liberty, and hence the Targum, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="la+2:22">Lamentations 2:22</span>, says: "Liberty shall be publicly proclaimed to thy people of the house of Israel, על יד משיחא <i>al yad Mashicha</i>, by the hand of the Messiah, such as was granted to them by Moses and Aaron at the time of the passover."</p>
<p>The liberty mentioned by the apostle is freedom from Jewish rites and ceremonies, called properly here the <i>yoke of bondage</i>; and also liberty from the power and guilt of sin, which nothing but the grace of Christ can take away.</p>
