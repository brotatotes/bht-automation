<p>Verse 10. <i><b>I have confidence in you</b></i> — I now feel a persuasion from the Lord that I shall not be permitted to expostulate with you in vain; <i>that ye will be none otherwise minded</i> - that ye will be aware of the danger to which ye are exposed, that ye will retreat in time, and recover the grace which ye have lost.</p>
<p><i><b>But he that troubleth you</b></i> — The false teacher, who sowed doubtful disputations among you, and thus has troubled the repose of the whole Church, <i>shall bear</i> his <i>judgment</i> - shall meet with the punishment he deserves, for having sown <i>his tares</i> among <i>God's</i> <i>wheat</i>.</p>
