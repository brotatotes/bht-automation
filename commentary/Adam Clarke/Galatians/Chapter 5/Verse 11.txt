<p>Verse 11. <i><b>If I yet preach circumcision</b></i> â€” it is very likely that some of the false apostles, hearing of Paul's having circumcised Timothy, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>, which must have been done <i>about this time</i>, reported him as being an advocate for circumcision, and by this means endeavoured to sanction their own doctrine. To this the apostle replies: Were it so, that I am a friend to this measure, is it likely that I should suffer persecution from the Jews? But I am every where persecuted by them, and I am persecuted <i>because</i> I am known to be an enemy to circumcision; were I a friend to this doctrine, the <i>offence of the</i> <i>cross</i>-preaching salvation only through the sacrifice of Christ, would soon cease; because, to be consistent with myself, if I preached the necessity of circumcision I must soon cease to preach Christ crucified, and then the Jews would be no longer my enemies.</p>
