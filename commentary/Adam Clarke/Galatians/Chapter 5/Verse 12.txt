<p>Verse 12. <i><b>I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</b></i> — This saying has puzzled many, and different interpretations of the place have been proposed by learned men.</p>
<p>At first sight it seems as if the apostle was praying for the <i>destruction</i> of the false teachers who had perverted the Churches of Galatia. Mr. Wakefield thought οφελον αποκοψονται might be translated, <i>I wish that they were made to weep</i>; and in his translation of the New Testament the passage stands thus: "I wish that they who are unsettling you may lament it." I believe the apostle never meant any such thing. As the persons who were breeding all this confusion in the Churches of Galatia were <i>members of that Church</i>, the apostle appears to me to be simply expressing his desire that they might be <i>cut off</i> or <i>excommunicated</i> from the Church. <i>Kypke</i> has given an abundance of examples where the word is used to signify <i>amputating; cutting off from society,</i> <i>office, c. excluding</i>. In opposition to the notion of excommunication, it might be asked: "Why should the apostle wish these to be excommunicated when it was his own office to do it?" To this it may be answered: The apostle's authority was greatly weakened among that people by the influence of the false teachers, so that in all probability he could exercise no ecclesiastical function; he could therefore only <i>express his wish</i>. And the whole passage is so parallel to that, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6-7">1 Corinthians 5:6-7</span>, that I think there can be no reasonable doubt of the apostle's meaning: Let those who are unsettling the Church of Christ in your district be excommunicated; this is my wish, that they should no longer have any place among you."</p>
