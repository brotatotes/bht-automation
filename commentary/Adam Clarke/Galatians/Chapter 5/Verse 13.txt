<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Ye have been called unto liberty</b></i> — A total freedom from all the burthensome rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic law. <i>Only</i> use <i>not that liberty for an occasion to the flesh</i>. By <i>flesh,</i> here, we may understand all the unrenewed desires and propensities of the mind; whatsoever is not under the influence and guidance of the Holy Spirit of God. Your liberty is from that which would <i>oppress the spirit</i>; not from that which would lay <i>restraints</i> on the <i>flesh</i>. The Gospel proclaims liberty from the <i>ceremonial</i> law: but binds you still faster under the <i>moral law</i>. To be freed from the <i>ceremonial</i> law is the <i>Gospel liberty</i>; to pretend freedom from the <i>moral</i> law is <i>Antinomianism</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>By love serve one another.</b></i> — Having that faith which worketh by love, serve each other to the uttermost of your power: δουλευετε, serve each other, when necessary, as <i>slaves</i> serve their masters. Several excellent MSS. and <i>versions</i>, instead of δια της αγαπης, <i>by</i> <i>love</i>, have τῃ αγαπῃ του Πνευματος, <i>in the love of the Spirit serve</i> <i>one another</i>.</p>
