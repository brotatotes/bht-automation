<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Walk in the Spirit</b></i> — Get back that Spirit of God which you have grieved and lost; take up that <i>spiritual</i> religion which you have abandoned.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</b></i> — If the Spirit of God dwell in and rule your heart, the whole <i>carnal mind</i> will be destroyed; and then, not only carnal ordinances will be abandoned, but also the works and propensities of the flesh.</p>
