<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit</b></i> â€” God still continues to strive with you, notwithstanding your apostasy, showing you whence you have fallen, and exciting you to return to him; but your own obstinacy renders all ineffectual; and through the influence of these different principles, you are kept in a state of self-opposition and self-distraction, <i>so that you cannot</i> <i>do the things that ye would</i>. You are convinced of what is <i>right</i>, and ye wish to do it; but, having abandoned the Gospel and the grace of Christ, the law and its ordinances which ye have chosen in their place afford you no <i>power</i> to conquer your evil propensities. It was on this ground that the apostle exhorted them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:16">Galatians 5:16</span>, to <i>walk in the Spirit, that they might not fulfil the lust of the</i> <i>flesh</i>; as without the grace of God they could do nothing. Who can suppose that he speaks this of adult <i>Christians</i>?</p>
