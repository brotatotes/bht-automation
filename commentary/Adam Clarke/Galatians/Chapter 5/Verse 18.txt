<p>Verse 18. <i><b>But, if ye be led of the Spirit</b></i> â€” If ye receive again the Gospel and the grace of Christ, and permit yourselves to be influenced by the Holy Spirit whom you are now grieving, <i>ye are</i> <i>not under the law</i>-ye will not feel those evil propensities which now disgrace and torment you; but they must prevail while you are not under the influence of the grace and Spirit of Christ.</p>
