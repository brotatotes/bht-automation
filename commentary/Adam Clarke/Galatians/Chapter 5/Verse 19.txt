<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Now the works of the flesh are manifest</b></i> — By <i>flesh</i> we are to understand the evil and fallen state of the soul, no longer under the guidance of God's Spirit and right reason, but under the animal passions; and they are even rendered more irregular and turbulent by the influence of <i>sin</i>; so that man is in a worse state than the brute: and so all-commanding is this evil nature that it leads men into all kinds of crimes; and among them the following, which <i>are manifest</i>-known to all, and most prevalent; and, though these are most solemnly forbidden by your <i>law</i>, the observance of its ordinances gives no power to overcome them, and provides no pardon for the guilt and condemnation produced by them.</p>
<p><i><b>Adultery</b></i> — μοιχεια. Illicit connection with a <i>married</i> person. This word is wanting in this place in the best MSS., versions, and fathers; the next term often comprehending both.</p>
<p><i><b>Fornication</b></i> — πορνεια. Illicit connection between <i>single</i> or <i>unmarried</i> persons; yet often signifying <i>adultery</i> also.</p>
<p><i><b>Uncleanness</b></i> — ακαθαπσια. Whatever is opposite to <i>purity</i>; probably meaning here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:21">2 Corinthians 12:21</span>, <i>unnatural</i> practices; sodomy, bestiality.</p>
<p><i><b>Lasciviousness</b></i> — ασελγεια. Whatever is contrary to <i>chastity</i>; all <i>lewdness</i>.</p>
