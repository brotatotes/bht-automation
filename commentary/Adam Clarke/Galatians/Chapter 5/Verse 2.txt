<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2">Galatians 5:2</span>. <i><b>If ye be circumcised</b></i> â€” By circumcision you take on you the whole obligation of the Jewish law, and consequently profess to seek salvation by means of its observances; and therefore Christ can profit you nothing; for, by seeking justification by the <i>works of the law</i>, you renounce justification by <i>faith in</i> <i>Christ</i>.</p>
