<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Idolatry</b></i> — Worshipping of idols; frequenting idol festivals; all the rites of Bacchus, Venus, Priapus, c., which were common among the Gentiles.</p>
<p><i><b>Witchcraft</b></i> — φαρμακεια, from φαρμακον, <i>a drug</i> or <i>poison</i> because in all spells and enchantments, whether true or false, <i>drugs</i> were employed. As <i>a drug</i>, φαρμακον, might either be the means of <i>removing</i> an evil, or <i>inflicting</i> one, etymologists have derived it from φερον ακος, <i>bringing ease</i>, or φερον αχος, <i>bringing pain</i>. So spells and incantations were used sometimes for the <i>restoration</i> of the health; at others, for the <i>destruction</i> of an enemy. Sometimes, these φαρμακα were used to procure <i>love</i>; at other times, to produce <i>hatred</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hatred</b></i> — εχθραι. <i>Aversions</i> and <i>antipathies</i>, when opposed to <i>brotherly love</i> and <i>kindness</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Variance</b></i> — ερεις. <i>Contentions</i>, where the principle of <i>hatred</i> proceeds to <i>open acts</i>; hence contests, altercations, lawsuits, and disputes in general.</p>
<p><i><b>Emulations</b></i> — ζηλοι. <i>Envies</i> or <i>emulations</i>; that is strife to excel at the expense of another; lowering others to set up one's self; unholy zeal, fervently adopting a bad cause, or supporting a good one by cruel means. <i>Inquisitions</i>, pretending to support true religion by torturing and burning alive those who both profess and practise it.</p>
<p><i><b>Wrath</b></i> — θυμοι. Turbulent passions, disturbing the harmony of the mind, and producing <i>domestic</i> and <i>civil</i> broils and disquietudes.</p>
<p><i><b>Strife</b></i> — επιθειαι. Disputations, janglings, logomachics, or <i>strife</i> about <i>words</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Seditions</b></i> — διχοστασιαι. Divisions into separate factions; parties, whether in the <i>Church</i> or <i>state</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Heresies</b></i> — αιρεσεις. <i>Factions</i>; parties in the <i>Church</i> separating from communion with each other, and setting up <i>altar</i> against <i>altar</i>. The word, which is harmless in itself, is here used in a bad sense. In stead of αιρεσεις the <i>Slavonic</i> has σκανδαλα, <i>scandals</i>, offences or stumbling-blocks.</p>
