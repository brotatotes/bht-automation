<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Envyings</b></i> — φθονοι. "Pain felt, and malignity conceived, at the sight of excellence or happiness." A passion the most base and the least curable of all that disgrace or degrade the fallen soul. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Murders</b></i> — φονοι. Similarity of <i>sound</i> to the preceding seems to have suggested the word in this association; it is wanting in several MSS. <i>Murder</i> signifies the destruction of human life; and as he who <i>hates his brother in his heart</i> is ready to take away his life, so he is called a <i>murderer</i>. After all the casuistry of man, it does not appear that the <i>right</i> of taking away a human life on any pretence, except for the crime of <i>murder</i> belongs to any but the Maker and Judge of all men.</p>
<p><i><b>Drunkenness</b></i> — μεθαι. Taking more wine or any kind of inebriating liquor than is necessary for health; whatever unfits for <i>public, domestic</i>, or <i>spiritual</i> duties; even the <i>cares of the</i> <i>world</i>, when they intoxicate the mind. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Revellings</b></i> — κωμοι. Lascivious feastings, with obscene songs, music, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And such like</b></i> — και τα ομοια τουτοις. All that proceeds from the evil passions of a fallen spirit, besides those above specified and all that the law of God specifies and condemns.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the which I tell you before</b></i> — When I <i>first</i> preached the Gospel to you.</p>
<p><i><b>As I have also told</b></i> you <i>in time past</i>] When I paid my <i>second</i> visit to you; for the apostle did visit them <i>twice</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span>; and see <i>preface</i>, p. 385.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall not inherit</b></i> — They are not <i>children</i> of God, and therefore cannot <i>inherit</i> the kingdom which belongs only to the <i>children</i> of the Divine <i>family</i>.</p>
