<p>Verse 22. <i><b>But the fruit of the Spirit</b></i> — Both <i>flesh</i>-the sinful dispositions of the human heart and <i>spirit</i>-the changed or purified state of the soul, by the grace and Spirit of God, are represented by the apostle as <i>trees</i>, one yielding <i>good</i> the other <i>bad fruit</i>; the productions of each being according to the nature of the <i>tree</i>, as the <i>tree</i> is according to the nature of the <i>seed</i> from which it sprung. The <i>bad seed</i> produced a <i>bad tree</i>, yielding all manner of <i>bad fruit</i>; the <i>good seed</i> produced a <i>good tree</i>, bringing forth <i>fruits</i> of the most <i>excellent kind</i>. The <i>tree</i> of the <i>flesh</i>, with all its bad fruits, we have already seen; the <i>tree</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>, with its good fruits, we shall now see.</p>
<p><i><b>Love</b></i> — αγαπη. An intense desire to please God, and to do good to mankind; the very soul and spirit of all true religion; the fulfilling of the law, and what gives energy to faith itself. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Joy</b></i> — χαρα. The exultation that arises from a sense of God's mercy communicated to the soul in the pardon of its iniquities, and the prospect of that eternal glory of which it has the foretaste in the pardon of sin. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Peace</b></i> — ειρηνη. The calm, quiet, and order, which take place in the justified soul, instead of the doubts, fears, alarms, and dreadful forebodings, which every true penitent less or more feels, and must feel till the assurance of pardon brings peace and satisfaction to the mind. Peace is the first sensible fruit of the pardon of sin. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>, and the notes there.</p>
<p><i><b>Long-suffering</b></i> — μακροθυμια. Long-mindedness, bearing with the frailties and provocations of others, from the consideration that God has borne long with ours; and that, if he had not, we should have been speedily consumed: bearing up also through all the troubles and difficulties of life without murmuring or repining; submitting cheerfully to every dispensation of God's providence, and thus deriving benefit from every occurrence.</p>
<p><i><b>Gentleness</b></i> — χρηστοτης Benignity, affability; a very rare grace, often wanting in many who have a considerable share of Christian excellence. A good education and polished manners, when brought under the influence of the grace of God, will bring out this grace with great effect.</p>
<p><i><b>Goodness</b></i> — αγαθωσυνη. The perpetual desire and sincere study, not only to abstain from every appearance of evil, but to do good to the bodies and souls of men to the utmost of our ability. But all this must spring from a <i>good heart</i>-a heart purified by the Spirit of God; and then, the <i>tree</i> being made <i>good</i>, the <i>fruit</i> must be good also.</p>
<p><i><b>Faith</b></i> — πιστις, here used for <i>fidelity</i>-punctuality in performing promises, conscientious carefulness in preserving what is committed to our trust, in restoring it to its proper owner, in transacting the business confided to us, neither betraying the secret of our friend, nor disappointing the confidence of our employer.</p>
