<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Meekness</b></i> — πραοτης. Mildness, indulgence toward the weak and erring, patient suffering of injuries without feeling a spirit of revenge, an even balance of all tempers and passions, the entire opposite to <i>anger</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Temperance</b></i> — εγκρατεια. <i>Continence, self-government</i>, or <i>moderation</i>, principally with regard to <i>sensual</i> or <i>animal</i> <i>appetites. Moderation</i> in <i>eating, drinking, sleeping</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Several very respectable MSS., as D*EFG, with the <i>Vulgate</i>, most copies of the <i>Itala</i> and several of the fathers, add αγνεια, <i>chastity</i>. This we are sure cannot be separated from the genuine Christian character, though it may be included in the word εγκρατεια, <i>continence</i> or <i>moderation</i>, immediately preceding.</p>
<p><i><b>Against such there is no law.</b></i> — Those, whose lives are adorned by the above virtues, cannot be <i>condemned</i> by any law, for the whole purpose and design of the moral law of God is fulfilled in those who have the Spirit of God, producing in their hearts and lives the preceding fruits.</p>
