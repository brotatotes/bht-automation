<p>Verse 24. <i><b>And they that are Christ's</b></i> — All genuine Christians <i>have crucified the flesh</i>-are so far from obeying its dictates and acting under its influence, that they have crucified their sensual appetites; they have nailed them to the cross of Christ, where they have expired with him; hence, says St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>, <i>our old man</i>-the flesh, with its affections and lusts, <i>is crucified</i> <i>with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth</i> <i>we should not serve sin</i>. By which we see that God has fully designed to save all who believe in Christ from <i>all sin</i>, whether outward or inward, with all the <i>affections</i>, παθημασι, irregular <i>passions</i>, and <i>lusts</i>, επιθυμιαις, disorderly <i>wishes</i> and <i>desires</i>. All that a man may <i>feel</i> contrary to love and purity; and all that he may <i>desire</i> contrary to <i>moderation</i> and that <i>self-denial</i> peculiar to the Christian character.</p>
