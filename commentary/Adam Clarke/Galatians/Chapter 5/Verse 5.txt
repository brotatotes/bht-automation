<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:5">Galatians 5:5</span>. <i><b>For we</b></i><b>, Christians, </b><i><b>through the Spirit</b></i> — Through the operation of the Holy Ghost, under this spiritual dispensation of the Gospel, <i>wait for the hope of righteousness</i>-expect that which is the object of our hope, on our being <i>justified</i> by faith in Christ. <i>Righteousness</i>, δικαιοσυνη, may here, as in many other places of St. Paul's epistles, mean <i>justification</i>, and the hope of justification, or the hope excited and inspired by it, is the <i>possession of eternal glory</i>; for, says the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1-2">Romans 5:1-2</span>, <i>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God-and rejoice in</i> HOPE <i>of the</i> GLORY <i>of</i> GOD. But, as this glory is necessarily future, it is to be <i>waited for</i>; but this waiting, in a thorough Christian, is not only a blessed expectation, but also a continual <i>anticipation</i> of it; and therefore the apostle says, απεκδεχομεθα, we <i>receive out if it</i>, from απο, <i>from</i> εκ, <i>out of</i>, and δεχομαι, <i>I receive</i>. This is no fanciful derivation; it exists in the experience of every genuine Christian; he is continually <i>anticipating</i> or <i>receiving foretastes</i> of that glory, the fulness of which he expects after death. Thus they are <i>receiving the end of</i> <i>their faith, the salvation of their souls</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9">1 Peter 1:9</span>.</p>
<p>That they could not have the Holy Spirit without <i>faith</i>, was a doctrine also of the Jews; hence it is said, <i>Mechilta</i>, fol. 52: "<i>That</i> faith was of great consequence with which the Israelites believed in Him who, with one word, created the universe; and because the Israelites believed in God, the Holy Spirit dwelt in them; so that, being filled with God, they sang praises to him." Cicero, De <i>Nat. Deor</i>., lib. ii., has said: <i>Nemo vir magnus sine</i> <i>aliquo afflatu divino unquam fuit</i>: "There never was a great man who had not some measure of the Divine influence." However true this may be with respect to the <i>great men</i> of the Roman orator, we may safely assert there never was a true <i>Christian</i> who had not the inspiration of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
