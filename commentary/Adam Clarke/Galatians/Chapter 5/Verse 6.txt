<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>. <i><b>For in Jesus Christ</b></i> — By the dispensation of the Gospel all legal observances, as essential to salvation, are done away; and uncircumcision, or the <i>Gentile state</i>, contributes as much to salvation as <i>circumcision</i> or the <i>Jewish state</i>; they are both equally ineffectual; and nothing now avails in the sight of God but that faith δι' αγαπης ενεργουμενη, <i>which is made active</i>, or <i>energetic, by love</i>. God acknowledges no faith, as of the operation of his Spirit, that is not <i>active</i> or <i>obedient</i>; but the principle of all obedience to God, and beneficence to man, is <i>love</i>; therefore faith cannot work unless it be associated with love. Love to God produces obedience to his will: love to man <i>worketh no ill</i>; but, on the contrary, every act of kindness. Faith which does not work by love is either <i>circumcision</i> or <i>uncircumcision</i>, or whatever its possessor may please to call it; it is, however, nothing that will stand him in stead when God comes to take away his soul. <i>It availeth nothing</i>. This humble, holy, operative, obedient LOVE, is the grand touchstone of all <i>human creeds</i> and <i>confessions of faith. Faith</i> without this has neither soul nor operation; in the language of the Apostle James, it is <i>dead</i>, and can perform no function of the spiritual life, no more than a dead man can perform the duties of animal or civil life.</p>
