<p>Verse 8. <i><b>This persuasion</b></i> — Of the necessity of your being circumcised and obeying the law of Moses, is <i>not of him that</i> <i>calleth you</i>. I never preached such a doctrine to you; I called you out of <i>bondage to liberty</i>, from a <i>galling yoke</i> to a <i>cheerful</i> <i>service</i>. Some translate πεισμονη, <i>obedience</i> or <i>subjection</i>. This <i>subjection</i> of yours to the Mosaic law is opposed to the will of God, and never was preached by me.</p>
