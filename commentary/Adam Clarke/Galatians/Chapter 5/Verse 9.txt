<p>Verse 9. <i><b>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</b></i> â€” A proverbial expression, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6">1 Corinthians 5:6</span>, very aptly applied to those who receive the smallest tincture of false doctrine, relative to the things essential to salvation, which soon influences the whole conduct, so that the man becomes totally perverted. They might have argued, "It is a <i>small thing</i>, and should not be made a subject of serious controversy, whether we be circumcised or not." Granted, that in <i>itself</i> it is a small matter; but, as every man who is circumcised is a debtor to do the whole law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:3">Galatians 5:3</span>, then your circumcision leads necessarily to your total perversion; as the <i>little</i> portion of <i>leaven</i>, mixed with the batch, soon <i>leavens</i> <i>the whole lump</i>.</p>
