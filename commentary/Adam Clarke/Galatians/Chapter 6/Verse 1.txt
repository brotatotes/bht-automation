<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>. <i><b>Brethren, if a man be overtaken</b></i> — εαν προληφθη. If he be <i>surprised, seized on</i> without warning, <i>suddenly invaded,</i> <i>taken before he is aware</i>: all these meanings the word has in connections similar to this. <i>Strabo</i>, lib. xvi., page 1120, applies it to the <i>rhinoceros</i>, in its contests with the elephant: he suddenly rips up the belly of the elephant, αν μη προληφθη τῃ προβοσκιδι, <i>that he may not be surprised with his trunk</i>. For, should the elephant seize him with his trunk first, all resistance would be afterwards in vain; therefore he endeavours to rip up the elephant's belly with the horn which is on his nose, in order to prevent this. It is used also by <i>Arrian</i>, in <i>Peripl. Mar. Eryth</i>., page 164, and page 168, to signify a vessel being <i>suddenly</i> <i>agitated</i> and whirled by the waves, and then <i>dashed on the rocks</i>. See <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye which are spiritual</b></i> — Ye who still retain the grace of the Gospel, and have wisdom and experience in Divine things;</p>
<p><i><b>Restore such a one</b></i> — καταρτιζετε τον τοιουτον. Bring the man <i>back into his place</i>. It is a metaphor taken from a <i>dislocated</i> <i>limb</i>, brought back by the hand of a skilful and tender surgeon into its place.</p>
<p><i><b>In the spirit of meekness</b></i> — Use no <i>severity</i> nor <i>haughty carriage</i> towards him; as the man was <i>suddenly</i> overtaken, he is already deeply humbled and distressed, and needs much encouragement and lenient usage. There is a great difference between a man who being <i>suddenly assailed</i> falls into sin, and the man who transgressed in consequence of having WALKED <i>in the counsel of the</i> UNGODLY, <i>or</i> STOOD <i>in the way of</i> SINNERS.</p>
<p><i><b>Considering thyself</b></i> — σκοπων σεαυτον. Looking to thyself; as <i>he</i> fell through a moment of <i>unwatchfulness, look about</i>, that <i>thou</i> be not surprised; AS <i>he</i> fell, so mayest <i>thou</i>: thou art now warned at his expense; therefore <i>keep a good look out</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest thou also be tempted.</b></i> — And having had this warning, thou wilt have less to plead in extenuation of thy offence. It is no wonder if a <i>harsh</i> and <i>cruel censurer</i> of a <i>weak, backsliding</i> brother, should be taught moderation and mercy by an awful proof of his own frailty. Such a one may justly dread the most violent attacks from the arch enemy; he will disgrace him if he can, and if he can <i>overtake him</i> he will have no small triumph. Consider the possibility of such a case, and show the <i>mercy</i> and <i>feeling</i> which thou wouldst then wish to receive from another. From the consideration of what we <i>are</i>, what we <i>have been</i>, or what we <i>may</i> <i>be</i>, we should learn to be compassionate. The poet <i>Mantuanus</i> has set this in a fine light in his Eclogue, <i>De honesto Amore</i>:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>Aut sumus, aut fuimus, aut possemus omne quod hic est</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "This is a common evil; at one time or other we have all</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> done wrong. Either we <i>are</i>, or <i>have been</i>, or <i>may be</i>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> as bad as he whom we condemn." </p>
