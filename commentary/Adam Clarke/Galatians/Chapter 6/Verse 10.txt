<p>Verse 10. <i><b>As we have - opportunity</b></i> â€” While it is the <i>time</i> of <i>sowing</i> let us sow the good seed; and let our love be, as the love of Christ is, <i>free, manifested to all</i>. Let us help all who need help according to the uttermost of our power; but let the first objects of our regards be those who are of the household of faith-the members of the Church of Christ, who form one <i>family</i>, of which Jesus Christ is the <i>head</i>. Those have the first claims on our attention , but <i>all others</i> have their claims also, and therefore we should do good unto <i>all</i>.</p>
