Verse 10. As we have - opportunity â€” While it is the time of sowing let us sow the good seed; and let our love be, as the love of Christ is, free, manifested to all. Let us help all who need help according to the uttermost of our power; but let the first objects of our regards be those who are of the household of faith-the members of the Church of Christ, who form one family, of which Jesus Christ is the head. Those have the first claims on our attention , but all others have their claims also, and therefore we should do good unto all.
