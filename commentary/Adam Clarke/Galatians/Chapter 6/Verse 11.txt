<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Ye see how large a letter</b></i> â€” There is a strange diversity of opinions concerning the apostle's meaning in this place. Some think he refers to the <i>length</i> of the epistle, others to the <i>largeness</i> of the <i>letters</i> in which this epistle is written, others to the <i>inadequacy</i> of the apostle's <i>writing</i>. It appears plain that most of his epistles were written by an <i>amanuensis</i>, and simply <i>subscribed</i> by himself; but the <i>whole</i> of the Epistle to the Galatians was written by his <i>own hand</i>. To say that the apostle was <i>unskilled in Greek</i>, and especially in the <i>Greek characters</i>, is in my opinion absurd. He was born in <i>Tarsus</i>, a city which, according to <i>Strabo</i>, rivalled both <i>Athens</i> and <i>Alexandria</i> in philosophy, and in arts and sciences; and therefore he could not be ignorant of a <i>tongue</i> which must have been the very <i>means</i> of conveying all this instruction. As to <i>writing</i> it, there was in his time nothing difficult, because the <i>uncial</i> character was that which was alone in use in those days, and this character is as easily made as the <i>capitals</i> in the <i>Roman</i> alphabet, which have been taken from it. I conclude, therefore, that what the apostle says must be understood of the <i>length of the epistle</i>, in all probability the largest he had ever written with <i>his own hand</i>; though several, much larger, have been dictated by him, but they were written by his <i>scribe</i> or <i>amanuensis</i>.</p>
