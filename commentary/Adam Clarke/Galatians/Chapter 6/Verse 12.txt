<p>Verse 12. <i><b>A fair show in the flesh.</b></i> â€” The Jewish religion was general in the region of Galatia, and it was respectable, as it appears that the principal inhabitants were either <i>Jews</i> or <i>proselytes</i>. As it was then professed and practised among the Jews, this religion had nothing very grievous to the old man; an unrenewed nature might go through all its observances with little pain or cross-bearing. On the other hand, Christianity could not be very popular; it was too strict. A Jew made a <i>fair show</i> there, according to his <i>carnal system</i>, and it was a temptation to a weak Christian to swerve into <i>Judaism</i>, that he might be <i>exempted from</i> <i>persecution</i>, and be creditable among his countrymen. This is what the apostle intimates: "They constrain you to be circumcised, lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."</p>
