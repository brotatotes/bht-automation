<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Neither they themselves who are circumcised</b></i> â€” They receive circumcision and profess Judaism, not from a desire to be conformed to the <i>will of God</i>; but <i>Judaism</i> was popular, and the more converts the false teachers could make; the more occasion of glorying they had, and they wished to get those Christian converts, who had been before <i>proselytes of the gate</i>, to receive circumcision, that they might glory in their <i>flesh</i>. Behold my converts! Thus they gloried, or <i>boasted</i>, not that the people were <i>converted to God</i>, but that they were <i>circumcised</i>.</p>
