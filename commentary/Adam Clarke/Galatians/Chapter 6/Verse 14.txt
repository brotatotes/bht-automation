<p>Verse 14. <i><b>But God forbid that I should glory</b></i> — Whatever others may do, or whatever they may exult or glory in, God forbid that I should <i>exult</i>, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; in the grand <i>doctrine</i>, that justification and salvation are only through Christ crucified, he having made an atonement for the sin of the world by his passion and death. And I glory, also, in the <i>disgrace</i> and <i>persecution</i> which I experience through my attachment to this crucified Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>By whom the world is crucified unto me</b></i> — Jewish rites and Gentile vanities are equally insipid to me; I know them to be empty and worthless. If Jews and Gentiles despise me, I despise that in which they trust; through Jesus, all are <i>crucified to</i> <i>me</i>-their objects of dependence are as vile and execrable to me, as I am to them, in whose sight these things are of great account.</p>
