<p>Verse 15. <i><b>In Christ Jesus</b></i> — Under the dispensation of the Gospel, of which he is head and supreme, <i>neither circumcision</i>- nothing that the <i>Jew</i> can boast of, nothing that the <i>Gentile</i> can call excellent, <i>availeth any thing</i>-can in the least contribute to the salvation of the soul.</p>
<p><i><b>But a new creature.</b></i> — αλλα καινη κτισις. <i>But a new creation</i>; not a <i>new creature</i> merely, (for this might be restrained to any <i>new power</i> or <i>faculty</i>,) but a total renewal of the whole man, of all the powers and passions of the soul; and as <i>creation</i> could not be effected but by the power of the Almighty, so this change cannot be effected but by the same energy; no circumcision can do this; only the power that made the man at first can <i>new make him</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:19">1 Corinthians 7:19</span>, and on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span><i>"</i>.</p>
