Verse 15. In Christ Jesus — Under the dispensation of the Gospel, of which he is head and supreme, neither circumcision- nothing that the Jew can boast of, nothing that the Gentile can call excellent, availeth any thing-can in the least contribute to the salvation of the soul.But a new creature. — αλλα καινη κτισις. But a new creation; not a new creature merely, (for this might be restrained to any new power or faculty,) but a total renewal of the whole man, of all the powers and passions of the soul; and as creation could not be effected but by the power of the Almighty, so this change cannot be effected but by the same energy; no circumcision can do this; only the power that made the man at first can new make him. 1 Corinthians 7:19, and on "2 Corinthians 5:17".
