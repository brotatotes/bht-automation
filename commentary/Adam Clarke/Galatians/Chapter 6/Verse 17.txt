<p>Verse 17. <i><b>From henceforth let no man trouble me</b></i> — Put an end to your contentions among yourselves; return to the pure doctrine of the Gospel; abandon those who are leading you astray; separate from the Church those who corrupt and disturb it; and let me be grieved no longer with your defections from the truth.</p>
<p><i><b>I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</b></i> — The στιγματα, <i>stigmata</i>, of which the apostle speaks here, may be understood as implying the <i>scars</i> of the <i>wounds</i> which he had <i>received in the work</i> <i>of the ministry</i>; and that he had such scars, we may well conceive, when we know that he had been <i>scourged, stoned</i>, and maltreated in a variety of ways. The writer could show such <i>scars</i> himself, received in the same way. Or, the apostle may allude to the <i>stigmata</i> or <i>marks</i> with which servants and slaves were often impressed, in order to ascertain whose property they were. A <i>Burman</i> servant often has <i>indelible marks</i> on his <i>thighs</i> and <i>elsewhere</i>, which ascertain to whose service he belongs. "Do not trouble me; I bear the marks of my Lord and Master, <i>Jesus</i>; I am his, and will remain so. You glory in your <i>mark of circumcision</i>; I glory in the marks which I bear in my body for the testimony of the Lord; I am an open, professed Christian, and have given full proof of my attachment to the cause of Christianity."</p>
<p>The first sense appears to be the best: "I have suffered already sufficiently; I am suffering still; do not add any more to my afflictions."</p>
