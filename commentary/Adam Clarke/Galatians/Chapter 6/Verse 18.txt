<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:18">Galatians 6:18</span>. <i><b>The grace</b></i> — Favour, benevolence, and continual influence of the Lord Jesus, <i>be with your spirit</i> - may it live in your heart, enlighten and change your souls, and be conspicuous in your life!</p>

<p><i><b>Unto the Galatians, written from Rome.</b></i> — This, or the major part of it, is wanting in the best and most ancient MSS. <i>Written from</i> <i>Rome</i> is wanting in ACDEFG, and others. <i>Claudius Antissiodor</i>, has εγραφη απ' Εφεσου· <i>Written from Ephesus</i>. Some add, <i>by the</i> <i>hands of Paul</i>, others, <i>by Titus</i>. The SYRIAC has, <i>The end of the</i> <i>Epistle to the Galatians, which was written from the city of Rome</i>. The AETHIOPIC, <i>To the Galatians</i>. The COPTIC, <i>Written from Rome</i>. The VULGATE, <i>nothing</i>. The ARABIC, <i>Written from the city of Rome</i> <i>by Titus and Luke</i>.</p>
<p>Little respect is to be paid to these subscriptions. The epistle was written by <i>Paul himself</i>, not <i>Titus, Luke</i> nor <i>Tychicus</i>; and there is no evidence that it was written from <i>Rome</i>, but rather from <i>Corinth</i> or <i>Ephesus</i>. See the <i>preface</i>, page 385.</p>
<p>THE great similarity between the Epistle to the Romans and that to the Galatians has been remarked by many; and indeed it is so obvious, that the same mode of interpretation may be safely pursued in the elucidation of both; as not only the great subject, but the phraseology, in many respects, is the same. The design of the apostle is to show that God has called the Gentiles to equal privileges with the Jews, pulling down the partition wall that had separated them and the Gentiles, calling all to believe in Christ Jesus, and forming out of the believers of both people one holy and pure Church, of which, equally, himself was the head; none of either people having any preference to another, except what he might derive from his personal sanctity and superior usefulness. The calling of the Gentiles to this state of salvation was the mystery which had been hidden from all ages, and concerning which the apostle has entered into such a laborious discussion in the Epistle to the Romans; justifying the reprobation as well as the election of the Jews, and vindicating both the justice and mercy of God in the election of the Gentiles. The same subjects are referred to in this epistle, but not in that <i>detail</i> of argumentation as in the former. In both, the <i>national</i> privileges of the Jews are a frequent subject of consideration; and, as these <i>national privileges</i> were intended to point out <i>spiritual</i> <i>advantages</i>, the terms which express them are used frequently in both these senses with no change; and it requires an attentive mind, and a proper knowledge of the analogy of faith, to discern when and where they are to be restricted exclusively to one or the other meaning, as well as where the one is intended to shadow forth the other; and where it is used as expressing <i>what they</i> <i>ought to be</i>, according to the spirit and tenor of their original calling.</p>
<p>Multitudes of interpreters of different sects and parties have strangely mistaken both epistles, by not attending to these most necessary, and to the unprejudiced, most obvious, distinctions and principles. Expressions which point out national privileges have been used by them to point out those which were spiritual; and merely <i>temporal</i> advantages or disadvantages have been used in the sense of <i>eternal</i> blessings or miseries. Hence, what has been spoken of the Jews in their <i>national</i> capacity has been applied to the Church of God in respect to its future destiny; and thus, out of the temporal election and reprobation of the Jews, the doctrine of the irrespective and eternal election of a small part of mankind, and the unconditional and eternal reprobation of the far greater part of the human race, has been formed. The contentions produced by these misapprehensions among Christians have been uncharitable and destructive. In snatching at the shadow of religion in a great variety of metaphors and figures, the substance of Christianity has been lost: and the man who endeavours to draw the contending parties to a consistent and rational interpretation of those expressions, by showing the grand nature and design of these epistles, becomes a prey to the zealots of both parties! Where is <i>truth</i> in the mean time? It is fallen in the streets, and <i>equity</i> is gone backwards; for the most sinister designs and most heterodox opinions have been attributed to those who, regarding the words of God only, have refused to swim with either torrent; and, without even consulting their own peculiar creed, have sought to find out the meaning of the inspired writers, and with simplicity of heart, and purity of conscience, to lay that meaning before mankind.</p>
<p>The <i>Israelites</i> were denominated <i>a peculiar treasure unto God,</i> <i>above all people; a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:5-6">Exodus 19:5-6</span>. <i>A holy people whom he had chosen to be a special people unto</i> <i>himself, above all the people who were upon the face of the earth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+7:6">Deuteronomy 7:6</span>. This was their <i>calling</i>, this was their <i>profession</i>, and this was their <i>denomination</i>; but how far they fell practically short of this character their history most painfully proves. Yet still they were called a holy people, because called to holiness, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+11:44">Leviticus 11:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+19:2">Leviticus 19:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+20:7">Leviticus 20:7</span>,) and separated from the impure and degrading idolatries of the neighbouring nations.</p>
<p>Under the <i>New Testament</i>, all those who believe in Christ Jesus <i>are called to holiness</i> - to <i>have their fruit unto holiness, that</i> <i>their end may be eternal life</i>; and hence they are called <i>saints</i> or <i>holy persons</i>. And the same epithets are applied to <i>them</i> as to the <i>Israelites</i> of old; they are <i>lively stones, built up a spiritual</i> <i>house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices</i> <i>acceptable to God through Christ</i>; they are also called a <i>chosen</i> <i>generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,</i> <i>that should show forth the praises of him who had called them from</i> <i>darkness into his marvellous light</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>. All this they were <i>called to</i>, all this was their <i>profession</i>, and to have all these excellences was their indisputable <i>privilege</i>.</p>
<p>As they professed <i>to be</i> what God had called them to be, they are often <i>denominated</i> by their <i>profession</i>; and this denomination is given frequently to those who, in <i>experience</i> and <i>practice</i>, fall far short of the blessings and privileges of the Gospel. The Church of <i>Corinth</i>, which was in many respects the most imperfect, as well as the most impure, of all the apostolic Churches, is nevertheless denominated <i>the Church of God, sanctified in Christ</i> <i>Jesus, and called to be saints</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>. That there were many <i>saints</i> in the Corinthian Church, and many <i>sanctified in Christ</i> <i>Jesus</i> both in <i>it</i> and in the Churches of <i>Galatia</i>, the slightest perusal of the epistles to those Churches will prove: but that there were many, and in the Galatian Churches the majority, of a <i>different character</i>, none can doubt; yet they are all indiscriminately called the <i>Churches of God, saints</i>, c. And, even in those early times, <i>saint</i> appears to have been as general an appellative for a person professing faith in Christ Jesus, as the term <i>Christian</i> is at the present day, which is given to all who profess the Christian religion and yet these terms, taken in their <i>strict</i> and <i>proper</i> sense, signify, a <i>holy person</i>, and one who has <i>the Spirit and mind of Christ</i>.</p>
<p>In my notes on the <i>Epistle to the Romans</i> I have entered at large into a discussion of the subjects to which I have referred in these observations; and, to set the subject in a clear point of view, I have made a copious extract from <i>Dr. Taylor's Key to that</i> <i>epistle</i>; and I have stated, that a consistent exposition of that epistle cannot be given but upon that plan. <i>I am still of the</i> <i>same opinion</i>. It is by attending to the above distinctions, which are most obvious to all unprejudiced persons, that we plainly see that the doctrines of <i>eternal, unconditional reprobation and</i> <i>election, and the impossibility of falling finally from the grace</i> <i>of God</i>, have no foundation in the Epistle to the Romans. Dr. Taylor has shown that the phrases and expressions on which these doctrines are founded refer to national privileges, and those exclusive advantages which the Jews, as God's peculiar people, enjoyed during the time in which that <i>peculiarity</i> was designed to last; and that it is doing violence to the sense in which those expressions are generally used, to apply them to the support of such doctrines. In reference to <i>this</i>, I have quoted Dr. Taylor; and those illustrations of his which I have adopted, I have adopted <i>on this ground</i>, taking care never to pledge myself to any peculiar or heterodox opinions, by whomsoever held; and, where I thought an expression might be misunderstood, I took care to guard it by a <i>note</i> or <i>observation</i>.</p>
<p>Now I say that it is <i>in this sense</i> I understand the quotations I have made, and in <i>this sense alone</i> these quotations <i>ought</i> to be understood; and my whole work sufficiently shows that neither Dr. Taylor's nor any person's <i>peculiar</i> theological system makes any part of mine; that, on the doctrine of the <i>fall of man</i> or <i>original</i> <i>sin</i>, the doctrine of the <i>eternal deity of Jesus Christ</i>, the doctrine of <i>justification by faith in the atoning blood</i>, and the doctrine of the <i>inspiration and regenerating influence of the Holy</i> <i>Ghost</i>, I stand on the pure orthodox creed, diametrically opposite to that of the Arians and Socinians. Yet this most distinguishing difference cannot blind me against the excellences I find in any of their works, nor can I meanly borrow from Dr. Taylor, or any other author, without acknowledging my obligation; nor could I suppress a <i>name</i>, however obnoxious that might be, as associated with any heterodox system, when I could mention it with <i>deference</i> and <i>respect</i>. Let this be my apology for quoting Dr. Taylor, and for the frequent use I have made of his industry and learning in my exposition of the Epistle to the Romans. If I have quoted, to illustrate the sacred writings, passages almost innumerable from <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman heathens</i>; from <i>Jewish Talmudists</i> and <i>rabbinical</i> expositors; from the <i>Koran</i>; from <i>Mohammedan</i> writers, both <i>Arabic</i> and <i>Persian</i>; and from <i>Brahminical polytheists</i>; and these illustrations have been well received by the Christian public; surely I may have liberty to use, in the same way, the works of a very learned man, and a most conscientious believer in the books of Divine revelation, however erroneous he may appear to be in certain doctrines which I myself deem of vital importance to the creed of an experimental Christian. Let it not be said that, by thus largely quoting from his work, I tacitly recommend an Arian creed, or any part of that system of theology peculiar to him and his party; I no more do so than the Indian matron who, while she gives the <i>nourishing</i> farina of the <i>cassava</i> to her household, recommends them to drink the <i>poisonous</i> juice which she has previously expressed from it.</p>
<p>After this declaration, it will be as <i>disingenuous</i> as <i>unchristian</i> for either <i>friends</i> or <i>foes</i> to attribute to me opinions which I never held, or an indifference to those doctrines which (<i>I speak as a fool</i>) stand in no work of the kind, in any language, so fully explained, fortified, and demonstrated, as they do in that before the reader. On such a mode of judgment and condemnation as that to which some resort in matters of this kind, I might have long ago been reputed a <i>Pagan</i> or a <i>Mohammedan</i>, because I have quoted <i>heathen</i> writers and the <i>Koran</i>. And, by the same mode of argumentation, St. Paul might be convicted of having abandoned his <i>Jewish creed</i> and <i>Christian faith</i>, because he had quoted the heathen poets <i>Aratus</i> and <i>Cleanthes</i>. The man is entitled to my pity who refuses to take advantage of useful discoveries in the philosophical researches of Dr. Priestley, because Dr. Priestley, as a theologian, was not sound in the faith.</p>
<p>I have made that use of Dr. Taylor which I have done of others; and have reason to thank God that his <i>Key</i>, passing through several wards of a <i>lock</i> which appeared to me inextricable, has enabled me to bring forth and exhibit, in a fair and luminous point of view, objects and meanings in the Epistle to the Romans which, without this assistance, I had perhaps been unable to discover.</p>
<p>I may add, farther, that I have made that use of Dr. Taylor which himself has recommended to his readers: some of his censors will perhaps scarcely believe that the <i>four</i> following articles constitute the charge with which this learned man commences his theological lectures: - </p>
<p>When I was a <i>child</i> I had for a lesson the following words: <i>Despise not advice, even from the meanest; the cackling of geese</i> <i>once preserved the Roman state</i>. And since I became a <i>man</i>, I have learned wisdom from that saying: <i>Blessed are ye who sow beside</i> ALL WATERS; <i>that send forth</i> thither <i>the feet of the</i> OX <i>and the</i> ASS. May He, who is the way, the truth, and the life, lead the reader into all truth, and bring him to life everlasting! Amen.</p>
