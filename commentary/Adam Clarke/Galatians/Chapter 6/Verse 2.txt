<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>. <i><b>Bear ye one another's burdens</b></i> — Have <i>sympathy</i>; feel for each other; and consider the case of a distressed brother as your own.</p>
<p><i><b>And so fulfil the law of Christ.</b></i> — That law or commandment, <i>Ye</i> <i>shall love one another</i>; or that, <i>Do unto all men as ye would they</i> <i>should do unto you</i>. We should be as indulgent to the infirmities of others, as we can be consistently with truth and righteousness: our brother's <i>infirmity</i> may be his <i>burden</i>; and if we do not choose to help him to bear it, let us not reproach him because he is obliged to carry the load.</p>
