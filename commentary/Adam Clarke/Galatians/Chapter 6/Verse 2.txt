Verse Galatians 6:2. Bear ye one another's burdens — Have sympathy; feel for each other; and consider the case of a distressed brother as your own.And so fulfil the law of Christ. — That law or commandment, Ye shall love one another; or that, Do unto all men as ye would they should do unto you. We should be as indulgent to the infirmities of others, as we can be consistently with truth and righteousness: our brother's infirmity may be his burden; and if we do not choose to help him to bear it, let us not reproach him because he is obliged to carry the load.
