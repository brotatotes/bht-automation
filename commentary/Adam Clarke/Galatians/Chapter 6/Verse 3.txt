Verse Galatians 6:3. If a man think himself to be something â€” i.e. To be a proper Christian man; when he is nothing; being destitute of that charity which beareth, hopeth, and endureth all things. See 1 Corinthians 13:1, c. Those who suppose themselves to excel all others in piety, understanding, c., while they are harsh, censorious, and overbearing, prove that they have not the charity that thinketh no evil and in the sight of God are only as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. There are no people more censorious or uncharitable than those among some religious people who pretend to more light and a deeper communion with God. They are generally carried away with a sort of sublime, high sounding phraseology, which seems to argue a wonderfully deep acquaintance with Divine things stripped of this, many of them are like Samson without his hair.
