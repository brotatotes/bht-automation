<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:3">Galatians 6:3</span>. <i><b>If a man think himself to be something</b></i> â€” i.e. To be a proper Christian man; <i>when he is nothing</i>; being destitute of that <i>charity</i> which <i>beareth, hopeth</i>, and <i>endureth</i> all things. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>, c. Those who suppose themselves to excel all others in piety, understanding, c., while they are <i>harsh, censorious</i>, and <i>overbearing</i>, prove that they have not the <i>charity</i> that <i>thinketh no evil</i> and in the sight of God are only as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. There are no people more censorious or uncharitable than those among some religious people who pretend to more light and a deeper communion with God. They are generally carried away with a sort of sublime, high sounding phraseology, which seems to argue a wonderfully deep acquaintance with Divine things stripped of this, many of them are like Samson without his hair.</p>
