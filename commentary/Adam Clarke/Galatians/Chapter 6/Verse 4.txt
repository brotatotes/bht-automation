<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:4">Galatians 6:4</span>. <i><b>Prove his own work</b></i> â€” Let him examine himself and his conduct by the words and example of Christ; and if he find that they bear this <i>touchstone</i>, then he shall have <i>rejoicing in himself</i> <i>alone</i>, feeling that he resembles his Lord and Master, <i>and not in</i> <i>another</i>-not derive his consolation from comparing himself with another who may be <i>weaker</i>, or less instructed than himself. The only <i>rule</i> for a Christian is the word of Christ; the only <i>pattern</i> for his imitation is the <i>example</i> of Christ. He should not compare himself with <i>others</i>; they are not his <i>standard</i>. Christ hath left us an example that we should follow <i>his</i> steps.</p>
