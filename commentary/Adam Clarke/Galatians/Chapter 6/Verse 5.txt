<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:5">Galatians 6:5</span>. <i><b>Every man shall bear his own burden.</b></i> â€” All must answer for <i>themselves</i>, not for their <i>neighbours</i>. And every man must expect to be dealt with by the Divine Judge, as his character and conduct have been. The greater offences of another will not excuse thy smaller crimes. Every man must give account of himself to God.</p>
