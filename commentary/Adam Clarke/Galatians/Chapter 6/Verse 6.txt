<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:6">Galatians 6:6</span>. <i><b>Let him that is taught in the word</b></i> — He who receives instructions in Christianity by the public preaching of the word;</p>
<p><i><b>Communicate unto him that teacheth</b></i> — Contribute to the support of the man who has dedicated himself to the work of the ministry, and who gives up his time and his life to preach the Gospel. It appears that some of the believers in Galatia could receive the Christian ministry without contributing to its support. This is both ungrateful and base. We do not expect that a common schoolmaster will give up his time to teach our children their <i>alphabet</i> without being paid for it; and can we suppose that it is <i>just</i> for any person to sit under the preaching of the Gospel in order to grow wise unto salvation by it, and not contribute to the support of the spiritual teacher? It is <i>unjust</i>.</p>
