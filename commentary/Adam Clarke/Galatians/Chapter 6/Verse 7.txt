Verse 7. Be not deceived — Neither deceive yourselves, nor permit yourselves to be deceived by others. He seems to refer to the Judaizing teachers.God is not mocked — Ye cannot deceive him, and he will not permit you to mock him with pretended instead of real services.Whatsoever a man soweth — Whatsoever kind of grain a man sows in his field, of that shall he reap; for no other species of grain can proceed from that which is sown. Darnel will not produce wheat, nor wheat, darnel.
