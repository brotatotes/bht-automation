<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Be not deceived</b></i> — Neither deceive yourselves, nor permit yourselves to be deceived by others. He seems to refer to the Judaizing teachers.</p>
<p><i><b>God is not mocked</b></i> — Ye cannot deceive him, and he will not permit you to mock him with <i>pretended</i> instead of <i>real</i> services.</p>
<p><i><b>Whatsoever a man soweth</b></i> — Whatsoever kind of grain a man sows in his field, of that shall he reap; for no <i>other species</i> of grain can proceed from that which is sown. <i>Darnel</i> will not produce <i>wheat</i>, nor <i>wheat, darnel</i>.</p>
