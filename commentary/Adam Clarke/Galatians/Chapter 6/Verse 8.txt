<p>Verse 8. <i><b>He that soweth to his flesh</b></i> â€” In like manner, he that <i>sows to the flesh</i>-who indulges his sensual and animal appetites, shall have <i>corruption</i> as the <i>crop</i>: you cannot expect to lead a bad life and go to heaven at last. According as your present life is, so will be your eternal life whether your <i>sowing</i> be to the <i>flesh</i> or to the <i>Spirit</i>, so will your eternal <i>reaping</i> be. To <i>sow</i>, here, means transacting the concerns of a man's <i>natural life</i>. To <i>reap</i>, signifies his <i>enjoyment</i> or <i>punishment</i> in <i>another world</i>. Probably by <i>flesh</i> and <i>Spirit</i> the apostle means <i>Judaism</i> and <i>Christianity.</i> Circumcision of the <i>flesh</i> was the principal <i>rite</i> of the former; circumcision in the <i>heart</i>, by the <i>Spirit</i>, the chief rite of the latter; hence the one may have been called <i>flesh</i>, the other, <i>Spirit</i>. He who rejects the Gospel, and trusts only in the rites and ceremonies of the law for salvation, will reap endless disappointment and misery. He who trusts in Christ, and receives the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, shall reap life everlasting.</p>
