<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Let us not be weary</b></i> — <i>Well-doing</i> is easier in itself than <i>ill-doing</i>; and the danger of <i>growing weary</i> in the former arises only from the <i>opposition</i> to good in our <i>own nature</i>, or the <i>outward hinderances</i> we may meet with from a gainsaying and persecuting world.</p>
<p><i><b>In due season we shall reap</b></i> — As the husbandman, in ploughing, sowing, and variously labouring in his fields, is supported by the hope of a plentiful harvest, which he cannot expect before the right and appointed time; so every follower of God may be persuaded that he shall not be permitted to pray, weep, deny himself, and live in a conformity to his Maker's will, without reaping the fruit of it in eternal glory. And although no man obtains glory <i>because</i> he has prayed, c., yet none can expect glory who do not seek it in this way. This is <i>sowing to the</i> <i>Spirit</i> and the <i>Spirit</i> and the <i>grace</i> are furnished by Christ Jesus, and by him the kingdom of heaven is <i>opened</i> to all believers; but only those who <i>believe, love</i>, and <i>obey</i>, shall enter into it.</p>
