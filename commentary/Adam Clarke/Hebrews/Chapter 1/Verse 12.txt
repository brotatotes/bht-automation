Verse Hebrews 1:12. And they shall be changed — Not destroyed ultimately, or annihilated. They shall be changed and renewed.But thou art the same — These words can be said of no being but God; all others are changeable or perishable, because temporal; only that which is eternal can continue essentially, and, speaking after the manner of men, formally the same.Thy years shall not fail. — There is in the Divine duration no circle to be run, no space to be measured, no time to be reckoned.All is eternity - infinite and onward.
