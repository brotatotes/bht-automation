<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:12">Hebrews 1:12</span>. <i><b>And they shall be changed</b></i> — Not <i>destroyed</i> ultimately, or <i>annihilated</i>. They shall be <i>changed</i> and <i>renewed</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But thou art the same</b></i> — These words can be said of no being but God; all others are <i>changeable</i> or <i>perishable</i>, because temporal; only that which is <i>eternal</i> can continue <i>essentially</i>, and, speaking after the manner of men, <i>formally</i> the <i>same</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thy years shall not fail.</b></i> — There is in the Divine duration no circle to be run, no space to be measured, no time to be reckoned.</p>
<p>All is eternity - infinite and onward.</p>
