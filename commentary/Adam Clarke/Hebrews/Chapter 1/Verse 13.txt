<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>. <i><b>But to which of the angels</b></i> â€” We have already seen, from the opinions and concessions of the Jews, that, if Jesus Christ could be proved to be <i>greater than the angels</i>, it would necessarily follow that he was God: and this the apostle does most amply prove by these various quotations from their own Scriptures; for he shows that while he is the supreme and absolute Sovereign, they are no more than his <i>messengers</i> and <i>servants</i>, and <i>servants</i> even to his <i>servants</i>, i.e. to mankind.</p>
