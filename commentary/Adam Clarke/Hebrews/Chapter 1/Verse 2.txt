<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>. <i><b>Last days</b></i> — The Gospel dispensation, called the <i>last</i> <i>days</i> and the <i>last time</i>, because not to be followed by any other dispensation; or the conclusion of the Jewish Church and state now at their termination.</p>
<p><i><b>By</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>Son</b></i> — It is very remarkable that the pronoun αυτου, <i>his</i>, is not found in the text; nor is it found in any MS. or version. We should not therefore supply the pronoun as our translators have done; but simply read ενυιω, BY A SON, or IN A SON, <i>whom he hath appointed heir of all things</i>. God has many <i>sons</i> and daughters, for he is <i>the Father of the spirits of all flesh</i>; and he has many <i>heirs</i>, for <i>if sons, then heirs, heirs of God, and</i> <i>joint heirs with Jesus Christ</i>; but he has no Son who is <i>heir of</i> <i>all things</i>, none <i>by whom he made the worlds</i>, none <i>in</i> whom <i>he</i> <i>speaks</i>, and <i>by</i> whom he has delivered a complete revelation to mankind, but Jesus the Christ.</p>
<p>The apostle begins with the lowest state in which Christ has appeared:</p>
<p>1. His being a SON, born of a woman, and made under the law. He then ascends,</p>
<p>2. So his being an <i>Heir</i>, and an Heir of <i>all</i> <i>things</i>. </p>
<p>3. He then describes him as the <i>Creator</i> of all worlds.</p>
<p>4. As the <i>Brightness of the Divine glory</i>. </p>
<p>5. As the <i>express Image</i> <i>of his person, or character of the Divine substance</i>. </p>
<p>6. As sustaining the immense fabric of the universe; and this by the word of his power. </p>
<p>7. As having made an <i>atonement</i> for the sin of the world, which was the most stupendous of all his works. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "'Twas great to speak a world from nought;.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Twas greater to redeem."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>8. As being on the <i>right hand</i> of God, infinitely exalted above all created beings; and the object of <i>adoration</i> to all the angelic host. </p>
<p>9. As having an <i>eternal throne</i>, neither his <i>person</i> nor his <i>dignity</i> ever <i>changing</i> or decaying. </p>
<p>10. As continuing to <i>exercise</i> <i>dominion</i>, when the earth and the heavens are no more! It is only in God manifested in the flesh that all these excellences can possibly appear, therefore the apostle begins this astonishing <i>climax</i> with the simple <i>Sonship</i> of Christ, or his <i>incarnation</i>; for, on <i>this</i>, all that he is to man, and all that he has done for man, is built.</p>
