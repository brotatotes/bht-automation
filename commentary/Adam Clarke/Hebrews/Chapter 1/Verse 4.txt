<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>. <i><b>So much better than the angels</b></i> — Another argument in favour of the Divinity of our Lord. The Jews had the highest opinion of the transcendent excellence of angels, they even associate them with God in the creation of the world, and suppose them to be of the privy council of the Most High; and thus they understand <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>: <i>Let us make man in our own image, in our own likeness</i>; "And the Lord said to the ministering angels that stood before him, and who were created the second day, Let us make man," c. See the Targum of <i>Jonathan ben Uzziel</i>. And they even allow them to be worshipped for the sake of their Creator, and as his representatives though they will not allow them to be worshipped for their own sake. As, therefore, the Jews considered them next to God, and none entitled to their adoration but God; on their own ground the apostle proves Jesus Christ to be God, because God commanded all the angels of heaven to worship him. He, therefore, who is greater than the angels, and is the object of their adoration, is God. But Jesus Christ is greater than the angels, and the object of their adoration; therefore Jesus Christ must be God.</p>
<p><i><b>By inheritance obtained</b></i> — κεκληρονομηκεν ονομα. The verb κληρονομειν signifies generally to <i>participate, possess, obtain</i>, or <i>acquire</i>; and is so used by the purest Greek writers: Kypke has produced several examples of it from <i>Demosthenes</i>. It is not by <i>inheritance</i> that Christ possesses a more excellent name than angels, but as God: he has it <i>naturally</i> and <i>essentially</i>; and, as <i>God manifested in the flesh</i>, he has it in consequence of his humiliation, sufferings, and meritorious death.
