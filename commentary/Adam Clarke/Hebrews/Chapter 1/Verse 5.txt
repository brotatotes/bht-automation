<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>. <i><b>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee</b></i> — These words are quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>, a psalm that seems to refer only to the Messiah; and they are quoted by St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>, as referring to the <i>resurrection of Christ</i>. And this application of them is confirmed by the same apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>, as by his resurrection from the dead he <i>was declared</i>-manifestly proved, <i>to</i> <i>be the Son of God with power</i>; God having put forth his miraculous energy in raising that body from the grave which had truly died, and died a violent death, for Christ was put to death as a malefactor, but by his <i>resurrection</i> his innocence was demonstrated, as God could not work a miracle to raise a wicked man from the dead. As Adam was <i>created</i> by God, and because no natural generation could have any operation in this case, therefore he was called the <i>son of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:38">Luke 3:38</span>, and could never have seen <i>corruption</i> if he had not sinned, so the human nature of Jesus Christ, formed by the energy of the eternal Spirit in the womb of the virgin, without any human intervention, was for this very reason called the Son of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>; and because it had not <i>sinned</i>, therefore it could not see corruption, nor was it even <i>mortal</i>, but through a miraculous display of God's infinite love, for the purpose of making a sacrificial atonement for the sin of the world and God, having raised this sacrificed human nature from the dead, declared that same Jesus (who was, as above stated, <i>the</i> <i>Son of God</i>) to be his Son, the promised Messiah; and as coming by the Virgin Mary, the right heir to the throne of David, according to the uniform declaration of all the prophets.</p>
<p>The words, <i>This day have I begotten thee</i>, must refer either to his <i>incarnation</i>, when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the virgin by the power of the Holy Spirit; or to his <i>resurrection</i> from the dead, when God, by this sovereign display of his almighty energy, declared him to be his Son, vindicated his innocence, and also the purity and innocence of the blessed virgin, who was the mother of this son, and who declared him to be produced in her womb by the power of God. The <i>resurrection</i> of Christ, therefore, to which the words most properly refer, not only gave the fullest proof that he was an <i>innocent</i> and <i>righteous</i> man, but also that he had accomplished the purpose for which he died, and that his <i>conception</i> was miraculous, and his mother a pure and unspotted virgin.</p>
<p>This is a subject of infinite importance to the Christian system, and of the last consequence in reference to the conviction and conversion of the Jews, for whose use this epistle was sent by God. Here is the rock on which they split; they deny this <i>Divine</i> <i>Sonship</i> of Jesus Christ, and their blasphemies against <i>him</i> and his <i>virgin mother</i> are too shocking to be transcribed. The <i>certainty</i> <i>of the resurrection</i> of Jesus refutes their every calumny; proves his miraculous conception; vindicates the blessed virgin; and, in a word, <i>declares him to be the Son of God with power</i>.</p>
<p>This most important use of this saying has passed unnoticed by almost every Christian writer which I have seen; and yet it lies here at the foundation of all the apostle's proofs. If Jesus was not thus the Son of God, the whole Christian system is vain and baseless: but his <i>resurrection</i> demonstrates him to have been the Son of God; therefore every thing built on this foundation is more durable than the foundations of heaven, and as inexpungable as the throne of the eternal King.</p>
<p><i><b>He shall be to me a Son?</b></i> — As the Jews have ever blasphemed against the <i>Sonship</i> of Christ, it was necessary that the apostle should adduce and make strong all his proofs, and show that this was not a new revelation; that it was that which was chiefly intended in several scriptures of the Old Testament, which, without farther mentioning the places where found, he immediately produces. This place, which is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:14">2 Samuel 7:14</span>, shows us that the <i>seed</i> which God promised to David, and who was to <i>sit upon</i> <i>his throne</i>, and whose <i>throne should be established for ever</i>, was not Solomon, but Jesus Christ; and indeed he quotes the words so as to intimate that they were so understood by the Jews. See among the observations at the end of the chapter.</p>
