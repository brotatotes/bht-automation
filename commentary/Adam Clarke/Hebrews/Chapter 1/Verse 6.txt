<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span>. <i><b>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten</b></i> — This is not a correct translation of the Greek, Ὁταν δε παλιν εισαγαγῃ τον πρωτοτοκον εις την οικουμενην. <i>But when he bringeth</i> <i>again</i>, or <i>the second time, the first-born into the habitable</i> <i>world</i>. This most manifestly refers to his <i>resurrection</i>, which might be properly considered a <i>second incarnation</i>; for as the human soul, as well as the fulness of the Godhead bodily, dwelt in the man, Christ Jesus on and during his incarnation, so when he expired upon the cross, both the <i>Godhead</i> and the <i>human spirit</i> left his dead body; and as on his resurrection these were reunited to his revivified manhood, therefore, with the strictest propriety, does the apostle say that the resurrection was a <i>second bringing</i> <i>of him into the world</i>.</p>
<p>I have translated οικουμενη the <i>habitable world</i>, and this is its proper meaning; and thus it is distinguished from κοσμος, which signifies the <i>terraqueous globe</i>, independently of its inhabitants; though it often expresses both the inhabited and uninhabited parts. Our Lord's <i>first coming</i> into the world is expressed by this latter word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>: <i>Wherefore when he cometh into the world</i>, διο εισερχομενος εις τον κοσμον, and this simply refers to his being <i>incarnated</i>, that he might be capable of <i>suffering</i> and <i>dying</i> for man. But the word is changed on this <i>second coming</i>, I mean his <i>resurrection</i>, and then οικουμενη is used; and why? (fancy apart) because he was now <i>to</i> <i>dwell with man</i>; to send his gospel everywhere to all the inhabitants of the earth, and to <i>accompany</i> that Gospel wherever he sent it, and to <i>be</i> wherever two or three should be gathered together in his name. Wherever the messengers of Jesus Christ go, preaching the kingdom of God, even to the farthest and most desolate parts of the earth where human beings exist, there they ever find Christ; he is not only in <i>them</i>, and with <i>them</i>, but he is in and among all who believe on him through their word.</p>
<p><i><b>Let all the angels of God worship him.</b></i> — The apostle recurs here to his former assertion, that Jesus is higher than the angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>, that he is none of those who can be called ordinary angels or messengers, but one of the most extraordinary kind, and the object of worship to all the angels of God. To worship any <i>creature</i> is idolatry, and God resents idolatry more than any other evil. Jesus Christ can be no creature, else the angels who worship him must be guilty of idolatry, and God the author of that idolatry, who commanded those angels to worship Christ.</p>
<p>There has been some difficulty in ascertaining the place from which the apostle quotes these words; some suppose <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:7">Psalms 97:7</span>: <i>Worship him, all ye gods</i>; which the Septuagint translate thus: Προσκυνησατε αυτῳ, παντες αγγελοι αυτου. <i>Worship him, all ye his</i> <i>angels</i>; but it is not clear that the Messiah is intended in this psalm, nor are the words precisely those used here by the apostle. Our marginal references send us with great propriety to the <i>Septuagint</i> version of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span>, where the passage is found <i>verbatim et literatim</i>; but there is nothing answering to the words in the present Hebrew text. The apostle undoubtedly quoted the <i>Septuagint</i>, which had then been for more than 300 years a version of the highest repute among the Jews; and it is very probable that the copy from which the Seventy translated had the corresponding words. However this may be, they are now sanctioned by Divine authority; and as the verse contains some singular <i>additions</i>, I will set it down in a parallel column with that of our own version, which was taken immediately from the Hebrew text, premising simply this, that it is the last verse of the famous prophetic song of Moses, which seems to point out the <i>advent of</i> <i>the Messiah</i> to discomfit his enemies, purify the land, and redeem Israel from all his iniquities. </p>

<p>This is a very important verse; and to it, as it stands in the Septuagint, St. Paul has referred once before; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:10">Romans 15:10</span>. This very verse, as it stands now in the Septuagint, thus referred to by an inspired writer, shows the great importance of this ancient version; and proves the necessity of its being studied and well understood by every minister of Christ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:0">Romans 3:0</span>: there is a large quotation-from Psalm 14:, where there are six whole verses in the apostle's quotation which are not found in the present Hebrew text, but are preserved in the Septuagint! How strange it is that this venerable and important version, so often quoted by our Lord and all his apostles, should be so generally neglected, and so little known! That the common people should be ignorant of it, is not to be wondered at, as it has never been put in an English dress; but that the ministers of the Gospel should be unacquainted with it may be spoken to their shame.</p>
