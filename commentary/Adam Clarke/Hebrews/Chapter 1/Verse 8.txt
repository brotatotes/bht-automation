<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8">Hebrews 1:8</span>. <i><b>Thy throne, O God</b></i><b>, is </b><i><b>for ever and ever</b></i> — If this be said of the Son of God, i.e. Jesus Christ, then Jesus Christ must be God; and indeed the design of the apostle is to prove this. The words here quoted are taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:6">Psalms 45:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:7">Psalms 45:7</span>, which the ancient Chaldee paraphrast, and the most intelligent rabbins, refer to the Messiah. On the third verse of this Psalm, <i>Thou art</i> <i>fairer than the children of men</i>, the <i>Targum</i> says: "Thy beauty, מלכא משיחא <i>malca Meshicha</i>, O King Messiah, is greater than the children of men." <i>Aben Ezra</i> says: "This Psalm speaks of David, or rather of his son, the <i>Messiah</i>, for this is his name," <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:24">Ezekiel 34:24</span>: <i>And David my servant shall be a Prince over them for ever</i>. Other rabbins confirm this opinion.</p>
<p>This verse is very properly considered a proof, and indeed a strong one, of the Divinity of Christ; but some late versions of the New Testament have endeavoured to avoid the evidence of this proof by translating the words thus: <i>God is thy throne for ever</i> <i>and ever</i>; and if this version be correct, it is certain the text can be no proof of the doctrine. Mr. Wakefield vindicates this translation at large in his <i>History of Opinions</i>; and ο θεος, being the <i>nominative</i> case, is supposed to be a sufficient justification of this version. In answer to this it may be stated that the <i>nominative</i> case is often used for the <i>vocative</i>, particularly by the Attics; and the whole scope of the place requires it should be so used here; and, with due deference to all of a contrary opinion, the original Hebrew cannot be consistently translated any other way, כסאך אלהים עולם ועד <i>kisaca Elohim olam vaed</i>, <i>Thy</i> <i>throne, O God, is for ever, and to eternity</i>. It is in both worlds; and extends over all time; and will exist through all endless duration. To this our Lord seems to refer, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>: <i>All power is given unto me, both in</i> HEAVEN <i>and</i> EARTH. My <i>throne</i>, i.e. my <i>dominion</i>, extends from the creation to the consummation of all things. These I have made, and these I uphold; and from the end of the world, throughout eternity, I shall have the same glory-sovereign, unlimited power and authority, which I had with the Father before the world began; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>. I may add that none of the ancient versions has understood it in the way contended for by those who deny the Godhead of Christ, either in the Psalm from which it is taken, or in this place where it is quoted. Aquila translates אלהים <i>Elohim</i>, by Θεε, <i>O God</i>, in the vocative case; and the Arabic adds the sign of the vocative [Arabic] <i>ya</i>, reading the place thus: [Arabic] <i>korsee yallaho ila abadilabada</i>, the same as in our version. And even allowing that οθεος here is to be used as the <i>nominative</i> case, it will not make the sense contended for, without adding εστι to it, a reading which is not countenanced by any <i>version</i>, nor by any MS. yet discovered. Wiclif, Coverdale, and others, understood it as the nominative, and translated it so; and yet it is evident that this nominative has the power of the vocative: <i>forsothe to the sone God thi</i> <i>troone into the world of world: a gerde of equite the gerde of thi</i> <i>reume</i>. I give this, pointing and all, as it stands in my old MS. Bible. <i>Wiclif</i> is nearly the same, but is evidently of a more modern cast: <i>but to the sone he seith, God thy trone is into the</i> <i>world of world, a gherd of equyte is the gherd of thi rewme</i>. <i>Coverdale</i> translates it thus: <i>But unto the sonne he sayeth, God</i>, <i>thi seate endureth for ever and ever: the cepter of thi kyngdome</i> <i>is a right cepter</i>. <i>Tindal</i> and others follow in the same way, all reading it in the <i>nominative</i> case, with the force of the <i>vocative</i>; for none of them has inserted the word εστι, <i>is</i>, because not authorized by the original: a word which the opposers of the Divinity of our Lord are obliged to <i>beg</i>, in order to support their interpretation. See some farther criticisms on this at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>A sceptre of righteousness</b></i> — The sceptre, which was a sort of staff or instrument of various forms, was the ensign of government, and is here used for government itself. This the ancient Jewish writers understand also of the Messiah.</p>
