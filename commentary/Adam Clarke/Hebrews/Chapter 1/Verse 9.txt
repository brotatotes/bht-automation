<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span>. <i><b>Thou hast loved righteousness</b></i> — This is the characteristic of a just governor: he abhors and suppresses iniquity; he countenances and supports righteousness and truth.</p>
<p><i><b>Therefore God</b></i>, even <i>thy God</i>] The original, δια τουτο εχρισε σε ὁ Θεος, ὁ Θεος σου, may be thus translated: <i>Therefore, O God, thy</i> <i>God hath anointed thee</i>. The form of speech is nearly the same with that in the preceding verse; but the sense is sufficiently clear if we read, <i>Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee, c</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>With the oil of gladness</b></i> — We have often had occasion to remark that, anciently, <i>kings, priests</i>, and <i>prophets</i> were consecrated to their several offices by anointing and that this signified the gifts and influences of the Divine Spirit. Christ, οχριστος, signifies <i>The Anointed One</i>, the same as the Hebrew Messias; and he is here said to be <i>anointed with the oil of gladness above his</i> <i>fellows</i>. None was ever constituted <i>prophet, priest</i>, and <i>king</i>, but himself; some were kings only, prophets only, and priests only; others were kings and priests, or priests and prophets, or kings and prophets; but none had ever the <i>three offices</i> in his own person but Jesus Christ, and none but himself can be a King over the universe, a Prophet to all intelligent beings, and a Priest to the whole human race. Thus he is infinitely exalted <i>beyond his</i> <i>fellows</i>-all that had ever borne the regal, prophetic, or sacerdotal offices.</p>
<p>Some think that the word μετοχους, <i>fellows</i>, refers to <i>believers</i> who are made partakers of the same Spirit, but cannot have its infinite plenitude. The first sense seems the best. <i>Gladness</i> is used to express the <i>festivities</i> which took place on the inauguration of kings, &amp;c.</p>
