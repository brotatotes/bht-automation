<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>. <i><b>The law, having a shadow of good things to come</b></i> — <i>A</i> <i>shadow</i>, σκια, signifies,</p>
<p>1. <i>Literally</i>, the <i>shade</i> cast from a body of any kind, interposed between the place on which the shadow is projected, and the sun or light; the rays of the light not shining on that place, because intercepted by the opacity of the body, through which they cannot pass. </p>
<p>2. It signifies, <i>technically</i>, a sketch, rude plan, or imperfect draught of a building, landscape, man, beast, c. </p>
<p>3. It signifies, <i>metaphorically</i>, any faint adumbration, symbolical expression, imperfect or obscure image of a thing and is opposed to σωμα, <i>body</i>, or the <i>thing</i> intended to be thereby defined. </p>
<p>4. It is used <i>catachrestically</i> among the Greek writers, as <i>umbra</i> is among the Latins, to signify any thing <i>vain, empty, light</i>, not <i>solid</i>; thus <i>Philostratus</i>, Vit. Soph., lib. i. cap. 20: Ὁτι σκια και ονειρατα αἱ ἡδοναι πασαι· <i>All pleasures are but</i> SHADOWS <i>and dreams</i>. And <i>Cicero</i>, in Pison., cap. 24: <i>Omnes umbras falsae gloriae consectari</i>. "All pursue the SHADOWS of FALSE GLORY." And again, <i>De Offic</i>., lib. iii. cap. 17: <i>Nos veri juris germanaeque justitiae</i> solidam <i>et</i> expressam effigiem <i>nullam tenemus</i>; umbra <i>et</i> itnaginibus <i>utimur</i>. "We have no solid and express effigy of true law and genuine justice, but we employ shadows and images to represent them."</p>
<p><b>And </b><i><b>not the very image</b></i> — εικων, <i>image</i>, signifies,</p>
<p>1. A simple <i>representation</i>, from εικω, <i>I am like</i>. </p>
<p>2. The <i>form</i> or particular fashion of a thing. </p>
<p>3. The <i>model</i> according to which any thing is formed. </p>
<p>4. The <i>perfect image</i> of a thing as opposed to a faint representation. </p>
<p>5. <i>Metaphorically</i>, a <i>similitude</i>, agreement, or conformity.</p>
<p>The law, with all its ceremonies and sacrifices, was only a <i>shadow</i> of spiritual and eternal good. The Gospel is the <i>image</i> or <i>thing itself</i>, as including every spiritual and eternal good.</p>
<p>We may note <i>three</i> things here:</p>
<p>1. The <i>shadow</i> or general outline, limiting the size and proportions of the thing to be represented.</p>
<p>2. The <i>image</i> or <i>likeness</i> completed from this shadow or general outline, whether represented on paper, canvass, or in statuary,</p>
<p>3. The <i>person</i> or <i>thing</i> thus represented in its actual, natural state of existence; or what is called here <i>the very image of the things</i>, αυτην την εικονα των πραγματων.</p>
<p>Such is the <i>Gospel</i>, when compared with the <i>law</i>; such is <i>Christ</i>, when compared with <i>Aaron</i>; such is his <i>sacrifice</i>, when compared with the <i>Levitical offerings</i>; such is the <i>Gospel remission of sins</i> and <i>purification</i>, when compared with those afforded by the law; such is the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, ministered by the Gospel, when compared with its types and shadows in the Levitical service; such the <i>heavenly rest</i>, when compared with the <i>earthly Canaan</i>. Well, therefore, might the apostle say, <i>The law</i> <i>was only the shadow of good things to come</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Can never - make the comers thereunto perfect.</b></i> — Cannot remove guilt from the conscience, or impurity from the heart. I leave <i>preachers</i> to improve these points.</p>
