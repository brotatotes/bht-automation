<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:10">Hebrews 10:10</span>. <i><b>By the which will we are sanctified</b></i> â€” Closing in with this so solemnly declared WILL <i>of God</i>, that there is no name given under heaven among men, by which we can be saved, but Jesus the Christ, we believe in him, find redemption in his blood, and are sanctified unto God through the sacrificial <i>offering of his body</i>.</p>
<p>1. Hence we see that the sovereign WILL of God is, that Jesus should be incarnated; that he should suffer and die, or, in the apostle's words, <i>taste death for every man</i>; that all should believe on him, and be saved from their sins: for this is the WILL of God, our <i>sanctification</i>.</p>
<p>2. And as the apostle grounds this on the words of the psalm, we see that it is the WILL <i>of God</i> that that system shall end; for as the essence of it is contained in its <i>sacrifices</i>, and God says he <i>will not</i> have these, and has prepared the <i>Messiah</i> to do his will, i.e. to <i>die for men</i>, hence it necessarily follows, from the psalmist himself, that the introduction of the Messiah into the world is the abolition of the law, and that his sacrifice is that which shall last for ever.</p>
