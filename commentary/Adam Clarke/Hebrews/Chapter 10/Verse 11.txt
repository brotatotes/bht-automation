<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11">Hebrews 10:11</span>. <i><b>Every priest standeth</b></i> â€” The office of the Jewish priest is here compared with the office of our High Priest. The Jewish priest <i>stands</i> daily at the altar, like a servant ministering, <i>repeating</i> the same sacrifices; our High Priest offered himself once for all, and <i>sat down</i> at the right hand of God, as the only-begotten Son and Heir of all things, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:12">Hebrews 10:12</span>. This <i>continual</i> offering argued the <i>imperfection</i> of the sacrifices. Our Lord's <i>once</i> offering, proves his was <i>complete</i>.</p>
