<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:13">Hebrews 10:13</span>. <i><b>Till his enemies be made his footstool.</b></i> â€” Till all that oppose his high priesthood and sacrificial offering shall be defeated, routed, and confounded; and acknowledge, in their punishment, the supremacy of his power as universal and eternal King, who refused to receive him as their <i>atoning</i> and <i>sanctifying</i> <i>Priest</i>. There is also an oblique reference here to the destruction of the Jews, which was then at hand; for Christ was about to <i>take away the second</i> with an overwhelming flood of desolations.</p>
