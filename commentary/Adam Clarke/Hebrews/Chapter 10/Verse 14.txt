<p>Verse 14. <i><b>For by one offering</b></i> — His death upon the cross.</p>
<p><i><b>He hath perfected for ever.</b></i> — He has procured remission of sins and holiness; fur it is well observed here, and in several parts of this epistle, that τελειοω, <i>to make perfect</i>, is the same as αφεσιν αμαρτιων ποιεω, <i>to procure remission of sins</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Them that are sanctified.</b></i> — τους αγιαζομενους. Them that have received the sprinkling of the blood of this offering. These, therefore, receiving redemption through that blood, have no need of any other offering; as this was a complete atonement, purification, and title to eternal glory.</p>
