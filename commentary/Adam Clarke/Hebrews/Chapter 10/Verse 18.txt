<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Now where remission of these</b></i><b> is</b>] In any case, where sin is once pardoned, there is no farther need of a sin-offering; but every believer on Christ has his sin blotted out, and therefore needs no other offering for that sin.</p>
<p>"If," says Dr. Macknight, "after remission is granted to the sinner, there is no need of any more sacrifice for sin; and if Christ, by offering himself once, has <i>perfected for ever the</i> <i>sanctified</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:14">Hebrews 10:14</span>, the <i>sacrifice of the mass</i>, as it is called, about which the Romish clergy employ themselves so incessantly, and to which the <i>papists</i> trust for the pardon of their sins, has no foundation in Scripture. Nay, it is an evident impiety, as it proceeds upon the supposition that the offering of the body of Christ once is not sufficient to procure the pardon of sin, but must be <i>frequently</i> repeated. If they reply that their mass is only the representation and commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ, they give up the cause, and renounce an article of their faith, established by the council of Trent, which, in session xxii. can. 1, 3, declared <i>the sacrifice of the mass to be a true and</i> <i>propitiatory sacrifice for sin</i>. I say, give up the cause; for the <i>representation</i> and <i>commemoration</i> of a sacrifice is not a sacrifice. Farther, it cannot be affirmed that the body of Christ is offered in the mass, unless it can be said that, as often as it is offered, <i>Christ has suffered death</i>; for the apostle says expressly, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:25">Hebrews 9:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>, that if Christ offered himself often, <i>he must often have suffered since the foundation of the world</i>." Let him disprove this who can.</p>
