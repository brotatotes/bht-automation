<p>Verse 20. <i><b>By a new and living way</b></i> — It is a <i>new</i> way; no <i>human</i> being had ever before entered into the heaven of heavens; Jesus in human nature was the first, and thus he has opened the way to heaven to mankind, his own resurrection and ascension to glory being the proof and pledge of ours.</p>
<p>The way is called ὁδον προσφατον και ζωσαν, <i>new</i> or <i>fresh, and</i> <i>living</i>. This is evidently an allusion to the blood of the victim <i>newly shed, uncoagulated</i>, and consequently proper to be used for <i>sprinkling</i>. The blood of the Jewish victims was fit for sacrificial purposes only so long as it was <i>warm and fluid</i>, and might be considered as yet possessing its <i>vitality</i>; but when it grew <i>cold</i>, it <i>coagulated</i>, lost its <i>vitality</i>, and was no longer proper to be used sacrificially. Christ is here, in the allusion, represented as <i>newly slain</i>, and yet <i>living</i>; the blood ever considered as <i>flowing</i> and giving life to the world. The <i>way</i> by the old covenant neither gave life, nor removed the liability to death. The way to peace and reconciliation, under the old covenant, was through the dead bodies of the animals slain; but Christ is living, and ever liveth, to make intercession for us; therefore he is a new and <i>living</i> way.</p>
<p>In the Choephorae of <i>AEschylus</i>, ver. 801, there is an expression like this of the apostle: - </p>
<p>It is also called ζωσαν, <i>living</i>,</p>
<p>1. In opposition to the way into the holiest under the tabernacle, which was by <i>death</i>; nothing could be done in it without the blood of a victim. </p>
<p>2. It was the cause of death to any who might use it, except the high priest himself; and he could have access to it only one day in the year.</p>
<p>3. It is called <i>living</i>, because it has a spiritual <i>vital</i> efficacy in our access to God. </p>
<p>4. It is <i>living</i> as to its effects; it leads to life, and infallibly brings those who walk in it unto <i>life</i> <i>eternal</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Through the veil</b></i> — As the high priest lifted up or drew aside the veil that separated the holy from the most holy place, in order that he might have access to the Divine Majesty; and as the veil of the temple was rent from the top to the bottom at the crucifixion of Christ, to show that the way to the holiest was then laid open; so we must approach the throne through the mediation of Christ, and through his sacrificial death. His pierced side is the way to the holiest. Here the veil-his humanity, is rent, and the kingdom of heaven opened to all believers.</p>
