<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Let us draw near</b></i> — Let us come with the blood of our sacrifice to the throne of God: the expression is sacrificial.</p>
<p><i><b>With a true heart</b></i> — Deeply convinced of our need of help, and truly in earnest to obtain it.</p>
<p><i><b>In full assurance of faith</b></i> — Being fully persuaded that God will accept us for the sake of his Son, and that the sacrificial death of Christ gives us full authority to expect every blessing we need.</p>
<p><i><b>Having our hearts sprinkled</b></i> — Not our <i>bodies</i>, as was the case among the Hebrews, when they had contracted any pollution, for they were to be <i>sprinkled with the water of separation</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:2-10">Numbers 19:2-10</span>; but our <i>hearts</i>, sprinkled by the cleansing efficacy of the blood of Christ, without which we cannot draw nigh to God.</p>
<p><i><b>From an evil conscience</b></i> — Having that deep sense of guilt which our conscience felt taken all away, and the peace and love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us.</p>
<p><i><b>Our bodies washed with pure water.</b></i> — The high priest, before he entered into the inner tabernacle, or put on his holy garments, was to wash his flesh in water, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:4">Leviticus 16:4</span>, and the Levites were to be cleansed the same way, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+8:7">Numbers 8:7</span>. The apostle probably alludes to this in what he says here, though it appears that he refers principally to <i>baptisms</i>, the washing by which was an emblem of the purification of the soul by the grace and Spirit of Christ; but it is most likely that it is to the Jewish baptisms, and not the Christian, that the apostle alludes.</p>
