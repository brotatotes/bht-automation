<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith</b></i> — The word ομολογια, from ομου, <i>together</i>, and λογος, <i>a word</i>, implies that general consent that was among Christians on all the important articles of their faith and practice; particularly their acknowledgment of the truth of the Gospel, and of Jesus Christ, as the only victim for sin, and the only Saviour from it. If the word <i>washed</i> above refer to Christian baptism in the case of adults, then the profession is that which the baptized then made of their faith in the Gospel; and of their determination to live and die in that faith.</p>
<p>The various readings on this clause are many in the MSS., c. Της ελπιδος την ὁμολογιαν, <i>the confession of our</i> HOPE D*, two of the <i>Itala, Vulgate</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, and the <i>AEthiopic</i>. Ὁμολογιαν της πιστεως, <i>the confession of</i> FAITH; one of the Barberini MSS. and two others. This is the reading which our translators have followed; but it is of very little authority. Την επαγγελιαν της ελπιδος, <i>the promise of</i> HOPE; St. <i>Chrysostom</i>. Την ελπιδα της ὁμολογιας, <i>the</i> HOPE <i>of our</i> PROFESSION; one of Petavius's MSS. But among all these, the <i>confession</i> or <i>profession of</i> HOPE is undoubtedly the genuine reading. Now, among the primitive Christians, the <i>hope</i> which they professed was the <i>resurrection of the body, and everlasting life</i>; every thing among these Christians was done and believed in reference to a future state; and for the joy that this set before them, they, like their Master, endured every cross, and despised all shame: they <i>expected</i> to be with God, through Christ; this <i>hope</i> they <i>professed to have</i>; and they <i>confessed</i> boldly and publicly the <i>faith</i> on which this hope was built. The apostle exhorts them to <i>hold fast</i> this <i>confession without wavering</i>-never to doubt the declarations made to them by their Redeemer, but having the <i>full</i> <i>assurance of faith</i> that their hearts were sprinkled from an evil conscience, that they had found redemption in the blood of the lamb, they might expect to be glorified with their living Head in the kingdom of their Father.</p>
<p><i><b>He</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>faithful that promised</b></i> — The eternal life, which is the <i>object</i> of your <i>hope</i>, is promised to you by him who cannot lie; as he then is <i>faithful</i> who has given you this <i>promise, hold fast the</i> <i>profession of</i> your <i>hope</i>.</p>
