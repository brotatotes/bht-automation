<p>Verse 24. <i><b>And let us consider one another</b></i> — κατανοωμεν. Let us <i>diligently</i> and <i>attentively consider</i> each other's trials, difficulties, and weaknesses; feel for each other, and <i>excite</i> each other to an increase of <i>love</i> to God and man; and, as the proof of it, to be fruitful in <i>good works</i>. The words εις παροξυσμον, <i>to</i> <i>the provocation</i>, are often taken in a <i>good sense</i>, and signify <i>excitement, stirring up</i>, to do any thing laudable, useful, honourable, or necessary. Xenophon, <i>Cyrop</i>., lib. vi., page 108, speaking of the conduct of Cyrus towards his officers, says: και Και τουτους επαινων τε, παρωξυνε, και χαριζομενος αυτοις ὁ τι δυναιτο. "He by praises and gifts <i>excited</i> them as much as possible." <i>See the note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span><i>"</i>, where the subject is farther considered.</p>
