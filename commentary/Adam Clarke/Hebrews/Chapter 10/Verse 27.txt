Verse 27. A certain fearful looking for of judgment — From this it is evident that God will pardon no man without a sacrifice for sin; for otherwise, as Dr. Macknight argues, it would not follow, from there remaining to apostates no more sacrifice for sin, that there must remain to them a dreadful expectation of judgment.And fiery indignation — και πυρος ζηλος. A zeal, or fervour of fire; something similar to the fire that came down from heaven and destroyed Korah and his company; Numbers 16:35.Probably the apostle here refers to the case of the unbelieving Jews in general, as in chap. Hebrews 6:0: to the dreadful judgment that was coming upon them, and the burning up their temple and city with fire. These people had, by the preaching of Christ and his apostles, received the knowledge of the truth. It was impossible that they could have witnessed his miracles and heard his doctrine without being convinced that he was the Messiah, and that their own system was at an end; but they rejected this only sacrifice at a time when God abolished their own: to that nation, therefore, there remained no other sacrifice for sin; therefore the dreadful judgment came, the fiery indignation was poured out, and they, as adversaries, were devoured by it.
