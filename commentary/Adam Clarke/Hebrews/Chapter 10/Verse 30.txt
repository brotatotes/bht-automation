<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Vengeance</b></i><b> belongeth </b><i><b>unto me</b></i> — This is the saying of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:35">Deuteronomy 32:35</span>, in reference to the idolatrous Gentiles, who were the enemies of his people; and is here with propriety applied to the above apostates, who, being enemies to God's ordinances, and Christ's ministry and merits, must also be enemies to Christ's people; and labour for the destruction of them, and the cause in which they are engaged.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord shall judge his people.</b></i> — That is, he shall execute judgment <i>for</i> them; for this is evidently the sense in which the word is used in the place from which the apostle quotes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:36">Deuteronomy 32:36</span>: <i>For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his</i> <i>servants, when he seeth that their power is gone</i>. So God will avenge and vindicate the cause of Christianity by destroying its enemies, as he did in the case of the Jewish people, whom he destroyed from being a nation, and made them a proverb of reproach and monuments of his wrathful indignation to the present day.</p>
