<p>Verse 31. <i><b>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the</b></i> <i>living God.</i>] To fall into the hands of God is to fall under his <i>displeasure</i>; and he who <i>lives for ever</i> can <i>punish for ever</i>. How dreadful to have the displeasure of an <i>eternal, almighty</i> Being to rest on the soul for ever! Apostates, and all the persecutors and enemies of God's cause and people, may expect the heaviest judgments of an incensed Deity: and these, not for a <i>time</i>, but through <i>eternity</i>.</p>
