<p>Verse 32. <i><b>But call to remembrance</b></i> — It appears from this, and indeed from some parts of the Gospel history, that the first believers in Judea were greatly persecuted; our Lord's crucifixion, Stephen's martyrdom, the persecution that arose after the death of Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>, Herod's persecution, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1">Acts 12:1</span>, in which James was killed, and the various persecutions of St. Paul, sufficiently show that this disposition was predominant among that bad people.</p>
<p><i><b>A great fight of afflictions</b></i> — Πολλην αθλησιν παθηματων· <i>A</i> <i>great combat</i> or <i>contention of sufferings</i>. Here we have an allusion to the combats at the Grecian games, or to exhibitions of gladiators at the public spectacles; and an intimation how <i>honourable</i> it was to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints, and to overcome through the blood of the Lamb, and their own testimony.</p>
