<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Ye were made a gazing-stock</b></i> — Θεατριζομενοι. Ye were exhibited as wild beasts and other shows at the theatres. See the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>, where all this is illustrated.</p>
<p><i><b>Companions of them that were so used.</b></i> — It appears, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14-15">1 Thessalonians 2:14-15</span>, that the Churches of God in Judea were greatly persecuted, and that they believed with courage and constancy in their persecutions. When any victim of persecuting rage was marked out, the rest were prompt to take his part, and acknowledge themselves believers in the same doctrine for which he suffered. This was a noble spirit; many would have slunk into a corner, and put off the marks of Christ, that they might not be exposed to affliction on this account.</p>
