<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Ye had compassion of me in my bonds</b></i> — συνεπαθησατε. <i>Ye suffered with me, ye sympathized with me</i>, when bound for the testimony of Jesus. This probably refers to the sympathy they showed towards him, and the help they afforded him, during his long imprisonment in Caesarea and Jerusalem. But instead of τοις δεσμοιςμου, <i>my bonds</i>, τοιςδεσμιοις, <i>the prisoners</i>, is the reading of AD, and several others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Arabic</i> of Erpen, the <i>Coptic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, some of the <i>Itala</i>, and several of the Greek <i>fathers</i>. This reading appears to be so well supported, that <i>Griesbach</i> has admitted it into the text. If it be genuine, it shows that there had been, and perhaps were <i>then</i>, several bound for the testimony of Jesus, and that the Church in Judea had shown its attachment to Christ by openly acknowledging these prisoners, and ministering to them.</p>
<p><i><b>Took joyfully the spoiling of your goods</b></i> — They were deprived of their inheritances, turned out of their houses, and plundered of their goods; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented. To suffer such persecution patiently was great; to endure it without a murmur was greater; to rejoice in it was greatest of all. But how could they do all this? The next clause informs us.</p>
<p><i><b>Knowing in yourselves</b></i> — They had the fullest evidence that they were the children of God, the Spirit itself bearing this witness to their spirits; and if <i>children</i> than <i>heirs</i>, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. They knew that heaven was their <i>portion</i>, and that to it they had a sure right and indefeasible title by Christ Jesus. This accounts, and this alone can account, for their <i>taking joyfully the spoiling of their goods</i>: they had Christ in their hearts; they knew that they were his children, and that they had a kingdom, but that kingdom was not of this world. They had the support they needed, and they had it in the time in which they needed it most.</p>
