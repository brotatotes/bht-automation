<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Ye have need of patience</b></i> — Having so <i>great a fight of</i> <i>sufferings</i> to pass through, and they of so long continuance. God furnishes the <i>grace</i>; you must exercise it. The grace or principle of patience comes from God; the use and exercise of that grace is of yourselves. Here ye must be workers together with God. <i>Patience</i> and <i>perseverance</i> are nearly the same.</p>
<p><i><b>Have done the will of God</b></i> — By keeping the faith, and patiently suffering for it.</p>
