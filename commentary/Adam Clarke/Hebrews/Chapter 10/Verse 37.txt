<p>Verse 37. <i><b>For yet a little while</b></i> — Ετι γαρ μικρον ὁσον· <i>For</i> <i>yet a very little time</i>. In a very short space of time the Messiah will come, and execute judgment upon your rebellious country. This is determined, because they have filled up the measure of their iniquity, and their destruction slumbereth not. The apostle seems to refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:3">Habakkuk 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span>, and accommodates the words to his own purpose.</p>
