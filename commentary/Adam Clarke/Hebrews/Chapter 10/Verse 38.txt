<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Now the just shall live by faith</b></i> — Ὁ δε δικαιος εκ πιστεως ζησεται· <i>But the just by faith</i>, i.e. he who is justified by faith, <i>shall live</i>-shall be preserved when this overflowing scourge shall come. See this meaning of the phrase vindicated, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>. And it is evident, both from this text, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span>, that it is in this sense that the apostle uses it.</p>
<p><i><b>But if</b></i> any <i>man draw back</i>] Και εαν ὑποστειληται· <i>But if he</i> <i>draw back; he, the man who is justified by faith</i>; for it is of <i>him</i>, and none other, that the text speaks. The insertion of the words <i>any man</i>, if done to serve the purpose of a <i>particular creed</i>, is a wicked perversion of the words of God. They were evidently intended to turn away the <i>relative</i> from the <i>antecedent</i>, in order to save the doctrine of final and <i>unconditional</i> perseverance; which doctrine this text destroys.</p>
<p><i><b>My soul shall have no pleasure in him.</b></i> — My very heart shall be opposed to him who makes shipwreck of faith and a good conscience. The word υποστελλειν signifies, not only to <i>draw back</i>, but to <i>slink away and hide through fear</i>. In this sense it is used by the very best Greek writers, as well as by <i>Josephus</i> and <i>Philo</i>. As dastards and cowards are hated by all men, so those that <i>slink</i> <i>away</i> from Christ and his cause, for fear of persecution or secular loss, God must despise; in them he cannot delight; and his Spirit, grieved with their conduct, must desert their hearts, and lead them to <i>darkness</i> and <i>hardness</i>.</p>
