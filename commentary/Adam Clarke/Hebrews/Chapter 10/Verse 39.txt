<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:39">Hebrews 10:39</span>. <i><b>But we are not of them who draw back</b></i> — Ουκ εσμεν ὑποστολης - , αλλα πιστεως· "We are not the cowards, but the courageous." I have no doubt of this being the meaning of the apostle, and the form of speech requires such a translation; it occurs more than once in the New Testament. So, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>: οι εκ πιστεως, <i>they who are of the faith</i>, rather <i>the faithful</i>, the <i>believers</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>: ο εκ πιστεως, <i>the believer</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:8">Romans 2:8</span>: οι εξ επιθειας, <i>the contentious</i>; in all which places the learned reader will find that the form of speech is the same. We are not cowards who slink away, and notwithstanding meet <i>destruction</i>; but we are <i>faithful</i>, and have our souls saved alive. The words περιποιησις ψυχης signify the <i>preservation of the life</i>. <i>See the note, "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span><i>"</i>. He intimates that, notwithstanding the persecution was hot, yet they should escape with their <i>lives</i>.</p>
<p>1. IT is very remarkable, and I have more than once called the reader's attention to it, that not one Christian life was lost in the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. Every <i>Jew</i> perished, or was taken captive; all those who had <i>apostatized</i>, and slunk away from Christianity, perished with them: all the genuine <i>Christians</i> escaped with their lives. This very important information, which casts light on many passages in the New Testament, and manifests the grace and providence of God in a very conspicuous way, is given both by <i>Eusebius</i> and <i>Epiphanius</i>. I shall adduce their words: "When the whole congregation of the Church in Jerusalem, according to an oracle given by revelation to the approved persons among them before the war, κατα τινα χρησμον τοις αυτοθι δοκιμοις δι' αποκαλυψεως δοθεντα προ του πολεμου, μεταναστηναι της πολεως, και τινα της περαιας πολιν οικειν κεκελευσμενου, Πελλαν αυτην ονομαζουσιν, were commanded to depart from the city, and inhabit a certain city which they call Pella, beyond Jordan, to which, when all those who believed in Christ had removed from Jerusalem, and when the saints had totally abandoned the royal city which is the metropolis of the Jews; then the Divine vengeance seized them who had dealt so wickedly with Christ and his apostles, and utterly destroyed that wicked and abominable generation." EUSEB. <i>Hist</i>. <i>Eccles</i>, l. iii. c. v. vol. i. p. 93. Edit. a <i>Reading</i>.</p>
<p>St. <i>Epiphanius</i>, in <i>Haeres. Nazaren</i>, c. 7, says: "The Christians who dwelt in Jerusalem, being forewarned by Christ of the approaching siege, removed to Pella."</p>
<p>The same, in his book <i>De Ponderibus et Mensuris</i>, says: "The disciples of Christ being warned by an angel, removed to Pella; and afterwards, when Adrian rebuilt Jerusalem, and called it after his own name, <i>AElia Colonia</i>, they returned thither." As those places in Epiphanius are of considerable importance, I shall subjoin the original: Εκειθεν γαρ ἡ αρχη γεγονε μετα την απο των Ἱεροσολυμων μεταστασιν, παντων των μαθητων των εν Πελλῃ ῳκηκοτων, Χριστου φησαντος καταλειψαι τα Ἱεροσολυμα, και αναχωρησαι, επειδη ημελλε πασχειν πολιορκιαν. EPIPH. <i>adver. Haeres</i>., l. i. c. 7, vol. i. p. 123. Edit. Par. 1622. The other place is as follows: Ἡνικα γαρ εμελλεν ἡ πολις ἁλισκεσθαι ὑπο των Ῥωμαιων, προεχρηματισθησαν ὑπο Αγγελου παντες οἱ μαθηται μεταστηναι απο της πολεως, μελλουσης αρδην απολλυσθαι. Οἱ τινες και μετανασται γενομενοι ῳκησαν εν Πελλῃ - περαν του Ιορδανου, ἡ τις εκ Δεκαπολεως λεγεται ειναι. Ibid. <i>De Pon. et Mens</i>., vol. ii. p. 171.</p>
<p>These are remarkable testimonies, and should be carefully preserved. Pella, it appears, was a city of Coelesyria, beyond Jordan, in the district of Decapolis. Thus it is evident that these Christians held fast their faith, preserved their shields, and continued to believe to the <i>saving of their lives</i> as well as to the <i>saving of their souls</i>. As the apostle gives several hints of the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, it is likely that this is the true sense in which the words above are to be understood.</p>
<p>2. I have already said a little, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span>, on the importance of <i>social worship</i>. PUBLIC <i>worship</i> is not of less consequence. Were it not for <i>public</i>, private worship would soon be at an end. To this, under God, the Church of Christ owes its being and its continuance. Where there is no public worship there is no <i>religion</i>. It is by this that God is acknowledged; and he is the <i>universal Being</i>; and by his <i>bounty</i> and <i>providence</i> all live; consequently, it is the duty of every intelligent creature <i>publicly</i> to acknowledge him, and offer him that worship which himself has prescribed in his word. The ancient Jews have some good maxims on this subject which may be seen in Schoettgen. I shall quote a few.</p>
<p>In <i>Berachoth</i>, fol. 8, it is written: "Rabbi Levi said, He who has a synagogue in his city, and does not go thither to pray, shall be esteemed a bad citizen," or a bad neighbour. And to this they apply the words of the prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+12:14">Jeremiah 12:14</span>: <i>Thus saith the Lord against all my evil neighbours-behold, I will</i> <i>pluck them out of their land</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Mechilta</i>, fol. 48: "Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Jacob, said," speaking as from God, "If thou wilt come to my house, I will go to thy house; but if thou wilt not come to my house, I will not enter thy house. The place that my heart loveth, to that shall my feet go." We may safely add, that those who do not frequent the house of God can never expect his presence or blessing in their own.</p>
<p>In <i>Taanith</i>, fol. 11, it is said that "to him who separates himself from the congregation shall two angels come, and lay their hands upon his head and say, This man, who separates himself from the congregation, shall not see the comfort which God grants to his afflicted Church." The wisest and best of men have always felt it their duty and their interest to worship God in public. As there is nothing more necessary, so there is nothing more reasonable; he who acknowledges God in all his ways may expect all his steps to be directed. The public worship of God is one grand line of distinction between the atheist and the believer. He who uses not public worship has either no God, or has no right notion of his being; and such a person, according to the rabbins, is a <i>bad neighbour</i>; it is dangerous to live near him, for neither he nor his can be under the protection of God. No man should be forced to attend a particular place of worship, but every man should be obliged to attend some place; and he who has any fear of God will not find it difficult to get a place to his mind.</p>
