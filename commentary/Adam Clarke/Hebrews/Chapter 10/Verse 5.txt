<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>. <i><b>When he</b></i><b> (the Messiah) </b><i><b>cometh into the world</b></i> — Was about to be incarnated, <i>He saith</i> to God the Father, <i>Sacrifice and</i> <i>offering thou wouldest not</i>-it was never thy <i>will</i> and design that the sacrifices under thy own law should be considered as making atonement for sin, they were only designed to point out my incarnation and consequent sacrificial death, and therefore <i>a body</i> <i>hast thou prepared me</i>, by a miraculous conception in the womb of a virgin, according to thy word, <i>The seed of the woman shall bruise</i> <i>the head of the serpent</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A body hast thou prepared me</b></i> — The quotation in this and the two following verses is taken from Psalm xl., 6th, 7th, and 8th verses, as they stand now in the Septuagint, with scarcely any variety of reading; but, although the general meaning is the same, they are widely different in verbal expression in the Hebrew. David's words are, אזנים כרית לי <i>oznayim caritha li</i>, which we translate, <i>My ears hast thou opened</i>; but they might be more properly rendered, <i>My ears hast thou bored</i>, that is, thou hast made me <i>thy servant for ever</i>, to dwell in thine own house; for the allusion is evidently to the custom mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:2">Exodus 21:2</span>, c.: "If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve, and in the seventh he shall go out free but if the servant shall positively say, I love my master, c., I will not go out free, then his master shall bring him to the door post, and shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever."</p>
<p>But how is it possible that the Septuagint and the apostle should take a meaning so totally different from the sense of the Hebrew? Dr. Kennicott has a very ingenious conjecture here: he supposes that the Septuagint and apostle express the meaning of the words as they stood in the copy from which the Greek translation was made and that the present Hebrew text is corrupted in the word אזנים <i>oznayim</i>, ears, which has been written through carelessness for אז גוה <i>az gevah</i>, THEN A BODY. The first syllable אז, THEN, is the same in both; and the latter נים, which joined to אז, makes אזנים <i>oznayim</i>, might have been easily mistaken for גוה <i>gevah</i>, BODY; נ <i>nun</i>, being very like ג <i>gimel</i>; י yod, like ו <i>vau</i>; and ה <i>he</i>, like final ם <i>mem</i>; especially if the line on which the letters were written in the MS. happened to be blacker than ordinary, which has often been a cause of mistake, it might have been easily taken for the under stroke of the <i>mem</i>, and thus give rise to a corrupt reading: add to this the root כרה <i>carah</i>, signifies as well to <i>prepare as to open</i>, <i>bore</i>, c. On this supposition the ancient copy, translated by the Septuagint, and followed by the apostle, must have read the text thus: אז גוה כרית לי <i>az gevah caritha li</i>, σωμα δε κατηρτισω μοι, <i>then a body thou hast prepared me</i>: thus the Hebrew text, the version of the Septuagint, and the apostle, will agree in what is known to be an indisputable fact in Christianity, namely, that Christ was <i>incarnated</i> for the sin of the world.</p>
<p>The <i>AEthiopic</i> has nearly the same reading the <i>Arabic</i> has both, <i>A body hast thou prepared me, and mine ears thou hast opened</i>. But the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Chaldee</i>, and the <i>Vulgate</i>, agree with the present Hebrew text; and none of the MSS. collated by <i>Kennicott</i> and <i>De</i> <i>Rossi</i> have any various reading on the disputed words.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that all the offerings and sacrifices which were considered to be of an atoning or cleansing nature, offered under the law, are here enumerated by the psalmist and the apostle, to show that <i>none</i> of them nor <i>all</i> of them could take away sin, and that the grand sacrifice of Christ was that alone which could do it.</p>
<p>Four kinds are here specified, both by the psalmist and the apostle, viz.:</p>
<p>SACRIFICE, זבח <i>zebach</i>, θυσια.</p>
<p>OFFERING, מנחה <i>minchah</i>, προσφορα.</p>
<p>BURNT-OFFERING, עולה <i>olah</i>, ολοκαυτωμα.</p>
<p>SIN-OFFERING, חטאה <i>chataah</i>, περι αμαρτιας.</p>
<p>Of all these we may say, with the apostle, it was impossible that the blood of bulls and goats, &amp;c., should take away sin.</p>
