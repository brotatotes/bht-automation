<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:7">Hebrews 10:7</span>. <i><b>In the volume of the book</b></i> — במגלת ספר <i>bimgillath</i> <i>sepher</i>, "in the <i>roll</i> of the book." Anciently, books were written on skins and rolled up. Among the Romans these were called <i>volumina</i>, from <i>volvo, I roll</i>; and the Pentateuch, in the Jewish synagogues, is still written in this way. There are two wooden rollers; on one they roll <i>on</i>, on the other they roll <i>off</i>, as they proceed in reading. The <i>book</i> mentioned here must be the <i>Pentateuch</i>, or five books of Moses; for in David's time no other part of Divine revelation had been committed to writing. This whole book speaks about Christ, and his accomplishing the <i>will</i> of God; not only in, <i>The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of</i> <i>the serpent</i>, and, <i>In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth</i> <i>be blessed</i>, but in all the <i>sacrifices</i> and sacrificial rites mentioned in the law.</p>
<p><i><b>To do thy will</b></i> — God <i>willed</i> not the sacrifices under the law, but he <i>willed</i> that a human victim of infinite merit should be offered for the redemption of mankind. That there might be <i>such a</i> <i>victim</i>, a <i>body</i> was prepared for the eternal Logos; and in that body <i>he came</i> to do the <i>will of God</i>, that is, to suffer and die for the sins of the world.</p>
