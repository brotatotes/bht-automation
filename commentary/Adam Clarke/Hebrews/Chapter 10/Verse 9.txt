Verse Hebrews 10:9. He taketh away the first — The offerings, sacrifices, burnt-offerings, and sacrifices for sin, which were prescribed by the law.That he may establish the second. — The offering of the body of Jesus once for all. It will make little odds in the meaning if we say, he taketh away the first covenant, that he may establish the second covenant; he takes away the first dispensation, that he may establish the second; he takes away the law, that he may establish the Gospel. In all these cases the sense is nearly the same: I prefer the first.
