<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:9">Hebrews 10:9</span>. <i><b>He taketh away the first</b></i> — The offerings, sacrifices, burnt-offerings, and sacrifices for sin, which were prescribed by the <i>law</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That he may establish the second.</b></i> — The offering of the <i>body of</i> <i>Jesus</i> once for all. It will make little odds in the meaning if we say, he taketh away the first <i>covenant</i>, that he may establish the second <i>covenant</i>; he takes away the first <i>dispensation</i>, that he may establish the second; he takes away the <i>law</i>, that he may establish the <i>Gospel</i>. In all these cases the sense is nearly the same: I prefer the <i>first</i>.</p>
