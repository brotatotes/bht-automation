<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>. <i><b>Faith is the substance of things hoped for</b></i> — Εστι δε πιστις ελπιζομενων ὑποστασις· <i>Faith is the</i> SUBSISTENCE <i>of</i> <i>things hoped for</i>; πραγματων ελεγχος ου βλεπομενων·. <i>The</i> DEMONSTRATION <i>of things not seen</i>. The word υποστασις, which we translate <i>substance</i>, signifies <i>subsistence</i>, that which becomes a <i>foundation</i> for another thing to stand on. And ελεγχος signifies such a <i>conviction</i> as is produced in the mind by the <i>demonstration</i> of a <i>problem</i>, after which demonstration no doubt can remain, because we see from it that the thing <i>is</i>; that it <i>cannot but be</i>; and that it cannot be <i>otherwise</i> than as it is, and is proved to be. Such is the faith by which the soul is justified; or rather, such are the effects of justifying faith: on it subsists the peace of God which passeth all understanding; and the love of God is shed abroad in the heart where it lives, by the Holy Ghost. At the same time the Spirit of God witnesses with their spirits who have this faith that their sins are blotted out; and this is as fully manifest to their judgment and conscience as the axioms, "A whole is greater than any of its parts;" "Equal lines and angles, being placed on one another, do not exceed each other;" or as the deduction from prop. 47, book i., Euclid: "The square of the base of a right-angled triangle is equal to the difference of the squares of the other two sides." ελεγχος is defined by logicians, <i>Demonstratio quae fit argumentis certis et rationibus indubitatis</i>, <i>qua rei certitudo efficitur</i>. "A demonstration of the certainly of a thing by sure arguments and indubitable reasons." Aristotle uses it for a mathematical demonstration, and properly defines it thus: Ελεγχος δε εστις ὁ μη δυνατος αλλως εχειν, αλλ' οὑτως ὡς ἡμεις λεγομεν, " Elenehos, or Demonstration, is that which cannot be otherwise, but is so as we assert." Rhetor. ad Alexand., cap. 14, περι ελεγχου. On this account I have adduced the above theorem from <i>Euclid</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Things hoped for</b></i> — Are the peace and approbation of God, and those blessings by which the soul is prepared for the kingdom of heaven. A <i>penitent</i> hopes for the pardon of his sins and the favour of his God; faith in Christ puts him in possession of this pardon, and thus the thing that was hoped for is enjoyed by faith. When this is received, a man has the fullest conviction of the truth and reality of all these blessings though <i>unseen</i> by the <i>eye</i>, they are <i>felt</i> by the <i>heart</i>; and the man has no more doubt of God's approbation and his own free pardon, than he has of his being.</p>
<p>In an extended sense the <i>things hoped</i> for are the resurrection of the body, the new heavens and the new earth, the introduction of believers into the heavenly country, and the possession of eternal glory.</p>
<p>The <i>things unseen</i>, as distinguished from the things hoped for, are, in an extended sense, the creation of the world from nothing, the destruction of the world by the deluge, the miraculous conception of Christ, his resurrection from the dead, his ascension to glory, his mediation at the right hand of God, his government of the universe, &amp;c., &amp;c., all which we as firmly believe on the testimony of God's word as if we had seen them. See <i>Macknight</i>. But this faith has particular respect to the being, goodness, providence, grace, and mercy of God, as the subsequent verses sufficiently show.</p>
