<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:10">Hebrews 11:10</span>. <i><b>For he looked for a city which hath foundations</b></i> — He knew that earth could afford no permanent residence for an immortal mind, and he looked for that heavenly building of which God is the architect and owner; in a word, he lost sight of earth, that he might keep heaven in view. And all who are partakers of his faith possess the same spirit, walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose builder and maker</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>God.</b></i> — The word τεχνιτης signifies an <i>architect</i>, one who <i>plans, calculates</i>, and <i>constructs</i> a building. The word δημιουργος signifies the <i>governor of a people</i>; one who <i>forms them by institutions</i> and <i>laws</i>; the framer of a <i>political constitution</i>. God is here represented the <i>Maker</i> or <i>Father</i> of all the heavenly inhabitants, and the <i>planner</i> of their <i>citizenship</i> in that heavenly country. See <i>Macknight</i>.</p>
