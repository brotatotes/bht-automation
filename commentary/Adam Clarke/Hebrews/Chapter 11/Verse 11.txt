<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:11">Hebrews 11:11</span>. <i><b>Through faith also Sara</b></i> â€” Her history, as far as the event here is concerned, may be seen <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:19">Genesis 17:19</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:2">Genesis 21:2</span>. Sarah at first treated the Divine message with ridicule, judging it to be absolutely impossible, not knowing then that it was from God; and this her age and circumstances justified, for, humanly speaking, such an event was impossible: but, when she knew that it was God who said this, it does not appear that she doubted any more, but implicitly believed that what God had promised he was able to perform.</p>
