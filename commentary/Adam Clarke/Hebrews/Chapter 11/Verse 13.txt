<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>. <i><b>These all died in faith</b></i> — That is, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and Jacob, continued to believe, to the <i>end of their lives</i>, that God would fulfil this promise; but they neither saw the numerous seed, nor did they get the promised rest in Canaan.</p>
<p><i><b>Strangers and pilgrims</b></i> — Strangers, ξενοι, persons who are out of their own country, who are in a foreign land: <i>pilgrims</i>, παρεπιδημοι, sojourners only for a time; not intending to take up their abode in that place, nor to get naturalized in that country.</p>
<p>How many use these expressions, professing to be strangers and pilgrims here below, and yet the whole of their conduct, spirit, and attachments, show that they are <i>perfectly at home</i>! How little consideration and weight are in many of our professions, whether they relate to earth or heaven!</p>
