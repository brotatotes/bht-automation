Verse Hebrews 11:13. These all died in faith — That is, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and Jacob, continued to believe, to the end of their lives, that God would fulfil this promise; but they neither saw the numerous seed, nor did they get the promised rest in Canaan.Strangers and pilgrims — Strangers, ξενοι, persons who are out of their own country, who are in a foreign land: pilgrims, παρεπιδημοι, sojourners only for a time; not intending to take up their abode in that place, nor to get naturalized in that country.How many use these expressions, professing to be strangers and pilgrims here below, and yet the whole of their conduct, spirit, and attachments, show that they are perfectly at home! How little consideration and weight are in many of our professions, whether they relate to earth or heaven!
