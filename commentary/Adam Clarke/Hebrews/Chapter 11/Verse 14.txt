<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Declare plainly that they seek a country.</b></i> â€” A man's <i>country</i> is that in which he has constitutional rights and privileges; no stranger or sojourner has any such rights in the country where he sojourns. These, by declaring that they felt themselves strangers and sojourners, professed their faith in a heavenly country and state, and looked beyond the grave for a place of happiness. No intelligent Jew could suppose that Canaan was all the <i>rest</i> which God had promised to his people.</p>
