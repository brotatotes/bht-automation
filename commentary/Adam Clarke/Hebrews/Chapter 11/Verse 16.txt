<p>Verse 16. <i><b>But now they desire a better</b></i> â€” They all expected <i>spiritual blessings</i>, and a <i>heavenly inheritance</i>; they sought God as their <i>portion</i>, and in such a way and on such principles that he is not <i>ashamed to be called their God</i>; and he shows his affection for them by preparing for them a city, to wit, <i>heaven</i>, as themselves would seek no city on earth; which is certainly what the apostle has here in view. And from this it is evident that the patriarchs had a proper notion of the immortality of the soul, and expected a place of residence widely different from Canaan. Though to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the promises were made in which Canaan was so particularly included, yet God did not give them any inheritance in that country, <i>no, not so much as to set a</i> <i>foot on</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:5">Acts 7:5</span>. Therefore, if they had not understood the promises to belong to <i>spiritual things</i>, far from enduring, as seeing him who is invisible, they must have considered themselves deceived and mocked. The apostle therefore, with the highest propriety, attributes their whole conduct and expectation to <i>faith</i>.</p>
