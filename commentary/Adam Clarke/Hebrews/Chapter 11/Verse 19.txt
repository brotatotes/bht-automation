<p>Verse 19. <i><b>To raise</b></i><b> him </b><i><b>up, even from the dead</b></i> — Abraham staggered not at the promise through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God. The resurrection of the dead must have been a doctrine of the patriarchs; they expected a heavenly inheritance, they saw they died as did other men, and they must have known that they could not enjoy it but in consequence of a resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p><i><b>He received him in a figure.</b></i> — εν παραβολη. In my discourse on <i>parabolical writing</i> at the end of <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:58">Matthew 13:58</span>, I have shown (signification #9) that παραβολη sometimes means a <i>daring exploit</i>, a <i>jeoparding of the life</i>; and have referred to this place. I think it should be so understood here, as pointing out the very imminent danger he was in of losing his life. The clause may therefore be thus translated: "Accounting that God was able to raise him up from the dead, from whence he had received him, he being in the most imminent danger of losing his life." It is not, therefore, the natural deadness of Abraham and Sarah to which the apostle alludes, but the death to which Isaac on this occasion was exposed, and which he escaped by the immediate interference of God.</p>
