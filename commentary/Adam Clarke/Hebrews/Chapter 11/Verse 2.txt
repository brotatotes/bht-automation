<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:2">Hebrews 11:2</span>. <i><b>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</b></i> — By the <i>elders</i> are meant <i>ancestors, forefathers</i>, such as the patriarchs and prophets, several of whom he afterwards particularly names, and produces some fact from the history of their lives.</p>
<p>It is very remarkable that among the whole there is root one word concerning poor Adam and his wife, though both <i>Abraham</i> and <i>Sarah</i> are mentioned. There was no <i>good report</i> concerning <i>them</i>; not a word of their repentance, faith, or holiness. Alas! alas! did ever such bright suns set in so thick a cloud? Had there been any thing praiseworthy in their life after their fall, any act of faith by which they could have been distinguished, it had surely come out here; the mention of their second son Abel would have suggested it. But God has covered the whole of their spiritual and eternal state with a <i>thick</i> and <i>impenetrable veil</i>. Conjectures relative to their state would be very precarious; little else than <i>hope</i> can be exercised in their favour: but as to them the promise of Jesus was given, so we may believe they found redemption in that blood which was shed from the foundation of the world. Adam's rebellion against his Maker was too great and too glaring to permit his name to be ever after mentioned with honour or respect.</p>
<p>The word εμαρτυρηθησαν, which we translate <i>obtained a good</i> <i>report</i>, literally signifies, <i>were witnessed of</i>; and thus leads us naturally to GOD, who by his word, as the succeeding parts of the chapter show, <i>bore testimony</i> to the faith and holiness of his servants. The apostle does not mention one of whom an account is not given in the Old Testament. This, therefore, is God's witness or testimony concerning them.</p>
