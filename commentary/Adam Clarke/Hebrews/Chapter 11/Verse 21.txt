<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Blessed both the sons of Joseph</b></i> — That is, Ephraim and Manasseh. See the account and the notes. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:5">Genesis 48:5</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Worshipped</b></i><b>, leaning </b><i><b>upon the top of his staff</b></i> — This subject is particularly considered in the note, <i>See "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:31">Genesis 47:31</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p>It appears, that at the time Joseph visited his father he was very weak, and generally confined to his couch, having at hand his <i>staff</i> either that with which he usually supported his feeble body, or that which was the <i>ensign</i> of his office, as <i>patriarch</i> or <i>chief</i> of a very numerous family. The ancient chiefs, in all countries, had this staff or sceptre continually at hand. See Homer throughout. It is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:2">Genesis 48:2</span>, that when Joseph came to see his father Jacob, who was then in his last sickness, <i>Israel</i> <i>strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed</i>. Still I conceive he had his staff or sceptre at hand; and while sitting upon the bed, with his feet on the floor, he supported himself with his staff. When Joseph sware to him that he should be carried up from Egypt, he <i>bowed himself on his bed's head</i>, still supporting himself with his staff, which probably with this last act he laid aside, <i>gathered up his feet</i>, and reclined wholly on his couch. It was therefore indifferent to say that he worshipped or bowed himself on his staff or on his bed's head. But as שחה <i>shachah</i> signifies, not only to <i>bow</i>, but also to <i>worship</i>, because acts of adoration were performed by <i>bowing</i> and <i>prostration</i>; and as מטה <i>mittah</i>, a <i>bed</i>, by the change of the vowel points becomes <i>matteh</i>, a <i>staff</i>, hence the <i>Septuagint</i> have translated the passage Και προσεκυνησεν Ισραηλ επι το ακρον της ῥαβδου αυτου· <i>And Israel bowed or</i> <i>worshipped on the head of his staff</i>. This reading the apostle follows here <i>literatim</i>.</p>
<p>Wretched must that cause be which is obliged to have recourse to what, at best, is an equivocal expression, to prove and support a favourite opinion. The Romanists allege this in favour of <i>image</i> <i>worship</i>. This is too contemptible to require confutation. To make it speak this language the Rheims version renders the verse thus: <i>By faith Jacob dying, blessed every one of the sons of</i> <i>Joseph, and adored the top of his rod</i>. A pretty object of adoration, indeed, for a dying patriarch! Here the preposition επι <i>upon</i>, answering to the Hebrew על <i>al</i>, is wholly suppressed, to make it favour the corrupt reading of the Vulgate. This preposition is found in the <i>Hebrew text</i>, in the <i>Greek version</i> of the <i>Seventy</i>, the <i>printed Greek text</i> of the New Testament, and in <i>every</i> MS. yet discovered of this epistle. It is also found in the <i>Syriac, AEthiopic, Arabic</i>, and <i>Coptic</i>: in which languages the connection necessarily shows that it is not an idle particle: and by no mode of construction can the text be brought to support <i>image worship</i>, any more than it can to support <i>transubstantiation</i>.</p>
