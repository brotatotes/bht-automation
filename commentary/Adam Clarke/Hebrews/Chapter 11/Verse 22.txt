Verse 22. Joseph, when he died — τελευτων, When he was dying, gave commandment concerning his bones. On this subject I refer the reader to the notes on "Genesis 50:25". And I have this to add to the account I have given of the sarcophagus now in the British Museum, vulgarly called Alexander's coffin, that it is more probably the coffin of Joseph himself; and, should the time ever arrive in which the hieroglyphics on it shall he interpreted, this conjecture may appear to have had its foundation in truth.
