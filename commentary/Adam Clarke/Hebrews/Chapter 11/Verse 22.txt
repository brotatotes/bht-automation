<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Joseph, when he died</b></i> — τελευτων, <i>When he was dying</i>, <i>gave commandment concerning his bones</i>. On this subject I refer the reader to the <i>notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+50:25">Genesis 50:25</span><i>"</i>. And I have this to add to the account I have given of the <i>sarcophagus</i> now in the <i>British Museum</i>, vulgarly called <i>Alexander's coffin</i>, that it is more probably the <i>coffin of Joseph</i> himself; and, should the time ever arrive in which the hieroglyphics on it shall he interpreted, this conjecture may appear to have had its foundation in truth.</p>
