<p>Verse 23. <i><b>By faith Moses, c.</b></i> — <i>See the notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:2">Exodus 2:2</span><i>"</i>, and <i>See "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:20">Acts 7:20</span><i>"</i>. We know that Moses was bred up at the Egyptian court, and <i>there</i> was considered to be the son of Pharaoh's daughter and probably might have succeeded to the throne of Egypt: but, finding that God had visited his people, and given them a promise of <i>spiritual and eternal blessings</i>, he chose rather to take the lot of this people, i.e. God as his portion for ever, than to <i>enjoy the pleasures of sin</i>, which, however gratifying to the animal senses, could only be προσκαιρον, <i>temporary</i>.</p>
<p>After the <i>23</i>d verse, there is a whole clause added by DE, two copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and some copies of the <i>Vulgate</i>. The clause is the following: Πιστει μεγας γενομενος Μωΰσης ανειλεν τον Αιγυπτιον, κατανοων την ταπεινωσιν των αδελφων αὑτου. <i>By faith</i> <i>Moses, when he was grown up, slew the Egyptian, considering the</i> <i>oppression of his own brethren</i>. This is a remarkable addition, and one of the largest in the whole New Testament. It seems to have been collected from the history of Moses as given in Exodus, and to have been put originally into the margin of some MS., from which it afterwards crept into the text.</p>
