<p>Verse 26. <i><b>The reproach of Christ</b></i> — The <i>Christ</i> or <i>Messiah</i> had been revealed to Moses; of him he prophesied, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>; and the <i>reproach</i> which God's people had, in consequence of their decided opposition to idolatry, may be termed the <i>reproach of Christ</i>, for they refused to become one people with the Egyptians, because the <i>promise of the rest</i> was made to them, and in this <i>rest</i> CHRIST and his <i>salvation</i> were included: but, although it does not appear these things were known to the Hebrews <i>at large</i>, yet it is evident that there were sufficient intimations given to Moses concerning the Great Deliverer, (of whom himself was a type,) that determined his conduct in the above respect; as he folly understood that he must renounce his interest in the promises, and in the life eternal to which they led, if he did not obey the Divine call in the present instance. Many have been stumbled by the word ο χριστος, <i>Christ</i>, here; because they cannot see how Moses should have any knowledge of him. It may be said that it was just as easy for God Almighty to reveal Christ to <i>Moses</i>, as it was for him to reveal him to <i>Isaiah</i>, or to the <i>shepherds</i>, or to <i>John Baptist</i>; or to manifest him in the <i>flesh</i>. After all there is much reason to believe that, by τουχριστου, here, of <i>Christ</i> or the <i>anointed</i>, the apostle means the whole body of the Israelitish or Hebrew people; for, as the word signifies the <i>anointed</i>, and anointing was a consecration to God, to serve him in some particular office, as prophet, priest, king, or the like, all the Hebrew people were considered thus <i>anointed</i> or <i>consecrated</i>; and it is worthy of remark that χριστος is used in this very sense by the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:35">1 Samuel 2:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:15">Psalms 105:15</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hab+3:13">Habakkuk 3:13</span>; where the word is necessarily restrained to this meaning.</p>
<p><i><b>He had respect unto the recompense</b></i> — απεβλεπε. He <i>looked</i> <i>attentively</i> to it; his eyes were <i>constantly directed</i> to it. This is the import of the original word; and the whole conduct of Moses was an illustration of it.</p>
