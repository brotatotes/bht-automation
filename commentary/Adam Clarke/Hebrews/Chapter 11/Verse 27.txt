<p>Verse 27. <i><b>He forsook Egypt</b></i> — He believed that God would fulfil the promise he had made; and he cheerfully changed an <i>earthly</i> for a <i>heavenly</i> portion.</p>
<p><i><b>Not fearing the wrath of the king</b></i> — The apostle speaks here of the departure of Moses <i>with the Israelites</i>, not of his <i>flight to</i> <i>Midian</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:14">Exodus 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:15">Exodus 2:15</span>; for he was then in great fear: but when he went to Pharaoh with God's authority, to demand the dismission of the Hebrews, he was without fear, and acted in the most noble and dignified manner; he then feared nothing but God.</p>
<p><i><b>As seeing him who is invisible.</b></i> — He continued to act as one who had the judge of his heart and conduct always before his eyes. By calling the Divine Being <i>the invisible</i>, the apostle distinguishes him from the <i>god's of Egypt</i>, who were <i>visible, corporeal, gross</i>, and <i>worthless</i>. The Israelites were worshippers of the <i>true God</i>, and this worship was not tolerated in Egypt. His pure and spiritual worship could never comport with the adoration of <i>oxen</i>, <i>goats, monkeys, leeks</i>, and <i>onions</i>.</p>
