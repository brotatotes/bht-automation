Verse 27. He forsook Egypt — He believed that God would fulfil the promise he had made; and he cheerfully changed an earthly for a heavenly portion.Not fearing the wrath of the king — The apostle speaks here of the departure of Moses with the Israelites, not of his flight to Midian, Exodus 2:14; Exodus 2:15; for he was then in great fear: but when he went to Pharaoh with God's authority, to demand the dismission of the Hebrews, he was without fear, and acted in the most noble and dignified manner; he then feared nothing but God.As seeing him who is invisible. — He continued to act as one who had the judge of his heart and conduct always before his eyes. By calling the Divine Being the invisible, the apostle distinguishes him from the god's of Egypt, who were visible, corporeal, gross, and worthless. The Israelites were worshippers of the true God, and this worship was not tolerated in Egypt. His pure and spiritual worship could never comport with the adoration of oxen, goats, monkeys, leeks, and onions.
