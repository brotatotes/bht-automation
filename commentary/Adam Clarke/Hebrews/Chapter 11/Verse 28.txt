<p>Verse 28. <i><b>He kept the passover</b></i> â€” God told him that he would destroy the first-born of the Egyptians, but would spare all those whose doors were <i>sprinkled with the blood</i> of the paschal lamb. Moses believed this, kept the passover, and <i>sprinkled the blood</i>. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:0">Exodus 12:0</span>. One of the Itala adds here, <i>Fide</i> <i>praedaverunt AEgyptios exeuntes</i>. "By faith, when they went out, they spoiled the Egyptians." This is any thing but <i>genuine</i>.</p>
