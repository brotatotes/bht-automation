Verse 28. He kept the passover â€” God told him that he would destroy the first-born of the Egyptians, but would spare all those whose doors were sprinkled with the blood of the paschal lamb. Moses believed this, kept the passover, and sprinkled the blood. See the notes on Exodus 12:0. One of the Itala adds here, Fide praedaverunt AEgyptios exeuntes. "By faith, when they went out, they spoiled the Egyptians." This is any thing but genuine.
