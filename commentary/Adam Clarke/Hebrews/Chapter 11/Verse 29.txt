Verse 29. By faith they passed through the Red Sea â€” See the notes on "Exodus 14:22". The Egyptians thought they could walk through the sea as well as the Israelites; they tried, and were drowned; while the former passed in perfect safety. The one walked by faith, the other by sight; one perished, the other was saved.
