<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span>. <i><b>Through faith we understand</b></i> — By <i>worlds</i>, τους αιωνας, we are to understand the <i>material fabric of the universe</i>; for αιων can have no reference here to age or any measurement of time, for he speaks of the <i>things which are</i> SEEN; <i>not being made out of the</i> <i>things which do</i> APPEAR; this therefore must refer to the <i>material</i> <i>creation</i>: and as the word is used in the <i>plural</i> number, it may comprehend, not only the earth and visible heavens, but the whole planetary system; the different worlds which, in our system at least, revolve round the sun. The apostle states that these things were <i>not made</i> out of a <i>pre-existent matter</i>; for if they were, that matter, however extended or <i>modified</i>, must <i>appear</i> in that thing into which it is compounded and modified, consequently it could not be said that the things which are <i>seen</i> are not made of the things that <i>appear</i>; and he shows us also, by these words, that the present mundane fabric was not formed or <i>reformed</i> from one anterior, as some suppose. According to Moses and the apostle we believe that God made all things out of <i>nothing</i>. <i>See the note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span><i>"</i>, c.</p>
<p>At present we see trees of different kinds are produced from trees beasts, birds, and fishes, from others of the same kind; and man, from man: but we are necessarily led to believe that there was a <i>first man</i>, who owed not his being to man; first there were <i>beasts</i>, c., which did not derive their being from others of the same kind and so of all manner of <i>trees, plants</i>, c. God, therefore, made all these out of <i>nothing</i> his word tells us so, and we credit that word.</p>
