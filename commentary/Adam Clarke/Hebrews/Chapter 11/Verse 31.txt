<p>Verse 31. <i><b>The harlot Rahab perished not</b></i> — See this account <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:1">Joshua 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:9">Joshua 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:11">Joshua 2:11</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:23">Joshua 6:23</span>, where it is rendered exceedingly probable that the word זונה <i>zonah</i> in Hebrew, and πορνη in Greek, which we translate <i>harlot</i>, should be rendered <i>innkeeper</i> or <i>tavernkeeper</i>, as there is no proper evidence that the person in question was such a woman as our translation represents her. As to her having been a <i>harlot</i> before and converted afterwards, it is a figment of an idle fancy. She was afterwards married to <i>Salmon</i>, a Jewish prince; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:5">Matthew 1:5</span>. And it is extremely incredible that, had she been what we represent her, he would have sought for such an alliance.</p>
<p><i><b>Received the spies with peace.</b></i> — Μετ' ειρηνης· The same as בשלום <i>beshalom</i>, giving them a <i>kind welcome, good fare</i>, and <i>protection</i>. After these words the <i>Slavonic</i> adds: Και ἑτερᾳ ὁδῳ εκβαλουσα, <i>and sent them out another way</i>.</p>
