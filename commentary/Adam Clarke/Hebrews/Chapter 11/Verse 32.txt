<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Time would fail me</b></i> — με διηγουμενον ο χρονος. A very usual mode of expression with the best Greek writers, when they wish to intimate that much important intelligence remains to be communicated on the subject already in hand, which must be omitted because of other points which have not yet been handled.</p>
<p><i><b>Gedeon</b></i> — Who by faith in God, with 300 men, destroyed a countless multitude of Midianites and Amalekites, and delivered Israel from oppression and slavery. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+6:0">Judges 6:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+7:0">Judges 7:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+8:0">Judges 8:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Barak</b></i> — Who overthrew Jabin, king of Canaan, and delivered Israel from servitude. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+4:0">Judges 4:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Samson</b></i> — Who was appointed by God to deliver Israel from the oppressive yoke of the <i>Philistines</i>; and, by extraordinary assistance, discomfited them on various occasions. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:0">Judges 13:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+14:0">Judges 14:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+15:0">Judges 15:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+16:0">Judges 16:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Jephthae</b></i> — Who, under the same guidance, defeated the Ammonites, and delivered Israel. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+11:0">Judges 11:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+12:0">Judges 12:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>David</b></i> — King of Israel, whose whole life was a life of faith and dependence on God; but whose character will be best seen in those books which contain an account of his reign, and the book of Psalms, to which, and the notes there, the reader must be referred. It is probable he is referred to here for that act of faith and courage which he showed in his combat with Goliah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:0">1 Samuel 17:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Samuel</b></i> — The last of the Israelitish <i>judges</i>, to whom succeeded a race of <i>kings</i>, of whom Saul and David were the two first, and were both anointed by this most eminent man. See his history in the <i>first</i> book of <i>Samuel</i>.</p>
<p>All these are said to have performed their various exploits <i>through faith</i>. </p>
<p>1. The faith of <i>Gideon</i> consisted in his throwing down the altar of Baal, and cutting down his grove, in obedience to the command of God. </p>
<p>2. The faith of <i>Barak</i> consisted in his believing the revelation made to Deborah, and the command to go against Jabin's numerous army. </p>
<p>3. <i>Samson's</i> faith consisted in his obeying the various impulses produced by the Spirit of God in his own mind. </p>
<p>4. <i>Jephthae's</i> faith consisted particularly in his believing the promise made to Abraham and his posterity, that they should possess the land of Canaan; and in his resolutely fighting against the Ammonites, that they might not deprive the Israelites of the land between Arnon and Jabbok.</p>
<p>It may be observed, here, that the apostle does not produce these in <i>chronological order</i>; for Barak lived before Gideon, and Jephthae before Samson, and Samuel before David. He was not producing facts in their chronological order, but instances of the power of God exerted in the behalf of men who had strong confidence in him.</p>
