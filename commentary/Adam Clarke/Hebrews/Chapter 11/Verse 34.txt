<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Quenched the violence of fire</b></i> — As in the case of the three faithful Hebrews, <i>Shadrach, Meshach</i>, and <i>Abed-nego</i>, who, for their steady attachment to God's worship, were cast into a fiery furnace, in which they were preserved, and from which they escaped unhurt. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+3:0">Daniel 3:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Escaped the edge of the sword</b></i> — Moses, who escaped the sword of Pharaoh, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+18:4">Exodus 18:4</span>; <i>Elijah</i>, that of Jezebel; and <i>David</i>, that of Saul: and many others.</p>
<p><i><b>Out of weakness were made strong</b></i> — Were miraculously restored from <i>sickness</i>, which seemed to threaten their life; as <i>Hezekiah</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+38:21">Isaiah 38:21</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Waxed valiant in fight</b></i> — Like <i>Gideon</i>, who overthrew the camp of the Midianites, and <i>Jonathan</i>, that of the Philistines, in such a way as must have proved that God was with them.</p>
