Verse 34. Quenched the violence of fire — As in the case of the three faithful Hebrews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who, for their steady attachment to God's worship, were cast into a fiery furnace, in which they were preserved, and from which they escaped unhurt. Daniel 3:0.Escaped the edge of the sword — Moses, who escaped the sword of Pharaoh, Exodus 18:4; Elijah, that of Jezebel; and David, that of Saul: and many others.Out of weakness were made strong — Were miraculously restored from sickness, which seemed to threaten their life; as Hezekiah, Isaiah 38:21.Waxed valiant in fight — Like Gideon, who overthrew the camp of the Midianites, and Jonathan, that of the Philistines, in such a way as must have proved that God was with them.
