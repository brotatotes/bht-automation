<p>Verse 35. <i><b>Women received their dead</b></i> — As did the widow of <i>Zarephath</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:21">1 Kings 17:21</span>, and the <i>Shunammite</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:34">2 Kings 4:34</span>. What other cases under all the above heads the apostle might have in view, we know not.</p>
<p><i><b>Others were tortured</b></i> — ετυμπανισθησαν. This is a word concerning the meaning of which the critics are not agreed. τυμπανον signifies a stick, or <i>baton</i>, which was used in <i>bastinadoing</i> criminals. And τυμπανιζω signifies to <i>beat</i> <i>violently</i>, and is thus explained by the best lexicographers. After considering what others have written on this subject, I am inclined to think that the <i>bastinado</i> on the <i>soles of the feet</i> is what is here designed. That this was a most torturing and dangerous punishment, we learn from the most authentic accounts; and it is practised among the <i>Turks</i> and other <i>Mohammedans</i> to the present day. Mr. <i>Antes</i>, of Fulnek, is Yorkshire, twenty years a resident in Egypt, furnishes the latest account I have met with; he himself was the unhappy subject of his own description. See at the end of this chapter, article 4. <i>See "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:40">Hebrews 11:40</span><i>"</i></p>
<p><i><b>Not accepting deliverance</b></i> — This looks very like a reference to the case of the mother and her seven sons, mentioned <i>2Mac 7:1</i>, &amp;c.</p>
