<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Had trial of</b></i><b> cruel </b><i><b>mockings and scourgings</b></i> — We do not know the cases to which the apostle refers. The <i>mockings</i> here can never mean such as those of Ishmael against Isaac, or the youths of Bethel against Elisha. It is more probable that it refers to public exhibitions of the people of God at idol feasts and the like; and Samson's case before Dagon, when the Philistines had put out his eyes, is quite in point. As to <i>scourgings</i>, this was a common way of punishing minor culprits: and even those who were to be punished <i>capitally</i> were first scourged. See the case of our Lord.</p>
