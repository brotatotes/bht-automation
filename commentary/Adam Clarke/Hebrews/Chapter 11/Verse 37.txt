<p>Verse 37. <i><b>They were stoned</b></i> — As Zechariah, the son of Barachiah or Jehoida, was, between the altar and the temple; see the account, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:21">2 Chronicles 24:21</span>; and <i>See the notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span><i>"</i>. And as Naboth the Jezreelite, who, on refusing to give up his father's inheritance to a covetous king, because it had respect to the promise of God, was falsely accused and stoned to death; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+21:1-14">1 Kings 21:1-14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>They were sawn asunder</b></i> — There is a tradition that the Prophet Isaiah was thus martyred. In <i>Yevamoth</i>, fol. 49, 2, it is thus written: "Manasseh slew Isaiah; for he commanded that he should be slain with a wooden saw. They then brought the saw, and cut him in two; and when the saw reached his mouth, his soul fled forth." St. Jerome and others mention the same thing; and among the Jews the tradition is indubitable.</p>
<p><i><b>Were tempted</b></i> — επειρασθησαν. I believe this word has vexed the critics more than any other in the New Testament. How being <i>tempted</i> can be ranked among the <i>heavy sufferings</i> of the primitive martyrs and confessors is not easy to discern, because <i>to be</i> <i>tempted</i> is the common lot of every godly man. This difficulty has induced learned men to mend the text by conjecture: Beza proposes επυρωθησαν, <i>they were branded</i>. Junius, Piscator, and others, propose επυρασθησαν, <i>they were burnt alive</i>. Gataker thinks επρησθησαν, a word of the same import, should be preferred. Tanaquil Faber gives the preference to επηρωθησαν, <i>they were</i> <i>mutilated </i>- had different parts of their bodies <i>lopped off</i>. Sir <i>Norton Knatchbull</i> contends for επαρτησαν, <i>they were transfixed</i>, or <i>pierced through</i>. Alberti thinks the original reading was εσπειρασθησαν, <i>they were strangled</i>. About as many more differences have been proposed by learned men, all hearing a very clear resemblance to the words now found in the Greek text. By three MSS. the word is entirely <i>omitted</i>; as also by the <i>Syriac</i>, <i>Arabic</i> of Erpen, the <i>AEthiopic</i>, and by <i>Eusebius</i> and <i>Theophylact</i>. Of all the conjectures, that of <i>Knatchbull</i> appears to me to be the most probable: <i>they were transfixed</i> or <i>impaled</i>; and even the present reading might be construed in this sense.</p>
<p><i><b>Were slain with the sword</b></i> — As in the case of the eighty-five priests slain by Doeg, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+22:18">1 Samuel 22:18</span>; and the <i>prophets</i>, of whose slaughter by the sword Elijah complains, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:10">1 Kings 19:10</span>. Probably the word means being <i>beheaded</i>, which was formerly done with a <i>sword</i>, and not with an axe; and in the east is done by the sword to the present day.</p>
<p><i><b>They wandered about in sheepskins</b></i> — μηλωταις <i>Sheepskins dressed</i> <i>with the wool on</i>. This was probably the sort of mantle that Elijah wore, and which was afterwards used by Elisha; for the Septuagint, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:8-13">2 Kings 2:8-13</span>, expressly say: Και ελαβεν Ἡλιας την μηλωτην αὑτου· <i>and Elijah took his</i> SHEEPSKIN (mantle.) Και ὑψωσε την μηλωτην Ἡλιου, ἡ επεσεν επανωθεν αὑτου· <i>And he</i> (Elisha) <i>took</i> <i>the</i> SHEEPSKIN <i>of Elijah which had fallen from off him</i>. It was most probably on this account, as Dr. Macknight conjectures, that Elijah was called a <i>hairy man</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:8">2 Kings 1:8</span>; and not on account of having a preposterously <i>long beard</i>, as those marrers of all the unities of time, place, circumstances, and common sense, the <i>painters</i>, represent him. And it is likely that the prophets themselves wore such garments, and that the false prophets imitated them in this, in order that they might gain the greater credit. <i>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets</i> <i>shall be ashamed every one of his vision-neither shall they wear a</i> <i>rough garment to deceive</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:4">Zechariah 13:4</span>; δερριντριχινην, a <i>hairy skin</i>, SEPT., probably the <i>goatskins</i> mentioned above. In general, this was an <i>upper garment</i>; but, in the cases to which the apostle alludes, the <i>sheepskin</i> and <i>goatskin</i> seem to have been the <i>only covering</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Being destitute</b></i> — υστερουμενοι. <i>In want</i> of all the <i>comforts</i> and <i>conveniences</i> of life, and often of its <i>necessaries</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Afflicted</b></i> — In consequence of enduring such privations.</p>
<p><i><b>Tormented</b></i> — κακουχουμενοι. <i>Maltreated, harassed</i>, variously persecuted by those to whom they brought the message of salvation.</p>
