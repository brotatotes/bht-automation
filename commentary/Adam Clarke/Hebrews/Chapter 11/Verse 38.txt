<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Of whom the world was not worthy</b></i> â€” Yet they were obliged to wander by day in <i>deserts</i> and <i>mountains</i>, driven from the society of men, and often obliged to hide by night in dens and caves of the earth, to conceal themselves from the brutal rage of men. Perhaps he refers here principally to the case of Elijah, and the hundred prophets hidden in caves by Obadiah, and fed with bread and water.

David was often obliged thus to hide himself from Saul; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:3">1 Samuel 24:3</span>, &amp;c.</p>
