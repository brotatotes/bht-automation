Verse 39. Having obtained a good report (having been witnessed to; see Hebrews 11:2) through faith — It was faith in God which supported all those eminent men who, in different parts of the world, and in different ages, were persecuted for righteousness sake.Received not the promise — They all heard of the promises made to Abraham of a heavenly rest, and of the promise of the Messiah, for this was a constant tradition; but they died without having seen this Anointed of the Lord. Christ was not in any of their times manifested in the flesh; and of him who was the expectation of all nations, they heard only by the hearing of the ear. This must be the promise, without receiving of which the apostle says they died.
