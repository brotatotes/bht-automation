<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:4">Hebrews 11:4</span>. <i><b>By faith Abel offered - a more excellent sacrifice</b></i> — πλειονα θυσιαν. <i>More sacrifice</i>; as if he had said: Abel, by faith, made <i>more</i> than <i>one</i> offering; and hence it is said, God testified of his GIFTS, τοιςδωροις. The plain state of the case seems to have been this: Cain and Abel both brought offerings to the altar of God, probably the altar erected for the <i>family</i> <i>worship</i>. As Cain was a <i>husbandman</i>, he brought a <i>mincha</i>, or <i>eucharistic offering</i>, of the fruits of the ground, by which he acknowledged the being and providence of God. Abel, being a <i>shepherd</i> or a feeder of cattle, brought, not only the <i>eucharistic</i> <i>offering</i>, but also of the produce of his flock as a <i>sin-offering</i> to God, by which he acknowledged his own <i>sinfulness</i>, God's <i>justice</i> and <i>mercy</i>, as well as his <i>being</i> and <i>providence</i>. Cain, not at all apprehensive of the demerit of sin, or God's holiness, contented himself with the <i>mincha</i>, or <i>thank-offering</i>: this God could not, consistently with his holiness and justice, receive with complacency; the other, as referring to him who was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, God could receive, and did particularly testify his approbation. Though the <i>mincha</i>, or <i>eucharistic offering</i>, was a very proper offering in its place, yet this was not received, because there was no <i>sin-offering</i>. The rest of the history is well known.</p>
<p>Now by this faith, thus exercised, in reference to an atonement, he, Abel, <i>though dead, yet speaketh</i>; i.e. preacheth to mankind the necessity of an atonement, and that God will accept no sacrifice unless connected with this. <i>See this transaction explained at large in my notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:3">Genesis 4:3</span><i>"</i>, &amp;c.</p>
