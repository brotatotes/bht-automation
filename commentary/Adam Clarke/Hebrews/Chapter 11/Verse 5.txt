<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>. <i><b>By faith Enoch was translated</b></i> â€” It is said, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:24">Genesis 5:24</span>, that Enoch walked with God, and <i>he was not, for God took him</i>. Here the apostle explains what God's taking him means, by saying that <i>he was translated that he should not see death</i>; from which we learn that he did not die, and that God took him to a state of blessedness without obliging him to pass through death. See his history explained at large in the above place, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:22-24">Genesis 5:22-24</span>.</p>
