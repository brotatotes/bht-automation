<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span>. <i><b>He that cometh to God</b></i> â€” The man who professes that it is his duty to worship God, must, if he act rationally, do it on the conviction that there is such a Being infinite, eternal, unoriginated, and self-existent; the cause of all other being; on whom all being depends; and by whose energy, bounty, and providence, all other beings exist, live, and are supplied with the means of continued existence and life. He must believe, also, that he rewards them that diligently seek him; that he is not indifferent about his own worship; that he <i>requires</i> adoration and religious service from men; and that he blesses, and especially protects and saves, those who in simplicity and uprightness of heart seek and serve him. This requires <i>faith</i>, such a faith as is mentioned above; a faith by which we can <i>please God</i>; and now that we have an abundant revelation, a faith <i>according</i> to that revelation; a faith in God through Christ the great sin-offering, without which a man can no more please him, or be accepted of him, than Cain was. As the knowledge of the being of God is of infinite importance in religion, I shall introduce at the end of this chapter a series of propositions, tending to prove the being of God, 1st, <i>a priori</i>; and 2dly, <i>a posteriori</i>; omitting the proofs that are generally produced on those points, for which my readers may refer to works in general circulation on this subject: and 3dly, I shall lay down some <i>phenomena</i> relative to the heavenly bodies, which it will be difficult to account for without acknowledging the infinite skill, power, and <i>continual energy</i> of God.</p>
