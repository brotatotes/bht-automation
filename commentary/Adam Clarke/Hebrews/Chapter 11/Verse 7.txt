<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>. <i><b>By faith Noah</b></i> — See the whole of this history, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:13">Genesis 6:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Warned of God</b></i> — ξρηματισθεις. As we know from the history in Genesis that <i>God</i> did warn Noah, we see from this the real import of the verb χρηματιζω, as used in various parts of the New Testament; it signifies to <i>utter oracles</i>, to <i>give Divine warning</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Moved with fear</b></i> — ευλαβηθεις. Influenced by <i>religious fear</i> or <i>reverence towards God</i>. This is mentioned to show that he acted not from a fear of losing his life, but from the fear of God; and hence that fear is here properly attributed to faith.</p>
<p><i><b>He condemned the world</b></i> — HE credited God, <i>they</i> did not; <i>he</i> walked in the way God had commanded, <i>they</i> did not; <i>he</i> repeatedly admonished them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20">1 Peter 3:20</span>, <i>they</i> regarded it not; this aggravated their crimes while it exalted his faith and righteousness. "His faith and obedience condemned the world, i.e. the <i>unbelievers</i>, in the same sense in which every good man's virtues and exhortations condemn such as will not attend to and imitate them." <i>Dodd</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Became heir of the righteousness</b></i> — He became entitled to that justification which is by faith; and his temporal deliverance was a pledge of the salvation of his soul.</p>
