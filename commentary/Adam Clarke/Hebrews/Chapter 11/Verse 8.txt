<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:8">Hebrews 11:8</span>. <i><b>Abraham, when he was called</b></i> — See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1-4">Genesis 12:1-4</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Not knowing whither he went.</b></i> — Therefore his <i>obedience</i> was the fullest proof of his <i>faith</i> in God, and his faith was an <i>implicit</i> faith; he obeyed, and went out from his own country, having no prospect of any good or success but what his implicit faith led him to expect from God, <i>as the rewarder of them that diligently</i> <i>seek him</i>. In all the preceding cases, and in all that follow, the apostle keeps this maxim fully in view.</p>
