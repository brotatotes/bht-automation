<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:9">Hebrews 11:9</span>. <i><b>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise</b></i> â€” It is remarkable that Abraham did not acquire any right in Canaan, except that of a <i>burying place</i>; nor did he build any house in it; his faith showed him that it was only a <i>type</i> and <i>pledge</i> of a better country, and he kept that better country continually in view: he, with Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs of the same promise, were contented to dwell in tents, without any <i>fixed</i> habitation.</p>
