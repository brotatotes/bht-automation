<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>. <i><b>Wherefore</b></i> — This is an inference drawn from the examples produced in the preceding chapter, and on this account both should be read in connection.</p>
<p><i><b>Compassed about</b></i> — Here is another allusion to the <i>Olympic games</i>: the <i>agonistae</i>, or contenders, were often greatly animated by the consideration that the eyes of the <i>principal men</i> of their country were fixed upon them; and by this they were induced to make the most extraordinary exertions.</p>
<p><i><b>Cloud of witnesses</b></i> — νεφος μαρτυρων. Both the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latins</i> frequently use the term <i>cloud</i>, to express a <i>great number</i> of persons or things; so in <i>Euripides</i>, Phoeniss. ver. 257: νεφος ασπιδων πυκνον, a <i>dense cloud of shields</i>; and <i>Statius</i>, Thebiad., lib. ix., ver. 120: <i>jaculantum nubes</i>, a cloud of spearmen. The same metaphor frequently occurs.</p>
<p><i><b>Let us lay aside every weight</b></i> — As those who ran in the Olympic races would throw aside every thing that might impede them in their course; so Christians, professing to go to heaven, must throw aside every thing that might hinder them in their Christian race. Whatever weighs down our hearts or affections to earth and sense is to be carefully avoided; for no man, with the love of the world in his heart, can ever reach the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>The sin which doth so easily beset</b></i> — ευπεριστατον αμαρτιαν. <i>The</i> <i>well circumstanced sin</i>; that which has every thing in its favour, <i>time</i>, and <i>place</i>, and <i>opportunity</i>; the <i>heart</i> and the <i>object;</i> and a sin in which all these things frequently occur, and consequently the transgression is frequently committed. ευπεριστατος is derived from ευ, <i>well</i>, περι, <i>about</i>, and ιστημι <i>I stand</i>; the sin that stands well, or is favourably situated, ever surrounding the person and soliciting his acquiescence. What <i>we</i> term the <i>easily besetting sin</i> is the sin of our constitution, the sin of our trade, that in which our worldly honour, secular profit, and sensual gratification are most frequently felt and consulted. Some understand it of <i>original</i> <i>sin</i>, as that by which we are enveloped in body, soul, and spirit. Whatever it may be, the word gives us to understand that it is what meets us at every turn; that it is always presenting itself to us; that as a pair of compasses describe a circle by the revolution of one leg, while the other is at rest in the centre, so this, springing from that point of corruption within, called the <i>carnal mind</i>, surrounds us in every place; we are <i>bounded</i> by it, and often hemmed in on every side; it is a circular, well fortified wall, over which we must leap, or through which we must break. The man who is addicted to a particular species of sin (for every sinner has <i>his way</i>) is represented as a prisoner in this strong fortress.</p>
<p>In laying aside the weight, there is an allusion to the long garments worn in the eastern countries, which, if not laid aside or tucked up in the girdle, would greatly incommode the traveller, and utterly prevent a man from running a race. The easily besetting sin of the Hebrews was an aptness to be drawn aside from their attachment to the Gospel, for fear of persecution.</p>
<p><i><b>Let us run with patience the race</b></i> — Τρεχωμεν τον προκειμενον ἡμιν αγωνα· Let us <i>start, run on</i>, and <i>continue running</i>, till we get to the goal. This figure is a favourite among the Greek writers; so <i>Euripides</i>, Alcest,, ver. 489: Ου τον δ' αγωνα πρωτον αν δραμοιμ' εγω· <i>This is not the first race that I shall run</i>. Id. Iphig. in Aulid., ver. 1456: Δεινους αγωνας δια σε κεινον δει δραμειν· <i>He must run a hard race for thee</i>. This is a race which is of infinite moment to us: the prize is ineffably great; and, if we lose it, it is not a simple loss, for the whole soul perishes.</p>
