<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:10">Hebrews 12:10</span>. <i><b>For - a few days</b></i> â€” The chastisement of our earthly parents lasted only a <i>short time</i>; that of our heavenly Father will also be but a <i>short time</i>, if we submit: and as our parents ceased to correct when we learned obedience; so will our heavenly Father when the end for which he sent the chastisement is accomplished. God delights not in the rod; judgment is his strange work.</p>
