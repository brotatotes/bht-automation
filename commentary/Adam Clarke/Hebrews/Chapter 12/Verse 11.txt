<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11">Hebrews 12:11</span>. <i><b>No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous</b></i> — Neither correction, wholesome restraint, domestic regulations, nor gymnastic discipline, are pleasant to them that are thus exercised; but it is by these means that <i>obedient children</i>, <i>scholars</i>, and <i>great men</i> are made. And it is by God's discipline that <i>Christians</i> are made. He who does not bear the yoke of Christ is good for nothing to others, and never gains rest to his own soul.</p>
<p><i><b>The peaceable fruit of righteousness</b></i> — <i>i.e.</i> The joyous, prosperous fruits; those fruits by which we gain much, and through which we are made happy.</p>
<p><i><b>Exercised thereby.</b></i> — γεγυμνασμενοις. <i>To the trained</i>. There is still an allusion to the Grecian games; and in the word before us to those <i>gymnastic exercises</i> by which the candidates for the prizes were trained to the different kinds of exercises in which they were to contend when the games were publicly opened.</p>
