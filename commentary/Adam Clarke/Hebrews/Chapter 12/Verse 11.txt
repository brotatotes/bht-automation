Verse Hebrews 12:11. No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous — Neither correction, wholesome restraint, domestic regulations, nor gymnastic discipline, are pleasant to them that are thus exercised; but it is by these means that obedient children, scholars, and great men are made. And it is by God's discipline that Christians are made. He who does not bear the yoke of Christ is good for nothing to others, and never gains rest to his own soul.The peaceable fruit of righteousness — i.e. The joyous, prosperous fruits; those fruits by which we gain much, and through which we are made happy.Exercised thereby. — γεγυμνασμενοις. To the trained. There is still an allusion to the Grecian games; and in the word before us to those gymnastic exercises by which the candidates for the prizes were trained to the different kinds of exercises in which they were to contend when the games were publicly opened.
