<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13">Hebrews 12:13</span>. <i><b>Make straight paths for your feet</b></i> — That is, Take the straight path that is before you, do not go in crooked or rough ways, where are stones, briers, and thorns, by which you will be inevitably lamed, and so totally prevented from proceeding in the way; whereas, if you go in the even, proper path, though you have been wounded by getting into a wrong way, that which was wounded will <i>be healed</i> by moderate, equal exercise, all impediments being removed. The application of all this to a correct, holy deportment in religious life, is both natural and easy.</p>
