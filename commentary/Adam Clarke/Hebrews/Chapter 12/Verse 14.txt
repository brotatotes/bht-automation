<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Follow peace with all men</b></i> — Cultivate, as far as you possibly can, a good understanding, both with Jews and Gentiles. ειρηνηνδιωκετε, pursue peace with the same care, attention, and diligence, as <i>beasts</i> do their <i>game</i>; follow it through all places; trace it through all winding circumstances; and have it with all men, if you can with a safe conscience.</p>
<p><i><b>And holiness</b></i> — τον αγιασμον. That state of continual <i>sanctification</i>, that life of <i>purity</i> and <i>detachment</i> from the <i>world</i> and all its lusts, without which detachment and sanctity <i>no</i> <i>man shall see the Lord</i>-shall never enjoy his presence in the world of blessedness. <i>To see God</i>, in the Hebrew phrase, is to <i>enjoy</i> <i>him</i>; and without holiness of heart and life this is impossible. No soul can be fit for heaven that has not suitable dispositions for the place.</p>
