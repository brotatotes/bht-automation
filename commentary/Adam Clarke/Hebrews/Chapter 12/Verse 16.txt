<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Lest there</b></i> be <i>any fornicator</i>] Any licentious person who would turn the Gospel of the grace of God into lasciviousness.</p>
<p><i><b>Or profane person, as Esau</b></i> — It is not intimated that Esau was a <i>fornicator</i>; and the disjunctive η, <i>or</i>, separates the <i>profane</i> <i>person</i> from the <i>fornicator</i>. And Esau is here termed <i>profane</i>, because he so far disregarded the spiritual advantages connected with his rights of primogeniture, that he alienated the whole for a single mess of pottage. <i>See the note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:34">Genesis 25:34</span><i>"</i>. The word βεβηλος, which we translate <i>profane</i>, is compounded of βε, which in composition has a <i>negative</i> signification, and βηλος, <i>the</i> <i>threshold of a temple</i> or <i>sacred edifice</i>; and was applied to those who were not <i>initiated</i> into the sacred mysteries, or who were <i>despisers</i> of <i>sacred things</i>, and consequently were to be denied <i>admittance</i> to the <i>temple</i>, and were not permitted to <i>assist at holy</i> <i>rites</i>. Indeed, among the Greeks βεβηλος signified any thing or person which was <i>not consecrated to the gods</i>. Hence, in the opening of their worship, they were accustomed to proclaim, </p>
<p><i><b>Sold his birthright.</b></i> — <i>The first-born</i>, in patriarchal times,</p>
<p>1. Had a right to the priesthood, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:29">Exodus 22:29</span>. </p>
<p>2. And a double portion of all the father's possessions, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+21:17">Deuteronomy 21:17</span>. </p>
<p>3. And was <i>lord over his brethren</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:29">Genesis 27:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:37">Genesis 27:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:3">Genesis 49:3</span>. </p>
<p>4. And in the family of Abraham the first-born was the very source whence the Messiah as the Redeemer of the world, and the Church of God, were to spring. Farther,</p>
<p>5. The first-born had the right of conveying especial blessings and privileges when he came to die. See the case of Isaac and his two sons, Jacob and Esau, in the history to which the apostle alludes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:0">Genesis 27:0</span>; and that of Jacob and his twelve sons, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:0">Genesis 49:0</span>;</p>
<p>In short, the rights of primogeniture were among the most noble, honourable, and spiritual in the ancient world.</p>
