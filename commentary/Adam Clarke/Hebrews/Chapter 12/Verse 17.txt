<p>Verse 17. <i><b>When he would have inherited the blessing</b></i> — When he wished to have <i>the lordship over the whole family conveyed to him</i>, and sought it earnestly with tears, he found no place for a <i>change</i> in his <i>father's mind</i> and counsel, who now perceived that it was the will of God that Jacob should be made <i>lord of all</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Repentance</b></i> — Here μετανοια is not to be taken in a theological sense, as implying <i>contrition</i> for sin, but merely <i>change of mind</i> or <i>purpose</i>; nor does the word refer here to <i>Esau</i> at all, but to his <i>father</i>, whom Esau could not, with all his tears and entreaties, persuade to reverse what he had done. <i>I have blessed</i> <i>him</i>, said he, <i>yea, and he must be blessed</i>; I cannot reverse it now. See the whole of this transaction largely considered and explained, <i>See the notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:29">Genesis 25:29</span><i>"</i>, c., and <i>See "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:1">Genesis 27:1</span><i>"</i>, &amp;c. Nothing spoken here by the apostle, nor in the history in Genesis to which he refers, concerns the <i>eternal</i> state of either of the two brothers. The use made of the transaction by the apostle is of great importance: Take heed lest, by apostatizing from the Gospel, ye forfeit all right and title to the heavenly birthright, and never again be able to retrieve it because they who reject the Gospel reject the only means of salvation.</p>
