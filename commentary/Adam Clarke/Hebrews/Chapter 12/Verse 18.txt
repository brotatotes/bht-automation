<p>Verse 18. - 21. <i><b>For ye are not come unto the mount that might</b></i><b> </b><i><b>be touched</b></i> — I believe the words ψηλαφωμενωορει should be translated <i>to a palpable</i> or <i>material mountain</i>; for that it was not a mountain that on this occasion <i>might be touched</i>, the history, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:12">Exodus 19:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:13">Exodus 19:13</span>, shows; and the apostle himself, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:20">Hebrews 12:20</span>, confirms. It is called here a <i>palpable</i> or <i>material</i> mount, to distinguish it from that <i>spiritual mount</i> Sion, of which the apostle is speaking. Some contend that it should be translated <i>tacto de caelo</i>, thunder-struck; this sense would agree well enough with the scope of the place. The apostle's design is to show that the dispensation of the law engendered terror; that it was most awful and exclusive; that it belonged only to the Jewish people; and that, even to them, it was so terrible that they <i>could not</i> <i>endure that which was commanded</i>, and entreated that God would not communicate with them in his own person, but by the ministry of Moses: and even to Moses, who held the highest intimacy with Jehovah, the revealed glories, the burning fire, the blackness, the darkness, the tempest, the loud-sounding trumpet, and the voice of words, were so terrible that he said, <i>I exceedingly fear</i> <i>and tremble</i>.</p>
<p>These were the things which were exhibited on that <i>material</i> mountain; but the Gospel dispensation is one grand, copious, and interesting display of the infinite love of God. It is all encouragement; breathes nothing but mercy; is not an exclusive system; embraces the whole human race; has Jesus, the sinner's friend, for its mediator; is ratified by his blood; and is suited, most gloriously suited, to all the wants and wishes of every soul of man.</p>
