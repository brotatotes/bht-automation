<p>Verse 24. <i><b>And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant</b></i> — The old covenant and its mediator, Moses, are passed away. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:13">Hebrews 8:13</span>. The new covenant, i.e. the Gospel, is now in force, and will be to the end of the world; and Jesus, the Son of God, the brightness of the Father's glory, the Maker and Preserver of all things, the Saviour and the Judge of all men, is its mediator. Both the covenant and its mediator are infinitely superior to those of the Jews, and they are very properly set down here among the superior benefits and glories of Christianity.</p>
<p><i><b>To the blood of sprinkling</b></i> — This is an allusion, as was before observed, to the sprinkling of the blood of the covenant sacrifice upon the people, when that covenant was made upon Mount Sinai; to the sprinkling of the blood of the sin-offerings before the mercy-seat; and probably to the sprinkling of the blood of the paschal lamb on their houses, to prevent their destruction by the destroying angel. But all these sprinklings were <i>partial</i> and inefficacious, and had no meaning but as they referred to this: the blood of sprinkling under the new covenant is ever ready; all may have it applied; it continues through ages; and is the highest glory of Christianity, because by it we draw nigh to God, and through it get our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience; and, in a word, have an entrance unto the holiest by the blood of Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>Better things than</b></i><b> that of </b><i><b>Abel.</b></i> — God accepted Abel's sacrifice, and, was well pleased with it; for Abel was a righteous man, and offered his sacrifice by <i>faith</i> in the great promise. But the blood of Christ's sacrifice was infinitely more precious than the blood of Abel's sacrifice, as Jesus is infinitely greater than Abel; and the blood of Christ avails for the sins of the <i>whole</i> <i>world</i>, whereas the blood of Abel's sacrifice could avail only for <i>himself</i>.</p>
<p>Many have supposed that the <i>blood of Abel</i> means here the blood that was shed by Cain in the murder of this holy man, and that the blood of Jesus <i>speaks better things than it does</i>, because the blood of Abel <i>called for vengeance</i>, but the blood of Christ <i>for</i> <i>pardon</i>; this interpretation reflects little credit on the understanding of the apostle. To say that the blood of Christ <i>spoke better things than that of Abel</i> is saying little indeed; it might speak very little good to any soul of man, and yet speak <i>better things</i> than <i>that</i> blood of Abel which spoke no kind of good to any human creature, and only called for vengeance against him that shed it. The truth is, the <i>sacrifice</i> offered by Abel is that which is intended; that, as we have already seen, was pleasing in the sight of God, and was accepted in behalf of him who offered it: but the blood of Christ is infinitely more acceptable with God; it was shed for the whole human race, and cleanses all who believe from all unrighteousness.</p>
