<p>Verse 25. <i><b>See</b></i> — βλεπετε. <i>Take heed, that ye refuse not him </i>- the Lord Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant, who now speaketh <i>from heaven</i>, by his Gospel, to the Jews and to the Gentiles, having in his incarnation come down from God.</p>
<p><i><b>Him that spake on earth</b></i> — Moses, who spoke on the part of God to the Hebrews, every transgression of whose word received a just recompense of reward, none being permitted to <i>escape</i> punishment; consequently, if ye turn away from Christ, who speaks to you from heaven, you may expect a much sorer punishment, the offence against God being so much the more heinous, as the privileges slighted are more important and glorious.</p>
