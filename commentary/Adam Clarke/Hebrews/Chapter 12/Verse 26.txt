<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Whose voice then shook the earth</b></i> — Namely, at the giving of the law on Mount Sinai; and from this it seems that it was the voice of <i>Jesus</i> that then shook the earth, and that it was he who came down on the mount. But others refer this simply to God the Father giving the law.</p>
<p><i><b>Not the earth only, but also heaven.</b></i> — Probably referring to the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, and the total abolition of the political and ecclesiastical constitution of the Jews; the one being signified by the <i>earth</i>, the other by <i>heaven</i>; for the Jewish state and worship are frequently thus termed in the prophetic writings. And this seems to be the apostle's meaning, as he evidently refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hag+2:6">Haggai 2:6</span>, where this event is predicted. It may also remotely refer to the final dissolution of all things.</p>
