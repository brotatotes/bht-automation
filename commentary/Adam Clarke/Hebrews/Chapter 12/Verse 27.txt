<p>Verse 27. <i><b>The removing of those things that are shaken</b></i> — The whole of the <i>Jewish polity</i>, which had been in a <i>shaken state</i> from the time that Judea had fallen under the power of the Romans.</p>
<p><i><b>As of things that are made</b></i> — That is, subjects intended to last only for a time. God never designed that the Jewish religion should become general, nor be permanent.</p>
<p><i><b>Those things which cannot be shaken</b></i> — The whole <i>Gospel system</i>, which cannot be <i>moved</i> by the power of man.</p>
<p><i><b>May remain.</b></i> — Be permanent; God designing that this shall be the <i>last dispensation</i> of his grace and mercy, and that it shall continue till the earth and the heavens are no more.</p>
