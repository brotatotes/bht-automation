Verse 27. The removing of those things that are shaken — The whole of the Jewish polity, which had been in a shaken state from the time that Judea had fallen under the power of the Romans.As of things that are made — That is, subjects intended to last only for a time. God never designed that the Jewish religion should become general, nor be permanent.Those things which cannot be shaken — The whole Gospel system, which cannot be moved by the power of man.May remain. — Be permanent; God designing that this shall be the last dispensation of his grace and mercy, and that it shall continue till the earth and the heavens are no more.
