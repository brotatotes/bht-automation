<p>Verse 28. <i><b>We receiving a kingdom</b></i> — The Gospel dispensation, frequently termed the <i>kingdom of God</i> and the <i>kingdom of heaven</i>, because in it God reigns among men, and he reigns in the hearts of them that believe, and his kingdom is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><i><b>Which cannot be moved</b></i> — Which never can fail, because it is the last dispensation.</p>
<p><i><b>Let us have grace</b></i> — εξωμεν χαριν. <i>Let us have, keep</i>, or <i>hold</i> <i>fast, the benefit</i> or <i>gift</i>, that is, the heavenly kingdom which God has given us. This is the meaning of the word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span>, and is so rendered by our translators; and it is only by this <i>heavenly</i> <i>gift</i> of the Gospel that we can serve God acceptably, for he can be pleased with no service that is not performed according to the Gospel of his Son.</p>
<p>If we prefer the common meaning of the word <i>grace</i> it comes to the same thing; without the <i>grace </i>- the especial <i>succour</i> and <i>influence of Christ</i>, we cannot serve, λατρευωμεν, pay religious worship to God; for he receives no <i>burnt-offering</i> that is not kindled by fire from his own altar.</p>
<p><i><b>Acceptably</b></i> — ευαρεστως. In such a way as to <i>please</i> him well. And the offering, with which he is <i>well pleased</i>, he will <i>graciously accept</i>; and if he accept our service, his Spirit will testify in our conscience that our ways please him. When <i>Abel</i> sacrifices, God is well pleased; where <i>Cain</i> offers, there is no approbation.</p>
<p><i><b>Reverence</b></i> — αιδους. With <i>shamefacedness</i> or <i>modesty</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Godly fear</b></i> — ευλαβειας. <i>Religious fear</i>. We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, but let that boldness be ever tempered with <i>modesty</i> and <i>religious fear</i>; for we should never forget that <i>we have sinned</i>, and that <i>God is a</i> <i>consuming fire</i>. Instead of αιδους και ευλαβειας, <i>modesty</i> and <i>religious fear</i>, ACD*, several others, with the Slavonic and Chrysostom, have ευλαβειας και δεους, and others have ψοβου και τρομου, <i>fear and trembling</i>; but the sense is nearly the same.</p>
