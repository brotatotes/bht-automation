<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:3">Hebrews 12:3</span>. <i><b>For consider him</b></i> — Αναλογισασθε - ἱνα μη καμητε, ταις ψυχαις - εκλυμενοι· Attentively observe and analyze every part of his conduct, enter into his spirit, examine his motives and object, and remember that, as he acted, ye are called to act; he will furnish you with the same Spirit, and will support you with the same strength. He bore a continual opposition of sinners against himself; but he conquered by meekness, patience, and perseverance: he has left you an example that ye should follow his steps. If ye trust in him, ye shall receive strength; therefore, howsoever great your opposition may be, ye shall not <i>be weary</i>: if ye confide in and attentively look to him, ye shall have continual <i>courage</i> to go on, and never <i>faint</i> in your minds.</p>
<p>Here is a continued allusion to the contenders in the Grecian games, who, when exhausted in bodily strength and courage, yielded the palm to their opponents, and were said καμνειν, to be weary or exhausted; εκλυεσθαι, to be dissolved, disheartened, or to have lost all bravery and courage.</p>
