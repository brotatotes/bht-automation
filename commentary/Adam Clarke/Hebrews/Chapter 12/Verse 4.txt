Though you have had opposition and persecution, yet you have not been called, in bearing your testimony against sin and sinners, to seal the truth with your blood.</p>
<p><i><b>Striving against sin.</b></i> — Προς την ἁμαρτιαν ανταγωνι ζομενοι· An allusion to <i>boxing</i> at the Grecian games. In the former passages the apostle principally refers to the foot races.</p>
