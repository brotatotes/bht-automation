<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>. <i><b>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth</b></i> — Here is the <i>reason</i> why we should neither <i>neglect</i> correction, nor <i>faint</i> under it: it is a proof of the fatherly love of God Almighty, and shows his most gracious designs towards us; from which we may be fully convinced that the affliction will prove the means of good to our souls, if we make a proper use of it.</p>
<p><i><b>And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</b></i> — Μαστιγοι δε παντα υἱον, ὁν παραδεχεται. This is a quotation, literatim from the Septuagint, of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:12">Proverbs 3:12</span>, of which place our version is: <i>Even as the father the son</i> in whom <i>he delighteth</i>. But, howsoever near this may appear to be the Hebrew, it bears scarcely any affinity to the apostle's words. The Hebrew text is as follows: וכאב את־בן ירצה <i>uchab eth-ben yirtseh</i>. Now, וכאב may be a <i>noun</i>, compounded of the conjunction ו <i>vau</i>, "and," the <i>comparative</i> particle כ <i>ke</i>, "as" or "like;" and אב <i>ab</i>, "a father:" or it may be the third person preterite kal of כאב <i>caab</i>, "he spoiled, wasted, marred, ulcerated," compounded with the conjunction ו <i>vau</i>, "and." And in this sense the <i>Septuagint</i> most evidently understood it; and it is so understood by the <i>Arabic</i>; and both readings seem to be combined by the <i>Syriac</i> and <i>Chaldee</i> versions. And as to רצה <i>ratsah</i>, one of its prime meanings is to <i>accept</i>, to receive <i>graciously</i>, to <i>take into favour</i>; the translation, therefore, of the Septuagint and apostle is perfectly consonant to the Hebrew text, and our version of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:12">Proverbs 3:12</span> is wrong.</p>
