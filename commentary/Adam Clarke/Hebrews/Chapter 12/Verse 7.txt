<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:7">Hebrews 12:7</span>. <i><b>If ye endure chastening</b></i> — If ye submit to his authority, humble yourselves under his hand, and pray for his blessing, you will find that he deals with you as beloved children, correcting you that he may make you partakers of his holiness.</p>
<p><i><b>God dealeth with you as with sons</b></i> — He acknowledges by this that you belong to the <i>family</i>, and that he, as your <i>Father</i>, has you under proper discipline. It is a maxim among the Jewish rabbins that "the love which is not conjoined with reproof is not genuine."</p>
