<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:8">Hebrews 12:8</span>. <i><b>Then are ye bastards</b></i> — This proceeds on the general fact, that <i>bastards</i> are neglected in their manners and education; the fathers of such, feeling little affection for, or obligation to regard, their spurious issue. But <i>all</i> that are legitimate children <i>are partakers</i> of chastisement or discipline; for the original word παιδεια does not imply <i>stripes</i> and <i>punishments</i>, but the whole discipline of a child, both at home and at school.</p>
