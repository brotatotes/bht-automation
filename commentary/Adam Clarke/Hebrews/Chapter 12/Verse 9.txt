<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:9">Hebrews 12:9</span>. <i><b>We have had fathers of our flesh</b></i> â€” The fathers of our flesh, i.e. our natural parents, were correctors; and we reverenced them, notwithstanding their corrections often arose from whim or caprice: but <i>shall we not rather be in subjection to</i> <i>the Father of spirits</i>; to him from whom we have received both body and soul; who is our Creator, Preserver, and Supporter; to whom both we and our parents owe our life and our blessings; and who corrects us only for our profit; that we may <i>live</i> and be <i>partakers</i> <i>of his holiness</i>? The apostle in asking, <i>Shall we not much rather</i> <i>be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live</i>? alludes to the punishment of the <i>stubborn</i> and <i>rebellious son</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+21:18-21">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</span>: "If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them; then shall his father and mother lay hold on him and bring him to the elders of the city, and they shall say, This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice: and all the men of the city shall stone him with stones that he DIE." Had he been subject to his earthly parents, he would have <i>lived</i>; because not subject, he <i>dies</i>. If we be subject to our heavenly Father, we shall LIVE, and be partakers of his holiness; if not, we shall DIE, and be treated as <i>bastards</i> and not <i>sons</i>. This is the sum of the apostle's meaning; and the <i>fact</i> and the <i>law</i> to which he alludes.</p>
