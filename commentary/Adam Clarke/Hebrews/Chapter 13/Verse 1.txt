Feel for, comfort, and support each other; and remember that he who professes to love God should love his brother also. They had this brotherly love among them; they should take care to retain it. As God is remarkable for his φιλανθρωπια, <i>philanthropy</i>, or love to man, so should they be for φιλαδελφια, or <i>love to each other</i>. <i>See the note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:4">Titus 3:4</span><i>"</i>.</p>
