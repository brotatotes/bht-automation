<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:13">Hebrews 13:13</span>. <i><b>Let us go forth therefore unto him</b></i> — Let us leave this city and system, devoted to destruction, and take refuge in Jesus alone, bearing his reproach-being willing to be accounted the refuse of all things, and the worst of men, for his sake who bore the contradiction of sinners against himself, and was put to death as a malefactor.</p>
