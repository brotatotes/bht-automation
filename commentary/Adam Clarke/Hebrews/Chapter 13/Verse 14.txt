<p>Verse 14. <i><b>For here have we no continuing city</b></i> — Here is an elegant and forcible allusion to the approaching destruction of Jerusalem. The Jerusalem that was <i>below</i> was about to be burnt with fire, and erased to the ground; the Jerusalem that was <i>from</i> <i>above</i> was that alone which could be considered to be μενουσαν, <i>permanent</i>. The words seem to say: "Arise, and depart; for this is not your rest: it is polluted:" About seven or eight years after this, Jerusalem was wholly destroyed.</p>
