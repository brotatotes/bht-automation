<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Obey them that have the rule over you</b></i> — Obey your <i>leaders</i>, τοις ηγουμενοις. He is not fit to <i>rule</i> who is not capable of <i>guiding</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>. In the former verse the apostle exhorts them to remember those who had been their leaders, and to imitate their faith; in this he exhorts them to obey the leaders they now had, and to submit to their authority in all matters of doctrine and discipline, on the ground that they <i>watched for their souls</i>, and should have to give an account of their conduct to God. If this conduct were improper, they must give in their report before the great tribunal with <i>grief</i>; but <i>in</i> it must be given: if holy and pure, they would give it in with <i>joy</i>. It is an awful consideration that many pastors, who had loved their flocks as their own souls, shall be obliged to accuse them before God for either having <i>rejected</i> or <i>neglected</i> the great salvation.</p>
