<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Now the God of peace</b></i> — We have often seen that <i>peace</i> among the Hebrews signifies <i>prosperity</i> of every kind. <i>The God of</i> <i>peace</i> is the same as the God of all blessedness, who has at his disposal all temporal and eternal good; who loves mankind, and has provided them a complete salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Brought again from the dead our Lord</b></i> — As our Lord's sacrificial death is considered as an atonement offered to the Divine justice, God's acceptance of it as an atonement is signified by his raising the human nature of Christ from the dead; and hence this raising of Christ is, with the utmost propriety, attributed to <i>God the</i> <i>Father</i>, as this proves his acceptance of the sacrificial offering.</p>
<p><i><b>That great Shepherd of the sheep</b></i> — This is a title of our blessed Lord, given to him by the prophets; so <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:11">Isaiah 40:11</span>; <i>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs</i> <i>with his arms, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead</i> <i>those which are with young</i>: and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:23">Ezekiel 34:23</span>; <i>I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them; even</i> <i>my servant David</i>, (i.e. the beloved, viz. Jesus,) and <i>he shall</i> <i>feed them, and be their shepherd</i>: and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:7">Zechariah 13:7</span>; <i>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd - smite the shepherd, and the</i> <i>flock shall be scattered</i>. In all these places the term <i>shepherd</i> is allowed to belong to our blessed Lord; and he appropriates it to himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>, by calling himself <i>the good Shepherd, who, lays down his life for the sheep</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Through the blood of the everlasting covenant</b></i> — Some understand this in the following way, that "God brought back our Lord from the dead on account of his having shed his blood to procure the everlasting covenant." Others, that the Lord Jesus became the great Shepherd and Saviour of the sheep by shedding his blood to procure and ratify the everlasting covenant." The sense, however, will appear much plainer if we connect this with the following verse: "Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead, our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, make you, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, perfect in every good work to do his will." The Christian system is termed the <i>everlasting covenant</i>, to distinguish it from the <i>temporary</i> <i>covenant</i> made with the Israelites at Mount Sinai; and to show that it is the <i>last</i> dispensation of grace to the world, and shall endure to the end of time.</p>
