Verse 21. Make you perfect — καταρτισια υμας. Put you completely in joint. 2 Corinthians 13:9, where the meaning of the original word is largely considered. From the following terms we see what the apostle meant by the perfection for which he prays. They were to do the will of God in every good work, from God working in them that which is well pleasing in his sight. 1. This necessarily implies a complete change in the whole soul, that God may be well pleased with whatsoever he sees in it; and this supposes its being cleansed from all sin, for God's sight cannot be pleased with any thing that is unholy. 2. This complete inward purity is to produce an outward conformity to God's will, so they were to be made perfect in every good work. 3. The perfection within and the perfection without were to be produced by the blood of the everlasting covenant; for although God is love, yet it is not consistent with his justice or holiness to communicate any good to mankind but through his Son, and through him as having died for the offences of the human race.To whom be glory for ever.] As God does all in, by, and through Christ Jesus, to him be the honour of his own work ascribed through time and eternity. Amen.
