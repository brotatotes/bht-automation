<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Suffer the word of exhortation</b></i> — Bear the word or doctrine of this exhortation. This seems to be an epithet of this whole epistle: and as the apostle had in it shown the insufficiency of the Levitical system to atone for sin and save the soul; and had proved that it was the design of God that it should be abolished; and had proved also that it was now abolished by the coming of Christ, whom he had shown to be a greater priest than Aaron, higher than all the angels, the only Son of God as to his human nature, and the Creator, Governor, and Judge of all; and that their city was shortly to be destroyed; he might suppose that they would feel prejudiced against him, and thus lose the benefit of his kind intentions toward them; therefore he entreats them to bear the exhortation which, notwithstanding the great extent of the subject, he had included in a short compass.</p>
<p><i><b>I have written a letter unto you in few words.</b></i> — Perhaps it would be better to translate διαβραχεωνεπεστειλαυμιν, <i>I have</i> <i>written to you briefly</i>, as επιστελλειν often signifies simply to <i>write</i>, and this appears to be its meaning here.</p>
