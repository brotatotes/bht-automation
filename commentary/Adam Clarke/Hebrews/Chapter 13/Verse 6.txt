<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:6">Hebrews 13:6</span>. <i><b>So that we may boldly say</b></i> â€” We, in such circumstances, while cleaving to the Lord, may confidently apply to ourselves what God spake to Joshua and to Solomon; and what he spake to David, "The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do." God is omnipotent, man's power is limited; howsoever strong he may be, he can do nothing against the Almighty.</p>
