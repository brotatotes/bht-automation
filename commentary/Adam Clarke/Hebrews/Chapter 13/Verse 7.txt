<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>. <i><b>Remember them which have the rule over you</b></i> — This clause should be translated, <i>Remember your guides</i>, των ηγουμενων, <i>who have spoken unto you the doctrine of God</i>. Theodoret's note on this verse is very judicious: "He intends the saints who were dead, Stephen the first martyr, James the brother of John, and James called the Just. And there were many others who were taken off by the Jewish rage. 'Consider these, (said he,) and, observing their example, imitate their faith.'" This remembrance of the dead saints, with admiration of their virtues, and a desire to imitate them, is, says Dr. Macknight, the only worship which is due to them from the living.</p>
<p><i><b>Considering the end of their conversation</b></i> — Ὡν αναθεωρουντες την εκβασιν της αναστροφης· "The issue of whose course of life most carefully consider." They lived to get good and do good; they were faithful to their God and his cause; they suffered persecution; and for the testimony of Jesus died a violent death. God never left them; no, he never forsook them; so that they were happy in their afflictions, and glorious in their death. Carefully consider this; act as they did; keep the faith, and God will keep you.</p>
