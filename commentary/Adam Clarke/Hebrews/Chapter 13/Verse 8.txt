<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:8">Hebrews 13:8</span>. <i><b>Jesus Christ the same yesterday</b></i> — In all past times there was no way to the holiest but through the blood of Jesus, either actually shed, or significantly typified. <i>To-day </i>- he is the lamb newly slain, and continues to appear in the presence of God for us. <i>For ever</i>-to the conclusion of time, he will be the way, the truth, and the life, none coming to the Father but through him; and throughout eternity, εις τους αιωνας, it will appear that all glorified human spirits owe their salvation to his infinite merit. This Jesus was thus witnessed of by your guides, who are already departed to glory. Remember HIM; remember <i>them</i>; and take heed to <i>yourselves</i>.</p>
