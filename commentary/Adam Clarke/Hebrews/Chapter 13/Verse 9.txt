<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:9">Hebrews 13:9</span>. <i><b>Be not carried about</b></i> — μη περιφερεσθε. <i>Be not whirled</i> <i>about</i>. But ABCD, and almost every other MS. of importance, with the <i>Syriac, Coptic, Arabic, Vulgate</i>, and several of the Greek fathers, have μη παραφερεσθε, <i>be not carried away</i>, which is undoubtedly the true reading, and signifies here, <i>do not</i> <i>apostatize</i>; permit not yourselves to be carried off from Christ and his doctrine.</p>
<p><i><b>Divers and strange doctrines.</b></i> — διδαχαις, ποικιλαις. <i>Variegated</i> <i>doctrines</i>; those that blended the law and the Gospel, and brought in the Levitical sacrifices and institutions in order to perfect the Christian system. Remember the old covenant is abolished; the <i>new</i> alone is in force.</p>
<p><i>Strange doctrines</i>, διδαχαις ξεναις, foreign doctrines; such as have no <i>apostolical</i> authority to recommend them.</p>
<p><i><b>That the heart be established with grace</b></i> — It is well to have the heart, the mind, and conscience, fully satisfied with the truth and efficacy of the <i>Gospel</i>; for so the word χαρις should be understood here, which is put in opposition to βρωμασιν, meats, signifying here the Levitical institutions, and especially its <i>sacrifices</i>, these being emphatically termed <i>meats</i>, because the offerers were permitted to <i>feast</i> upon them after the blood had been poured out before the Lord.

<p><i><b>Which have not profited them</b></i> — Because they neither took away guilt, cleansed the heart, nor gave power over sin.</p>
