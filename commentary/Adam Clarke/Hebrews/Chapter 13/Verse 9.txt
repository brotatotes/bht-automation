Verse Hebrews 13:9. Be not carried about — μη περιφερεσθε. Be not whirled about. But ABCD, and almost every other MS. of importance, with the Syriac, Coptic, Arabic, Vulgate, and several of the Greek fathers, have μη παραφερεσθε, be not carried away, which is undoubtedly the true reading, and signifies here, do not apostatize; permit not yourselves to be carried off from Christ and his doctrine.Divers and strange doctrines. — διδαχαις, ποικιλαις. Variegated doctrines; those that blended the law and the Gospel, and brought in the Levitical sacrifices and institutions in order to perfect the Christian system. Remember the old covenant is abolished; the new alone is in force.Strange doctrines, διδαχαις ξεναις, foreign doctrines; such as have no apostolical authority to recommend them.That the heart be established with grace — It is well to have the heart, the mind, and conscience, fully satisfied with the truth and efficacy of the Gospel; for so the word χαρις should be understood here, which is put in opposition to βρωμασιν, meats, signifying here the Levitical institutions, and especially its sacrifices, these being emphatically termed meats, because the offerers were permitted to feast upon them after the blood had been poured out before the Lord. See Leviticus 7:15; Deuteronomy 12:6; Deuteronomy 12:7.Which have not profited them — Because they neither took away guilt, cleansed the heart, nor gave power over sin.
