<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>. <i><b>For it became him</b></i> — It was suitable to the Divine wisdom, the requisitions of justice, and the economy of grace, to offer Jesus as a sacrifice, in order to bring many sons and daughters to glory.</p>
<p><i><b>For whom - and by whom</b></i> — God is the <i>cause</i> of all things, and he is the <i>object</i> or <i>end</i> of them.</p>
<p><i><b>Perfect through sufferings.</b></i> — Without <i>suffering</i> he could not have <i>died</i>, and without <i>dying</i> he could not have made an <i>atonement</i> <i>for sin</i>. The sacrifice must be <i>consummated</i>, in order that he might be qualified to be the <i>Captain</i> or <i>Author</i> of the <i>salvation</i> of men, and lead all those who become children of God, through faith in him, into eternal glory. I believe this to be the sense of the passage; and it appears to be an answer to the grand objection of the Jews: "The Messiah is never to be conquered, or die; but will be victorious, and endure for ever." Now the apostle shows that this is not the counsel of God; on the contrary, that it was entirely <i>congruous</i> to the will and nature of God, <i>by whom</i>, and <i>for whom are all things</i>, to bring men to eternal glory through the suffering and death of the Messiah. This is the decision of the Spirit of God against their prejudices; and on the Divine authority this must be our <i>conclusion</i>. Without the passion and death of Christ, the salvation of man would have been impossible.</p>
<p>As there are many different views of this and some of the following verses, I shall introduce a paraphrase of the whole from</p>
<p>Dr. Dodd, who gives the substance of what Doddridge, Pearce, and Owen, have said on this subject.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>. <i><b>For it became him, c.</b></i> — Such has been the conduct of God in the great affair of our redemption and the beauty and harmony of it will be apparent in proportion to the degree in which it is examined; <i>for</i>, though the Jews dream of a temporal Messiah as a scheme conducive to the Divine glory, <i>it well became</i> <i>him</i> - it was expedient, that, in order to act worthy of himself, he should take this method; <i>Him, for whom are all things</i>, and <i>by whom</i> <i>are all things</i> - that glorious Being who is the first cause and last end of all, in pursuit of the great and important design he had formed, of <i>conducting many</i>, whom he is pleased to adopt as his <i>sons</i>, to the possession of that inheritance of <i>glory</i> intended for them, <i>to make</i> and constitute Jesus, his first-begotten and well beloved Son, the <i>Leader</i> and <i>Prince</i> of their salvation, and to make him <i>perfect</i>, or <i>completely fit</i> for the full execution of his office, <i>by</i> a long train of various and extreme <i>sufferings</i>, whereby he was, as it were, solemnly <i>consecrated</i> to it.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span>. <i>Now</i>, in consequence of this appointment, Jesus, <i>the</i> great <i>Sanctifier</i>, who engages and <i>consecrates</i> men to the service of God, and <i>they</i> <i>who are sanctified</i>, (i.e. consecrated and introduced to God with such acceptance,) <i>are all of one</i> family-all the descendants of Adam, and in a sense the seed of Abraham; <i>for which cause he is</i> <i>not ashamed to call them</i>, whom he thus redeems, and presents to the Divine favour, his <i>brethren</i>.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:12">Hebrews 2:12</span>. <i>Saying</i>, in the person of David, who represented the Messiah in his sufferings and exaltation, <i>I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst</i> <i>of the Church will I praise thee</i>.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:13">Hebrews 2:13</span>. <i>And again</i>, speaking as a mortal man, exposed to such exercises of faith in trials and difficulties as others were, he says, in a psalm which sets forth his triumph over his enemies: <i>I will trust in him</i>, as other good men have done in all ages; <i>and again</i>, elsewhere in the person of Isaiah: <i>Behold I, and the children which my God hath given me</i>, are for signs and for wonders.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>. <i>Seeing then</i> those whom he represents in one place and another, as <i>the children</i> of the same family with himself, <i>were partakers of flesh and blood, he himself</i> <i>in like manner participated in them, that</i> thereby becoming capable of those sufferings to which, without such a union with flesh, this Divine Sanctifier could not have been obnoxious, <i>he might</i>, by his own voluntary and meritorious <i>death, abolish and depose him</i> <i>who</i>, by Divine permission, <i>had the empire of death</i>, and led it in his train when he made the first invasion on mankind; <i>that is, the</i> <i>devil</i>, the great artificer of mischief and destruction; at the beginning the murderer of the human race; who still seems to triumph in the spread of mortality, which is his work, and who may often, by God's permission, be the executioner of it.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:15">Hebrews 2:15</span>. But Christ, the great Prince of mercy and life, graciously interposed, that he <i>might deliver those</i> miserable captives of Satan-mankind in general, and the dark and idolatrous Gentiles in particular, <i>who, through fear of death, were</i>, or justly might have been, <i>all their lifetime, obnoxious to bondage</i>; having nothing to expect in consequence of it, if they rightly understood their state, but future misery; whereas now, changing their lord, they have happily changed their condition, and are, as many as have believed in him, the heirs of eternal life."</p>
