<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span>. <i><b>For both he that sanctifieth</b></i> — The word ο αγιαζων does not merely signify one who sanctifies or makes holy, but one who makes atonement or reconciliation to God; and answers to the Hebrew כפר <i>caphar</i>, to expiate. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:33-36">Exodus 29:33-36</span>. He that sanctifies is he that makes atonement; and they who are sanctified are they who receive that atonement, and, being reconciled unto God, become his children by adoption, through grace.</p>
<p>In this sense our Lord uses the word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>: <i>For their sakes I sanctify myself</i>; ὑπερ αυτων εγω ἁγιαζω εμαυτον, on their account I consecrate myself to be a sacrifice. This is the sense in which this word is used generally through this epistle.</p>
<p>Are <i><b>all of one</b></i> — εξ ενος παντες. What this <i>one</i> means has given rise to various conjectures; <i>father, family, blood, seed, race</i>, <i>nature</i>, have all been substituted; <i>nature</i> seems to be that intended, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>; and the conclusion of this verse confirms it. Both the <i>Sanctifier</i> and the <i>sanctified</i>-both Christ and his followers, are all of the same nature; for as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, i.e. of <i>human nature</i>, he partook of the same, and thus he was qualified to become a sacrifice for man.</p>
<p><i><b>He is not ashamed to call them brethren</b></i> — Though, as to his Godhead, he is infinitely raised above men and angels; yet as he has become incarnate, notwithstanding his dignity, he blushes not to acknowledge all his true followers as his <i>brethren</i>.</p>
