<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:12">Hebrews 2:12</span>. <i><b>I will declare thy name</b></i> â€” See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:22">Psalms 22:22</span>. The apostle certainly quotes this psalm as referring to Jesus Christ, and these words as spoken by Christ unto the Father, in reference to his incarnation; as if he had said: "When I shall be incarnated, I will declare thy perfections to mankind; and among my disciples I will give glory to thee for thy mercy to the children of men." See the fulfilment of this, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>: <i>No man hath seen God at any time; the</i> ONLY-BEGOTTEN SON, <i>which is</i> <i>in the bosom of the Father</i>, HE HATH DECLARED HIM. Nor were the perfections of God ever properly <i>known</i> or <i>declared</i>, till the manifestation of Christ. Hear another scripture, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span>: <i>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O</i> <i>Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things</i> <i>from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes, &amp;c</i>. Thus he gave praise to God.</p>
