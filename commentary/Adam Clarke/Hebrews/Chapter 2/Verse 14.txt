<p>Verse 14. <i><b>The children are partakers of flesh and blood</b></i> — Since those children of God, who have fallen and are to be redeemed, are <i>human beings</i>; in order to be qualified to redeem them by suffering and dying in their stead, <i>He himself likewise took part of the</i> <i>same</i>-he became <i>incarnate</i>; and thus he who was <i>God with God</i>, became <i>man</i> with <i>men</i>. By the <i>children</i> here we are to understand, not only the <i>disciples</i> and all <i>genuine Christians</i>, as in <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:13">Hebrews 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:13">Hebrews 2:13</span></span> but also the <i>whole human race</i>; all Jews and all Gentiles; so <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:51">John 11:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:52">John 11:52</span>: <i>He prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; and not for</i> <i>that nation only, but also that he should gather together in one</i> <i>the</i> CHILDREN <i>of</i> GOD <i>that were scattered abroad</i>; meaning, probably, all the <i>Jews</i> in every part of the earth. But collate this with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>, where: the evangelist explains the former words: <i>He is the propitiation for our sins</i>, (the <i>Jews</i>,) <i>and not</i> <i>for ours only, but for the sins of the</i> WHOLE WORLD. As the apostle was writing to the <i>Hebrews</i> only, he in general uses a Jewish phraseology, pointing out to them <i>their own</i> privileges; and rarely introduces the <i>Gentiles</i>, or what the Messiah has done for the other nations of the earth.</p>
<p><i><b>That through death</b></i> — That by the merit of his own death, making atonement for sin, and procuring the almighty energy of the Holy Spirit, he might <i>counterwork</i> καταργηση, or <i>render useless</i> and <i>ineffectual</i>, all the operations of him who <i>had</i> the <i>power</i>, κρατος, or <i>influence</i>, to bring death into the world; so that <i>death</i>, which was intended by him who was a murderer from the beginning to be the final ruin of mankind, becomes the instrument of their exaltation and endless glory; and thus the death brought in by Satan is <i>counterworked</i> and rendered <i>ineffectual</i> by the death of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Him that had the power of death</b></i> — This is spoken in conformity to an opinion prevalent among the Jews, that there was a certain fallen angel who was called מלאך המות <i>malak hammaveth</i>, the <i>angel</i> <i>of death</i>; i.e. one who had the <i>power</i> of separating the soul from the body, when God decreed that the person should die. There were two of these, according to some of the Jewish writers: one was the angel of death to the <i>Gentiles</i>; the other, to the Jews. Thus <i>Tob</i> <i>haarets</i>, fol. 31: "There are two angels which preside over death: one is over those who die out of the land of Israel, and his name is <i>Sammael</i>; the other is he who presides over those who die in the land of Israel, and this is <i>Gabriel</i>." Sammael is a common name for the devil among the Jews; and there is a tradition among them, delivered by the author of <i>Pesikta rabbetha</i> in <i>Yalcut Simeoni</i>, par. 2, f. 56, that the angel of death should be destroyed by the Messiah! "Satan said to the holy blessed God: <i>Lord of the world</i>, <i>show me the Messiah</i>. The Lord answered: <i>Come and see him</i>. And when he had seen him he was terrified, and his countenance fell, and he said: <i>Most certainly this is the Messiah who shall cast me</i> <i>and all the nations into hell, as it is written</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span>, <i>The Lord shall swallow up death for ever</i>." This is a very remarkable saying, and the apostle shows that it is true, for the Messiah came to <i>destroy him who had the power of death</i>. Dr. Owen has made some collections on this head from other Jewish writers which tend to illustrate this verse; they may he seen in his comment, vol. i., p. 456, 8vo. edition.</p>
