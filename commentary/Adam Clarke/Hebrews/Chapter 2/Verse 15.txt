<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And deliver them who through fear of death</b></i> â€” It is very likely that the apostle has the Gentiles here principally in view. As <i>they</i> had no <i>revelation</i>, and no certainty of <i>immortality,</i> they were continually in bondage to the fear of death. They preferred <i>life</i> in any state, with the most grievous evils, to <i>death</i>, because they had no hope beyond the grave. But it is also true that all men naturally fear death; even those that have the fullest persuasion and certainty of a future state dread it: genuine Christians, who know that, if the earthly house of their tabernacle were dissolved, they have a house not made with hands, a building framed of God, eternal in the heavens, only <i>they</i> fear it not. In the assurance they have of God's love, the fear of death is removed; and by the purification of their hearts through faith, the sting of death is extracted. The people who know not God are in continual torment through the fear of death, and they fear death because they fear something beyond death. They are conscious to themselves that they are wicked, and they are afraid of God, and terrified at the thought of <i>eternity</i>. By these fears thousands of sinful, miserable creatures are prevented from hurrying themselves into the unknown world. This is finely expressed by the poet: - </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> For who could bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> When he himself might his quietus make</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> But that the <i>dread of something after death</i>,--</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The <i>undiscovered</i> country from whose bourn</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> No traveller returns,--puzzles the will;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</i>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>Than fly to others that we know not of</i>?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all</i>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And enterprises of great pith and moment,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> With this regard, their currents turn awry</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And lose the name of action." </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>I give this long quotation from a poet who was well acquainted with all the workings of the human heart; and one who could not have described scenes of distress and anguish of mind so well, had he not passed through them.</p>
