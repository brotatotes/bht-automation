<p>Verse 16. <i><b>For verily he took not on</b></i> him the nature of <i>angels</i>] Ου γαρ δηπου αγγελων επιλαμβανεται, αλλα σπερματος Αβρααμ επιλαμβανεται. <i>Moreover, he doth not at all take hold of angels</i>; <i>but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold</i>. This is the <i>marginal</i> reading, and is greatly to be preferred to that in the text Jesus Christ, intending not to redeem angels, but to redeem man, did not assume the angelic nature, but was made man, coming directly by the <i>seed</i> or <i>posterity of Abraham</i>, with whom the <i>original covenant</i> was made, that <i>in his seed all the nations of the earth should be</i> <i>blessed</i>; and it is on this account that the apostle mentioned the <i>seed</i> of <i>Abraham</i>, and not the <i>seed</i> of <i>Adam</i>; and it is strange that to many commentators should have missed so obvious a sense. The word itself signifies not only to <i>take hold of</i>, but to <i>help</i>, <i>succour, save from sinking</i>, c. The rebel <i>angels</i>, who sinned and fell from God, were permitted to <i>fall downe, alle downe</i>, as one of our old writers expresses it, till they fell into perdition: <i>man</i> sinned and fell, and was falling <i>downe, alle downe</i>, but Jesus laid hold on him and prevented him from falling into endless perdition. Thus he <i>seized on the falling human creature</i>, and prevented him from falling into the bottomless <i>pit</i> but he did not <i>seize</i> on the falling angels, and they fell down into outer darkness. By assuming the nature of man, he prevented this final and irrecoverable fall of man; and by making an atonement in human nature, he made a provision for its restoration to its forfeited blessedness. This is a fine thought of the apostle, and is beautifully expressed. Man was falling from heaven, and Jesus caught hold of the falling creature, and prevented its endless ruin. In this respect he prefers men to angels, and probably for this simple reason, that the <i>human nature</i> was <i>more excellent</i> than the <i>angelic</i>; and it is suitable to the wisdom of the Divine Being to regard all the works of his hands in proportion to the dignity or excellence with which he has endowed them.</p>
