<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Wherefore in all things</b></i> — Because he thus <i>laid hold</i> on man in order to redeem him, it was necessary that he should in all things become like to man, that he might suffer in his stead, and make an atonement in his nature.</p>
<p><i><b>That he might be a merciful and faithful high priest</b></i> — ινα ελεημων γενηται. <i>That he might be merciful</i>-that he might be affected with a feeling of our infirmities, that, partaking of our nature with all its innocent infirmities and afflictions, he might know how to <i>compassionate</i> poor, afflicted, suffering man. And that he might be a <i>faithful high priest in those things which</i> <i>relate to God</i>, whose justice requires the punishment of the transgressors, or a suitable expiation to be made for the sins of the people. The proper meaning of ιλασκεσθαι τας αμαρτιας is <i>to</i> <i>make propitiation</i> or <i>atonement for sins by sacrifice</i>. <i>See the note on this word, "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span><i>"</i>, where it is particularly explained. Christ is the <i>great High Priest</i> of mankind;</p>
<p>1. He exercises himself in the <i>things pertaining</i> to GOD, taking heed that God's honour be properly secured, his worship properly regulated, his laws properly enforced, and both his justice and mercy magnified. Again,</p>
<p>2. He exercises himself in <i>things pertaining</i> to MEN, that he may make an <i>atonement for</i> them, apply this atonement <i>to</i> them, and liberate them thereby from the curse of a broken law, from the guilt and power of sin, from its inbeing and nature, and from all the evils to which they were exposed through it, and lastly that he might open their way into the holiest by his own blood; and he has <i>mercifully</i> and <i>faithfully</i> accomplished all that he has undertaken.</p>
