Verse Hebrews 2:2. If the word spoken by angels — The law, (according to some,) which was delivered by the mediation of angels, God frequently employing these to communicate his will to men. See Acts 7:53; and Galatians 3:19. But the apostle probably means those particular messages which God sent by angels, as in the case of Lot, "Genesis 19:12" c., and such like.Was steadfast — Was so confirmed by the Divine authority, and so strict, that it would not tolerate any offence, but inflicted punishment on every act of transgression, every case in which the bounds laid down by the law, were passed over and every act of disobedience in respect to the duties enjoined.Received a just recompense — That kind and degree of punishment which the law prescribed for those who broke it.
