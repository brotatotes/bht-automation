<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>. <i><b>If the word spoken by angels</b></i> — The <i>law</i>, (according to some,) which was delivered by the <i>mediation of angels</i>, God frequently employing these to communicate his will to men. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:53">Acts 7:53</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>. But the apostle probably means those particular messages which God sent by angels, as in the case of <i>Lot</i>, <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:12">Genesis 19:12</span><i>"</i> c., and such like.</p>
<p><i><b>Was steadfast</b></i> — Was so confirmed by the Divine authority, and so strict, that it would not tolerate any offence, but inflicted punishment on every act of <i>transgression</i>, every case in which the <i>bounds</i> laid down by the law, were <i>passed over</i> and every act of <i>disobedience</i> in respect to the <i>duties</i> enjoined.</p>
<p><i><b>Received a just recompense</b></i> — That kind and degree of punishment which the law prescribed for those who broke it.</p>
