<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3">Hebrews 2:3</span>. <i><b>How shall we escape</b></i> — If they who had fewer privileges than we have, to whom God spoke in divers manners by angels and prophets, fell under the displeasure of their Maker, and were often punished with a sore destruction; how shall we escape wrath to the uttermost if we neglect the salvation provided for us, and proclaimed to us by the Son of God? Their offence was <i>high</i>; ours, indescribably <i>higher</i>. The <i>salvation</i> mentioned here is the whole system of Christianity, with all the privileges it confers; properly called a <i>salvation</i>, because, by bringing such an abundance of heavenly <i>light</i> into the world, it <i>saves</i> or <i>delivers</i> men from the kingdom of <i>darkness, ignorance, error, superstition</i>, and <i>idolatry</i>; and provides all the requisite means to <i>free</i> them from the <i>power, guilt</i>, and <i>contamination</i> of sin. This salvation is great when compared with that granted to the Jews:</p>
<p>1. The Jewish dispensation was provided for the <i>Jews</i> alone; the Christian dispensation for all mankind. </p>
<p>2. The Jewish dispensation was full of significant types and ceremonies; the Christian dispensation is the substance of all those types. </p>
<p>3. The Jewish dispensation referred chiefly to the <i>body</i> and <i>outward</i> state of man-washings and external cleansings of the flesh; the Christian, to the inward state-purifying the heart and soul, and purging the conscience from dead works.</p>
<p>4. The Jewish dispensation promised <i>temporal</i> <i>happiness</i>; the Christian, <i>spiritual</i>. </p>
<p>5. The Jewish dispensation belonged chiefly to <i>time</i>; the Christian, to <i>eternity</i>. </p>
<p>6. The Jewish dispensation had its glory; but that was nothing when compared to the exceeding glory of the Gospel. </p>
<p>7. Moses administered the former; Jesus Christ, the Creator, Governor, and Saviour of the world, the latter. </p>
<p>8. This is a great salvation, infinitely beyond the Jewish; but how great no tongue or pen can describe.</p>
<p>Those who neglect it, αμελησαντες, are not only they who oppose or <i>persecute</i> it, but they who <i>pay no regard</i> to it; who do not <i>meddle with</i> it, do not <i>concern themselves</i> about it, do not lay it to heart, and consequently do not get their hearts changed by it. Now these cannot <i>escape</i> the coming judgments of God; not merely because they oppose his will and commandment, but because they sin against the very <i>cause</i> and <i>means</i> of their deliverance. As there is but <i>one</i> remedy by which their diseased souls can be saved, so by refusing to apply that one remedy they must necessarily perish.</p>
<p><i><b>Which at the first began to be spoken</b></i> — Though John the Baptist went before our Lord to prepare his way, yet he could not be properly said to preach the Gospel; and even Christ's preaching was only a <i>beginning</i> of the great proclamation: it was his own Spirit in the apostles and evangelists, the men who heard him preach, that opened the whole mystery of the kingdom of heaven. And all this testimony had been so confirmed in the land of Judea as to render it indubitable; and consequently there was no excuse for their unbelief, and no prospect of their <i>escape</i> if they should continue to <i>neglect</i> it.</p>
