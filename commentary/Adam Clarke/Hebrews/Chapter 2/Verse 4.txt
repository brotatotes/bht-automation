<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>. <i><b>God also bearing them witness</b></i> — He did not leave the confirmation of these great truths to the testimony of <i>men</i>; he bore his <i>own</i> testimony to them by <i>signs, wonders, various</i> <i>miracles</i>, and <i>distributions of the Holy Ghost</i>, Πνευματος 'Αγιου μερισμοις. And all these were proved to come from <i>himself</i>; for no <i>man</i> could do those miracles at <i>his own pleasure</i>, but the power to work them was given according to God's <i>own will</i>; or rather, God himself wrought them, in order to accredit the ministry of his servants.</p>
<p>For the meaning of <i>signs, wonders</i>, &amp;c., <i>See the note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+4:34">Deuteronomy 4:34</span><i>"</i>.</p>
