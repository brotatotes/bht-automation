<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5">Hebrews 2:5</span>. <i><b>The world to come</b></i> — That עולם הבא <i>olam habba, the</i> <i>world to come</i>, meant the <i>days of the Messiah</i> among the Jews, is most evident, and has been often pointed out in the course of these notes; and that the administration of this kingdom has not been intrusted to <i>angels</i>, who were frequently employed under the law, is also evident, for the government is on the shoulder of Jesus Christ; he alone has the keys of death and hell; he alone shuts, and no man opens; opens, and no man shuts; he alone has the residue of the Spirit; he alone is the Governor of the universe, the Spirit, Soul, Heart, and Head of the Church: all is in his authority, and under subjection to him.</p>
<p>But some think that the <i>world to come</i> means <i>future glory</i>, and suppose the words are spoken in reference to the <i>Angel of God's</i> <i>presence</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:20">Exodus 23:20</span>, who introduced the Israelites into the <i>promised land</i>, which land is here put in opposition to the <i>heavenly inheritance</i>. And it is certain that in this sense also we have an entrance into the holiest <i>only</i> by the blood of Jesus. Dr. <i>Macknight</i> contends for this latter meaning, but the former appears more consistent with the Jewish phraseology.</p>
