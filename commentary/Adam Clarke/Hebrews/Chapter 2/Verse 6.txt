<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6">Hebrews 2:6</span>. <i><b>But one in a certain place</b></i> — This <i>one</i> is <i>David</i>; and the <i>certain place</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:4-6">Psalms 8:4-6</span>. But why does the apostle use this indeterminate mode of quotation? Because it was common thus to express the testimony of any of the inspired writers; אמר ההוא <i>amar hahu kethab</i>, thus saith a certain scripture. So <i>Philo</i>, De Plant. Noe: Ειπε γαρ που, <i>he saith somewhere</i>; ειπε γαρ τις, <i>a certain person saith</i>. Thus even the heathens were accustomed to quote <i>high authorities</i>; so <i>Plato</i>, Tim.: Ὡς εφη τις, <i>as a</i> <i>certain person saith</i>, meaning <i>Heraclitus</i>. See in <i>Rosenmuller</i>. It is such a mode of quotation as we sometimes use when we speak of a very eminent person who is well known; as <i>that very eminent</i> <i>person</i>, that <i>great philosopher</i>, that <i>celebrated divine</i>, that <i>inspired teacher of the Gentiles</i>, the <i>royal psalmist</i>, the <i>evangelical prophet</i>, hath said. The mode of quotation therefore implies, not <i>ignorance</i>, but <i>reverence</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>What is man</b></i> — This quotation is verbatim from the <i>Septuagint</i>; and, as the Greek is not as emphatic as the Hebrew, I will quote the original: מה אנוש כי תזכרנו ובן אדם כי תפקדנו <i>mah enosh ki</i> <i>thizkerennu, uben Adam ki thiphkedennu</i>; <i>What is miserable man,</i> <i>that thou rememberest him? and the son of Adam, that thou visitest</i> <i>him</i>? The variation of the terms in the original is very emphatic. <i>Adam</i>, אדם, is the name given to man at his creation, and expresses his origin, and generic distinction from all other animals. <i>Enosh</i>, אנוש, which signifies <i>sick, weak, wretched</i>, was never given to him till after his fall. The <i>son of Adam</i> means here, any one or all of the fallen posterity of the first man. That God should <i>remember</i> in the way of mercy these <i>wretched</i> beings, is great condescension; that he should <i>visit</i> them, <i>manifest</i> himself to them, yea, even <i>dwell among them</i>, and at last <i>assume their nature</i>, and give up his <i>life</i> to ransom them from the bitter pains of eternal death, is mercy and love indescribable and eternal.</p>
