<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:7">Hebrews 2:7</span>. <i><b>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels</b></i> — We must again have recourse to the original from which this quotation is made: ותחסרהו מעט מאלהים <i>vattechasserehu meat meelohim</i>. If this be spoken of <i>man</i> as he came out of the hands of his Maker, it places him at the <i>head</i> of all God's works; for literally translated it is: <i>Thou hast made him less than God</i>. And this is proved by his being made in the <i>image</i> and <i>likeness of God</i>, which is spoken of no other creature either in heaven or earth; and it is very likely that in his original creation he stood at the head of all the works of God, and the next to his Maker. This sentiment is well expressed in the following lines, part of a paraphrase on this psalm, by the Rev. C. Wesley: - </p>
<p><i><b>Thou crownedst him with glory and honour</b></i> — This was strictly true of <i>Adam</i> in his state of innocence, for he was set over all things in this <i>lower world; all sheep and oxen, the beasts of the</i> <i>field, the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, and whatsoever</i> <i>passeth over the paths of the seas</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:7">Psalms 8:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:8">Psalms 8:8</span>. So far all this perfectly applies to Adam; but it is evident the apostle takes <i>all</i> in a much higher sense, that of <i>universal dominion</i>; and hence he says, <i>he left nothing that is not put under him</i>. These verses, collated with the above passage from the Epistle to the Philippians, mutually illustrate each other. And the <i>crowning</i> <i>Christ with glory and honour</i> must refer to his <i>exaltation</i> after his resurrection, in which, as the victorious Messiah, he had all power given to him in heaven and earth. And although <i>we do not</i> <i>yet see all things put under him</i>, for evil men, and evil spirits, are only under the <i>subjection of control</i>, yet we look forward to that time when the whole world shall be bowed to his sway, and when the stone cut out of the mountain without hands shall become great, and fill the whole earth. What was never true of the first Adam, even in his most exalted state, is true of the second Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ; and to him, and to him alone, it is most evident that the apostle applies these things; and thus he is higher than the <i>angels</i>, who never had nor can have such dominion and consequent glory.</p>
