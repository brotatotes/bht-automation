<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>. <i><b>Should taste death for every man.</b></i> — In consequence of the fall of Adam, the whole human race became sinful in their <i>nature</i>, and in their <i>practice</i> added <i>transgression</i> to <i>sinfulness</i> of disposition, and thus became exposed to endless perdition. To redeem them Jesus Christ took on him the nature of man, and suffered the penalty due to their sins.</p>
<p>It was a custom in ancient times to take off criminals by making them <i>drink a cup of poison</i>. Socrates was adjudged to drink a cup of the juice of hemlock, by order of the Athenian magistrates: Πινειν το φαρμακον, αναγκαζοντων των Αρχοντων. The sentence was one of the most unjust ever pronounced on man. Socrates was not only innocent of every crime laid to his charge, but was the greatest benefactor to his country. He was duly conscious of the iniquity of his sentence, yet cheerfully submitted to his appointed fate; for when the officer brought in the poison, though his friends endeavoured to persuade him that he had yet a considerable time in which he might continue to live, yet, knowing that every purpose of life was now accomplished, he refused to avail himself of a few remaining moments, seized the cup, and drank off the poison with the utmost cheerfulness and alacrity; επισχομενος και μαλα ευχερως και ευκολως εξεπιε. <i>Plato</i>, Phaed. sub. fin. The reference in the text seems to point out the whole human race as being accused, tried, found guilty, and condemned, each having his own <i>poisoned cup</i> to drink; and Jesus, the wonderful Jesus, takes the cup out of the hand of each, and chearfully and with alacrity drinks off the dregs! Thus having drunk every man's <i>poisoned cup</i>, he <i>tasted</i> that <i>death</i> which they must have endured, had not their <i>cup</i> been drunk by <i>another</i>. Is not this the <i>cup</i> to which he refers, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39">Matthew 26:39</span>: <i>O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me</i>? But without his drinking it, the salvation of the world would have been <i>impossible</i>; and therefore he cheerfully drank it in the place of every human soul, and thus made atonement for the sin of the whole world: and this he did, χαριτιθεου, by the grace, mercy, or infinite goodness of God. Jesus Christ, incarnated, crucified, dying, rising, ascending to heaven, and becoming our Mediator at God's right hand, is the full proof of God's infinite love to the human race.</p>
<p>Instead of χαριτι Θεου, by the grace of God, some MSS. and the Syriac have χαριτι Θεου, <i>without God</i>, or <i>God excepted</i>; i.e. the <i>manhood died</i>, not the <i>Deity</i>. This was probably a marginal gloss, which has crept into the text of many MSS., and is quoted by some of the chief of the Greek and Latin fathers. Several critics contend that the verse should be read thus: "But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made less than angels, that by the grace of God he might taste death for every man, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour." Howsoever it be taken, the sense is nearly the same:</p>
<p>1. Jesus Christ was incarnated. </p>
<p>2. He suffered death as an expiatory victim. </p>
<p>3. The persons in whose behalf he suffered were the whole human race; <i>every man</i>-all human creatures. </p>
<p>4. This Jesus is now in a state of the highest glory and honour.</p>
