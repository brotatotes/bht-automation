<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>. <i><b>Holy brethren</b></i> — Persons <i>consecrated to God</i>, as the word literally implies, and called, in consequence, to be <i>holy in</i> <i>heart, holy in life</i>, and <i>useful in the world</i>. The Israelites are often called a <i>holy people, saints</i>, c., because <i>consecrated</i> to God, and because they were bound by their profession to be holy and yet these appellations are given to them in numberless instances where they were very <i>unholy</i>. The not attending to this circumstance, and the not discerning between actual positive <i>holiness</i>, and the <i>call</i> to it, as the <i>consecration</i> of the persons, has led many commentators and preachers into destructive mistakes. Antinomianism has had its origin here: and as it was found that many persons were called <i>saints</i>, who, in many respects, were miserable sinners, hence it has been inferred that they were called <i>saints</i> in reference to a holiness which they had in <i>another</i>; and hence the Antinomian imputation of Christ's righteousness to unholy believers, whose hearts were abominable before God, and whose lives were a scandal to the Gospel. Let, therefore, a due distinction be made between persons by their <i>profession holy</i>, i.e. <i>consecrated to God</i>; and persons who are <i>faithful</i> to that profession, and are both <i>inwardly</i> and <i>outwardly</i> <i>holy</i>. They are not all Israel who are of Israel: a man, by a literal circumcision, may be a Jew outwardly; but the circumcision of the heart by the Spirit makes a man a Jew inwardly. A man may be a Christian in profession, and not such in heart; and those who pretend that, although they are <i>unholy in themselves</i>, they are reputed <i>holy in Christ</i>, because his righteousness is imputed to them, most awfully deceive their own souls.</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Owen</i> has spoken well on the necessity of personal holiness against the Antinomians of his day. "If a man be not made holy he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. It is this that makes them meet for the inheritance of the saints in light; as without it they are not meet for their duty, so are they not capable of their reward. Yea, heaven itself, in the true light and notion of it, is undesirable to an unsanctified person. Such a one neither can nor would enjoy God if he might. In a word, there is no one thing required of the sons of God that an unsanctified person can do, and no one thing promised unto them that he can enjoy.</p>
<p>"There is surely then a woful mistake in the world. If Christ sanctify all whom he saves, many will appear to have been mistaken in their expectations at another day. It is grown amongst us almost an abhorrency to all flesh to say, <i>the Church of God is to</i> <i>be holy</i>. What! though God has promised that it should be so; that Christ has undertaken to make it so? What! if it be required to be so? What! if all the duties of it be rejected of God, if it be not so? It is all one, if men be baptized, whether they will or not, and outwardly profess the name of Christ, though not one of them be truly sanctified, yet they are, it is said, the Church of Christ. Why then let them be so; but what are they the better for it? Are their persons or their services therefore accepted with God? Are they related or united to Christ? Are they under his conduct unto glory? Are they meet for the inheritance of the saints in light? Not at all: not all nor any of these things do they obtain thereby. What is it then that they get by the furious contest which they make for the reputation of this privilege? Only this: that, satisfying their minds by it, resting if not priding themselves in it, they obtain many advantages to stifle all convictions of their condition, and so perish unavoidably. A sad success, and for ever to be bewailed! Yet is there nothing at all at this day more contended for in this world than that Christ might be thought to be a <i>captain of salvation</i> to them, unto whom he is not a <i>sanctifier</i>; that he may have an <i>unholy Church</i>, a <i>dead</i> <i>body</i>. These things tend neither to the glory of Christ, nor to the good of the souls of men. Let none then deceive themselves; sanctification is a qualification indispensably necessary to them who will be under the conduct of the Lord Christ unto salvation; he leads none to heaven but whom he <i>sanctifies</i> on earth. The holy God will not receive unholy persons. This <i>living head</i> will not admit of <i>dead members</i>, nor bring men into possession of a glory which they neither love nor like."</p>
<p><i><b>Heavenly calling</b></i> — The Israelites had an earthly calling; they were called out of Egypt to go into the promised land: Christians have a heavenly calling; they are invited to leave the bondage of sin, and go to the kingdom of God. These were made partakers of this calling; they had already embraced the Gospel, and were brought into a state of salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Apostle and High Priest of our profession</b></i> — Among the Jews the <i>high priest</i> was considered to be also <i>the apostle of God</i>; and it is in conformity to this notion that the apostle speaks. And he exhorts the Hebrews to <i>consider</i> Jesus Christ to be both their <i>High</i> <i>Priest</i> and <i>Apostle</i>; and to expect these offices to be henceforth fulfilled by him, and by him alone. This was the fullest intimation that the Mosaic economy was at an end, and the priesthood changed. By της ομολογιας ημων, <i>our profession</i>, or <i>that confession of ours</i>, the apostle undoubtedly means the <i>Christian religion</i>. Jesus was the Apostle of the Father, and has given to mankind the <i>new covenant</i>; and we are to consider the whole system of Christianity as coming immediately from him. Every system of religion must have a <i>priest</i> and a <i>prophet</i>; the one to <i>declare</i> the will of God, the other to <i>minister</i> in holy things. Moses was the <i>apostle</i> under the old testament, and Aaron the <i>priest</i>. When Moses was removed, the prophets succeeded him; and the sons of Aaron were the priests after the death of their father. This system is now annulled; and Jesus is the <i>Prophet</i> who declares the Father's will, and he is the <i>Priest</i> who ministers in the things pertaining to God, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>; as he makes atonement for the sins of the people, and is the Mediator between God and man.</p>
