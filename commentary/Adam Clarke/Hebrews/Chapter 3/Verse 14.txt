<p>Verse 14. <i><b>For we are made partakers of Christ</b></i> — Having believed in Christ as the promised Messiah, and embraced the whole Christian system, they were consequently made partakers of all its <i>benefits</i> in this life, and entitled to the fulfilment of all its exceeding great and precious promises relative to the glories of the eternal world. The former they actually possessed, the latter they could have only in case of their perseverance; therefore the apostle says, <i>If we hold fast the beginning of our confidence</i> <i>steadfast unto the end</i>, i.e. of our life. For our participation of glory depends on our continuing steadfast in the faith, to the end of our Christian race.</p>
<p>The word υποστασις, which we here translate <i>confidence</i>, from υπο, <i>under</i>, and ιστημι, <i>to place</i> or <i>stand</i>, signifies properly a <i>basis</i> or <i>foundation</i>; that on which something else is builded, and by which it is supported. Their <i>faith</i> in Christ Jesus was this <i>hypostasis</i> or <i>foundation</i>; on that all their peace, comfort, and salvation were builded. If this were not held fast to the end, Christ, in his saving influences, could not be held fast; and no Christ, no heaven. He who has Christ in him, has the well-founded hope of glory; and he who is found in the great day with Christ in his heart, will have an abundant entrance into eternal glory.</p>
