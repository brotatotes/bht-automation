Verse 15. While it is said, To-day â€” You may see the necessity of perseverance from the saying, "Today, if ye will hear his voice," therefore harden not your hearts-do not neglect so great a salvation; hold fast what ye have obtained, and let no man take your crown. See on Hebrews 3:7-9, and Hebrews 3:12.
