<p>Verse 16. <i><b>For some, when they had heard, did provoke</b></i> — There is a various reading here, which consists merely in the different placing of an <i>accent</i>, and yet gives the whole passage a different turn: - τινες, from τις, <i>who</i>, if read with the accent on the <i>epsilon</i>, τινες, is the plural indefinite, and signifies <i>some</i>, as in our translation; if read with the accent on the <i>iota</i>, τινες, it has an <i>interrogative</i> meaning; and, according to this, the whole clause, τίνες γαρ ακουσαντες παρεπικραναν: <i>But who were those</i> <i>hearers who did bitterly provoke</i>? αλλ' ου παντες οἱ εξελθοντες εξ Αιγυπτου δια Μωσεως; <i>Were they not all they who came out of the</i> <i>land of Egypt by Moses</i>? Or, the whole clause may be read with one interrogation: <i>But who were those hearers that did bitterly</i> <i>provoke, but all those who came out of Egypt by Moses</i>? This mode of reading is followed by some <i>editions</i>, and by <i>Chrysostom</i> and <i>Theodoret</i>, and by several learned <i>moderns</i>. It is more <i>likely</i> that this is the true reading, as all that follows to the end of the <i>18</i>th verse is a series of interrogations.</p>
<p>Should it be said that <i>all</i> did not provoke, for Joshua and Caleb are expressly excepted; I answer, that the term <i>all</i> may be with great propriety used, when out of many <i>hundreds of thousands</i> only two persons were found who continued faithful. To these also we may add the <i>priests</i> and the whole tribe of <i>Levi</i>, who, it is very likely, did not provoke; for, as Dr. Macknight very properly remarks, they were not of the number of those who were to fight their way into Canaan, being entirely devoted to the service of the sanctuary. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:3">Numbers 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:45">Numbers 1:45</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:49">Numbers 1:49</span>. And therefore what remained of them after forty years, no doubt, entered Canaan; for it appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+34:17">Numbers 34:17</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+24:33">Joshua 24:33</span>, that <i>Eleazar</i>, the son of Aaron, was one of those who did take possession of Canaan. Should it be still said our version appears to be most proper, because <i>all</i> did not provoke; it may be answered, that the common reading, τινες, <i>some</i>, is too <i>contracted</i> in its meaning to comprehend the hundreds of thousands who did rebel.</p>
