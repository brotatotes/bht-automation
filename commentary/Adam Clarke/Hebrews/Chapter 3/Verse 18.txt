<p>Verse 18. <i><b>To whom sware he</b></i> â€” God never acts by any kind of caprice; whenever he pours out his judgments, there are the most positive reasons to vindicate his conduct.</p>
<p>Those whose carcasses fell in the wilderness were they who had sinned. And those who did not enter into his rest were those who <i>believed not</i>. God is represented here as <i>swearing</i> that <i>they</i> <i>should not enter in</i>, in order to show the <i>determinate nature</i> of his purpose, the reason on which it was founded, and the height of the <i>aggravation</i> which occasioned it.</p>
