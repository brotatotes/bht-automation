<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:19">Hebrews 3:19</span>. <i><b>So we see that they could not enter in</b></i> — It was no <i>decree</i> of God that prevented them, it was no want of necessary <i>strength</i> to enable them, it was through no deficiency of <i>Divine</i> <i>counsel</i> to instruct them; all these they had in abundance: but they chose to sin, and would not believe. <i>Unbelief</i> produced <i>disobedience</i>, and disobedience produced <i>hardness of heart</i> and blindness of mind; and all these drew down the judgments of God, and wrath came upon them to the uttermost.</p>
<p>1. THIS whole chapter, as the epistle in general, reads a most awful lesson against <i>backsliders, triflers</i>, and <i>loiterers</i> in the way of salvation. Every believer in Christ is in danger of <i>apostasy</i>, while any remains of the <i>evil heart of unbelief</i> are found in him. God has promised to purify the heart; and the blood of Christ cleanses from all sin. It is therefore the highest wisdom of genuine Christians to look to God for the complete purification of their souls; this they cannot have too soon, and for this they cannot be too much in earnest.</p>
<p>2. No man should defer his salvation to any future time. If God speaks <i>to-day</i>, it is <i>to-day</i> that he should be <i>heard</i> and <i>obeyed</i>. To defer reconciliation to God to any <i>future</i> period, is the most reprehensible and destructive presumption. It supposes that God will indulge us in our sensual propensities, and cause his mercy to tarry for us till we have consummated our iniquitous purposes. It shows that we prefer, at least for the present, the devil to Christ, sin to holiness, and earth to heaven. And can we suppose that God will be thus mocked? Can we suppose that it can at all consistent with his <i>mercy</i> to extend forgiveness to such abominable provocation? What a man sows that shall he reap. If he sows to the flesh, he shall of the flesh reap corruption. Reader, it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p>3. <i>Unbelief</i> has generally been considered the <i>most damning of</i> <i>all sins</i>. I wish those who make this assertion would condescend to explain themselves. What is this <i>unbelief</i> that <i>damns</i> and <i>ruins</i> <i>mankind</i>? Their not <i>permitting their minds to be persuaded of the</i> <i>truths which God speaks</i>. απιστια, from α, negative, and πιστις, <i>faith</i>, signifies <i>faithless</i> or to be <i>without faith</i>. And this is an effect from another cause. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:11">Hebrews 4:11</span>, these very people are said to have <i>fallen through unbelief</i>; but there the word is απειθεια, from α, negative, and πειθω, to <i>persuade.</i> They heard the Divine instructions, they saw God's stupendous miracles; but they would not suffer themselves to be persuaded, that he who said and did such things would perform those other things which he had either threatened or promised: hence they had <i>no faith</i>, because they were <i>unpersuaded</i>; and their <i>unbelief</i> was the <i>effect</i> of their <i>unpersuaded</i> or <i>unpersuadable</i> mind. And their minds were not persuaded of God's truth, because they had ears open only to the dictates of the flesh; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>. Here then is the damning sin, the not inferring, from what God has said and done, that he will do those other things which he has either threatened or promised. And how few are there who are not committing this sin daily! Reader, dost <i>thou</i> in this state dream of heaven? Awake out of sleep!</p>
<p>4. Where there are so many snares and dangers it is impossible to be too watchful and circumspect. Satan, as a roaring lion, as a subtle serpent, or in the guise of an angel of light, is momentarily going about seeking whom he may deceive, blind, and devour; and, when it is considered that the human heart, till entirely renewed, is on his side, it is a miracle of mercy that any soul escapes perdition: no man is safe any longer than he maintains the spirit of <i>watchfulness</i> and <i>prayer</i>; and to maintain such a spirit, he has need of all the means of grace. He who neglects any of them which the mercy of God has placed in his power, tempts the devil to tempt him. As a preventive of backsliding and apostasy, the apostle recommends <i>mutual</i> <i>exhortation</i>. No Christian should live for himself alone; he should consider his fellow Christian as a member of the same body, and feel for him accordingly, and have, succour, and protect him. When this is carefully attended to in religious society, Satan finds it very difficult to make an inroad on the Church; but when coldness, distance, and a want of brotherly love take place, Satan can attack each <i>singly</i>, and, by successive victories over <i>individuals</i>, soon make an easy conquest of the whole.</p>
