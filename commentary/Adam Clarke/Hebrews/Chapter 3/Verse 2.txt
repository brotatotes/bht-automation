<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:2">Hebrews 3:2</span>. <i><b>Who was faithful to him</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:7">Numbers 12:7</span>, God gives this testimony to Moses: <i>My servant Moses - is faithful in all my house</i>; and to this testimony the apostle alludes. <i>House</i> not only means the <i>place</i> where a <i>family dwells</i>, but also the <i>family</i> itself. The whole congregation of Israel was the <i>house</i> or <i>family of God</i>, and God is represented as <i>dwelling among them</i>; and Moses was his <i>steward</i>, and was faithful in the discharge of his office; strictly enforcing the Divine rights; zealously maintaining God's honour; carefully delivering the mind and will of God to the people; proclaiming his promises, and denouncing his judgments, with the most inflexible integrity, though often at the risk of his life. Jesus Christ has his <i>house</i> - the whole great <i>family of mankind</i>, for all of whom he offered his sacrificial blood to God; and the <i>Christian Church</i>, which is especially his <i>own household</i>, is composed of his own <i>children</i> and <i>servants, among</i> and <i>in</i> whom he lives and constantly resides. He has been <i>faithful</i> to the trust reposed in him as the apostle of God; he has faithfully proclaimed the will of the Most High; vindicated the Divine honour against the corrupters of God's worship; testified against them at the continual hazard of his life; and, at last, not only died as a <i>victim</i> to cancel sin, but also as a <i>martyr</i> to his faithfulness. Christ's faithfulness, says <i>Leigh</i>, consists in this: "That he has as fully revealed unto us the doctrine of the Gospel, as Moses did that of the law; and that he hath faithfully performed and fulfilled all the types of himself and all the things signified by Moses' ceremonies, as Moses hath faithfully and distinctly set them down."</p>
<p>But there is a sense given to the word נאמן <i>neeman</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:7">Numbers 12:7</span>, which we translate <i>faithful</i>, by several of the Jewish writers, which is well worthy of note: it signifies, say they, "<i>one to whom</i> <i>secrets are confided, with the utmost confidence of their being</i> <i>safely and conscientiously kept</i>." The secret of God was with Moses, but all the treasures of <i>wisdom</i> and <i>knowledge</i> were in Christ. Life and immortality were comparatively <i>secrets</i> till Christ revealed and illustrated them, and even the <i>Divine nature</i> was but little known, and especially the Divine <i>philanthropy</i>, till Jesus Christ came; and it was Jesus alone who <i>declared</i> that GOD <i>whom no man had ever seen</i>. Moses received the secrets of God, and faithfully taught them to the people; Jesus revealed the <i>whole</i> <i>will of God to mankind</i>. Moses was thus <i>faithful</i> to a small part of mankind, viz. the Jewish people; but in this sense Jesus was <i>faithful</i> to all mankind: for he was the light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Israel.</p>
