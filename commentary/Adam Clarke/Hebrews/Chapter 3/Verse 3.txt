<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:3">Hebrews 3:3</span>. <i><b>For this</b></i> man <i>was counted</i>] As Jesus Christ, in the character of <i>apostle</i> and <i>high priest</i>, is here intended, the word <i>apostle</i>, or this <i>person</i> or <i>personage</i>, should have been supplied, if any, instead of <i>man</i>. Indeed, the pronoun ουτος should have been translated <i>this person</i>, and this would have referred immediately to Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>More glory than Moses</b></i> — We have already seen that the apostle's design is to prove that Jesus Christ is <i>higher than the angels</i>, <i>higher than Moses</i>, and <i>higher than Aaron</i>. That he is higher than the <i>angels</i> has been already proved; that he is <i>higher than Moses</i> he is now proving.</p>
<p><i><b>He who hath builded the house</b></i> — There can be no doubt that a man who builds a house for his own accommodation is more honourable than the house itself; but the <i>house</i> here intended is the <i>Church</i> of God. This Church, here called a <i>house</i> or <i>family</i>, is built by Christ; he is the Head, Governor, Soul and Life of it; he must therefore be <i>greater than Moses</i>, who was only a <i>member</i> and <i>officer</i> in that Church, who never put a stone in this spiritual building but was even himself put in it by the great Architect. Moses was in this house, and faithful in this house; but the house was the house of God, and builded and governed by Christ.</p>
