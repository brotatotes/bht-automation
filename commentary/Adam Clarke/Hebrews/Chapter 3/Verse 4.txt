<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:4">Hebrews 3:4</span>. <i><b>For every house is builded by some</b></i><b> man</b>] The literal sense is plain enough: "Every structure plainly implies an, <i>architect</i>, and an <i>end</i> for which it was formed. The architect may be employed by him for whose use the house is intended; but the <i>efficient</i> cause of the erection is that which is here to he regarded." The word <i>house</i>, here, is still taken in a <i>metaphorical</i> sense as above, it signifies <i>family</i> or <i>Church</i>. Now the general meaning of the words, taken in this sense, is: "Every family has an author, and a head or governor. Man may found families, civil and religious communities, and be the head of these; but God alone is the Head, Author, and Governor, of all the families of the earth; he is the Governor of the universe. But the apostle has a more restricted meaning in the words τα παντα, <i>all these things</i>; and as he has been treating of the Jewish and Christian Churches, so he appears to have them in view here. Who could found the Jewish and Christian Church but God? Who could support, govern, influence, and defend them, but himself? Communities or societies, whether religious or civil, may be founded by <i>man</i>; but God alone can build his own Church. Now as <i>all these things</i> could be builded only by God, so he must be God who has built all these things. But as Jesus is the Founder of the Church, and the Head of it, the word GOD seems here to be applied to <i>him</i>; and several eminent scholars and critics bring this very text as a proof of the supreme Deity of Christ: and the apostle's argument seems to require this; for, as he is proving that Christ is <i>preferred</i> <i>before Moses</i> because <i>he built this house</i>, which Moses could not do, where he to be understood as intimating that this house was built by <i>another</i>, viz. the <i>Father</i>, his whole argument would fall to the ground; and for <i>all this</i>, Moses might be equal, yea, superior to Christ. On this ground Dr. Owen properly concludes: "This then is that which the apostle intends to declare; namely, the ground and reason whence it is that the house was or could be, in that glorious manner, built by Christ, even because he is GOD, and so able to effect it; and by this effect of his power, he is manifested so to be."</p>
