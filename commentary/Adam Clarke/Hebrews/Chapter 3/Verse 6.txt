<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>. <i><b>But Christ as a Son over his own house</b></i> — Moses was faithful as a <i>servant</i> IN the house; Jesus was faithful, as the <i>first-born Son</i>, OVER the house of which he is the Heir and Governor. Here, then, is the conclusion of the argument in reference to Christ's superiority over Moses. Moses did not found the house or family, Christ did; Moses was but <i>in</i> the house, or one of the family, Christ was <i>over</i> the house as its Ruler; Moses was but <i>servant</i> in the house, Christ was the <i>Son</i> and <i>Heir</i>; Moses was in the house of <i>another</i>, Christ in his <i>own house</i>.</p>
<p>It is well known to every learned reader that the pronoun αυτου, without an <i>aspirate</i>, signifies <i>his</i> simply; and that with the <i>aspirate</i>, αυτου, it signifies <i>his own</i>: the word being in this form a contraction, not uncommon, of εαυτου. If we read αυτου without the <i>aspirate</i>, then <i>his</i> must refer to <i>God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:4">Hebrews 3:4</span>.</p>
<p><i>But Christ as a Son over his</i> (that is, God's) <i>house</i>: if we read αυτου, with the <i>aspirate</i>, as some editions do, then what is spoken refers to <i>Christ</i>; and the words above convey the same sense as those words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>: <i>Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own</i> <i>blood</i>. Some editions read the word thus; and it is evident that the edition which our translators used had the word αυτου, <i>his</i> <i>own</i>, and not αυτου, <i>his</i>. The Spanish and London Polyglots have the same reading. From the most ancient MSS. we can get no help to determine which is to be preferred, as they are generally written without accents. The two first editions of the Greek Testament, that of <i>Complutum</i>, 1514, and that of <i>Erasmus</i>, 1516, have αυτου, <i>his</i>; and they are followed by most other editions: but the celebrated edition of Robert <i>Stephens</i>, 1550, has αυτου, <i>his</i> <i>own</i>. The reading is certainly important; but it belongs to one of those difficulties in criticism which, if the context or collateral evidence do not satisfactorily solve it, must remain in doubt; and every reader is at liberty to adopt which reading he thinks best.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose house are we</b></i> — We Christians are his <i>Church</i> and <i>family</i>; he is our Father, Governor, and Head.</p>
<p><i><b>If we hold fast the confidence</b></i> — We are now his Church, and shall <i>continue</i> to be such, and be acknowledged by him IF we maintain our Christian profession, την παρρησιαν, <i>that liberty of</i> <i>access to God</i>, which we now have, and the <i>rejoicing of the hope</i>, i.e. of eternal life, which we shall receive at the resurrection of the dead. The word παρρησια, which is here translated <i>confidence</i>, and which signifies <i>freedom of speech, liberty of</i> <i>access</i>, c., seems to be used here to distinguish an important Christian privilege. Under the old testament no man was permitted to <i>approach to God</i>: even the very mountain on which God published his laws must not be touched by man nor beast and only the high priest was permitted to enter the holy of holies, and that only once a year, on the great day of atonement; and even then he must have the blood of the victim to propitiate the Divine justice. Under the Christian dispensation the way to the holiest is now laid open; and we have παρρησιαν, <i>liberty of access</i>, even to the holiest, by the blood of Jesus. Having such access unto God, by such a Mediator, we may obtain all that grace which is necessary to fit us for eternal glory; and, having the witness of his Spirit in our heart, we have a well grounded hope of endless felicity, and exult in the enjoyment of that hope. But IF we <i>retain not</i> the <i>grace</i>, we shall not inherit the <i>glory</i>.</p>
