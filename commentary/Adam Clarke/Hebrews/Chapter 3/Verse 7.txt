<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:7">Hebrews 3:7</span>. <i><b>Wherefore</b></i> <b>(</b><i><b>as the Holy Ghost saith, Today</b></i> â€” These words are quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:7">Psalms 95:7</span>; and as they were written by David, and attributed here to the Holy Ghost, it proves that David wrote, by the inspiration of God's Holy Spirit. As these words were originally a warning to the Israelites not to provoke God, lest they should be excluded from that <i>rest</i> which he had promised them, the apostle uses them here to persuade the Christians in Palestine to hold fast their religious privileges, and, the grace they had received, lest they should come short of that state of future glory which Christ had prepared for them. The words strongly imply, as indeed does the whole <i>epistle</i>, the <i>possibility of</i> <i>falling from the grace of God</i>, and <i>perishing everlastingly</i>; and without this supposition these words, and all such like, which make more than <i>two-thirds</i> of the whole of Divine revelation, would have neither sense nor meaning. Why should God entreat man to receive his mercy, if he have rendered this impossible? Why should he exhort a believer to persevere, if it be impossible for him to fall away? What contemptible quibbling have men used to maintain a false and dangerous tenet against the whole tenor of the word of God! Angels fell-Adam fell-Solomon fell-and multitudes of believers have fallen, and, for aught we know, rose no more; and yet we are told that <i>we</i> cannot finally lose the benefits of our conversion! Satan preached this doctrine to our first parents; they believed him, sinned, and fell; and brought a whole world to ruin!</p>
