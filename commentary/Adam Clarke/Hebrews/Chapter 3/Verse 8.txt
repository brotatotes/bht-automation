<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8">Hebrews 3:8</span>. <i><b>Harden not your hearts</b></i> — Which ye will infallibly do, if ye <i>will not</i> hear his voice.</p>
<p><i><b>Provocation</b></i> — παραπικρασμος. From παρα, signifying <i>intensity,</i> and πικραινω, to <i>make bitter</i>; the <i>exasperation</i>, or <i>bitter</i> <i>provocation</i>. "The Israelites provoked God <i>first</i> in the wilderness of Sin, (Pelusium,) when they murmured for want of bread, and had the manna given them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:4">Exodus 16:4</span>. From the wilderness of Sin they journeyed to Rephidim, where they provoked God a second time for want of water, and insolently saying, <i>Is the Lord God among us or</i> <i>not</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:2-9">Exodus 17:2-9</span>, on which account the place was called <i>Massah</i> and <i>Meribah</i>. See <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span><i>"</i>, note 1. From Rephidim they went into the wilderness of Sinai, where they received the law, in the beginning of the third year from their coming out of Egypt. Here they provoked God again, by making the golden calf, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:10">Exodus 32:10</span>. After the law was given they were commanded to go directly to Canaan, and take possession of the promised land, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:6">Deuteronomy 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:7">Deuteronomy 1:7</span>: <i>God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in</i> <i>this mount: turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount</i> <i>of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the</i> <i>plain, in the hills, and in the vales, and in the south, and by</i> <i>the seaside, to the land if the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, and</i> <i>unto the great river, the river Euphrates</i>. The Israelites, having received this order, departed from Horeb, and went forward three days' journey, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:33">Numbers 10:33</span>, till they came to Taberah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:3">Numbers 11:3</span>, where they provoked God the fourth time, by murmuring for want of flesh to eat; and for that sin were smitten with a very great plague, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:33">Numbers 11:33</span>; this place was called <i>Kibroth-hattaavah</i>, because there they buried the people who lusted. From Kibroth-hattaavah they went to Hazeroth, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:35">Numbers 11:35</span>, and from thence into the <i>wilderness of Paran</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:16">Numbers 12:16</span>, to a place called <i>Kadesh</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+13:26">Numbers 13:26</span>. Their journey from Horeb to Kadesh is thus described by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:19-21">Deuteronomy 1:19-21</span>: <i>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great</i> <i>and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain</i> <i>of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and, we came to</i> <i>Kadesh-barnea. And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain</i> <i>of the Amorites, which the Lord our God doth give unto us. Behold,</i> <i>the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee; go up and possess</i> <i>it</i>. But the people proposed to Moses to send spies, to bring them an account of the land, and of its inhabitants, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:22">Deuteronomy 1:22</span>. These after forty days returned to Kadesh; and, except Caleb and Joshua, they all agreed in bringing an evil report of the land, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+13:25-32">Numbers 13:25-32</span>; whereby the people were so discouraged that they refused to go up, and proposed to make a captain, and return into Egypt, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:4">Numbers 14:4</span>. Wherefore, having thus shown an absolute disbelief of God's promises, and an utter distrust of his power, he sware that not one of that generation should enter Canaan, except Caleb and Joshua, but should all die in the wilderness, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:20">Numbers 14:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:34">Deuteronomy 1:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:35">Deuteronomy 1:35</span>; and ordered them to <i>turn, and get into the wilderness, by the way</i> <i>of the Red Sea</i>. In that wilderness the Israelites, as Moses informs us, sojourned thirty-eight years, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+2:14">Deuteronomy 2:14</span>: <i>And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were</i> <i>come over the brook Zereb, was thirty and eight years; until all</i> <i>the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the</i> <i>host, as the Lord sware unto them</i>. Wherefore, although the Israelites <i>provoked God to wrath in the wilderness, from the day</i> <i>they came out of the land of Egypt until their arrival in Canaan</i>, as Moses told them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+9:7">Deuteronomy 9:7</span>, their greatest provocation, the provocation in which they showed the greatest degree of evil disposition, undoubtedly was their refusing to go into Canaan from Kadesh. It was therefore very properly termed <i>the bitter</i> <i>provocation</i> and the <i>day of temptation</i>, by way of eminence; and justly brought on them the oath of God, excluding them from his rest in Canaan. To distinguish this from the provocation at Rephidim, it is called <i>Meribah-Kadesh</i>," <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:51">Deuteronomy 32:51</span>.
