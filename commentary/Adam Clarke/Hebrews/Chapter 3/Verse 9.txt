<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:9">Hebrews 3:9</span>. <i><b>When your fathers tempted me</b></i> — It would be better to translate ου <i>where</i> than <i>when</i>, as the Vulgate has done in its <i>ubi</i>; and this translation has been followed by <i>Wiclif, Coverdale</i>, <i>Tindal</i>, and our first translators in general. In my old MS. Bible the 7th, 8th, and 9th verses stand thus:- <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:7-9">Hebrews 3:7-9</span></p>
<p><i>Wherefore as the Holy Gost seith, to-day gif yhe han herde his</i> <i>voyce: nye yhe herden ghour hertis as in wrath-thinge, after the</i> <i>day of temptacioun in desert. Where ghoure fadris temptiden me:</i> <i>provyden and saiden my werkis. Wherefore fourtye yeere I was</i> <i>offendid or wrothe to this generatoun</i>.</p>
<p>In behalf of this translation, Dr. Macknight very properly argues: "The word WHEN implies that, at the time of the <i>bitter</i> <i>provocation</i>, the Israelites had seen God's works <i>forty</i> years; contrary to the <i>history</i>, which shows that the <i>bitter provocation</i> happened, in the beginning of the <i>third</i> year after the Exodus: whereas the translation <i>where</i>, as well as the matter of fact, represents God as saying, by David, that the Israelites tempted God in the wilderness during forty years, notwithstanding all that time they had seen God's miracles."</p>
