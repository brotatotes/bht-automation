<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:1">Hebrews 4:1</span>. <i><b>Let us therefore fear</b></i> — Seeing the Israelites lost the rest of Canaan, through obstinacy and unbelief, let us be afraid lest we come short of the heavenly rest, through the same cause.</p>
<p><i><b>Should seem to come short of it.</b></i> — <i>Lest any of us should</i> <i>actually come short of it</i>; i.e. miss it. See the note on the verb δοκειν, to <i>seem</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>. What the apostle had said before, relative to the <i>rest</i>, might be considered as an allegory; here he explains and applies that allegory, showing that Canaan was a type of the grand privileges of the Gospel of Christ, and of the glorious eternity to which they lead.</p>
<p><i><b>Come short</b></i> — The verb υστερειν is applied here metaphorically; it is an allusion, of which there are many in this epistle, to the <i>races</i> in the Grecian games: he that <i>came short</i> was he who was any distance, no matter how small, <i>behind</i> the winner. Will it avail any of us how near we get to heaven, if the door be shut before we arrive? How dreadful the thought, to have only <i>missed</i> being eternally saved! To <i>run</i> well, and yet to permit the devil, the world, or the flesh, to hinder in the few last steps! Reader, watch and be sober.</p>
