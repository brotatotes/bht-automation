<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:10">Hebrews 4:10</span>. <i><b>For he that is entered into his rest</b></i> — The man who has believed in Christ Jesus has entered into his rest; the state of happiness which he has provided, and which is the forerunner of <i>eternal glory</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath ceased from his own works</b></i> — No longer depends on the observance of Mosaic rites and ceremonies for his justification and final happiness. He rests from all these <i>works of the law</i> as fully as God has rested from his works of <i>creation</i>.</p>
<p>Those who restrain the word <i>rest</i> to the signification of <i>eternal</i> <i>glory</i>, say, that <i>ceasing from our own works</i> relates to the <i>sufferings, tribulations, afflictions</i>, c., of this life as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span>. I understand it as including <i>both</i>.</p>
<p>In speaking of the <i>Sabbath</i>, as typifying a state of blessedness in the other world, the apostle follows the opinions of the Jews of his own and after times. The phrase שבת עלאה ושבת התאה <i>shabbath</i> <i>illaah, veshabbath tethaah</i>, the <i>sabbath above</i>, and the <i>sabbath</i> <i>below</i>, is common among the Jewish writers; and they think that where the plural number is used, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+19:30">Leviticus 19:30</span>: <i>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths</i>, that the <i>lower</i> and <i>higher sabbaths</i> are intended, and that the one is prefigured by the other. See many examples in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
