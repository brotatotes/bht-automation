<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:11">Hebrews 4:11</span>. <i><b>Let us labour therefore</b></i> — The word σπουδασωμεν implies every <i>exertion</i> of <i>body</i> and <i>mind</i> which can be made in reference to the subject. <i>Rebus aliis omissis, hoc agamus</i>; All things else omitted, this one thing let us do. We receive grace, improve grace, retain grace, that we may obtain eternal glory.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest any man fall</b></i> — Lest he fall off from the grace of God, from the Gospel and its blessings, and perish everlastingly. This is the meaning of the apostle, who never supposed that a man might not make final shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience, as long as he was in a state of <i>probation</i>.</p>
