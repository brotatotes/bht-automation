<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>. <i><b>For the word of God</b></i> is <i>quick, and powerful</i>] Commentators are greatly divided concerning the meaning of the phrase 'ολογοςτοςθεου, <i>the word of God</i>; some supposing the whole of <i>Divine revelation</i> to be intended; others, <i>the doctrine of</i> <i>the Gospel faithfully preached</i>; others, the <i>mind of God</i> or the <i>Divine intellect</i>; and others, the <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>, who is thus denominated in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>, c., and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:13">Revelation 19:13</span> the only places in which he is thus <i>incontestably</i> characterized in the New Testament. The disputed text, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:7">1 John 5:7</span>, I leave at present out of the question. In the introduction to this epistle I have produced sufficient evidence to make it very probable that St. Paul was the author of this epistle. In this sentiment the most eminent scholars and critics are now agreed. That Jesus Christ, the <i>eternal, uncreated</i> WORD, is not meant here, is more than probable from this consideration, that St. Paul, in no part of his thirteen acknowledged epistles, ever thus denominates our blessed Lord; nor is he thus denominated by any other of the New Testament writers except St. John. Dr. Owen has endeavoured to prove the contrary, but I believe to no man's conviction who was able to examine and judge of the subject. He has not been able to find more than two texts which even appeared to look <i>his</i> way. The first is, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span>: <i>Us, which - were eye witnesses, and ministers</i> του λογου, <i>of the</i> word; where it is evident the whole of our Lord's ministry is intended. The <i>second</i> is, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span>: <i>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace</i>; where nothing but the <i>gracious doctrine</i> of salvation by faith, the influence of the Divine Spirit, c., c., can be meant: nor is there any legitimate mode of construction with which I am acquainted, by which the words in either place can be personally applied to our Lord. That the phrase was applied to denominate the second subsistence in the glorious Trinity, by Philo and the rabbinical writers, I have already proved in my notes on John 1., where such observations are alone applicable.</p>
<p><i>Calmet</i>, who had read all that either the ancients or moderns have said on this subject, and who does not think that Jesus Christ is here intended, speaks thus: "None of the properties mentioned here can be denied to the Son of God, the eternal Word he sees all things, knows all things, penetrates all things, and can do all things. He is the ruler of the heart, and can turn it where he pleases. He enlightens the soul, and calls it gently and efficaciously, <i>when</i> and <i>how</i> he wills. Finally, he punishes in the most exemplary manner the insults offered to his Father and himself by infidels, unbelievers, and the wicked in general. But it does not appear that the Divine Logos is here intended,</p>
<p>1. Because St. Paul does not use that term to express the Son of God.</p>
<p>2. Because the conjunction γαρ, <i>for</i>, shows that this verse is an inference drawn from the preceding, where the subject in question is concerning the eternal rest, and the <i>means</i> by which it is to be obtained.</p>
<p>It is therefore more natural to explain the term of the <i>word, order</i>, and <i>will</i> of God, for the Hebrews represent the revelation of God as an <i>active</i> being, <i>living</i>, <i>all-powerful</i>, <i>illumined, executing vengeance, discerning</i> and <i>penetrating all</i> <i>things</i>. Thus <i>Wisd. 16:26</i>: 'Thy children, O Lord, know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man, but that it is <i>thy</i> <i>word</i> that preserveth them that put their trust in thee.' See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+8:3">Deuteronomy 8:3</span>. That is, the sacred Scriptures point out and appoint all the <i>means of life</i>. Again, speaking of the Hebrews who were bitten with the fiery serpents, the same writer says, <i>Wisd. 16:12</i>: 'For it was neither herb nor mollifying plaster that restored them to health, but <i>thy word</i>, O Lord, which healeth all things' i.e. which describes and prescribes the means of healing. And it is very likely that the <i>purpose</i> of God, sending the destroying angel to slay the firstborn in Egypt is intended by the same expression, <i>Wisd. 18:15, 16</i>: '<i>Thine almighty word</i> leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, <i>as a fierce man of war</i> into a land of destruction, and brought thine unfeigned commandment as a <i>sharp</i> <i>sword</i>, and, standing up, filled all things with death.' This however may be applied to the eternal Logos, or uncreated Word.</p>
<p>"And this mode of speech is exactly conformable to that of the Prophet Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:10-11">Isaiah 55:10-11</span>, where to the word of God, spoken by his prophets, the same kind of powers are attributed as those mentioned here by the apostle: <i>For as the rain cometh down and the</i> <i>snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the</i> <i>earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to</i> <i>the sower, and bread to the eater; so shall my</i> WORD BE <i>that</i> GOETH FORTH OUT OF MY MOUTH: <i>it shall not return unto me void; but it</i> <i>shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the</i> <i>thing whereto I sent it</i>. The centurion seems to speak a similar language, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:7">Luke 7:7</span>: <i>But say in a word</i>, (αλλα ειπε λογω, <i>speak to</i> thy <i>word</i>,) <i>and</i> <i>my servant shall be healed</i>." This is the sum of what this very able commentator says on the subject.</p>
<p>In Dr. Dodd's collections we find the following: - </p>
<p>"<i>The word of God</i>, which promises to the faithful, an entrance into God's rest in David's time, and now to us, is not a thing which <i>died</i> or was <i>forgotten</i> as soon as it was uttered, but it <i>continues</i> one and the same to all generations; it is ζων, <i>quick</i> or <i>living</i>. So Isaiah says: <i>The word of our God shall stand for</i> <i>ever</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:8">Isaiah 40:8</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:6">Isaiah 51:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:11">Isaiah 55:11</span>; <i>1Esdras 4:38</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span>. <i>And powerful</i>, ενργης, <i>efficacious, active</i>; sufficient, if it be not actually hindered, to produce its effects; <i>effectual</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:6">Philemon 1:6</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span>. <i>And sharper than any two-edged sword</i>; τομωτεροςυπερ, <i>more cutting</i> <i>than</i>. The word of God <i>penetrates deeper</i> into a man than any sword; it enters into the soul and spirit, into all our <i>sensations, passions, appetites</i>, nay, to our very <i>thoughts</i>; and sits as <i>judge</i> of the most <i>secret intentions, contrivances</i>, and <i>sentiments</i> of the <i>heart</i>. <i>Phocylides</i> has an expression very similar to our author, where he says, of reason, 'that it is a weapon which penetrates deeper into a man than a sword.' See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:4">Isaiah 40:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:16">Revelation 2:16</span>.</p>
<p>"<i>Piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit</i>. - When the <i>soul</i> is thus distinguished from the <i>spirit</i>, by the former is meant that <i>inferior faculty</i> by which we <i>think of</i> and <i>desire</i> what concerns our <i>present being</i> and <i>welfare</i>. By <i>spirit</i> is meant a <i>superior power</i> by which we <i>prefer future things</i> to <i>present</i>, by which we are directed to pursue <i>truth</i> and <i>right</i> above all things, and even to despise what is agreeable to our present state, if it stand in competition with, or is prejudicial to, our <i>future</i> <i>happiness</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>. Some have thought that by the expression before us is implied that the <i>word of God</i> is able to bring death, as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira; for, say they, if the <i>soul</i> and <i>spirit</i>, or the <i>joints</i> and <i>marrow</i> are separated one from another, it is impossible that life can remain. But perhaps the meaning of the latter clause may rather be: 'It can divide the joints and divide the marrow; i.e. enter irresistibly into the soul, and produce some sentiment which perhaps it would not willingly have received; and sometimes discover and punish secret, as well as open wickedness.' Mr. <i>Pierce</i> observes that our author has been evidently arguing from a tremendous judgment of God upon the ancient Israelites, the ancestors of those to whom this epistle is directed; and in this verse, to press upon them that care and diligence he had been recommending, he sets before them the efficacy and virtue of the <i>word of God</i>, connecting this verse with the former by a <i>for</i> in the beginning of it; and therefore it is natural to suppose that what he says of the <i>word of God</i> may have a relation to somewhat remarkable in that sore punishment of which he had been speaking, particularly to the destruction of the people by <i>lightning</i>, or <i>fire from heaven</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+10:1-5">Leviticus 10:1-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:1-3">Numbers 11:1-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:35">Numbers 16:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:21">Psalms 78:21</span>. All the expressions in this view will receive an additional force, for nothing is more <i>quick</i> and <i>living</i>, more <i>powerful</i> and <i>irresistible, sharp</i> and <i>piercing</i>, than <i>lightning</i>. If this idea be admitted, the meaning of the last clause in this verse will be, 'That the word of God is a judge, to censure and punish the evil thoughts and intents of the heart.' And this brings the matter home to the exhortation with which our author began, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:13">Hebrews 3:13</span>; for under whatever disguise they might conceal themselves, yet, from such tremendous judgments as God executed upon their fathers, they might learn to judge as Moses did, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+32:23">Numbers 32:23</span>: <i>If ye will not do so, ye have sinned against the Lord; and be sure</i> <i>your sin will find you out</i>." See <i>Hammond, Whitby, Sykes</i>, and <i>Pierce</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Wesley's note on this verse is expressed with his usual precision and accuracy: - </p>
<p>"<i>For the word of God </i>- preached, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>, and armed with threatenings, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3">Hebrews 4:3</span>, <i>is living and powerful</i> - attended with the power of the living God, and conveying either life or death to the hearers; <i>sharper than</i> <i>any two-edged sword</i> - penetrating the heart more than this does the body; <i>piercing</i> quite through, and laying open, <i>the soul and</i> <i>spirit, joints and marrow</i> - the inmost recesses of the mind, which the apostle beautifully and strongly expresses by this heap of figurative words; <i>and is a discerner, not only of the thoughts</i>, but also of the <i>intentions</i>."</p>
<p>The <i>law</i>, and the <i>word of God</i> in general, is repeatedly compared to a <i>two-edged sword</i> among the Jewish writers, חרב שתי פיפיות <i>chereb shetey piphiyoth</i>, the sword with the two mouths. <i>By this</i> <i>sword</i> the man <i>himself lives</i>, and by it he destroys his enemies. This is implied in its two edges. See also <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Is a discerner of the thoughts</b></i> — Και κριτικος ενθυμησεων και εννοιων καρδιας. <i>Is a critic of the propensities and suggestions</i> <i>of the heart</i>. How many have felt this property of God's word where it has been <i>faithfully</i> preached! How often has it happened that a man has seen the whole of his own character, and some of the most private transactions of his life, held up as it were to public view by the preacher; and yet the parties absolutely unknown to each other! Some, thus exhibited, have even supposed that their neighbours must have privately informed the preacher of their character and conduct; but it was the <i>word of God</i>, which, by the direction and energy of the Divine Spirit, thus searched them out, was a <i>critical examiner</i> of the <i>propensities</i> and <i>suggestions</i> <i>of their hearts</i>, and had pursued them through all their public haunts and private ways. Every genuine minister of the Gospel has witnessed such effects as these under his ministry in repeated instances.</p>
<p>But while this effect of the word or true doctrine of God is acknowledged, let it not be supposed that <i>it</i>, of <i>itself</i> can produce such effects. The word of God is compared to a <i>hammer</i> that <i>breaks</i> the <i>rock in pieces</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:29">Jeremiah 23:29</span>; but will a <i>hammer</i> break a <i>stone</i> unless it is applied by the <i>skill</i> and <i>strength</i> of some powerful <i>agent</i>? It is here compared to a <i>two-edged sword</i>; but will a <i>sword cut</i> or <i>pierce</i> to the dividing of joints and marrow, or separation of soul and spirit, unless some <i>hand push</i> and <i>direct</i> it? Surely, no. Nor can even the words and doctrine of God produce any effect but as directed by the experienced teacher, and applied by the Spirit of God. It is an <i>instrument</i> the most apt for the accomplishing of its work; but it will do nothing, can do nothing, but as used by the <i>heavenly</i> <i>workman</i>. To this is the reference in the next verse.</p>
