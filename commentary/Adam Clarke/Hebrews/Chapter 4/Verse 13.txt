<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:13">Hebrews 4:13</span>. <i><b>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest</b></i> — God, from whom this word comes, and by whom it has all its <i>efficacy</i>, is infinitely <i>wise</i>. He well knew how to construct his word, so as to suit it to the state of all <i>hearts</i>; and he has given it that infinite fulness of meaning, so as to suit it to all <i>cases</i>. And so infinite is he in his <i>knowledge</i>, and so <i>omnipresent</i> is he, that the whole creation is constantly <i>exposed to his view</i>; nor is there a <i>creature</i> of the <i>affections, mind</i>, or <i>imagination</i>, that is not constantly under his eye. He marks every rising thought, every budding desire; and such as these are supposed to be the <i>creatures</i> to which the apostle particularly refers, and which are called, in the preceding verse, the <i>propensities</i> and <i>suggestions of the heart</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But all things</b></i> are <i>naked and opened</i>] πανταδεγυμνακαι τετραχηλισμενα. It has been supposed that the phraseology here is <i>sacrificial</i>, the apostle referring to the case, of <i>slaying</i> and <i>preparing a victim</i> to be <i>offered to God</i>. </p>
<p>1. It is <i>slain</i>;</p>
<p>2. It is <i>flayed</i>, so it is <i>naked</i>;</p>
<p>3. It is <i>cut open</i>, so that all the intestines are exposed to view;</p>
<p>4. It is carefully <i>inspected</i> by the priest, to see that all is <i>sound</i> before any part is offered to him who has prohibited all <i>imperfect</i> and <i>diseased</i> offerings; and,</p>
<p>5. It is <i>divided</i> exactly into two equal parts, by being split down the chine from the nose to the rump; and so exactly was this performed, that the spinal marrow was cloven down the centre, one half lying in the divided cavity of each side of the backbone. This is probably the metaphor in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:15">2 Timothy 2:15</span>, where see the note.</p>
<p>But there is reason to suspect that this is not the metaphor here. The verb τραχηλιζω, from which the apostle's τετραχηλισμενα comes, signifies to have the <i>neck bent back</i> so as to expose the face to full view, that every feature might be seen; and this was often done with <i>criminals</i>, in order that they might be the better <i>recognized</i> and <i>ascertained</i>. To this custom <i>Pliny</i> refers in the very elegant and important panegyric which he delivered on the Emperor Trajan, about A. D. 103, when the emperor had made him consul; where, speaking of the great attention which Trajan paid to the public morals, and the care he took to extirpate informers, c., he says: <i>Nihil tamen gratius, nihil saeculo dignius, quam</i> <i>quod contigit</i> desuper intueri delatorum supina ora, retortasque cervices. <i>Agnoscebamus et fruebamur, cum velut piaculares</i> <i>publicae sollicitudinis victimae, supra sanguinem noxiorum ad</i> <i>lenta supplicia gravioresque poenas ducerentur</i>. <i>Plin</i>. Paneg., cap. 34. "There is nothing, however, in this age which affects us more pleasingly, nothing more deservedly, than to behold from above the supine faces and reverted necks of the informers. We thus knew them, and were gratified when, as expiatory victims of the public disquietude, they were led away to lingering punishments, and sufferings more terrible than even the blood of the guilty."</p>
<p>The term was also used to describe the action of <i>wrestlers</i> who, when they could, got their hand under the chin of their antagonists, and thus, by bending both the head and neck, could the more easily give them a fall this stratagem is sometimes seen in ancient monuments. But some suppose that it refers to the custom of <i>dragging them by the neck</i>. Diogenes the philosopher, observing one who had been victor in the Olympic games often fixing his eyes upon a <i>courtezan</i>, said, in allusion to this custom: Ιδε κριον αρειμανιον, ὡς ὑπο του τυχοντος κορασιου τραχηλιζεται. "See how this mighty champion (martial ram) <i>is</i> <i>drawn by the neck by a common girl</i>." See Stanley, page 305.</p>
<p><i><b>With whom we have to do.</b></i> — Προς ὁν ἡμιν ὁ λογος. <i>To whom we</i> <i>must give an account</i>. He is our <i>Judge</i>, and is well qualified to be so, as all our hearts and actions are <i>naked</i> and <i>open</i> to him.</p>
<p>This is the true meaning of λογος in this place; and it is used in precisely the same meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:36">Matthew 12:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:23">Matthew 18:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:2">Luke 16:2</span>.<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:12">Romans 14:12</span>: <i>So then every one of us</i> λογοςδωσει, <i>shall give an account of</i> <i>himself to God</i>. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:17">Hebrews 13:17</span>: <i>They watch for your souls</i>, ὡς λογον αποδωσοντες, <i>as those who must</i> <i>give account</i>. We translate the words, <i>With whom we have to do</i>; of which, though the phraseology is <i>obsolete</i>, yet the meaning is nearly the same. <i>To whom a worde to us</i>, is the rendering of my old MS. and Wiclif. <i>Of whom we speake</i>, is the version of our other early translators.</p>
