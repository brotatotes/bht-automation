<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Seeing then that we have a great high priest</b></i> — It is contended, and very properly, that the particle ουν, which we translate <i>seeing</i>, as if what followed was an immediate inference from what the apostle had been speaking, should be translated <i>now</i>; for the apostle, though he had before mentioned Christ as the <i>High</i> <i>Priest of our profession</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>, and as the <i>High Priest</i> who made <i>reconciliation for the sins of the</i> <i>people</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>, does not attempt to prove this in any of the preceding chapters, but now enters upon that point, and discusses it at great length to the end of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:0">Hebrews 10:0</span>.</p>
<p>After all, it is possible that this may be a resumption of the discourse from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>; the rest of that chapter, and the preceding thirteen verses of this, being considered as a parenthesis. These parts left out, the discourse runs on with perfect connection. It is very likely that the words, here, are spoken to meet an objection of those Jews who wished the Christians of Palestine to apostatize: "You have no tabernacle - no temple - no high priest - no sacrifice for sin. Without these there can be no religion; return therefore to us, who have the perfect temple service appointed - by God." To these he answers: <i>We have a</i> <i>High Priest who is passed into the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God</i>; therefore <i>let us hold fast our profession</i>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>, to which this verse seems immediately to refer.</p>
<p><i>Three</i> things the apostle professes to prove in this epistle: - </p>
<p>The apostle states,</p>
<p>1. That we have a <i>high priest</i>. </p>
<p>2. That this high priest is Jesus, the <i>Son of God</i>; not a <i>son</i> or <i>descendant</i> of <i>Aaron</i>, nor coming in that way, but in a more transcendent line.</p>
<p>3. Aaron and his successors could only pass into the holy of holies, and that once a year; but our High Priest has passed into the heavens, of which that was only the type. There is an allusion here to the high priest going into the holy of holies on the great day of atonement. </p>
<p>1. He left the congregation of the people. </p>
<p>2. He passed through the veil into the holy place, and was not seen even by the priests. </p>
<p>3. He entered through the second veil into the holy of holies, where was the symbol of the majesty of God. Jesus, our High Priest,</p>
<p>1. Left the people at large. </p>
<p>2. He left his disciples by ascending up through the visible heavens, the clouds, as a veil, screening him from their sight. </p>
<p>3. Having passed through these veils, he went immediately to be our Intercessor: thus <i>he passed</i> ουρανους, the visible or ethereal heavens, into the presence of the Divine Majesty; <i>through</i> <i>the heavens</i>, διεληλυθοτα τους ουρανους, and the empyreum, or heaven of heavens.</p>
