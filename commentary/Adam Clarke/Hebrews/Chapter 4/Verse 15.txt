<p>Verse 15. <i><b>For we have not a high priest</b></i> — To the objection, "Your High Priest, if entered into the heavens, can have no participation with you, and no sympathy for you, because out of the reach of human feelings and infirmities," he answers: Ου γαρ εχομεν Αρχιερεα μη δυναμενον συμπαθησαι ταις ασθενειαις ἡμων. <i>We</i> <i>have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weakness</i>. Though he be the Son of God, as to his <i>human nature</i>, and equal in his <i>Divine nature</i> with God; yet, having partaken of human nature, and having submitted to all its trials and distresses, and <i>being</i> <i>in all points tempted like as we are, without</i> feeling or consenting to <i>sin</i>; he is able to succour them that are tempted. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:18">Hebrews 2:18</span>, and the note there.</p>
<p>The words κατα παντα καθ' ὁμοιοτητα might be translated, <i>in all</i> <i>points according to the likeness</i>, i.e. as far as his human nature could bear affinity to ours; for, though he had a perfect human body and human soul, yet that body was perfectly tempered; it was free from all morbid action, and consequently from all <i>irregular movements</i>. His <i>mind</i>, or <i>human soul</i>, being free from all sin, being every way perfect, could feel no <i>irregular temper</i>, nothing that was inconsistent with infinite purity. In all these respects he was different from us; and cannot, as <i>man</i>, sympathize with us in any feelings of this kind: but, as <i>God</i>, he has provided support for the <i>body</i> under all its trials and infirmities, and for the <i>soul</i> he has provided an <i>atonement</i> and <i>purifying sacrifice</i>; so that he cleanses the heart from all unrighteousness, and fills the soul with his Holy Spirit, and makes it his own temple and continual habitation. He took our flesh and blood, a human body and a human soul, and lived a human life. Here was the <i>likeness</i> <i>of sinful flesh</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span>; and by <i>thus</i> assuming human nature, he was completely qualified to make an atonement for the sins of the world.</p>
