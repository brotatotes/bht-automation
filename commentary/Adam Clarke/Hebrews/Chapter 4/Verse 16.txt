<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>. <i><b>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>grace</b></i> — The allusion to the high priest, and his office on the day of atonement, is here kept up. The <i>approach</i> mentioned here is to the כפרת <i>kapporeth</i>, ιλαστηριον, the <i>propitiatory</i> or <i>mercy-seat</i>. This was the covering of the ark of the testimony or covenant, at each end of which was a cherub, and between them the <i>shechinah</i>, or symbol of the Divine Majesty, which appeared to, and conversed with, the high priest. Here the apostle shows the great superiority of the privileges of the new testament above those of the old; for <i>there</i> the high priest <i>only</i>, and he with <i>fear</i> and <i>trembling</i>, was permitted to approach; and that not without the blood of the victim; and if in any thing he transgressed, he might expect to be struck with death. The throne of grace in heaven answers to this propitiatory, but to <i>this</i> ALL may approach who feel their need of salvation; and they may approach μετα παρρησιας, <i>with freedom, confidence, liberty of speech</i>, in opposition to the <i>fear</i> and <i>trembling</i> of the Jewish high priest. Here, nothing is to be feared, provided the heart be right with God, truly sincere, and trusting alone in the sacrificial blood.</p>
<p><i><b>That we may obtain mercy</b></i> — ινα λαβωμεν ελεον. <i>That we may take</i> <i>mercy </i>- that we may receive the pardon of all our sins; there is mercy for the <i>taking</i>. As Jesus Christ <i>tasted death for every man</i>, so <i>every man</i> may go to that propitiatory, and take the mercy that is suited to his degree of guilt.</p>
<p><i><b>And find grace</b></i> — <i>Mercy</i> refers to the pardon of sin, and being brought into the favour of God. <i>Grace</i> is that by which the soul is supported after it has received this mercy, and by which it is purified from all unrighteousness, and upheld in all trials and difficulties, and enabled to prove faithful unto death.</p>
<p><i><b>To help in time of need.</b></i> — εις ευκαιρον βοηθειαν. <i>For a</i> <i>seasonable support</i>; that is, <i>support when necessary</i>, and <i>as</i> necessary, and in <i>due proportion</i> to the necessity. The word βονθεια is properly rendered <i>assistance, help</i>, or <i>support</i>; but it is an assistance in consequence of the <i>earnest cry</i> of the person in distress, for the word signifies to <i>run at the cry</i>, θειν εις βοην, or επιβοηνθειν. So, even at the <i>throne of grace</i>, or great <i>propitiatory</i>, no help can be expected where there is no <i>cry</i>, and where there is no <i>cry</i> there is no <i>felt</i> necessity; for he that <i>feels</i> he is perishing will <i>cry aloud</i> for help, and to such a cry the compassionate High Priest will <i>run</i>; and the <i>time of need</i> is the time in which God will show mercy; nor will he ever delay it <i>when</i> it is <i>necessary</i>. We are not to cry <i>to-day</i> to be helped <i>to-morrow</i>, or at some <i>indefinite time</i>, or at the <i>hour of death</i>. We are to call for mercy and grace <i>when we need them</i>; and we are to expect to receive them <i>when we call</i>. This is a part of our <i>liberty</i> or <i>boldness</i>; we <i>come up</i> to the throne, and we <i>call</i> <i>aloud</i> for mercy, and God hears and dispenses the blessing we need.</p>
<p>That this exhortation of the apostle may not be lost on us, let us consider: -</p>
<p>1. That there is a <i>throne of grace</i>, i.e. a <i>propitiatory</i>, the place where God and man are to <i>meet</i>.</p>
<p>2. That this propitiatory or mercy-seat is sprinkled with the atoning blood of that <i>Lamb of God</i> which taketh away the sin of the world.</p>
<p>3. That we must <i>come up</i>, προσερχωμεθα, to this throne; and this implies <i>faith</i> in the efficacy of the sacrifice.</p>
<p>4. That we must <i>call aloud</i> on God for his mercy, if we expect him to <i>run</i> to our assistance.</p>
<p>5. That we must <i>feel</i> our spiritual necessities, in order to our <i>calling</i> with fervency and earnestness.</p>
<p>6. That calling thus we shall infallibly get what we want; for in Christ Jesus, as a sacrificial offering, God is ever well pleased; and he is also well pleased with all who take refuge in the atonement which he has made.</p>
<p>7. That thus coming, feeling, and calling, we may have the <i>utmost confidence</i>; for we have <i>boldness, liberty of access</i>, <i>freedom of speech</i>; may plead with our Maker without <i>fear</i>; and expect all that heaven has to bestow; because Jesus, who died, sitteth upon the throne! Hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</p>
<p>8. All these are reasons why we should persevere.</p>
