<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>. <i><b>For unto us was the Gospel preached</b></i> — Και γαρ εσμεν ευηγγελισμενοι. <i>For we also have received good tidings as well as</i> <i>they</i>. They had a gracious promise of entering into an earthly rest; we have a gracious promise of entering into a heavenly rest. God gave them every requisite advantage; he has done the same to us. Moses and the elders spoke the word of God plainly and forcibly to them: Christ and his apostles have done the same to us. They might have persevered; so may we: they disbelieved, disobeyed, and fell: and so may we.</p>
<p><i><b>But the word preached did not profit them</b></i> — Αλλ ουκ ωφελησεν ὁ λογος της ακοης εκεινους. But the word of hearing did not profit them. The word and promise to which the apostle most probably refers is that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:20">Deuteronomy 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:21">Deuteronomy 1:21</span>: <i>Ye are come unto to the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord</i> <i>our God doth give unto to us. Behold, the Lord thy God hath set</i> <i>the land before thee; go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy</i> <i>fathers hath said unto thee: fear not</i>. Many exhortations they had to the following effect: <i>Arise, that we may go up against them</i>; <i>for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are</i> <i>ye still? Be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the</i> <i>land; for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there</i> <i>is no want of any thing that is in the earth</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+18:9-10">Judges 18:9-10</span>. But instead of attending to the word of the Lord by Moses, the whole congregation murmured against him and Aaron, <i>and said one to</i> <i>another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:2">Numbers 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:4">Numbers 14:4</span>. But they were dastardly through all their generations. They spoke evil of the pleasant land, and did not give credence to his word. Their minds had been debased by their Egyptian bondage, and they scarcely ever arose to a state of mental nobility.</p>
<p><i><b>Not being mixed with faith in them that heard</b></i> — There are several various readings in this verse, and some of them important. The principal are on the word συγκεκραμενος, <i>mixed</i>; which in the common text refers to ο λογος, <i>the word mixed</i>; but, in ABCD and several others, it is συγκεκραμενους, referring to, and agreeing with, εκεινους, and may be thus translated: <i>The word of hearing</i> <i>did not profit them, they not being mixed with those who heard it</i> <i>by faith</i>. That is, they were not of the same spirit with Joshua and Caleb. There are other variations, but of less importance; but the common text seems best.</p>
<p>The word συγκεκραμενος, <i>mixed</i>, is peculiarly expressive; it is a metaphor taken from the nutrition of the human body by mixing the aliment taken into the stomach with the saliva and gastric juice, in consequence of which it is concocted, digested, reduced into chyle, which, absorbed by the lacteal vessels, and thrown into the blood, becomes the means of increasing and supporting the body, all the solids and fluids being thus generated; so that on this process, properly performed, depend (under God) strength, health, and life itself. Should the most nutritive aliment be received into the stomach, if not <i>mixed</i> with the above juices, it would be rather the means of <i>death</i> than of life; or, in the words of the apostle, it would <i>not profit</i>, because not thus <i>mixed</i>. <i>Faith</i> in the word preached, in reference to that God who sent it, is the grand means of its becoming the power of God to the salvation of the soul. It is not likely that he who does not credit a <i>threatening</i>, when he comes to hear it, will be deterred by it from repeating the sin against which it is levelled; nor can he derive comfort from a <i>promise</i> who does not believe it as a pledge of God's veracity and goodness. Faith, therefore, must be <i>mixed</i> with all that we hear, in order to make the word of God effectual to our salvation.</p>
<p>This very use of the word, and its explanation, we may find in <i>Maximus Tyrius</i>, in his description of health, Dissert. x., page 101. "Health," says he, it is a certain disposition ὑγρων και ξηρων και ψυχρων και θερμων δυναμεων, η ὑπο τεχνης συγκραθεισων καλως, η ὑπο φυσεως ἁρμοσθεισων τεχνικως, which consists in a <i>proper mixture</i> together of the wet and the dry, the cold and the hot, either by an artificial process, or by the skilful economy of nature."</p>
