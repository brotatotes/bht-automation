Verse Hebrews 4:4. For he spake in a certain place — This certain place or somewhere, που, is probably Genesis 2:2; and refers to the completion of the work of creation, and the setting apart the seventh day as a day of rest for man, and a type of everlasting felicity. See the notes on "Genesis 2:1", &c., and see here "Hebrews 2:6".
