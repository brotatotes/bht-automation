<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:5">Hebrews 4:5</span>. <i><b>And in this place again</b></i> â€” In the ninety-fifth Psalm, already quoted, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:3">Psalms 95:3</span>. This was a second rest which the Lord promised to the believing, obedient seed of Abraham; and as it was spoken of in the days of David, when the Jews actually possessed this long promised <i>Canaan</i>, therefore it is evident that <i>that</i> was not the rest which God intended, as the next verse shows.</p>
