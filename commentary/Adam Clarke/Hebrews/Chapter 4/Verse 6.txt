<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:6">Hebrews 4:6</span>. <i><b>It remaineth that some must enter therein</b></i> — Why our translators put in the word <i>must</i> here I cannot even conjecture. I hope it was not to serve a system, as some have since used it: "Some <i>must</i> go to heaven, for so is the doctrine of the decree; and there <i>must</i> be certain persons <i>infallibly</i> brought thither as a reward to Christ for his sufferings; and in this the will of man and free agency can have no part," c, c. Now, supposing that even all this was true, yet it does not exist either positively or by implication in the text. The words επει ουν απολειπεται τινας εισελθειν εις αυτην, literally translated, are as follows: <i>Seeing</i> <i>then it remaineth for some to enter into it</i> or, <i>Whereas therefore</i> <i>it remaineth that some enter into it</i>, which is Dr. <i>Owen's</i> translation, and they to whom it was <i>first preached</i> (οἱ προτερον ευαγγελισθεντες, <i>they to whom the promise was given they who</i> <i>first received the good tidings</i>; i.e., the Israelites, to whom was given the promise of entering into the rest of Canaan) <i>did not</i> <i>enter in because of</i> their <i>unbelief</i>; and the promise still continued to be repeated even in the days of David; therefore, some <i>other rest</i> must be intended.</p>
