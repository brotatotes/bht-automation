<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span>. <i><b>He limiteth a certain day</b></i> â€” The term <i>day</i> signifies not only <i>time</i> in general, but also <i>present time</i>, and a particular <i>space</i>. Day here seems to have the same meaning as <i>rest</i> in some other parts of this verse. The day or time of rest relative to the ancient Jews being over and past, and a <i>long time</i> having elapsed between God's displeasure shown to the disobedient Jews in the wilderness and the days of David, and the true rest not having been enjoyed, God in his mercy has <i>instituted another day</i>-has given <i>another dispensation</i> of mercy and goodness by Christ Jesus; and now it may be said, as formerly, <i>To-day, if ye will hear his</i> <i>voice, harden not your hearts</i>. God <i>speaks</i> now as he spoke <i>before;</i> his <i>voice</i> is in the <i>Gospel</i> as it was in the <i>law</i>. Believe, love, obey, and ye shall enter into this rest.</p>
