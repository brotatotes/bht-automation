They must have known that the יהושע <i>Yehoshua</i> of the Hebrew, which we write <i>Joshua</i>, is everywhere rendered ιησους, <i>Jesus</i>, by the Septuagint; and it is their reading which the apostle follows. It is true the Septuagint generally write Ιησους Ναυη, or Υἱος Ναυη, <i>Jesus Nave</i>, or <i>Jesus, son of Nave</i>, for it is thus they translate יהושע בן נון <i>Yehoshua ben Nun</i>, Joshua the son of Nun; and this is sufficient to distinguish it from <i>Jesus, son of David</i>. But as Joshua, the captain general of Israel, is above intended, the word should have been written <i>Joshua</i>, and not <i>Jesus</i>. One MS., merely to prevent the wrong application of the name, has Ιησους ὁ του Ναυη, <i>Jesus the son of Nave</i>. <i>Theodoret</i> has the same in his comment, and one <i>Syriac</i> version has it in the text. It is <i>Joshua</i> in Coverdale's Testament, 1535; in Tindal's 1548; in that edited by Edmund Becke, 1549; in Richard Cardmarden's, Rouen, 1565; several modern translators, Wesley, Macknight, Wakefield, c., read <i>Joshua</i>, as does our own in the <i>margin</i>. What a pity it had not been in the text, as all the smaller Bibles have no marginal readings, and many simple people are bewildered with the expression.</p>
<p>The apostle shows that, although Joshua did bring the children of Israel into the promised land, yet this could not be the intended rest, because <i>long after</i> this time the Holy Spirit, by David, speaks of this rest the apostle, therefore, concludes,</p>
