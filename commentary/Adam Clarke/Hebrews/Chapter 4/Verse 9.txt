<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9">Hebrews 4:9</span>. <i><b>There, remaineth therefore a rest to the people of</b></i> <i>God.</i>] It was not,</p>
<p>1. The rest of the <i>Sabbath</i>; it was not,</p>
<p>2. The <i>rest</i> in the <i>promised land</i>,</p>
<p>for the psalmist wrote long after the days of Joshua; therefore there is <i>another rest</i>, a state of <i>blessedness</i>, for the people of God; and this is the <i>Gospel</i>, the blessings it procures and communicates, and the <i>eternal glory</i> which it prepares for, and has promised to, genuine believers.</p>
<p>There are two words in this chapter which we indifferently translate <i>rest</i>, καταπαυσις and σαββατισμος. the <i>first</i> signifying a <i>cessation from labour</i>, so that the weary body is <i>rested</i> and <i>refreshed</i>; the <i>second</i> meaning, not only a rest from labour, but a <i>religious rest; sabbatismus</i>, a rest of a sacred kind, of which both soul and body partake. This is true, whether we understand the rest as referring to <i>Gospel blessings</i>, or to <i>eternal felicity</i>, or to <i>both</i>.</p>
