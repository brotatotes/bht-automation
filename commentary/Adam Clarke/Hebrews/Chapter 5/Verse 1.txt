<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span>. <i><b>For every high priest taken from among men</b></i> — This seems to refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+21:10">Leviticus 21:10</span>, where it is intimated that the high priest shall be taken מאחיו <i>meachaiv</i>, from his brethren; i.e. he shall be of the tribe of Levi, and of the family of Aaron.</p>
<p><i><b>Is ordained for men</b></i> — Ὑπερ ανθρωπων καθισταται τα προς τον Θεον. Is appointed to preside over the Divine worship in those things which relate to man's salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>That he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins</b></i> — God ever appeared to all his followers in two points of view: </p>
<p>1. As the author and dispenser of all temporal good.</p>
<p>2. As their lawgiver and judge. In reference to this twofold view of the Divine Being, his worship was composed of two different parts:</p>
<p>1. <i>Offerings</i> or <i>gifts</i>. </p>
<p>2. <i>Sacrifices</i>. </p>
<p>1. As the creator and dispenser of all good, he had <i>offerings</i> by which his <i>bounty</i> and <i>providence</i> were acknowledged. </p>
<p>2. As the <i>lawgiver</i> and <i>judge</i>, against whose injunctions offences had been committed, he had <i>sacrifices</i> offered to him to make atonement for sin. The δωρα, or <i>gifts</i>, mentioned here by the apostle, included every kind of <i>eucharistical</i> offering.</p>
<p>The θυσιαι, <i>sacrifices</i>, included <i>victims</i> of every sort, or <i>animals</i> whose <i>lives</i> were to be offered in sacrifice, and their blood poured out before God, as an atonement for sins. The high priest was the mediator between God and the people; and it was his office, when the people had brought these gifts and sacrifices, to offer them to God in their behalf. The people could not legitimately offer their own offerings, they must be all brought to the priest, and he alone could present them to God. As we have a high priest over the house of God, to offer all <i>our</i> <i>gifts</i> and his <i>own sacrifice</i>, therefore we may come with boldness to the throne of grace. See above.</p>
