<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:10">Hebrews 5:10</span>. <i><b>Called of God a high priest</b></i> — προσαγορευθεις. Being <i>constituted, hailed</i>, and <i>acknowledged</i> to be a high priest. In <i>Hesychius</i> we find προσαγορευει, which he translates ασπαζεται. hence we learn that one meaning of this word is <i>to salute</i>; as when a man was constituted or anointed king, those who accosted him would say, <i>Hail king</i>! On this verse Dr. Macknight has the following note, with the insertion of which the reader will not be displeased: "As our Lord, in his conversation with the Pharisees, recorded <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:43">Matthew 22:43</span>, spake of it as a thing certain of itself, and universally known and acknowledged by the Jews, that David wrote the 110th Psalm by inspiration, concerning the Christ or Messiah; the apostle was well founded in applying the whole of that Psalm to Jesus. Wherefore, having quoted the fourth verse, <i>Thou art a</i> <i>priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec</i>, as directed to Messiah, David's Lord, he justly termed that speech of the Deity a <i>salutation</i> of Jesus, according to the true import of the word προσαγορευθεις, which properly signifies to <i>address</i> one by his <i>name</i>, or <i>title</i>, or <i>office</i>; accordingly <i>Hesychius</i> explains προσαγορευομαι by ασπαζομαι. Now, that the deep meaning of this <i>salutation</i> may be understood, I observe, <i>First</i>, that, by the testimony of the inspired writers, Jesus sat down at the right hand of God when he returned to heaven, after having finished his ministry upon earth; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>. Not, however, <i>immediately</i>, but <i>after</i> that he had offered the sacrifice of himself in heaven, by presenting his crucified body before the presence of God; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:10">Hebrews 10:10</span>. <i>Secondly</i>, I observe, that God's <i>saluting</i> Messiah <i>a priest after</i> <i>the order of Melchisedec</i>, being mentioned in the psalm after God is said to have invited him <i>to sit at his right hand</i>, it is reasonable to think the salutation was given him after he had offered the sacrifice of himself; and had taken his seat at God's right hand. Considered in this order, the <i>salutation</i> of Jesus, as a priest <i>after the order of Melchisedec</i>, was a public declaration on the part of God that he accepted the sacrifice of himself, which Jesus then offered, as a sufficient atonement for the sin of the world, and approved of the whole of his ministrations on earth, and confirmed all the effects of that meritorious sacrifice, And whereas we are informed in the psalm that, after God had <i>invited</i> his Son, in the human nature; to sit at his right hand as Governor of the world, and foretold the blessed fruits of his government, he published the <i>oath</i> by which he made him <i>a</i> <i>Priest for ever</i>, before he sent him into the world to accomplish the salvation of mankind; and declared that he would never repent of that oath: <i>The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent; Thou art</i> <i>a Priest for ever after the similitude of Melchisedec</i>. It was, in effect, a solemn publication of the method in which God would pardon sinners; and a promise that the effects of his Son's government as a <i>King</i>, and of his ministrations as a <i>Priest</i>, should be eternal; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span>. Moreover, as this solemn declaration of the dignity of the Son of God, as a King and a Priest for ever in the human nature, was made in the hearing of the angelical hosts, it was designed for this instruction, that they might understand their subordination to God's Son, and pay him that homage that is due to him as Governor of the world, and as Saviour of the human race; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span>. The above explanation of the import of God's <i>saluting</i> Jesus a Priest for ever, is founded on the apostle's reasonings in the <i>seventh</i> and following chapters, where he enters into the deep meaning of the <i>oath</i> by which that salutation was conferred."</p>
