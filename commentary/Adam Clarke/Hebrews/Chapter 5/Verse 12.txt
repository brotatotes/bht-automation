<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>. <i><b>For when for the time</b></i> — They had heard the Gospel for <i>many years</i>, and had professed to be Christians for a <i>long time</i>; on these accounts they might reasonably have been expected to be well instructed in Divine things, so as to be able to instruct others.</p>
<p><i><b>Which</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>the first principles</b></i> — Τινα τα στοιχεια. <i>Certain</i> <i>first principles</i> or <i>elements</i>. The word τινα is not the nominative plural, as our translators have supposed, but the accusative case, governed by διδασκειν. and therefore the literal translation of the passage is this: <i>Ye have need that</i> one <i>teach</i> <i>you a second time</i> (παλιν) <i>certain elements of the doctrines of</i> <i>Christ</i>, or <i>oracles of God</i>; i.e. the notices which the prophets gave concerning the <i>priesthood</i> of Jesus Christ, such as are found in Psa. 110:, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:0">Isaiah 53:0</span>: By the <i>oracles of God</i> the writings of the <i>Old Testament</i>, are undoubtedly meant.</p>
<p><i><b>And are become such</b></i> — The words seem to intimate that they had once been better instructed, and had now forgotten that teaching; and this was occasioned by their being <i>dull of hearing</i>; either they had not <i>continued</i> to hear, or they had heard so <i>carelessly</i> that they were not profited by what they heard. They had probably totally omitted the preaching of the Gospel, and consequently forgotten all they had learned. Indeed, it was to reclaim those Hebrews from backsliding, and preserve them from total <i>apostasy</i>, that this epistle was written.</p>
<p><i><b>Such as have need of milk</b></i> — <i>Milk</i> is a metaphor by which many authors, both sacred and profane, express the <i>first principles</i> of <i>religion</i> and <i>science</i>; and they apply <i>sucking</i> to learning; and every student in his novitiate, or commencement of his studies, was likened to an <i>infant</i> that derives all its nourishment from the breast of its mother, not being able to digest any other kind of food. On the contrary, those who had well learned all the first principles of religion and science, and knew how to apply them, were considered as <i>adults</i> who were capable of receiving στερεα τροφη, <i>solid food</i>; i.e. the more difficult and sublime doctrines. The rabbins abound with this figure; it occurs frequently in <i>Philo</i>, and in the Greek ethic writers also. In the famous Arabic poem called [Arabic] <i>al Bordah</i>, written by Abi Abdallah Mohammed ben Said ben Hamad Albusiree, in praise of Mohammed and his religion, every couplet of which ends with the letter [Arabic] mim, the first letter in Mohammed's name, we meet with a couplet that contains a similar sentiment to that of the apostle: - </p>
<p>Dr. Owen observes that there are two Sorts of hearers of the Gospel, which are here expressed by an elegant metaphor or similitude; this consists,</p>
<p>1. In the <i>conformity</i> that is between bodily food and the Gospel as preached. </p>
<p>2. In the <i>variety</i> of natural food as suited to the various states of them that feed on it, answered by the truths of the Gospel, which are of <i>various</i> <i>kinds</i>; and, in exemplification of this metaphor, natural food is reduced to two kinds: 1. <i>milk</i>; 2. <i>strong</i> or <i>solid meat</i>; and those who feed on these are reduced to two sorts: 1. <i>children</i>; 2. <i>men of</i> <i>ripe age</i>. Both of which are applied to hearers of the Gospel. </p>
<p>2. The <i>Old Testament</i> in general; the holy men of old having spoken by the <i>inspiration</i> of the Divine Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>, and in the text under consideration.</p>
<p>3. It signifies <i>Divine revelation</i> in general, because all delivered immediately from God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>. When we consider what respect was paid by the heathens to their oracles, which were supposed to be delivered by those gods who were the objects of their adoration, but which were only <i>impostures</i>, we may then learn what respect is due to the <i>true oracles</i> of God.</p>
<p>Among the heathens the credit of oracles was so great, that in all doubts and disputes their determinations were held sacred and inviolable; whence vast numbers flocked to them for advice in the management of their affairs, and no business of any importance was undertaken, scarcely any war waged or peace concluded, any new form of government instituted or new laws enacted, without the advice and approbation of the oracle. <i>Croesus</i>, before he durst venture to declare war against the Persians, consulted not only the most famous oracles of Greece, but sent ambassadors as far as Libya, to ask advice of Jupiter Ammon. <i>Minos</i>, the Athenian lawgiver, professed to receive instructions from Jupiter how to model his intended government; and <i>Lycurgus</i>, legislator of Sparta, made frequent visits to the Delphian Apollo, and received from him the platform of the Lacedemonian commonwealth. See <i>Broughton</i>.</p>
<p>What a reproach to Christians, who hold the Bible to be a collection of the oracles of God, and who not only do not consult it in the momentous concerns of either this or the future life, but go in direct opposition to it! Were every thing conducted according to these oracles, we should have neither war nor desolation in the earth; families would be well governed, and individuals universally made happy.</p>
<p>Those who consulted the ancient oracles were obliged to go to enormous expenses, both in <i>sacrifices</i> and in <i>presents</i> to the <i>priests</i>. And when they had done so, they received oracles which were so <i>equivocal</i>, that, howsoever the event fell out, they were capable of being interpreted <i>that way</i>.</p>
