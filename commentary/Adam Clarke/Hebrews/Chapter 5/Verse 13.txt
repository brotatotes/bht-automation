<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:13">Hebrews 5:13</span>. <i><b>For every one that useth milk</b></i> — It is very likely that the apostle, by using this term, refers to the <i>doctrines of</i> <i>the law</i>, which were only the <i>rudiments</i> of religion, and were intended to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</p>
<p><i><b>The word of righteousness</b></i> — αογος δικαιοσυνης. <i>The doctrine of</i> <i>justification</i>. I believe this to be the apostle's meaning. He that uses <i>milk</i>-rests in the ceremonies and observances of the law, <i>is unskilful in the doctrine of justification</i>; for this requires faith in the sacrificial death of the promised Messiah.</p>
