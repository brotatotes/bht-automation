<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</span>. <i><b>Who can have compassion on the ignorant</b></i> — The word μετριοπαθειν, signifies, not merely to have compassion, but to <i>act</i> <i>with moderation</i>, and to bear with each in <i>proportion</i> to his ignorance, weakness, and untoward circumstances, all taken into consideration with the offences he has committed: in a word, to <i>pity, feel for</i>, and <i>excuse</i>, as far as possible; and, when the provocation is at the highest, to <i>moderate one's passion</i> towards the culprit, and be <i>ready to pardon</i>; and when punishment must be administered, to do it in the <i>gentlest manner</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of αγνοουσι, <i>the ignorant</i>, one MS. only, but that of high repute, has ασθενουσι, <i>the weak</i>. Most men sin much through <i>ignorance</i>, but this does not excuse them if they have within reach the means of instruction. And the great majority of the human race sin through <i>weakness</i>. The principle of evil is <i>strong</i> in them; the occasions of sin are many; through their fall from God they are become exceedingly <i>weak</i>; and what the apostle calls, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>, that ευπεριστατον αμαρτιαν, <i>the well-circumstanced sin</i>, often occurs to every man. But, as in the above ease, weakness itself is no excuse, when the means of strength and succour are always at hand. However, all these are circumstances which the Jewish high priest took into consideration, and they are certainly not less attended to by the High Priest of our profession.</p>
<p>The reason given why the high priest should be slow to punish and prone to forgive is, that he himself is also <i>compassed with</i> <i>weakness</i>; περικειται ασθενειαν; <i>weakness lies all around him</i>, it is his <i>clothing</i>; and as he feels his clothing, so should he feel <i>it</i>; and as he feels it, so he should deplore it, and compassionate others.</p>
