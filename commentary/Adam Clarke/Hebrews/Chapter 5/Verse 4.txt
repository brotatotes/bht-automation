<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:4">Hebrews 5:4</span>. <i><b>This honour</b></i> — τηντιμην undoubtedly signifies here <i>the</i> <i>office</i>, which is one meaning of the word in the best Greek writers. It is here an <i>honourable office</i>, because the man is the high priest of God, and is appointed by God himself to that office.</p>
<p><i><b>But he that is called of God, as</b></i> was <i>Aaron.</i>] God himself appointed the tribe and family out of which the high priest was to be taken, and Aaron and his sons were expressly chosen by God to fill the office of the high priesthood. As God alone had the right to appoint his own priest for the Jewish nation, and man had no authority here; so God alone could provide and appoint a high priest for the whole human race. Aaron was thus appointed for the Jewish people; Christ, for all mankind.</p>
<p>Some make this "an argument for the <i>uninterrupted succession of</i> <i>popes and their bishops</i> in the Church, who alone have the authority to ordain for the sacerdotal office; and whosoever is not thus appointed is, with them, illegitimate." It is idle to employ time in proving that there is no such thing as an <i>uninterrupted succession</i> of this kind; it does not exist, it never did exist. It is a silly fable, invented by ecclesiastical tyrants, and supported by clerical coxcombs. But were it even true, it has nothing to do with the text. It speaks merely of the appointment of a high priest, the succession to be preserved in the tribe of Levi, and in the family of Aaron. But even this succession was <i>interrupted</i> and <i>broken</i>, and the office itself was to cease on the coming of Christ, after whom there could be no high priest; nor can Christ have any successor, and therefore he is said to be a <i>priest for ever</i>, for he ever liveth the intercessor and sacrifice for mankind. The verse, therefore, has nothing to do with the <i>clerical office</i>, with preaching God's holy word, or administering the sacraments; and those who quote it in this way show how little they understand the Scriptures, and how ignorant they are of the nature of their own office.</p>
