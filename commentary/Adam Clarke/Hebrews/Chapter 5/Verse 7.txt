<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>. <i><b>Who in the days of his flesh</b></i> — The time of his incarnation, during which he took all the infirmities of human nature upon him, and was afflicted in his body and human soul just as other men are, irregular and sinful passions excepted.</p>
<p><i><b>Offered up prayers and supplications</b></i> — This is one of the most difficult places in this epistle, if not in the whole of the New Testament. The labours of learned men upon it have been prodigious; and even in <i>their</i> sayings it is hard to find the meaning.</p>
<p>I shall take a <i>general view</i> of this and the two following verses, and then examine the particular expressions.</p>
<p>It is probable that the apostle refers to something in the agony of our Lord, which the evangelists have not distinctly marked.</p>
<p>The Redeemer of the world appears here as simply man; but he is the representative of the whole human race. He must make expiation for sin by <i>suffering</i>, and he can suffer only as man. <i>Suffering</i> was as necessary as <i>death</i>; for man, because he has <i>sinned</i>, must <i>suffer</i>, and because he has <i>broken the law</i>, should <i>die</i>. Jesus took upon himself the nature of man, subject to all the trials and distresses of human nature. He is now making atonement; and he begins with sufferings, as sufferings commence with human life; and he terminates with death, as that is the <i>end</i> of human existence in this world. <i>Though he was the Son of God</i>, conceived and born without sin, or any thing that could render him <i>liable</i> to suffering or death, and only suffered and died through infinite condescension; yet, to constitute him a complete Saviour, he must submit to whatever the law required; and therefore he is stated to have <i>learned</i> OBEDIENCE <i>by the things which he suffered</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:8">Hebrews 5:8</span>, that is, <i>subjection</i> to all the requisitions of the law; and being <i>made perfect</i>, that is, having <i>finished</i> the whole by <i>dying</i>, he, by these means, became the <i>author of eternal salvation to all them</i> <i>who obey him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>; to them who, according to his own command, repent and believe the Gospel, and, under the influence of his Spirit, walk in holiness of life. "But he appears to be under the most dreadful apprehension of death; for <i>he offered up</i> <i>prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto him</i> <i>that was able to save him from death</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>." I shall consider this first in the common point of view, and refer to the subsequent notes. This fear of death was in Christ a widely different thing from what it is in men; <i>they</i> fear death because of what lies <i>beyond</i> the grave; <i>they</i> have <i>sinned</i>, and they are afraid to meet their <i>Judge</i>. Jesus could have no fear on these grounds: he was now suffering for man, and he felt as <i>their</i> expiatory victim; and God only can tell, and perhaps neither men nor angels can conceive, how great the suffering and agony must be which, in the sight of infinite Justice, was requisite to make this atonement. <i>Death</i>, temporal and eternal, was the portion of man; and now Christ is to <i>destroy death</i> by agonizing and dying! The tortures and torments necessary to effect this destruction Jesus Christ alone could feel, Jesus Christ alone could sustain, Jesus Christ alone can comprehend. We are referred to them in this most solemn verse; but the apostle himself only drops <i>hints</i>, he does not attempt to explain them: he prayed; he supplicated with strong crying and tears; and he was <i>heard</i> in reference to that <i>which he feared</i>. His prayers, as our <i>Mediator</i>, were answered; and his sufferings and death were complete and effectual as our <i>sacrifice</i>. This is the glorious sum of what the apostle here states; and it is enough. We may hear it with awful respect; and adore him with silence whose grief had nothing common in it to that of other men, and is not to be estimated according to the measures of human miseries. It was: - </p>
<p><i><b>Prayers and supplications, c.</b></i> — There may be an allusion here to the manner in which the Jews speak of prayer, c. "Rabbi Yehudah said: All human things depend on repentance and the <i>prayers</i> which men make to the holy blessed God especially if <i>tears</i> be poured out with the prayers. There is no <i>gate</i> which <i>tears</i> will not pass through." <i>Sohar, Exod</i>., fol. 5.</p>
<p>"There are three degrees of prayer, each surpassing the other in sublimity <i>prayer, crying</i>, and <i>tears</i>: prayer is made in silence; crying, with a loud voice; but tears surpass all." <i>Synops. Sohar</i>, p. 33.</p>
<p>The apostle shows that Christ made every species of prayer, and those especially by which they allowed a man must be successful with his Maker.</p>
<p>The word ικετηριας, which we translate <i>supplications</i>, exists in no other part of the New Testament. ικετης signifies a <i>supplicant</i>, from ικομαι, <i>I come</i> or <i>approach</i>; it is used in this connection by the purest Greek writers. Nearly the same words are found in Isocrates, <i>De Pace</i>: Ἱκετηριας πολλας και δεησεις ποιουμενοι. <i>Making many supplications and prayers</i>. Ἱκετηρια, says Suidas, καλειται ελαιας κλαδος, στεμματι εστεμμενος· - εστιν, ἡν οἱ δεομενοι κατατιθενται που, η μετα χειρας εχουσις. "<i>Hiketeria</i> is a branch of olive, rolled round with wool - is what suppliants were accustomed to deposite in some place, or to carry in their hands." And ικετης, <i>hiketes</i>, he defines to be, ὁ δουλοπρεπως παρακαλων, και δεομενος περι τινος ὁτουουν. "He who, in the most humble and servile manner, entreats and begs any thing from another." In reference to this custom the Latins used the phrase <i>velamenta pratendere</i>, "to hold forth these covered branches," when they made supplication; and <i>Herodian</i> calls them ικετηριας θαλλους, "branches of supplication." <i>Livy</i> mentions the custom frequently; see lib. xxv. cap. 25: lib. xxix. c. 16; lib. xxxv. c. 34; lib. xxxvi. c. 20. The place in lib. xxix. c. 16, is much to the point, and shows us the full force of the word, and nature of the custom. "<i>Decem legati Locrensium, obsiti</i> <i>squalore et sordibus, in comitio sedentibus consulibus velamenta</i> <i>supplicium, ramos oleae (ut Graecis mos est,) porrigentes, ante</i> <i>tribunal cum flebili vociferatione humi procubuerunt</i>." "Ten delegates from the Locrians, squalid and covered with rags, came into the hall where the consuls were sitting, <i>holding out in their</i> <i>hands olive branches covered with wool</i>, according to the custom of the Greeks; and prostrated themselves on the ground before the tribunal, with weeping and loud lamentation." This is a remarkable case, and may well illustrate our Lord's situation and conduct. The Locrians, pillaged, oppressed, and ruined by the consul, <i>Q. Plemmius</i>, send their delegates to the Roman government to implore protection and redress they, the better to represent their situation, and that of their oppressed fellow citizens, take the <i>hiketeria</i>, or <i>olive branch wrapped round with wool</i>, and present themselves before the consuls in open court, and with wailing and loud outcries make known their situation. The senate heard, arrested Plemmius, loaded him with chains, and he expired in a dungeon. Jesus Christ, the representative of and delegate from the whole human race, oppressed and ruined by Satan and sin, with the <i>hiketeria</i>, or ensign of a most distressed suppliant, presents himself before the throne of God, with <i>strong crying and</i> <i>tears</i>, and prays against <i>death</i> and his ravages, in behalf of those whose representative he was; and he was <i>heard in that he</i> <i>feared</i>-the evils were removed, and the oppressor cast down. Satan was bound, he was spoiled of his dominion, and is reserved in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day.</p>
<p>Every scholar will see that the words of the Roman historian answer exactly to those of the apostle; and the allusion in both is to the same custom. I do not approve of allegorizing or spiritualizing; but the allusion and similarity of the expressions led me to make this application. Many others would make more of this circumstance, as the allusion in the text is so pointed to this custom. Should it appear to any of my readers that I should, after the example of great names, have gone into this house of Rimmon, and bowed myself there, they will pardon their servant in this thing.</p>
<p><i><b>To save him from death</b></i> — I have already observed that Jesus Christ was the <i>representative</i> of the human race; and have made some observations on the peculiarity of his sufferings, following the common acceptation of the words in the text, which things are true, howsoever the text may be interpreted. But here we may consider the pronoun αυτον, <i>him</i>, as implying the <i>collective body</i> of mankind; <i>the children who were partakers of flesh and blood</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>; <i>the seed of Abraham</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16">Hebrews 2:16</span>, <i>who through fear of death were all their life subject to bondage</i>. So he <i>made supplication with strong crying and tears to him who</i> <i>was able to save</i> THEM <i>from death</i>; for I consider the τουτους, <i>them</i>, of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:15">Hebrews 2:15</span>, the same or implying the same thing as αυτον, <i>him</i>, in this verse; and, thus understood, all the difficulty vanishes away. On this interpretation I shall give a paraphrase of the whole verse: <i>Jesus Christ, in the days of his</i> <i>flesh</i>, (for he was incarnated that he might redeem the <i>seed of</i> <i>Abraham</i>, the fallen race of man,) and in his expiatory sufferings, when representing the whole human race, <i>offered up prayers and</i> <i>supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him who was able</i> <i>to save</i> THEM <i>from death</i>: the intercession was prevalent, the passion and sacrifice were accepted, the sting of death was extracted, and Satan was dethroned.</p>
<p>If it should be objected that this interpretation occasions a very unnatural change of <i>person</i> in these verses, I may reply that the change made by my construction is not greater than that made between verses <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:6">Hebrews 5:6</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>; in the first of which the apostle speaks of <i>Melchisedec</i>, who at the conclusion of the verse appears to be antecedent to the relative <i>who</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>; and yet, from the nature of the subject, we must understand Christ to be meant. And I consider, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:8">Hebrews 5:8</span>, <i>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which</i> <i>he suffered</i>, as belonging, not only to Christ considered in his <i>human nature</i>, but also to him in his <i>collective capacity</i>; i.e., belonging to all the sons and daughters of God, who, by means of suffering and various chastisements, <i>learn submission, obedience</i> and <i>righteousness</i>; and this very subject the apostle treats in considerable detail in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2-11">Hebrews 12:2-11</span>, to which the reader will do well to refer.</p>
