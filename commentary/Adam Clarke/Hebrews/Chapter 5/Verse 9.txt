<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>. <i><b>And being made perfect</b></i> — και τελειωθεις. And having <i>finished</i> all-having <i>died</i> and <i>risen again</i>. τελειωθηναι signifies to have <i>obtained the goal</i>; to <i>have ended one's labour</i>, and enjoyed the fruits of it. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>: <i>The spirits of just men made perfect</i>, πνευμασι δικαιων τετελειωμενων, means the souls of those who have gained <i>the goal</i>, and <i>obtained the prize</i>. So, when Christ had <i>finished</i> his course of tremendous sufferings, and consummated the whole by his death and resurrection, he became αιτιος σωτηριας αιωνιος, <i>the cause of</i> <i>eternal salvation unto all them who obey him</i>. He was consecrated both highs priest and sacrifice by his offering upon the cross.</p>
<p>"In this verse," says Dr. Macknight, "<i>three</i> things are clearly stated: </p>
<p>1. That <i>obedience</i> to Christ is equally necessary to salvation with <i>believing</i> on him. </p>
<p>2. That he was made perfect as a high priest by offering himself a sacrifice for sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span>.</p>
<p>3. That, by the merit of that sacrifice, he hath obtained pardon and eternal life for them who obey him."</p>
<p>He <i>tasted death for</i> <i>every man</i>; but he is the <i>author</i> and <i>cause</i> of eternal salvation only to them who <i>obey him</i>. It is not merely <i>believers</i>, but obedient believers, that shall be finally saved. Therefore this text is an absolute, unimpeachable evidence, that it is not the imputed obedience of Christ that saves any man. Christ has bought men by his blood; and by the infinite merit of his death he has purchased for them an endless glory; but, in order to be prepared for it, the sinner must, through that grace which God withholds from no man, repent, turn from sin, believe on Jesus as being a sufficient ransom and sacrifice for his soul, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, be a worker together with him, walk in conformity to the Divine will through this Divine aid, and continue faithful unto death, through him, out of whose fulness he may receive grace upon grace.</p>
