<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:1">Hebrews 6:1</span>. <i><b>Therefore</b></i> — Because ye have been so indolent, <i>slow of</i> <i>heart</i>, and have still so many advantages.</p>
<p><i><b>Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ</b></i> — Ceasing to continue in the state of <i>babes</i>, who must be fed with <i>milk</i>-with the <i>lowest</i> doctrines of the Gospel, when ye should be capable of understanding the highest.</p>
<p><i><b>Let us go on unto perfection</b></i> — Let us never rest till we are <i>adult Christians</i>-till we are saved from all sin, and are filled with the spirit and power of Christ.</p>
<p>The words τον της αρχης· του Χριστου λογον might be translated, <i>The discourse of the beginning of Christ</i>, as in the <i>margin</i>; that is, the account of his <i>incarnation</i>, and the different types and ceremonies in the law by which his advent, nature, office, and miracles were pointed out. The whole law of Moses pointed out <i>Christ</i>, as may be seen at large in my comment on the Pentateuch; and therefore the words of the apostle may be understood thus: Leave the <i>law</i>, and come to the <i>Gospel</i>. Cease from <i>Moses</i>, and come to the <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
<p><i>Let us go on unto perfection</i>.-The original is very emphatic: επι την τελειοτητα φερωμεθα. <i>Let us be carried on to this perfection</i>. God is ever ready by the power of his Spirit, to <i>carry us forward</i> to every degree of light, life, and love, necessary to prepare us for an eternal weight of glory. There can be little difficulty in attaining the <i>end</i> of our faith, the salvation of our souls from all sin, if God <i>carry us forward</i> to it; and this he will do if we submit to be saved in his own way, and on his own terms. Many make a violent outcry against the doctrine of <i>perfection</i>, i.e. against the heart being cleansed from all sin in this life, and filled with love to God and man, because <i>they</i> judge it to be impossible! Is it too much to say of these that <i>they know neither</i> <i>the Scripture nor the power of God</i>? Surely the <i>Scripture</i> promises the thing; and the <i>power</i> of God can <i>carry us</i> on to the possession of it.</p>
<p><i><b>Laying again the foundation of repentance</b></i> — The phrase νεκρα εργα, <i>dead works</i>, occurs but once more in the sacred writings, and that is in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span> of this epistle; and in both places it seems to signify <i>such works as deserve death</i>-works of those who were <i>dead in trespasses, and dead in sins</i>; and <i>dead</i> by <i>sentence of</i> <i>the law</i>, because they had by these works broken the law. Repentance may be properly called the <i>foundation</i> of the work of God in the soul of man, because by it we forsake sin, and turn to God to find mercy.</p>
<p><i><b>Faith toward God</b></i> — Is also a <i>foundation</i>, or fundamental principle, without which it is impossible to please God, and without which we cannot be saved. By <i>repentance</i> we <i>feel</i> the need of God's mercy, by <i>faith</i> we <i>find</i> that mercy.</p>
<p>But it is very likely that the apostle refers here to the <i>Levitical law</i>, which, in its painful observances, and awful denunciations of Divine wrath against every breach of that law, was well calculated to produce repentance, and make it a grievous and bitter thing to sin against God. And as to <i>faith in God</i>, that was essentially necessary, in order to see the <i>end</i> of the commandment; for without faith in him who was to come, all that <i>repentance</i> was unavailable, and all ritual observances without profit.</p>
