<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10">Hebrews 6:10</span>. <i><b>God is not unrighteous</b></i> — God is only <i>bound</i> to men by his own <i>promise</i>: this promise he is not obliged to make; but, when once made, his <i>righteousness</i> or <i>justice</i> requires him to keep it; therefore, whatever he has promised he will certainly perform. But he has promised to reward every good work and <i>labour of love</i>, and he will surely reward yours; God's <i>promise</i> is God's <i>debt</i>.</p>
<p>Every good work must spring from <i>faith</i> in the <i>name</i>, being, and goodness of God; and every work that is truly good must have <i>love</i> for its <i>motive</i>, as it has God for its <i>end</i>.</p>
<p>The word του κοπου, <i>labour</i>, prefixed to <i>love</i>, is wanting in almost every MS. and version of importance. Griesbach has left it out of the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Ministered to the saints</b></i> — Have contributed to the support and comfort of the poor <i>Christians</i> who were suffering persecution in Judea. As they <i>had</i> thus ministered, and were <i>still</i> ministering, they gave full proof that they had a common cause with the others; and this was one of the <i>things</i> that proved them to be in a <i>state</i> <i>of salvation</i>.</p>
