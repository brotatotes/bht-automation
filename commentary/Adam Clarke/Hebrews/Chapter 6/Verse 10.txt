Verse Hebrews 6:10. God is not unrighteous — God is only bound to men by his own promise: this promise he is not obliged to make; but, when once made, his righteousness or justice requires him to keep it; therefore, whatever he has promised he will certainly perform. But he has promised to reward every good work and labour of love, and he will surely reward yours; God's promise is God's debt.Every good work must spring from faith in the name, being, and goodness of God; and every work that is truly good must have love for its motive, as it has God for its end.The word του κοπου, labour, prefixed to love, is wanting in almost every MS. and version of importance. Griesbach has left it out of the text.Ministered to the saints — Have contributed to the support and comfort of the poor Christians who were suffering persecution in Judea. As they had thus ministered, and were still ministering, they gave full proof that they had a common cause with the others; and this was one of the things that proved them to be in a state of salvation.
