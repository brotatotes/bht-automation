<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:11">Hebrews 6:11</span>. <i><b>We desire</b></i> — επιθυμουμεν, We <i>earnestly wish</i>, that each person among you may continue ενδεικνυσθαι, to <i>manifest</i>, <i>exhibit to full view</i>, the same diligence. There might be reason to suspect that some, through <i>fear of man</i>, might not wish the good they did to be <i>seen</i>, lest they also should suffer persecution. This would not comport with the generous, noble spirit of the Gospel; the man who is afraid to let his decided attachment to God be known, is not far from backsliding. He who is more afraid of <i>man</i> than he is of <i>God Almighty</i>, can have very little religion. As the Church of Christ required all those who in these times embraced the Gospel to be publicly baptized, those who submitted to this rite gave full proof that they were thoroughly convinced of the truths of Christianity; and they gave this as a <i>public</i> <i>pledge</i> that they would be faithful.</p>
<p><i><b>The same diligence</b></i> — They had an <i>active faith</i> and a <i>labouring</i> <i>love</i>, and the apostle wishes them to persevere in both. They were diligent, very diligent, and he desires them to continue so.</p>
<p>To the full assurance of hope, Προς την πληροφοριαν της ελπιδος. "The <i>full assurance of faith</i>," says Mr. Wesley, "relates to present pardon; the <i>full assurance of hope</i>, to future glory: the former is the highest degree of <i>Divine evidence</i> that God is reconciled to me in the Son of his love; the latter is the same degree of <i>Divine evidence</i>, wrought in the soul by the same immediate inspiration of the Holy Ghost, of persevering grace, and of eternal glory. So much as <i>faith</i> every moment <i>beholds</i> with <i>open</i> <i>face</i>, so much, and no more, does <i>hope see</i> to all eternity. But this assurance of faith and hope is not an opinion, not a bare construction of Scripture, but is given immediately by the power of the Holy Ghost, and what none can have for another, but for himself only."</p>
<p>We must not misapprehend these excellent sayings of this eminent man. </p>
<p>1. The person who has this <i>full assurance of hope</i> is he who not only <i>knows</i> and <i>feels</i> that <i>his sins are forgiven</i> through Christ Jesus, but also that his <i>heart is purified from all</i> <i>unrighteousness</i>, that the whole body of sin and death is destroyed, and that he is fully made a partaker of the Divine nature. As without holiness, complete, entire holiness, no man can see God: so, without this, none can scripturally or rationally <i>hope</i> for eternal glory; it being a contradiction to profess to have the full assurance of hope to enjoy a state and place for which the soul is conscious it is <i>not</i> prepared. </p>
<p>2. All that is said here must be understood as still implying the absolute necessity of <i>continuing in the same degree</i> of grace from which this full assurance of hope is derived. This full assurance, therefore, does not imply that the man <i>will absolutely persevere</i> to the end; but that, if he do persevere in this same grace, he shall infallibly have an eternal glory. There is no unconditional perseverance in the Scripture, nor can there be such in a state of <i>probation</i>.</p>
