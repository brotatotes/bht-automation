<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee</b></i> — I will continue to bless thee.</p>
<p><i><b>Multiplying I will multiply thee.</b></i> — I will continue to increase thy posterity. In the most literal manner God continues to fulfil this promise; genuine Christians are Abraham's seed, and God is increasing their number daily.
