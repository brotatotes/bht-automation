Verse 14. Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee — I will continue to bless thee.Multiplying I will multiply thee. — I will continue to increase thy posterity. In the most literal manner God continues to fulfil this promise; genuine Christians are Abraham's seed, and God is increasing their number daily. See the notes on Genesis 22:12-18; and Genesis 23:1.
