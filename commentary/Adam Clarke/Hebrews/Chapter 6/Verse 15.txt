<p>Verse 15. <i><b>He obtained the promise.</b></i> â€” Isaac was supernaturally born; and in his birth God began to fulfil the promise: while he lived, he saw a provision made for the multiplication of his seed; and, having continued steadfast in the faith, he received the <i>end</i> of all the promises in the enjoyment of an eternal glory.
