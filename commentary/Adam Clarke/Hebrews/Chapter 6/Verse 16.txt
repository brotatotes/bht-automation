<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Men verily swear by the greater</b></i> — One who has greater authority; who can take cognizance of the obligation, and punish the breach of it.</p>
<p><i><b>An oath for confirmation</b></i> — "This observation teaches us," says Dr. Macknight, "that both promissory oaths concerning things lawful and in our power, and oaths for the confirmation of things doubtful, when required by proper authority, and taken religiously, are allowable under the Gospel."</p>
