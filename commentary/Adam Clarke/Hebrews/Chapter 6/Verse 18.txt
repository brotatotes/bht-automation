<p>Verse 18. <i><b>That by two immutable things</b></i> — The <i>promise</i> and <i>oath</i> of God: the <i>promise</i> pledged his faithfulness and justice; the <i>oath</i>, all the infinite perfections of his Godhead, for he sware by himself. There is a good saying in <i>Beracoth</i> on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:13">Exodus 32:13</span>, fol. 32: <i>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom</i> <i>thou swarest by thine own self</i>. "What is the meaning of <i>by thine</i> <i>own self</i>? Rab. Eleazar answered, Thus said Moses to the holy blessed God, Lord of all the world. If thou hadst sworn to them by the heavens and the earth, then I should have said, As the heavens and the earth shall pass away, so may thy oath pass away. But now thou hast sworn unto them by thy great name, which liveth, and which endureth for ever, and for ever and ever; therefore thy oath shall endure for ever, and for ever and ever."</p>
<p>This is a good thought; if God had sworn by any thing finite, that thing might fail, and then the obligation would be at an end, but he has sworn by what is infinite, and cannot fail; therefore his oath is of eternal obligation.</p>
<p><i><b>We might have a strong consolation</b></i> — There appears to be an allusion here to the cities of refuge, and to the persons who fled to them for safety. As the person who killed his neighbour unawares was sure if he gained the city of refuge he should be safe, and had strong consolation in the hope that he should reach it, this hope animated him in his race to the city; he ran, he fled, knowing that, though in danger the most imminent of losing his life, yet, as he was now acting according to an ordinance of God, he was certain of safety provided he got to the place.</p>
<p>It is easy to apply this to the case of a truly penitent sinner. Thou hast sinned against God and against thy own life! The avenger of blood is at thy heels! Jesus hath shed his blood for thee, he is thy intercessor before the throne; flee to him! Lay hold on the hope of eternal life which is offered unto thee in the Gospel! Delay not one moment! Thou art never safe till thou hast redemption in his blood! God invites thee! Jesus spreads his hands to receive thee! God hath sworn that he willeth not the death of a sinner; then he cannot will <i>thy</i> death: take God's <i>oath</i>, take his <i>promise</i>; credit what he hath spoken and sworn! Take encouragement! Believe on the Son of God, and thou shalt not perish, but have everlasting life!</p>
