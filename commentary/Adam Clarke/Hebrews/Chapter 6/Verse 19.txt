<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Which</b></i><b> hope </b><i><b>we have as an anchor</b></i> — The apostle here changes the allusion; he represents the state of the followers of God in this lower world as resembling that of a vessel striving to perform her voyage through a troublesome, tempestuous, dangerous sea. At last she gets near the port; but the tempest continues, the water is shallow, broken, and dangerous, and she cannot get in: in order to prevent her being driven to sea again she heaves out her sheet anchor, which she has been able to get within the pier head by means of her boat, though she could not herself get in; then, swinging at the length of her cable, she rides out the storm in confidence, knowing that her anchor is sound, the ground good in which it is fastened, and the cable strong. Though agitated, she is safe; though buffeted by wind and tide, she does not drive; by and by the storm ceases, the tide flows in, her sailors take to the capstan, wear the ship against the anchor, which still keeps its bite or hold, and she gets safely into port. <i>See on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p>The comparison of <i>hope</i> to an <i>anchor</i> is frequent among the ancient heathen writers, who supposed it to be as necessary to the support of a man in adversity, as the anchor is to the safety of the ship when about to be driven on a lee shore by a storm. "To ground <i>hope</i> on a false supposition," says <i>Socrates</i>, "is like trusting to a weak <i>anchor</i>." He said farther, ουτε ναυν εξ ἑνος αγκυριου, ουτε βιον εκ μιας ελπιδος ὁρμιστεον· a ship ought not to trust to one <i>anchor</i>, nor life to one <i>hope</i>. <i>Stob</i>., Serm. 109.</p>
<p>The <i>hope</i> of <i>eternal life</i> is here represented as the soul's anchor; the <i>world</i> is the <i>boisterous, dangerous sea</i>; the <i>Christian</i> <i>course</i>, the <i>voyage</i>; the <i>port</i>, everlasting <i>felicity</i>; and the <i>veil</i> or <i>inner road</i>, the <i>royal dock</i> in which that anchor was cast. The storms of life continue but a short time; the anchor, hope, if fixed by faith in the eternal world, will infallibly prevent all shipwreck; the soul may be strongly tossed by various temptations, but will not drive, because the anchor is in <i>sure</i> ground, and itself is <i>steadfast</i>; it does not <i>drag</i>, and it does not <i>break</i>; <i>faith</i>, like the <i>cable</i>, is the <i>connecting medium</i> between the <i>ship</i> and the <i>anchor</i>, or the <i>soul</i> and its <i>hope of heaven</i>; faith sees the haven, hope desires and anticipates the rest; faith works, and hope holds fast; and, shortly, the soul enters into the haven of eternal repose.</p>
