<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:2">Hebrews 6:2</span>. <i><b>Of the doctrine of baptisms</b></i> — "There were two things," says Dr. Owen, "peculiar to the Gospel, the <i>doctrine</i> of it and the <i>gifts of the Holy Ghost</i>. Doctrine is called <i>baptism</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:2">Deuteronomy 32:2</span>; hence the people are said to be <i>baptized to Moses</i>, when they were initiated into his <i>doctrines</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>. The <i>baptism</i> of John was his <i>doctrine</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:3">Acts 19:3</span>; and the <i>baptism of Christ</i> was the <i>doctrine of Christ</i>, wherewith he was to <i>sprinkle many nations</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:15">Isaiah 52:15</span>. This is the <i>first</i> baptism of the Gospel, even its <i>doctrine</i>. The <i>other</i> was the communication of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>; and this alone is what is intended by the <i>laying on of hands</i>; and then the sense will be the foundation of the Gospel baptisms, namely <i>preaching</i> and the <i>gifts of the Holy</i> <i>Ghost</i>."</p>
<p>I am afraid, with all this great man's learning, he has not hit the meaning of the apostle. As <i>teaching</i> is the means by which we are to obtain the gifts of the Holy Ghost, surely the apostle never designed to separate them, but to lead men immediately through the one to the possession of the other. Nor is the word <i>baptism</i> mentioned in the passage in Deuteronomy which he quotes; nor, indeed, any word properly synonymous. Neither βαπτισμος, <i>baptism</i>, ραντισμος, <i>sprinkling</i>, nor any verb formed from them, is found in the <i>Septuagint</i>, in that place. But the other proofs are sufficiently in point, viz. that by <i>baptism</i> in the other places referred to, <i>doctrine</i> or TEACHING is meant; but to call TEACHING <i>one baptism</i>, and the <i>gifts</i> of THE HOLY GHOST <i>another baptism</i>, and to apply this to the explanation of the difficulty here, is very far from being satisfactory.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that all the terms in <i>this verse</i>, as well as those in the <i>former</i>, belong to the <i>Levitical law</i>, and are to be explained on that ground.</p>
<p><i>Baptisms</i>, or <i>immersions</i> of the body in water, <i>sprinklings</i>, and <i>washings</i>, were frequent as religious rites among the Hebrews, and were all emblematical of that purity which a holy God requires in his worshippers, and without which they cannot be happy here, nor glorified in heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>Laying on of hands</b></i> — Was also frequent, especially in <i>sacrifices</i>: the person bringing the victim laid his hands on its head, confessed his sins over it, and then gave it to the priest to be offered to God, that it might make atonement for his transgressions. This also had respect to Jesus Christ, that <i>Lamb</i> <i>of God who takes away the sins of the world</i>.</p>
<p>The doctrine also of the <i>resurrection</i> of the <i>dead</i> and of <i>eternal</i> <i>judgment</i>, were both Jewish, but were only partially revealed, and then referred to the <i>Gospel</i>. Of the <i>resurrection of the dead</i> there is a fine proof in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+26:19">Isaiah 26:19</span>, where it is stated to be the consequence of the <i>death</i> and <i>resurrection</i> of Christ, for so I understand the words, <i>Thy dead shall live</i>; with <i>my dead body shall</i> <i>they arise: awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew</i> <i>is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead</i>. The valley of <i>dry bones</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:1">Ezekiel 37:1</span>, c., is both an illustration and proof of it. And Daniel has taught both the <i>resurrection</i> and the <i>eternal judgment</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2">Daniel 12:2</span>: <i>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake</i> <i>some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting</i> <i>contempt</i>.</p>
<p>Now the <i>foundation</i> of all these doctrines was laid in the Old Testament, and they were variously represented under the law, but they were all referred to the Gospel for their proof and illustration. The apostle, therefore, wishes them to consider the Gospel as holding forth these in their full spirit and power. It preaches,</p>
<p>1. <i>Repentance</i>, unto life. </p>
<p>2. <i>Faith</i> in God through Christ, by whom we receive the atonement. </p>
<p>3. The <i>baptism</i> by <i>water</i>, in the name of the holy Trinity; and the <i>baptism</i> of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>. </p>
<p>4. The <i>imposition</i> of <i>hands</i>, the true sacrificial system; and, by and through it, the communication of the various gifts of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, for the instruction of mankind, and the edification of the Church. </p>
<p>5. The <i>resurrection</i> of the <i>dead</i>, which is both proved and illustrated by the resurrection of Christ. </p>
<p>6. The doctrine of the <i>eternal</i> or <i>future judgment</i>, which is to take place at the bar of Christ himself, God having committed all judgment to his Son, called here κριμα αιωνιον, <i>eternal</i> or <i>ever</i> <i>during judgment</i>, because the sentences then pronounced shall be irreversible.</p>
<p>Some understand the whole of the <i>initiation</i> of persons into the Church, as the candidates for admission were previously <i>instructed</i> in those doctrines which contained the <i>fundamental</i> principles of Christianity. The Hebrews had already received these; but should they Judaize, or mingle the Gospel with the law, they would thereby exclude themselves from the Christian Church, and should they be ever again admitted, they must come through the same gate, or lay a <i>second time</i>, παλιν, this foundation. But should they totally <i>apostatize</i> from Christ, and finally reject him, then it would be <i>impossible to renew them</i> <i>again to repentance</i> - they could no more be received into the Christian Church, nor have any right to any blessing of the Gospel dispensation; and, finally rejecting the Lord who bought them, would bring on themselves and their land swift destruction.
