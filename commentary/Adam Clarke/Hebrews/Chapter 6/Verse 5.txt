<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:5">Hebrews 6:5</span>. <i><b>And have tasted the good word of God</b></i> — Have had this proof of the excellence of the promise of God in sending the Gospel, the Gospel being itself the <i>good word</i> of a <i>good God</i>, the reading and preaching of which they find sweet to the taste of their souls. Genuine believers have an <i>appetite</i> for the word of God; they <i>taste</i> it, and then their <i>relish</i> for it is the more abundantly increased. The more they get, the more they wish to have.</p>
<p><i><b>The powers of the world to come</b></i> — Δυναμεις τε μελλοντος αιωνος. These words are understood two ways:</p>
<p>1. <i>The powers of the world to</i> <i>come</i> may refer to the stupendous <i>miracles</i> wrought in confirmation of the Gospel, the Gospel dispensation being <i>the world to come</i> in the Jewish phraseology, as we have often seen; and that δυναμις is often taken for a <i>mighty work</i> or <i>miracle</i>, is plain from various parts of the gospels. The prophets had declared that the Messiah, when he came, should work many miracles, and should be as mighty in word and deed as was <i>Moses</i>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15-19">Deuteronomy 18:15-19</span>. And they particularly specify the giving <i>sight</i> to the <i>blind, hearing</i> to the <i>deaf, strength</i> to the <i>lame</i>, and <i>speech</i> to the <i>dumb</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:5">Isaiah 35:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:6">Isaiah 35:6</span>. All these miracles Jesus Christ did in the sight of this very people; and thus they had the highest evidence they could have that Jesus was this promised Messiah, and could have no pretence to <i>doubt</i> his mission, or apostatize from the Christian faith which they had received; and hence it is no wonder that the apostle denounces the most awful judgments of God against those who had apostatized from the faith, which they had seen thus confirmed.</p>
<p>2. The words have been supposed to apply to those <i>communications</i> and <i>foretastes</i> of <i>eternal blessedness</i>, or of the <i>joys of the world</i> <i>to come</i>, which they who are justified through the blood of the covenant, and walk faithfully with their God, experience; and to this sense the word γευσαμενους <i>have tasted</i>, is thought more properly to apply. But γευομαι, <i>to taste</i>, signifies <i>to experience</i> or <i>have full proof</i> of a thing. Thus, <i>to taste death</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>, is <i>to die</i>, to come under the <i>power of death</i>, fully to <i>experience</i> its destructive nature as far as the body is concerned. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:27">Luke 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span>. And it is used in the same sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span> of this epistle, where Christ is said to <i>taste death for every man</i>; for notwithstanding the <i>metaphor</i>, which the reader will see explained in the note on the above place, the word necessarily means that he did <i>actually die</i>, that he <i>fully</i> <i>experienced</i> death; and had the fullest proof of it and of its malignity he could have, independently of the corruption of his flesh; for over this death could have no power. And to <i>taste</i> that <i>the Lord is gracious</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:3">1 Peter 2:3</span>, is to experience God's graciousness thoroughly, in being made <i>living stones, built up</i> <i>into a spiritual house</i>, constituted <i>holy priests</i> to <i>offer</i> <i>spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God</i>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>. And in this sense it is used by the purest Greek writers. See several examples in <i>Schleusner</i>.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, that the first opinion is the best founded.</p>
