<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span>. <i><b>If they shall fall away</b></i> — και παραπεσοντας <i>And having</i> <i>fallen away</i>. I can express my own mind on this translation nearly in the words of Dr. Macknight: "The participles φωτισθεντας, <i>who</i> <i>were enlightened</i>, γευσαμενους, <i>have tasted</i>, and γενηθεντας, <i>were made partakers</i>, being <i>aorists</i>, are properly rendered by our translators in the <i>past time</i>; wherefore, παραπεσοντας, being an aorist, ought likewise to have been translated in the <i>past time</i>, HAVE <i>fallen away</i>. Nevertheless, our translators, following <i>Beza</i>, who without any authority from ancient MSS. has inserted in his version the word <i>si</i>, <i>if</i>, have rendered this clause, IF <i>they fall</i> <i>away</i>, that this text might not appear to contradict the doctrine of the <i>perseverance of the saints</i>. But as no translator should take upon him to add to or alter the Scriptures, for the sake of any favourite doctrine, I have translated παραπεσοντας in the <i>past</i> time, <i>have fallen away</i>, according to the true import of the word, as standing in connection with the other aorists in the preceding verses."</p>
<p>Dr. Macknight was a Calvinist, and he was a thorough scholar and an honest man; but, professing to give a <i>translation</i> of <i>the</i> <i>epistle</i>, he consulted not his creed but his candour. Had our translators, who were excellent and learned men, leaned less to their own peculiar creed in the present authorized version, the Church of Christ in this country would not have been agitated and torn as it has been with polemical divinity.</p>
<p>It appears from this, whatever sentiment may gain or lose by it, that there is a fearful possibility of <i>falling away from the grace</i> <i>of God</i>; and if this scripture did not say so, there are many that do say so. And were there no scripture express on this subject, the nature of the present state of man, which is a state of <i>probation</i> or <i>trial</i>, must necessarily imply it. Let him who most assuredly standeth, take heed lest he fall.</p>
<p><i><b>To renew them again unto repentance</b></i> — As <i>repentance</i> is the <i>first</i> step that a sinner must take in order to return to God, and as sorrow for sin must be useless in itself unless there be a proper sacrificial offering, these having rejected the only available sacrifice, their repentance for sin, had they any, would be nugatory, and their salvation impossible on this simple account; and this is the very reason which the apostle immediately subjoins:-</p>
<p><i><b>Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God</b></i> — They reject him on the ground that he was an impostor, and <i>justly</i> put to death. And thus they are said to <i>crucify him to themselves</i>-to do that in their present apostasy which the Jews did; and they show thereby that, had they been present when he was crucified, they would have joined with his murderers.</p>
<p><i><b>And put him to an open shame.</b></i> — παραδειγματιζοντας. <i>And have</i> <i>made</i> him <i>a public example</i>; or, <i>crucifying unto themselves and</i> <i>making the Son of God a public example</i>. That is, they show openly that they judge Jesus Christ to have been worthy of the death which he suffered, and was justly made a public example by being crucified. This shows that it is <i>final apostasy</i>, by the total rejection of the Gospel, and blasphemy of the Saviour of men, that the apostle has in view. <i>See the note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span><i>"</i>.</p>
