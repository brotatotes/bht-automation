<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:8">Hebrews 6:8</span>. <i><b>That which beareth thorns and briers is rejected</b></i> — That is: The land which, notwithstanding the most careful cultivation, receiving also in due times the early and latter rain, produces nothing but thorns and briers, or noxious weeds of different kinds, is rejected, αδοκιμος, is given up as unimprovable; <i>its briers, thorns, and brushwood burnt down</i>; and then <i>left to be pastured on by the beasts of the field</i>. This seems to be the custom in <i>husbandry</i> to which the apostle alludes. The nature of the case prevents us from supposing that he alludes to the custom of <i>pushing and burning</i>, in order to farther <i>fertilization</i>. This practice has been common from very early times: - </p>
<p><b>Is </b><i><b>nigh unto cursing</b></i> — It is acknowledged, almost on all hands, that this epistle was written <i>before</i> the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. This verse is in my opinion a proof of it, and here I suppose the apostle refers to that <i>approaching destruction</i>; and perhaps he has this all along in view, but speaks of it <i>covertly</i>, that he might not give offence.</p>
<p>There is a <i>good sense</i> in which all these things may be applied to the Jews at large, who were favoured by our Lord's ministry and miracles. They were <i>enlightened</i> by his preaching; <i>tasted</i> of the benefits of the <i>heavenly gift</i>-the Christian religion established among them; saw many of their children and relatives <i>made</i> <i>partakers of the Holy Ghost; tasted the good word of God</i>, by the fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham; and saw the almighty <i>power</i> of God exerted, in working a great variety of <i>miracles</i>. Yet, after being convinced that never man spake as this man, and that none could do those miracles which he did, except God were with him; after having followed him in thousands, for three years, while he preached to them the Gospel of the kingdom of God; they <i>fell away</i> from all this, crucified him who, even in his sufferings as well as his resurrection, was demonstrated by miracles to be the Son of God; and then to vindicate their unparalleled wickedness, endeavoured to make him a <i>public example</i>, by reproaches and blasphemies. Therefore their state, which had received much moral cultivation from Moses, the prophets, Christ, and his apostles; and now bore nothing but the most vicious fruits, pride, unbelief, hardness of heart, contempt of God's word and ordinances, blasphemy, and rebellion; was <i>rejected</i>-reprobated, of God; was <i>nigh unto cursing</i>-about to be cast off from the Divine protection; and their city and temple were shortly to be <i>burnt up</i> by the Roman armies. Thus the apostle, under the case of <i>individuals</i>, points out the destruction that was to come upon this people <i>in general</i>, and which actually took place about <i>seven</i> years after the writing of this epistle! And this appears to be the very subject which the apostle has in view in the parallel solemn passages, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26-31">Hebrews 10:26-31</span>; and, viewed in this light, much of their obscurity and difficulty vanishes away.</p>
