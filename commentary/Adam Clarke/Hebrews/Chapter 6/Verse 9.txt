<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:9">Hebrews 6:9</span>. <i><b>But, beloved</b></i> — Here he softens what he had before said; having given them the most solemn warning against apostasy, he now encourages them to persevere, commends the good that is in them, and excites them to watchfulness and activity.</p>
<p><i><b>Better things of you</b></i> — Than that you shall resemble that <i>unfruitful ground</i> that can be improved by no tillage, and is thrown into <i>waste</i>, and is fit only for the beasts of the forests to roam in.</p>
<p><i><b>Things that accompany salvation</b></i> — τα εχομενα σωτηριας. <i>Things</i> <i>that are suitable to a state of salvation</i>; you give proofs still that you have not, whatever others have done, <i>departed from the</i> <i>living God</i>. Several of your brethren have already apostatized, and the whole nation is in a state of rebellion against God; and, in consequence of their final rejection of Christ and his Gospel, are about to be finally rejected by God. <i>They</i> must meet with <i>destruction</i>; <i>they</i> have <i>the things that are suitable to, and</i> <i>indicative of, a state of reprobation</i>; the wrath of God will come upon them to the <i>uttermost</i>; but, while <i>they</i> meet with <i>destruction,</i> <i>you</i> shall meet with <i>salvation</i>. It is worthy of remark, that no <i>genuine Christian</i> perished in the destruction of Jerusalem; they all, previously to the siege by Titus, escaped to <i>Pella</i>, in Coelosyria; and it is as remarkable that not one <i>Jew</i> escaped! all either fell by the <i>sword</i>, perished by <i>famine</i>, or were led into <i>captivity</i>! According to their own imprecation, <i>His blood be upon</i> <i>us and our children</i>, God visited and avenged the innocent blood of Christ upon them and upon their posterity; and they continue to be monuments of his displeasure to the present day.</p>
