<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:1">Hebrews 7:1</span>. <i><b>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem</b></i> — See the whole of this history largely explained in the notes, <i>See "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:18">Genesis 14:18</span><i>"</i>, c., and the concluding observations at the end of that chapter.</p>
<p>The name Melchisedec, מלכי צדק is thus expounded in <i>Bereshith Rabba</i>, sec. 43, fol. 42, מצדיק את יושביו <i>matsdie eth Yoshebaiv</i>, "The Justifier of those who dwell in him" and this is sufficiently true of Christ, but false of <i>Jerusalem</i>, to which the rabbins apply it, who state that it was originally called <i>Tsedek</i>, and that it <i>justified its inhabitants</i>.</p>
<p><i>Salem</i> is generally understood to be <i>Jerusalem</i>; but some think that it was that city of Shechem mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+20:7">Joshua 20:7</span>. St. Jerome was of this opinion.</p>
