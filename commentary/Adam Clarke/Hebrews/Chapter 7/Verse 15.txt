<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And it is yet far more evident</b></i> — Και περισσοτερον ετι καταδηλον εστιν. <i>And besides, it is more abundantly strikingly</i> <i>manifest</i>. It is very difficult to translate these words, but the apostle's meaning is plain, viz., that God designed the Levitical priesthood to be changed, because of the oath in Psa. cx., where, addressing the Messiah, he says: <i>Thou art a Priest for ever after</i> <i>the order</i>, or ομοιοτητα, <i>similitude, of Melchisedec</i>, who was not only a <i>priest</i>, but also a <i>king</i>. None of the Levitical priests sustained this <i>double</i> office; but they both, with that of <i>prophet</i>, appear and were exercised in the person of our Lord, who is the Priest to which the apostle alludes.</p>
