<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Who is made</b></i> — Appointed to this high office by God himself, not succeeding one that was <i>disabled</i> or <i>dead, according</i> <i>to that law</i> or ordinance directed to <i>weak</i> and <i>perishing</i> men, who could not <i>continue by reason of death</i>.</p>
<p>This is probably all that the apostle intends by the words <i>carnal commandment</i>, εντολης σαρκικης, for <i>carnal</i> does not always mean <i>sinful</i> or <i>corrupt</i>, but <i>feeble, frail</i>, or what may be said of or concerning <i>man</i> in his present <i>dying condition</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But after the power of an endless life.</b></i> — Not dying, or ceasing through weakness to be a priest; but properly immortal himself, and having the power to confer life and immortality on others. HE ever lives, as Priest, to make intercession for men; and they who believe on him shall never perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
