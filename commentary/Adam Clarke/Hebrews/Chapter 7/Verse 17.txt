<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For he testifieth</b></i> — That is, either the <i>Scripture</i>, in the place so often quoted, or God by that Scripture.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou</b></i><b> art </b><i><b>a priest for ever</b></i> — This is the proof that he was not appointed according to the carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life, because he is a priest <i>for ever</i>; i.e. one that never dies, and is never disabled from performing the important functions of his office; for if he be a priest for ever, he <i>ever lives</i>.</p>
