<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For there is verily a disannulling</b></i> — There is a total abrogation, προαγουσηςεντολης, <i>of the former law</i>, relative to the Levitical priesthood. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:19">Hebrews 7:19</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>For the weakness</b></i> — It had no <i>energy</i>; it communicated none; it had no <i>Spirit</i> to minister; it required perfect obedience, but furnished no <i>assistance</i> to those who were under it.</p>
<p><i><b>And unprofitableness</b></i> — No man was <i>benefited</i> by the mere observance of its precepts: it pardoned no sin, changed no heart, reformed no life; it found men dead in trespasses and sins, and it consigned them to eternal death. It was therefore weak in itself, and unprofitable to men.</p>
<p>The Jews, who still cleave to it, are a proof that it is both <i>weak</i> and <i>unprofitable</i>; for there is not a more miserable, distressed, and profligate class of men on the face of the earth.</p>
