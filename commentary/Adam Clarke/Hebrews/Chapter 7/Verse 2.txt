<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:2">Hebrews 7:2</span>. <i><b>Gave a tenth part of all</b></i> â€” It was an ancient custom, among all the nations of the earth, to consecrate a part or <i>tenth</i> of the spoils taken in war to the objects of their worship. Many examples of this kind occur.

But neither Abraham's decimation, nor theirs, had any thing to do, either with tithes as <i>prescribed</i> under the Mosaic dispensation, or as <i>claimed</i> under the Christian.</p>
