<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Not without an oath</b></i> â€” "The apostle's reasoning here is founded on this, that God never interposed his <i>oath</i>, except to show the <i>certainty</i> and <i>immutability</i> of the thing sworn. Thus he sware to <i>Abraham</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16-18">Genesis 22:16-18</span>, that <i>in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed</i>; and to the rebellious <i>Israelites</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:34">Deuteronomy 1:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:35">Deuteronomy 1:35</span>, that <i>they should not enter into his rest</i>; and to <i>Moses</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+4:21">Deuteronomy 4:21</span>, that <i>he should not go into Canaan</i>; and to <i>David</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:4">Psalms 89:4</span>, that <i>his seed should endure for ever, and his throne unto all</i> <i>generations</i>. Wherefore, since Christ was made a priest, <i>not</i> <i>without an oath</i> that he should be <i>a priest for ever, after the</i> <i>similitude of Melchisedec</i>, that circumstance showed God's immutable resolution never to change or abolish his priesthood, nor to change or abolish the covenant which was established on his priesthood; whereas the Levitical priesthood and the law of Moses, being established <i>without an oath</i>, were thereby declared to be changeable at God's pleasure." This judicious note is from Dr. <i>Macknight</i>.</p>
