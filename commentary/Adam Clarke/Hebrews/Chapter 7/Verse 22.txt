<p>Verse 22. <i><b>By so much</b></i> — This solemn, unchangeable <i>oath</i> of God, <i>was Jesus made a surety</i>, εγγυος, a <i>mediator</i>, one who brings the two parties together, witnesses the contract, and offers the covenant sacrifice on the occasion. See at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>A better testament.</b></i> — κρειττονος διατηκης. <i>A better covenant</i>; called, in the title to the sacred books which contain the whole Christian code, η καινη διαθηκη, THE NEW COVENANT, thus contradistinguished from the <i>Mosaic</i>, which was the <i>old covenant</i>; and this is called the <i>new</i> and <i>better</i> covenant, because God has in it promised other blessings, to other people, on other conditions, than the old covenant did. The <i>new</i> covenant is <i>better</i> than the <i>old</i> in the following particulars:</p>
<p>1. God promised to the Jewish nation certain secular blessings, peculiar to that nation, on condition of their keeping the law of Moses; but under the new covenant he promises pardon of sin, and final salvation to all mankind, on condition of believing on Jesus Christ, and walking in his testimonies. </p>
<p>2. The Jewish priests, fallible, dying men, were mediators of the old covenant, by means of their sacrifices, which could not take away sin, nor render the comers thereunto perfect. But Jesus Christ, who liveth for ever, who is infinite in wisdom and power, by the sacrifice of himself has established this new covenant, and by the shedding of his blood has opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.</p>
