<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Wherefore</b></i> — Because he is an everlasting priest, and has offered the only available sacrifice, <i>he is able to save</i>, from the power, guilt, nature, and punishment of sin, <i>to the uttermost</i>, εις το παντελες, to all intents, degrees, and purposes; and always, and in and through all times, places, and circumstances; for all this is implied in the original word: but <i>in and through</i> <i>all times</i> seems to be the particular meaning here, because of what follows, <i>he ever liveth to make intercession for them</i>; this depends on the <i>perpetuity</i> of his <i>priesthood</i>, and the <i>continuance</i> of his <i>mediatorial</i> office. As Jesus was the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world, has an everlasting priesthood, and is a continual intercessor; it is in virtue of this that all who were saved from the foundation of the world were saved through him, and all that shall be saved to the end of the world will be saved through him. He ever was and ever will be the High Priest, Sacrifice, Intercessor, and Mediator of the human race. All successive generations of men are equally interested in him, and may claim the same privileges. But none can be saved by his grace that do not <i>come unto God through him</i>; i.e. imploring mercy through him as their sacrifice and atonement; confidently trusting that God can be just, and yet the justifier of them who thus come to him, believing on Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>The phrase εντυγχανειν τινι, <i>to make intercession</i> for a person, has a considerable latitude of meaning. It signifies,</p>
<p>1. To <i>come</i> <i>to</i> or <i>meet a person</i> on any cause whatever. </p>
<p>2. To <i>intercede, pray</i> <i>for</i>, or <i>entreat in the behalf of</i>, another. </p>
<p>3. To <i>defend</i> or <i>vindicate</i> a person. </p>
<p>4. To <i>commend</i>. </p>
<p>5. To furnish any kind of <i>assistance</i> or <i>help</i>. </p>
<p>6. And, with the preposition κατα, <i>against</i>, to <i>accuse</i>, or <i>act against another</i> in a judicial way.</p>
<p>"The nature of the apostle's arguments," says Dr. Macknight, "requires that, by Christ's <i>always living</i>, we understand his always <i>living in the body</i>; for it is thus that he is an affectionate and sympathizing High Priest, who, in his intercession, pleads the merit of his death to procure the salvation of all who come unto God through him. Agreeably to this account of Christ's intercession, the apostle, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span>, mentions the sacrifice of himself, which Christ offered for the sins of the people as the foundation of his intercession. Now, as he offered that sacrifice in heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span>, by presenting his crucified body there, (<i>See "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span><i>"</i>,) and as he continually resides there in the body, some of the ancients were of opinion that his continual intercession consists in the <i>continual</i> <i>presentation of his humanity before his Father</i>, because it is a continual declaration of his earnest desire of the salvation of men, and of his having, in obedience to his Father's will, made himself flesh, and suffered death to accomplish it. <i>See "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span><i>"</i>, note 3. This opinion is confirmed by the manner in which the Jewish high priest made intercession for the people on the day of atonement, and which was a type of Christ's intercession in heaven. He made it, not by offering of prayers for them in the most holy place, but by <i>sprinkling the blood of the sacrifices on the</i> <i>mercy-seat</i>, in token of their death. And as, by that action, he opened the earthly holy places to the prayers and worship of the Israelites during the ensuing year; so Jesus, by presenting his humanity continually before the presence of his Father, opens heaven to the prayers of his people in the present life, and to their persons after the resurrection."</p>
