<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Such a high priest became us</b></i> — Such a high priest was in every respect <i>suitable</i> to us, every way qualified to accomplish the end for which he came into the world. There is probably here an allusion to the qualifications of the Jewish high priest:-</p>
<p>1. He was required to be <i>holy</i>, οσιος, answering to the Hebrew חסיד <i>chasid, merciful</i>. Holiness was his calling; and, as he was the representative of his brethren, he was required to be <i>merciful</i> and <i>compassionate</i>.</p>
<p>2. He was to be <i>harmless</i>, ακακος, <i>without evil</i> - holy without, and holy within; injuring none, but rather living for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>3. He was <i>undefiled</i>, αμιαντος answering to the Hebrew באל מום <i>baal mum, without blemish</i> - having no <i>bodily imperfection</i>. Nothing low, mean, base, or unbecoming in his conduct.</p>
<p>4. He was <i>separate from sinners</i>, κεχωρισμενος απο των ἁμαρτωλων. By his office he was <i>separated</i> from all men and worldly occupations, and entirely devoted to the service of God. And as to <i>sinners</i>, or <i>heathens</i>, he was never to be found in their society.</p>
<p>5. <i>Higher than the heavens</i>. There may be some reference here to the exceeding <i>dignity</i> of the high priesthood; it was the highest office that could be sustained by man, the high priest himself being the immediate representative of God.</p>
<p>But these things suit our Lord in a sense in which they cannot be applied to the high priest of the Jews.</p>
<p>1. He was <i>holy</i>, infinitely so; and <i>merciful</i>, witness his shedding his blood for the sins of mankind.</p>
<p>2. <i>Harmless</i> - perfectly without sin in his humanity, as well as his divinity.</p>
<p>3. <i>Undefiled</i> - contracted no sinful infirmity in consequence of his dwelling among men.</p>
<p>4. <i>Separate from sinners</i> - absolutely unblamable in the whole of his conduct, so that he could challenge the most inveterate of his enemies with, <i>Which of you convicteth me of sin</i>? Who of you can show in my conduct the slightest deviation from truth and righteousness!</p>
<p>5. <i>Higher than the heavens</i> - more exalted than all the angels of God, than all created beings, whether thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers, because all these were created by him and for him, and derive their continued subsistence from his infinite energy.</p>
<p>But how was a person of such infinite dignity <i>suitable</i> to us! His <i>greatness</i> is put in opposition to our meanness. HE was <i>holy</i>; WE, <i>unholy</i>. HE was <i>harmless</i>; WE, <i>harmful, injuring</i> both ourselves and others. HE was <i>undefiled</i>; WE, <i>defiled</i>, most <i>sinfully</i> <i>spotted</i> and impure. HE was <i>separate from sinners</i>; WE were <i>joined</i> <i>to sinners</i>, companions of the vile, the worthless, the profane, and the wicked. HE was <i>higher than the heavens</i>; WE, <i>baser</i> and <i>lower</i> than the earth, totally unworthy to be called the creatures of God. And had we not had such a Saviour, and had we not been redeemed at an infinite price, we should, to use the nervous language of <i>Milton</i> on another occasion, "after a shameful life and end in this world, have been thrown down eternally into the <i>darkest</i> and <i>deepest</i> gulf of <i>hell</i>, where, under the <i>despiteful</i> <i>control</i>, the trample and spurn, of all the other <i>damned</i>, and in the anguish of their <i>torture</i> should have no other ease than to exercise a raving and bestial <i>tyranny</i> over <i>us</i> as their <i>slaves</i>, we must have remained in that plight for ever, the <i>basest</i>, the <i>lower-most</i>, the most dejected, most <i>under-foot</i> and <i>down-trodden</i> <i>vassals</i> of <i>perdition</i>." MILTON on <i>Reformation</i>, in <i>fine</i>.</p>
