<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Who needeth not daily</b></i> — Though the high priest offered the great atonement only once in the year, yet in the Jewish services there was a daily acknowledgment of sin, and a daily sacrifice offered by the priests, at whose head was the high priest, for their own sins and the sins of the people. The Jews held that a priest who neglected his own expiatory sacrifice would be smitten with death. (<i>Sanhedr</i>., fol. 83.) When they offered this victim, they prayed the following prayer: "O Lord, I have sinned, and done wickedly, and gone astray before thy face, I, and my house, and the sons of Aaron, the, people of thy holiness. I beseech thee, for thy name's sake, blot out the sins, iniquities, and transgressions by which I have sinned, done wickedly, and gone astray before thy face, I, and my house, and the sons of Aaron, the people of thy holiness; as it is written in the law of Moses thy servant, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:30">Leviticus 16:30</span>:) <i>On that day shall he make an atonement for you, to cleanse you</i>, <i>that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord</i>!" To which the Levites answered: "Blessed be the name of the glory of thy kingdom, for ever and ever!"</p>
<p>This prayer states that the priest <i>offered a sacrifice, first</i> <i>for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people</i>, as the apostle asserts.</p>
<p><i><b>For this he did once</b></i> — For <i>himself</i> he offered no sacrifice; and the apostle gives the reason-he needed none, because he was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners: and for the <i>people</i> he offered himself once for all, when he expired upon the cross,</p>
<p>It has been very properly remarked, that the sacrifice offered by Christ differed in four essential respects from those, offered by the Jewish priests:</p>
<p>1. He offered no sacrifice for himself, but only for the people. </p>
<p>2. He did not offer that sacrifice <i>annually</i>, but once for all. </p>
<p>3. The sacrifice which he offered was not of calves and goats, but of himself. </p>
<p>4. This sacrifice he offered, not for <i>one people</i>, but for the <i>whole human race</i>; for he tasted death for <i>every man</i>.</p>
