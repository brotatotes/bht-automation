<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:4">Hebrews 7:4</span>. <i><b>Consider how great this man was</b></i> — There is something exceedingly mysterious in the person and character of this king of Salem; and to find out the whole is impossible. He seems to have been a sort of <i>universal</i> priest, having none superior to him in all that region; and confessedly superior even to Abraham himself, the father of the faithful, and the source of the Jewish race. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:7">Hebrews 7:7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The patriarch Abraham</b></i> — ο πατριαρχης. Either from πατηρ, a <i>father</i>, and αρχη, a <i>chief</i> or <i>head</i>; or from πατριας αρχη, <i>the head of a family</i>.' But the title is here applied, by way of eminence, to him who was the <i>head</i> or <i>chief</i> of all the <i>fathers</i>-or patriarch of the patriarchs, and father of the faithful. The Syriac translates it [Syriac] <i>Rish Abahatha</i>, "head of the fathers." The character and conduct of Abraham place him, as a man, deservedly at the <i>head</i> of the human race.</p>
