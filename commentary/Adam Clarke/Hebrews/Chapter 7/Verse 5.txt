<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:5">Hebrews 7:5</span>. <i><b>They that are of the sons of Levi</b></i> — The priests who are of the posterity of the Levites, and receive the priesthood in virtue of their descent from Aaron, have authority from the law of God to receive tithes from the people.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the law</b></i> — That is, the Levites received a <i>tenth</i> from the people. The priests received a <i>tenth</i> of this <i>tenth</i> from the Levites, who are here called their brethren, because they were of the same tribe, and employed in the same sacred work. The apostle is proceeding to show that Melchisedec was greater even than Abraham, the head of the fathers, for to him Abraham gave tithes; and as the Levites were the posterity of Abraham, they are represented here as paying tithes to Melchisedec through <i>him</i>. Yet Melchisedec was not of this family, and therefore must be considered as having a more honourable priesthood than even Aaron himself; for he took the <i>tenth</i> from Abraham, not for his <i>maintenance</i>, for he was a <i>king</i>, but in virtue of his <i>office</i> as universal high priest of all that region.</p>
