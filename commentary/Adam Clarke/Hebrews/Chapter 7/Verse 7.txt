<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:7">Hebrews 7:7</span>. <i><b>The less is blessed of the better.</b></i> â€” That the <i>superior</i> blesses the <i>inferior</i> is a general proposition; but Abraham was blessed of Melchisedec, therefore Melchisedec was greater than Abraham. "The blessing here spoken of," says Dr. Macknight, "is not the simple <i>wishing of good</i> to others, which may be done by inferiors to superiors; but it is the action of a person <i>authorized</i> to declare <i>God's intention</i> to bestow good things on another. In this manner Isaac and Jacob blessed their children under a prophetic impulse; in this manner the priests under the law blessed the people; in this manner, likewise, Melchisedec, the priest of the most high God, blessed Abraham."</p>
