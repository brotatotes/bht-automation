<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:8">Hebrews 7:8</span>. <i><b>Here men that die receive tithes</b></i> — The apostle is speaking of the ecclesiastical constitution of the Jews, which was standing at the time this epistle was written. Under the Jewish dispensation, though the priests were successively removed by <i>death</i>, yet they were as duly replaced by others appointed from the same family, and the payment of tithes was never interrupted. But as there is no account of Melchisedec <i>ceasing to be a priest</i>, or of <i>his dying</i>, he is represented as still living, the better to point him out as a type of Christ, and to show his priesthood to be more excellent than that which was according to the law, as an <i>unchanging</i> priesthood must be more excellent than that which was continually <i>changing</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But there he receiveth them</b></i> — The ωδε, <i>here</i>, in the first clause of this verse refers to <i>Mosaical institutions</i>, as then existing: the εκει, <i>there</i>, in this clause refers to the place in Genesis (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:20">Genesis 14:20</span>) where it is related that Abraham gave <i>tithes</i> to Melchisedec, who is still considered as being alive or without a successor, because there is no account of his death, nor of any termination of his priesthood.</p>
