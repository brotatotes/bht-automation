<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:9">Hebrews 7:9</span>. <i><b>And as I may so say</b></i> — και ως επος ειπειν. <i>And so to</i> <i>speak a word</i>. This form of speech, which is very frequent among the purest Greek writers, is generally used to <i>soften</i> some <i>harsh</i> expression, or to <i>limit</i> the meaning when the proposition might otherwise appear to be too <i>general</i>. It answers fully to our <i>so to</i> <i>speak - as one would say - I had almost said - in a certain sense</i>. Many examples of its use by Aristotle, Philo, Lucian, Josephus, Demosthenes, AEschines, and Plutarch, may be seen in <i>Raphelius</i> and <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Payed tithes in Abraham.</b></i> — The Levites, who were descendants of Abraham, paid tithes to Melchisedec δια <i>through</i>, Abraham, their progenitor and representative.</p>
