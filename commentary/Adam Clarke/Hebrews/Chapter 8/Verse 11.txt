<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:11">Hebrews 8:11</span>. <i><b>They shall not teach every man his neighbour</b></i> â€” Under the old covenant, properly speaking, there was no public instruction; before the erection of synagogues all worship was confined at first to the tabernacle, afterwards to the temple. When synagogues were established they were used principally for the bare reading of the law and the prophets; and scarcely any such thing as a <i>public ministry</i> for the continual instruction of the <i>common people</i> was found in the land till the time of John the Baptist, our Lord, and his apostles. It is true there were <i>prophets</i> who were a sort of general teachers, but neither was <i>their</i> ministry extended through all the people; and there were <i>schools of the prophets</i> and <i>schools of the rabbins</i>, but these were for the instruction of <i>select persons</i>. Hence it was necessary that every man should do what he could, under that dispensation, to <i>instruct his neighbour</i> and <i>brother</i>. But the prophecy here indicates that there should be, under the Gospel dispensation, a profusion of Divine light; and this we find to be the case by the plentiful diffusion of the sacred writings, and by an abundant Gospel ministry: and these blessings are not confined to <i>temples</i> or <i>palaces</i>, but are found in every corner of the land; so that, literally, all the people, from the least to the greatest, know and acknowledge the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. Almost every man, at least in this land, has a Bible, and can read it; and there is not a family that has not the opportunity of hearing the Gospel preached, explained, and enforced.</p>
<p>Some have thought that <i>from the least to the greatest</i> is intended to signify the order in which God proceeds with a work of grace; he generally begins with the poor, and through these the <i>great</i> and the <i>high</i> often hear the Gospel of Christ.</p>
