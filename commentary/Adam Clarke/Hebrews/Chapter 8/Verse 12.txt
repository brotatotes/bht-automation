Verse Hebrews 8:12. I will be merciful to their unrighteousness — In order to be their God, as mentioned under the preceding verse, it is requisite that their iniquity should be pardoned; this is provided for by the immolation of Jesus Christ as the covenant sacrifice. By his blood, redemption has been purchased, and all who with penitent hearts believe on the Lord Jesus receive remission of sins, and God remembers their iniquities no more against them so as to punish them on that account. All spiritual evil against the nature and law of God is represented here under the following terms:-1. Unrighteousness, αδικια, injustice or wrong. This is against God, his neighbour, and himself.2. Sin, αμαρτια, deviation from the Divine law; MISSING THE MARK; aiming at happiness but never attaining it, because sought out of God, and in the breach of his laws.3. Iniquity, ανομια, lawlessness, not having, knowing, or acknowledging, a law; having no law written in their hearts, and restrained by none in the conduct of their lives. All these are to be removed by God's mercy; and this is to be understood of his mercy in Christ Jesus.
