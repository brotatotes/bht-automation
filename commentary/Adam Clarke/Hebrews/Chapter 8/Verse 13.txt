<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:13">Hebrews 8:13</span>. <i><b>He hath made the first old.</b></i> — That is: He has considered it as <i>antiquated</i>, and as being no longer of any force.</p>
<p><i><b>That which decayeth and waxeth old</b></i> — Here is an allusion to the ancient laws, which either had perished from the <i>tables</i> on which they were written through <i>old age</i>, or were fallen into <i>disuse</i>, or were <i>abrogated</i>.</p>
<p>Is <i><b>ready to vanish away.</b></i> — εγγυς αφανισμου. <i>Is about to be</i> <i>abolished</i>. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, speaking of the laws of Numa, which had been written on <i>oak boards</i>, says: ας αψανισθηναι συνεβη τω χρονω. "which had perished through old age." And the word αφανιζειν is used to express the <i>abolition of the law</i>. The apostle, therefore, intimates that the old covenant was just about to be abolished; but he expresses himself cautiously and tenderly, that he might not give unnecessary offence.</p>
<p>WHEN the apostle said, <i>All shall know the Lord, from the least</i> <i>to the greatest</i>, under the new covenant, he had copious authority for saying so from the rabbins themselves. In <i>Sohar Chadash</i>, fol. 42, it is said: "In the days of the Messiah knowledge shall be renewed in the world, and the law shall be made plain among all; as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:33">Jeremiah 31:33</span>, <i>All shall know me, from the least to the greatest</i>." We find the following legend in <i>Midrash Yalcut Simeoni</i>, part 2, fol. 46: "The holy blessed God shall sit in paradise and explain the law; all the righteous shall sit before him, and the whole heavenly family shall stand on their feet; and the holy blessed God shall sit, and the <i>new law</i>, which be is to give by <i>the Messiah</i>, shall be interpreted."</p>
<p>In <i>Sohar Genes</i>., fol. 74, col. 291, we find these remarkable words: "When the days of the Messiah shall approach, even the little children in this world shall find out the hidden things of wisdom; and in that time all things shall be revealed to all men."</p>
<p>And in <i>Sohar Levit</i>., fol. 24, col. 95: "There shall be no time like this till the Messiah comes, and then the knowledge of God shall be found in every part of the world."</p>
<p>This day are all these sayings fulfilled in our ears: the word of God is multiplied; many run to and fro, and knowledge is increased; all the nations of the earth are receiving the book of God; and men of every clime, and of every degree-Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites; the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea, in Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt, in Libya; strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes; Cretes and Arabians; Americans, Indians, and Chinese-hear, in their own tongues, the wonderful works of God.</p>
