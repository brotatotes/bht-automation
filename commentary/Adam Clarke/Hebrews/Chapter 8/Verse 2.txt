<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>. <i><b>A minister of the sanctuary</b></i> — των αγιων λειτουργος. <i>A public minister of the holy things</i> or <i>places</i>. The word λειτουργος, from λειτος, <i>public</i>, and εργον, a <i>work</i> or <i>office</i>, means a person who officiated for the public, a public officer; in whom, and his work, all the people had a common right: hence our word <i>liturgy</i>, the <i>public work</i> of prayer and praise, designed for the <i>people at large</i>; all having a right to attend it, and each having an equal interest in it. Properly speaking, the Jewish priest was the servant of the public; he transacted the business of the people with God. Jesus Christ is also the same kind of public officer; both as <i>Priest</i> and <i>Mediator</i> he transacts the business of the whole human race with God. He performs the <i>holy things</i> or <i>acts</i> in the <i>true tabernacle</i>, HEAVEN, of which the Jewish tabernacle was the <i>type</i>. The tabernacle was the place among the Jews where God, by the <i>symbol of his presence, dwelt</i>. This could only typify <i>heaven</i>, where God, in his <i>essential glory</i>, dwells, and is manifest to angels and glorified saints; and hence heaven is called here the <i>true tabernacle</i>, to distinguish it from the <i>type</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which the Lord pitched</b></i> — The Jewish tabernacle was <i>man's work</i>, though made by God's direction; the <i>heavens</i>, this <i>true tabernacle</i>, the work of God alone, and infinitely more glorious than that of the Jews. The tabernacle was also a type of the <i>human nature</i> of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>: <i>And the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us</i>, καιεσκηνωσενεν ημιν <i>and tabernacled among us</i>; for, as the Divine presence dwelt in the tabernacle, so the fulness of the Godhead, bodily, dwelt in the man Christ Jesus. And this human body was the <i>peculiar work</i> <i>of God</i>, as it came not in the way of <i>natural generation</i>.</p>
