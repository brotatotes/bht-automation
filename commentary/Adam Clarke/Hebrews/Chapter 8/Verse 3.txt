<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span>. <i><b>Every high priest is ordained</b></i> — καθισταται, <i>Is set</i> <i>apart</i>, for this especial work.</p>
<p><i><b>Gifts and sacrifices</b></i> — δωρα τε και θυσιας. <i>Eucharistic</i> offerings, and <i>sacrifices for sin</i>. By the <i>former</i>, God's government of the universe, and his benevolence to his creatures in providing for their support, were acknowledged. By the <i>latter</i>, the destructive and ruinous nature of sin, and the necessity of an atonement, were confessed.</p>
<p><i><b>Wherefore-of necessity</b></i> — If Christ be a high priest, and it be essential to the office of a high priest to offer atoning sacrifices to God, Jesus must offer such. Now it is manifest that, as he is the <i>public minister</i>, officiating in the <i>true</i> <i>tabernacle</i> as high priest, he must make an atonement; and his being at the right hand of the throne shows that he has offered, and continues to offer, such an atonement.</p>
