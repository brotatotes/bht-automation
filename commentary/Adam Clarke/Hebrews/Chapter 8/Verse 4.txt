<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:4">Hebrews 8:4</span>. <i><b>For if he were on earth</b></i> — As the Jewish temple was standing when this epistle was written, the whole temple service continued to be performed by the legal priests, descendants of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi; therefore if Christ had been then on earth, he could not have performed the office of a priest, being of the tribe of Judah, to which tribe the office of the priesthood did not appertain.</p>
<p><i><b>There are priests that offer gifts</b></i> — This is an additional proof that this epistle was written before the destruction of Jerusalem. As the word θυσιαι, <i>sacrifices</i>, is not added here as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span>, is it any evidence that bloody sacrifices had then ceased to be offered? Or, are both kinds included in the word δωρα, <i>gifts</i>? But is δωρον, a <i>gift</i>, ever used to express a <i>bloody</i> <i>sacrifice</i>? I believe the Septuagint never used it for זבח <i>zebach,</i> which signifies an animal offered to God in sacrifice.</p>
