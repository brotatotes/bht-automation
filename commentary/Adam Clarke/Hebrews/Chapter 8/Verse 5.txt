<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>. <i><b>Who serve</b></i> — Οἱτινες λατρευουσι. Who perform Divine worship.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto the example and shadow</b></i> — Υποδειγματι και σκιᾳ, WITH <i>the</i> <i>representation and shadow</i>; this is Dr. Macknight's translation, and probably the true one.</p>
<p>The whole Levitical service was a representation and shadow of heavenly things; it appears, therefore, absurd to say that the priests served UNTO <i>an example</i> or <i>representation</i> of heavenly things; they served rather unto the <i>substance</i> of those things, WITH appropriate <i>representations</i> and <i>shadows</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>As Moses was admonished</b></i> — Καθως κεχρηματισται Μωσης. <i>As Moses</i> <i>was Divinely warned</i> or <i>admonished of God</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the pattern</b></i> — Κατα τον τυπον. According to the <i>type, plan</i>, or <i>form</i>. It is very likely that God gave a regular plan and <i>specification</i> of the tabernacle and all its parts to Moses; and that from this Divine plan the whole was constructed. <i>See on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:40">Exodus 25:40</span><i>"</i>.</p>
