Verse Hebrews 8:5. Who serve — Οἱτινες λατρευουσι. Who perform Divine worship.Unto the example and shadow — Υποδειγματι και σκιᾳ, WITH the representation and shadow; this is Dr. Macknight's translation, and probably the true one.The whole Levitical service was a representation and shadow of heavenly things; it appears, therefore, absurd to say that the priests served UNTO an example or representation of heavenly things; they served rather unto the substance of those things, WITH appropriate representations and shadows.As Moses was admonished — Καθως κεχρηματισται Μωσης. As Moses was Divinely warned or admonished of God.According to the pattern — Κατα τον τυπον. According to the type, plan, or form. It is very likely that God gave a regular plan and specification of the tabernacle and all its parts to Moses; and that from this Divine plan the whole was constructed. See on "Exodus 25:40".
