<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:7">Hebrews 8:7</span>. <i><b>If that first had been faultless</b></i> â€” This is nearly the same argument with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span>. The simple meaning is: If the first covenant had made a provision for and actually conferred pardon and <i>purity</i>, and given a <i>title</i> to eternal life, then there could have been no need for a second; but the first covenant did not give these things, therefore a second was necessary; and the covenant that gives these things is the Christian covenant.</p>
