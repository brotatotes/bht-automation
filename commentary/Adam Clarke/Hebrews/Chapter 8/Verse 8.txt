<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8">Hebrews 8:8</span>. <i><b>For finding fault with them</b></i> — The meaning is evidently this: God, in order to show that the first covenant was inefficient, saith to <i>them</i>, the Israelites, <i>Behold, the days come</i> <i>when I will make a new covenant</i>, c. He <i>found fault</i> with the <i>covenant</i>, and addressed the <i>people</i> concerning his purpose of giving another covenant, that should be such as the necessities of mankind required. As this place refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</span>, the words <i>finding fault with them</i> may refer to the <i>Jewish people</i>, of whom the Lord complains that they had broken his covenant <i>though</i> <i>he was a husband to them</i>. See below.</p>
<p><i><b>With the house of Israel and with the house of Judah</b></i> — That is, with all the descendants of the twelve sons of Jacob. This is thought to be a promise of the conversion of all the Jews to Christianity both of the <i>lost tribes</i>, and of those who are known to exist in Asiatic and European countries.</p>
