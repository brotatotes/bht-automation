<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:9">Hebrews 8:9</span>. <i><b>Not according to the covenant</b></i> — The new covenant is of a widely different nature to that of the old; it was only temporal and earthly in itself, though it pointed out spiritual and eternal things. The new covenant is totally different from this, as we have already seen; and such a covenant, or <i>system of religion</i>, the Jews should have been prepared to expect, as the Prophet Jeremiah had, in the above place, so clearly foretold it.</p>
<p><i><b>They continued not in my covenant</b></i> — It should be observed that the word διαθνκν, which we translate <i>covenant</i>, often means <i>religion</i> itself; and its various precepts. The old covenant in general stated, on God's side, <i>I will be your God</i>; on the Israelites' side, <i>We will be thy people</i>. This covenant they brake; they served other gods, and neglected the precepts of that holy religion which God had delivered to them.</p>
<p><i><b>And I regarded them not</b></i> — Καγω ημελησα αυτων· <i>And I</i> <i>neglected them or despised them</i>; but the words in the Hebrew text of the prophet are ואנכי בעלתי בם <i>veanochi baalti bam</i>, which we translate, <i>although I was a husband to them</i>. If our translation be correct, is it possible to account for this most strange difference between the apostle and the prophet? Could the Spirit of God be the author of such a strange, not to say <i>contradictory</i>, translation of the same words? Let it be observed:</p>
<p>1. That the apostle quotes from the Septuagint; and in quoting a version accredited by and commonly used among the Jews, he ought to give the text as he found it, unless the Spirit of God dictated an extension of meaning, as is sometimes the case; but in the present case there seems to be no necessity to alter the meaning. </p>
<p>2. The Hebrew words will bear a translation much nearer to the Septuagint and the apostle than our translation intimates. The words might be literally rendered, <i>And I was Lord over them</i>, or <i>I lorded</i> or <i>ruled over them</i>; i.e., I chastised them for their transgressions, and punished them for their iniquities; ημελησα, <i>I took no farther</i> <i>care of them</i>, and gave them up into the hands of their enemies, and so they were carried away into captivity. This pretty nearly reconciles the Hebrew and the Greek, as it shows the act of God in reference to them is nearly the same when the proper meaning of the Hebrew and Greek words is considered.</p>
<p>Some suppose that the letter ע ain in בעלתי is changed for ח <i>cheth</i>, and that the word should be read בחלתי <i>bachalti</i>, I <i>have</i> <i>hated</i> or <i>despised them</i>. An ancient and learned Jew, Rab. <i>Parchon,</i> has these remarkable words on this passage, </p>
<p>ואנכי בעלתי בם׃ פ</p>
<p>שנאתים וזו העין מתחלבה כחית שג</p>
<p>וגם נכשם כחלה בי׃ פ</p>
<p>שנאה אותי,</p>
<p><i>and I baatti baam</i>, translate, <i>I hated them</i>; for ע <i>ain</i> is here changed and stands for ח <i>cheth</i>, as it is said, <i>their soul bachalah</i> <i>bi</i>, translate, <i>hath hated me</i>." None of the Hebrew MSS. collated by <i>Kennicott</i> and <i>De Rossi</i> give any various reading on this word. Some of the versions have used as much latitude in their translations of the Hebrew as the Septuagint. But it is unnecessary to discuss this subject any farther; the word בעל <i>baal</i> itself, by the consent of the most learned men, signifies to <i>disdain</i> or <i>despise</i>, and this is pretty nearly the sense of the apostle's expression.</p>
