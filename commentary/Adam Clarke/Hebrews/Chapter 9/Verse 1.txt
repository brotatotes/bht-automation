<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1">Hebrews 9:1</span>. <i><b>The first</b></i> covenant <i>had also ordinances</i>] Our translators have introduced the word <i>covenant</i>, as if διαθηκη had been, if not originally in the text, yet in the apostle's mind. Several MSS., but not of good note, as well as printed <i>editions</i>, with the <i>Coptic</i> version, have σκηνη <i>tabernacle</i>; but this is omitted by ABDE, several others, both the <i>Syriac, AEthiopic</i>, <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, some copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and several of the Greek fathers; it is in all probability a spurious reading, the whole context showing that <i>covenant</i> is that to which the apostle refers, as that was the subject in the preceding chapter, and this is a continuation of the same discourse.</p>
<p><i><b>Ordinances</b></i> — δικαιωματα. Rites and ceremonies.</p>
<p><i><b>A worldly sanctuary.</b></i> — αγιον κοσμικον. It is supposed that the term <i>worldly</i>, here, is opposed to the term <i>heavenly</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>; and that the whole should be referred to the carnality or secular nature of the tabernacle service. But I think there is nothing plainer than that the apostle is speaking here in <i>praise</i> of this sublimely emblematic service, and hence he proceeds to enumerate the various things contained in the first tabernacle, which added vastly to its <i>splendour</i> and importance; such as the table of the show-bread, the golden candlestick, the golden censer, the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, in which was the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the two tables which God had written with his own finger: hence I am led to believe that κοσμικος is here taken in its proper, natural meaning, and signifies <i>adorned, embellished, splendid</i>; and hence κοσμος, <i>the world: Tota hujus universi machina, coelum et terram</i> <i>complectens et quicquid utroque contineter</i>, κοσμος <i>dicitur, quod</i> <i>nihil ea est</i> mundius, pulchrius, <i>et</i> ornatius. "The whole machine of this universe, comprehending the heavens and the earth, and whatsoever is contained in both, is called κοσμος, because nothing is more <i>beautiful</i>, more <i>fair</i>, and more <i>elegant</i>." So Pliny, Hist. Nat., l. ii. c. 5: <i>Nam quem</i> κοσμον <i>Graeci nomine</i> ornamenti <i>appellaverunt, eum nos a</i> perfecta absolutaque elegantia, MUNDUM. "That which the Greeks call κοσμος, <i>ornament</i>, we, (the Latins,) from its perfect and absolute elegance call <i>mundum</i>, world." <i>See on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:1">Genesis 2:1</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p>The Jews believe that the tabernacle was an epitome of the world; and it is remarkable, when speaking of their city, that they express this sentiment by the same Greek word, in Hebrew letters, which the apostle uses here: so in <i>Bereshith Rabba</i>, s. 19, fol. 19: כל קוזמיקון שלו שם הוא <i>col</i> kozmikon (κοσμικον) <i>shelo sham hu</i>. "All his world is placed there." Philo says much to the same purpose.</p>
<p>If my exposition be not admitted, the next most likely is, that God has a <i>worldly tabernacle</i> as well as a <i>heavenly one</i>; that he as truly <i>dwelt</i> in the Jewish tabernacle as he did in the heaven of heavens; the one being his <i>worldly house</i>, the other his <i>heavenly</i> <i>house</i>.</p>
