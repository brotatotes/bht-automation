<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:10">Hebrews 9:10</span>. <i><b>In meats and drinks, and divers washings</b></i> — He had already mentioned eucharistic and sacrificial offerings, and nothing properly remained but the different kinds of clean and unclean animals which were used, or forbidden to be used, as articles of food; together with the different kinds or drinks, washings, βαπτισμοις, <i>baptisms</i>, immersions, sprinklings and washings of the body and the clothes, and <i>carnal ordinances</i>, or things which had respect merely to the body, and could have no <i>moral influence</i> upon the soul, unless considered in reference to that of which they were the similitudes, or figures.</p>
<p><i><b>Carnal ordinances</b></i> — δικαιωματα σαρκος. Rites and ceremonies pertaining merely to the <i>body</i>. The word <i>carnal</i> is not used here, nor scarcely in any part of the New Testament, in that catachrestical or <i>degrading</i> sense in which many preachers and professors of Christianity take the liberty to use it.</p>
<p><i><b>Imposed</b></i> on them <i>until the time of reformation.</i>] These rites and ceremonies were enacted, by Divine authority, as proper representations of the Gospel system, which should reform and rectify all things.</p>
<p><i>The time of reformation</i>, καιρος διορθωσεως, <i>the time of</i> <i>rectifying</i>, signifies the Gospel dispensation, under which every thing is set <i>straight</i>; every thing referred to its proper purpose and end; the ceremonial law fulfilled and abrogated; the moral law exhibited and more strictly enjoined; (see our Lord's sermon upon the mount;) and the spiritual nature of God's worship taught, and grace promised to purify the heart: so that, through the power of the eternal Spirit, all that was <i>wrong</i> in the soul is <i>rectified</i>; the affections, passions, and appetites purified; the understanding enlightened; the judgment corrected; the will refined; in a word, all things made <i>new</i>.</p>
