<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>. <i><b>But Christ being come a high priest of good things</b></i> — I think this and the succeeding verses not happily translated: indeed, the <i>division</i> of them has led to a wrong translation; therefore they must be taken together, thus: <i>But the Christ, the</i> <i>high priest of those good things</i> (or <i>services</i>) <i>which were to come,</i> <i>through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with</i> <i>hands</i>, that is, <i>not of the same workmanship, entered once for all</i> <i>into the sanctuary; having obtained eternal redemption</i> for us, <i>not</i> <i>by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>. <i>For if the blood of</i> GOATS, <i>and bulls, and calves, and a heifer's</i> <i>ashes, sprinkled on the unclean, sanctifieth to the cleansing of</i> <i>the flesh</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>,) <i>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal</i> <i>Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your</i> <i>consciences from dead works, in order to worship</i> (or <i>that ye may worship</i>) <i>the living God</i>?</p>
<p>In the above translation I have added, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>, τραγων, <i>of goats</i>, on the authority of ABDE, three others, the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Arabic</i> of Erpen, <i>Coptic, Vulgate</i>, two copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and <i>Theodoret</i>. And I have rendered ειςτολατρευειν, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>,) IN ORDER <i>to worship</i>, or THAT YE MAY <i>worship</i>; for this is the meaning of these particles ειςτο in many parts of the New Testament. I shall now make a few observations on some of the principal expressions.</p>
<p><i><b>High priest of good things</b></i> — Or <i>services, to come</i>, των μελλοντων αγαθων. He is the High Priest of Christianity; he officiates in the behalf of all mankind; for by him are all the prayers, praises, and services of mankind offered to God; and he ever appears in the presence of God for us.</p>
<p><i><b>A greater and more perfect tabernacle</b></i> — This appears to mean our Lord's <i>human nature</i>. That, in which dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, was fitly typified by the tabernacle and temple, in both of which the majesty of God dwelt.</p>
<p><i><b>Not made with hands</b></i> — Though our Lord's body was a perfect human body, yet it did not come in the way of natural generation; his <i>miraculous conception</i> will sufficiently justify the expressions used here by the apostle.</p>
