<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>. <i><b>But by his own blood</b></i> — Here the redemption of man is attributed to the <i>blood of Christ</i>; and this blood is stated to be shed in a <i>sacrificial</i> way, precisely as the blood of bulls, goats and calves was shed under the law.</p>
<p><i><b>Once</b></i> — <i>Once for all</i>, εφαπαξ, in opposition to the <i>annual</i> entering of the high priest into the holiest, with the blood of the <i>annual</i> victim.</p>
<p><i><b>The holy place</b></i> — Or <i>sanctuary</i>, τα αγια, signifies <i>heaven</i>, into which Jesus entered with his own blood, as the high priest entered into the holy of holies with the blood of the <i>victims</i> which he had sacrificed.</p>
<p><i><b>Eternal redemption</b></i> — αιωνιαν λυτρωσιν. A redemption price which should stand good <i>for ever</i>, when once offered; and an <i>endless</i> <i>redemption</i> from sin, in reference to the pardon of which, and reconciliation to God, there needs no other sacrifice: it is <i>eternal</i> in its <i>merit</i> and <i>efficacy</i>.</p>
