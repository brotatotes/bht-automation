<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Who through the eternal Spirit</b></i> — This expression is understood two ways:</p>
<p>1. Of the Holy Ghost himself. As Christ's <i>miraculous conception</i> was by the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, and he wrought all his <i>miracles</i> by the <i>Spirit</i> of God, so his <i>death</i> or final offering was made through or by the <i>eternal Spirit</i>; and by that <i>Spirit</i> he was <i>raised from the dead</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span>. Indeed, through the whole of his life be was <i>justified by the Spirit</i>; and we find that in this great work of human redemption, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were continually employed: therefore the words may be understood of the Holy Spirit properly. </p>
<p>2. Of the <i>eternal Logos</i> or Deity which dwelt in the man Christ Jesus, through the energy of which the offering of his humanity became an infinitely meritorious victim; therefore the Deity of Christ is here intended.</p>
<p>But we cannot well consider one of these distinct from the other; and hence probably arose the various readings in the MSS. and versions on this article. Instead of διαπνευματος αιωνιου, <i>by the</i> ETERNAL <i>Spirit</i>, διαπνευματοςαγιου, <i>by</i> <i>the</i> HOLY <i>Spirit</i>, is the reading of D*, and more than twenty others of good note, besides the <i>Coptic, Slavonic, Vulgate</i>, two copies of the <i>Itala, Cyril, Athanasius</i> sometimes, <i>Damascenus, Chrysostom</i>, and some others. But the common reading is supported by ABD**, and others, besides the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, Armenian</i>, <i>AEthiopic, Athanasius</i> generally, <i>Theodoret, Theophylact</i>, and <i>Ambrosius</i>. This, therefore, is the reading that should he preferred, as it is probable that the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, not the <i>Logos</i>, is what the apostle had more immediately in view. But still we must say, that the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, with the <i>eternal Logos</i>, and the <i>almighty Father</i>, equally concurred in offering up the sacrifice of the human nature of Christ, in order to make atonement for the sin of the world.</p>
<p><i><b>Purge your conscience</b></i> — καθαριει την συνειδησιν. <i>Purify your</i> <i>conscience</i>. The term <i>purify</i> should be everywhere, both in the translation of the Scriptures, and in preaching the Gospel, preferred to the word <i>purge</i>, which, at present, is scarcely ever used in the sense in which our translators have employed it.</p>
<p><i><b>Dead works</b></i> — Sin in general, or acts to which the <i>penalty of</i> <i>death</i> is annexed by the law. <i>See the phrase explained, "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:1">Hebrews 6:1</span><i>"</i>.</p>
