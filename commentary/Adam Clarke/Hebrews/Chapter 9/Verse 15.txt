<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And for this cause</b></i> — Some translate διατουτο, <i>on</i> <i>account of this</i> (blood.) Perhaps it means no more than a mere inference, such as <i>therefore</i>, or <i>wherefore</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He is the Mediator of the new testament</b></i> — There was no proper reason why our translators should render διαθηκη by <i>testament</i> here, when in almost every other case they render it <i>covenant</i>, which is its proper ecclesiastical meaning, as answering to the Hebrew ברית <i>berith</i>, which see largely explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:10">Genesis 15:10</span>, and in other places of the Pentateuch.</p>
<p>Very few persons are satisfied with the translation of the following verses to the <i>20</i>th, particularly the <i>16</i>th and <i>17</i>th; at all events the word <i>covenant</i> must be retained. <i>He </i>- Jesus Christ, is <i>Mediator</i>; the μεσιτης, or <i>mediator</i>, was the person who witnessed the contract made between the two contracting parties, slew the victim, and sprinkled each with its blood.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the new testament</b></i> — The <i>new contract</i> betwixt God and the whole human race, by <i>Christ Jesus</i> the Mediator, distinguished here from the <i>old covenant</i> between God and the <i>Israelites</i>, in which <i>Moses</i> was the mediator.</p>
<p><i><b>That by means of death</b></i> — His own death upon the cross.</p>
<p><i><b>For the redemption of the transgressions</b></i> — To make atonement for the transgressions which were committed under the old covenant, which the blood of bulls and calves could not do; so the death of Jesus had respect to all the time antecedent to it, as well as to all the time afterward till the conclusion of the world.</p>
<p><i><b>They which are called</b></i> — The GENTILES, <i>might receive the</i> <i>promise</i>-might, by being brought into a covenant with God, have an equal right with the <i>Jews</i>, not merely to an inheritance such as the promised land, but to an <i>eternal inheritance</i>, and consequently infinitely superior to that of the Jews, inasmuch as the new covenant is superior in every point of view to the old.</p>
<p>How frequently the <i>Gentiles</i> are termed οικλητοι and οι κεκλημενοι, <i>the called</i>, all St. Paul's writings show. And they were thus termed because they were <i>called</i> and <i>elected</i> in the place of the Jews, the ancient <i>called</i> and <i>elect</i>, who were now <i>divorced</i> and <i>reprobated</i> because of their disobedience.</p>
