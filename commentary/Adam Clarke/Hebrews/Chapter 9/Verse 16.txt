<p>Verse 16. <i><b>For where a testament is</b></i> — A learned and judicious friend furnishes me with the following translation of this and the <i>17</i>th verse:-</p>
<p>"For where there is a covenant, it is necessary that the death of the appointed <i>victim</i> should be exhibited, because a covenant is confirmed over dead <i>victims</i>, since it is not at all valid while the appointed <i>victim</i> is alive."</p>
<p>He observes, "There is no word signifying <i>testator</i>, or <i>men</i>, in the original. διαθεμενος is not a substantive, but a participle, or a participial adjective, derived from the same root as διατηκη, and must have a substantive understood. I therefore render it <i>the</i> <i>disposed</i> or <i>appointed</i> victim, alluding to the manner of <i>disposing</i> or <i>setting apart</i> the pieces of the victim, when they were going to ratify a covenant; and you know well the old custom of ratifying a covenant, to which the apostle alludes. I refer to your own notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:18">Genesis 6:18</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:10">Genesis 15:10</span>.-J. C."</p>
<p>Mr. Wakefield has translated the passage nearly in the same way.</p>
<p>"For where a covenant <i>is</i>, there must be necessarily introduced <i>the</i> death of that which establisheth the covenant; because a covenant <i>is</i> confirmed over dead things, and is of no force at all whilst that which establisheth the covenant is alive." This is undoubtedly the meaning of this passage; and we should endeavour to forget that <i>testament</i> and <i>testator</i> were ever introduced, as they totally change the apostle's meaning. See the observations at the end of this chapter.</p>
