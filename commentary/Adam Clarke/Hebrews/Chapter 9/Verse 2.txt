<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span>. <i><b>For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein</b></i> — The sense is here very obscure, and the construction involved: leaving out all punctuation, which is the case with all the very ancient MSS., the verse stands thus: Σκηνη γαρ κατεσκευασθη ἡ πρωτη εν ᾑ ἡ τε λυχνια, κ. τ. λ. which I suppose an indifferent person, who understood the language, would without hesitation render, <i>For, there was the first tabernacle constructed, in which</i> <i>were the candlestick, c</i>. And this tabernacle or dwelling may be called the <i>first</i> dwelling place which God had among men, to distinguish it from the <i>second</i> dwelling place, the temple built by Solomon for tabernacle here is to be considered in its general sense, as implying a <i>dwelling</i>.</p>
<p>To have a proper understanding of what the apostle relates here, we should endeavour to take a concise view of the tabernacle erected by Moses in the wilderness. This tabernacle was the epitome of the Jewish temple; or rather, according to this as a model was the Jewish temple built. It comprised,</p>
<p>1. The court where the people might enter. </p>
<p>2. In this was contained the altar of burnt-offerings, on which were offered the sacrifices in general, besides offerings of bread, wine, and other things.</p>
<p>3. At the bottom or lower end of this court was the <i>tent</i> of the covenant; the two principal parts of the tabernacle were, the holy place and the holy of holies.</p>
<p>In the temple built by Solomon there was a court for the Levites, different from that of the people; and, at the entrance of the holy place, a vestibule. But in the tabernacle built by Moses these parts were not found, nor does the apostle mention them here.</p>
<p>In the holy place, as the apostle observes, there were,</p>
<p>1. The golden candlestick of seven branches, on the <i>south</i>.</p>
<p>2. The golden altar, or altar of incense, on the <i>north</i>.</p>
<p>3. The altar, or table of the show-bread; or where the twelve loaves, representing the twelve tribes, were laid before the Lord.</p>
<p>1. In each branch of the golden candlestick was a lamp; these were lighted every evening, and extinguished every morning. They were intended to give light by night. 2. The altar of incense was of gold; and a priest, chosen by lot each week, offered incense every morning and evening in a golden censer, which he probably left on the altar after the completion of the offering. 3. The table of the show-bread was covered with plates of gold; and on this, every Sabbath, they placed <i>twelve</i> loaves in two piles, six in each, which continued there all the week till the next Sabbath, when they were removed, and fresh loaves put in their place. The whole of this may be seen in all its details in the book of Exodus, from chap. 35 to 40. See <i>Calmet</i> also.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is called the sanctuary.</b></i> — ητις λεγεται αγια. <i>This is</i> <i>called holy</i>. This clause may apply to any of the nouns in this verse, in the nominative case, which are all of the feminine gender; and the adjective αγια, <i>holy</i>, may be considered here as the nominative singular feminine, agreeing with ητις. Several <i>editions</i> accent the words in reference to this construction. The word σκηνη, <i>tabernacle</i>, may be the proper antecedent; and then we may read αγια, instead of αγια: but these niceties belong chiefly to grammarians,</p>
