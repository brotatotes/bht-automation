<p>Verse 20. <i><b>This</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the blood of the testament</b></i> â€” (<i>covenant</i>.) Our Lord refers to the conduct of Moses here, and partly quotes his words in the institution of the eucharist: <i>This is my blood of</i> <i>the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of</i> <i>sins</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>. And by thus using the words and applying them, he shows that <i>his</i> sacrificial blood was intended by the blood shed and sprinkled on this occasion, and that by it alone the remission of sins is obtained.</p>
