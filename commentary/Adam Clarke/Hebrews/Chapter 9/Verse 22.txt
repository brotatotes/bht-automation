<p>Verse 22. <i><b>And almost all things are - purged with blood</b></i> — The apostle says <i>almost</i>, because in some cases certain vessels were purified by <i>water</i>, some by <i>fire</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:23">Numbers 31:23</span>, and some with the <i>ashes</i> of the <i>red heifer</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:2-10">Numbers 19:2-10</span>, but it was always understood that every thing was at <i>first</i> consecrated by the blood of the victim.</p>
<p><i><b>And without shedding of blood is no remission.</b></i> — The apostle shows fully here what is one of his great objects in the whole of this epistle, viz. that there is no salvation but through the sacrificial death of Christ, and to prefigure this the law itself would not grant any remission of sin without the blood of a victim. This is a maxim even among the Jews themselves, אין כפרה אלא בדם <i>ein capparah ella bedam</i>, "There is no expiation but by blood." <i>Yoma</i>, fol. 5, 1; <i>Menachoth</i>, fol. 93, 2. Every sinner has forfeited his <i>life</i> by his transgressions, and the law of God requires his <i>death</i>; the blood of the victim, which is its <i>life</i>, is shed as a <i>substitute</i> for the <i>life</i> of the sinner. By these victims the sacrifice of Christ was typified. He gave his <i>life</i> for the <i>life</i> of the world; human life for human life, but a life infinitely dignified by its union with God.</p>
