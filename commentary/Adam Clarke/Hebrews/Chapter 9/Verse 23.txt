<p>Verse 23. <i><b>The patterns of things in the heavens</b></i> — That is: The tabernacle and all its utensils, services, c., must be purified <i>by these</i>, viz.: <i>The blood of calves and goats, and the sprinkling</i> <i>of the blood and water with the bunch of hyssop bound about with</i> <i>scarlet wool</i>. These are called <i>patterns</i>, υποδειγματα, <i>exemplars</i>, earthly things, which were the representatives of heavenly things. And there is no doubt that every thing in the tabernacle, its parts, divisions, utensils, ministry, c., as appointed by God, were representations of <i>celestial matters</i> but how <i>far</i> and in <i>what way</i> we cannot now see.</p>
<p><i>Purification</i> implies, not only cleansing from defilement, but also <i>dedication</i> or <i>consecration</i>. All the utensils employed in the tabernacle service were thus <i>purified</i> though incapable of any moral pollution.</p>
<p><i><b>But the heavenly things themselves</b></i> — </p>
<p>1. Some think this means <i>heaven</i> itself, which, by receiving the sacrificed body of Christ, which appears in the presence of God for us, may be said to be <i>purified</i>, i.e., <i>set apart</i> for the reception of the souls of those who have found redemption in his blood.</p>
<p>2. Others think the <i>body</i> <i>of Christ</i> is intended, which is the <i>tabernacle</i> in which his Divinity dwelt and that this might be said to be <i>purified</i> by its own sacrifice, as he is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>, to <i>sanctify himself</i>; that is, to <i>consecrate</i> himself unto God as a sin-offering for the redemption of man. </p>
<p>3. Others suppose the Church is intended, which he is to <i>present to the Father without</i> <i>spot</i> or <i>wrinkle</i> or <i>any such thing</i>. </p>
<p>4. As the <i>entrance</i> to the holy of holies must be made by the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice, and as that holy of holies represented <i>heaven</i>, the apostle's meaning seems to be that there was and could be no entrance to the holiest but through his blood; and therefore, when by a more perfect tabernacle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>, he passed into the heavens, not with the blood of bulls and goats, but by his own blood, he thus purified or laid open the entrance to the holiest, by a more valuable sacrifice than those required to open the entrance of the holy of holies. <i>It was necessary</i>, therefore, for God had appointed it so, that the <i>tabernacle</i> and its <i>parts</i>, c., which were <i>patterns of things in the heavens</i>, should be <i>consecrated</i> and <i>entered</i> with such sacrifices as have already been mentioned but the heaven of heavens into which Jesus entered, and whither he will bring all his faithful followers, must be propitiated, consecrated, and entered, by the infinitely <i>better</i> <i>sacrifice</i> of his own body and blood. That this is the meaning appears from the following verse.</p>
