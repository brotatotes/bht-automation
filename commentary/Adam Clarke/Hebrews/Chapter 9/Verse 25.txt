<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Nor yet that he should offer himself often</b></i> â€” The sacrifice of Christ is not like that of the Jewish high priest; his must be offered every year, Christ has offered himself <i>once</i> <i>for all</i>: and this sacrificial act has ever the same efficacy, his crucified body being still a powerful and infinitely meritorious sacrifice before the throne.</p>
