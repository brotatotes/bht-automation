<p>Verse 26. <i><b>For then must he often have suffered</b></i> — In the counsel of God, Christ was considered the <i>Lamb slain from the foundation of</i> <i>the world</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>, so that all believers <i>before</i> his advent were equally interested in his sacrificial death with those who have lived <i>since</i> his coming. Humanly speaking, the virtue of the annual atonement could not last long, and must be repeated; Christ's sacrifice is ever the same; his life's blood is still considered as in the act of being <i>continually poured out</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The end of the world</b></i> — The conclusion of the Jewish dispensation, the Christian dispensation being that which shall continue till the end of time.</p>
<p><i><b>To put away sin</b></i> — εις αθετησιν αμαρτιας. <i>To abolish the</i> <i>sin-offerings</i>; i.e. to put an end to the <i>Mosaic economy</i> by his one offering of himself. It is certain that, after Christ had offered himself, the typical sin-offerings of the law ceased; and this was expressly foretold by the Prophet Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>. Some think that the expression should be applied to the <i>putting away</i> <i>the guilt, power</i>, and <i>being</i> of sin from the souls of believers.</p>
