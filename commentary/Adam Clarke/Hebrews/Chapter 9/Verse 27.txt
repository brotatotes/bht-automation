<p>Verse 27. <i><b>As it is appointed</b></i> — αποκειται. It is <i>laid before</i> <i>them</i> by the Divine decree: <i>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt</i> <i>return</i>. <i>Unto men</i> generally, during the course of the present world, not <i>all men</i> as some falsely quote; for Enoch and Elijah have not died, and those that shall be alive at the day of judgment shall not <i>die</i>, but be <i>changed</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But after this the judgment</b></i> — They <i>shall die</i> but <i>once</i>, and be <i>judged</i> but once, therefore there is no <i>metempsychosis</i>, no <i>transmigration from body to body</i>; judgment succeeds to dying; and as they shall be <i>judged</i> but <i>once</i>, they can <i>die</i> but <i>once</i>.</p>
