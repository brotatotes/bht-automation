Verse Hebrews 9:3. And after the second veil — The first veil, of which the apostle has not yet spoken, was at the entrance of the holy place, and separated the temple from the court, and prevented the people, and even the Levites, from seeing what was in the holy place.The second veil, of which the apostle speaks here, separated the holy place from the holy of holies.The tabernacle, which is called the Holiest of all — That is, that part of the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies.
