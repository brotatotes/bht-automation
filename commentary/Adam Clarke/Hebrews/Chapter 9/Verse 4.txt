<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span>. <i><b>Which had the golden censer</b></i> — It is evident that the apostle speaks here of the tabernacle built by Moses, and of the state and contents of that tabernacle as they were during the lifetime of Moses. For, as Calmet remarks, in the temple which was afterwards built there were many things <i>added</i> which were not in the tabernacle, and <i>several</i> things <i>left out</i>. The ark of the covenant and the two tables of the law were never found after the return from the Babylonish captivity. We have no proof that, even in the time of Solomon, the golden pot of manna, or the rod of Aaron, was either in or near the ark. In Solomon's temple the holy place was separated from the holy of holies by a solid <i>wall</i>, instead of a veil, and by strong wooden doors, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:31-33">1 Kings 6:31-33</span>. In the same temple there was a large vestibule before the holy place; and round about this and the holy of holies there were many chambers in three stories, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:5-6">1 Kings 6:5-6</span>. But there was nothing of all this in the Mosaic tabernacle; therefore, says Calmet, we need not trouble ourselves to reconcile the various scriptures which mention this subject; some of which refer to the tabernacle, others to Solomon's temple, and others to the temple built by Zorobabel; which places were very different from each other.</p>
<p>The apostle says that the <i>golden censer</i> was in the holy of holies; but this is nowhere mentioned by Moses. But he tells us that the high priest went in, once every year, with the golden censer to burn incense; and Calmet thinks this censer was <i>left</i> <i>there</i> all the year, and that its place was supplied by a new one, brought in by the priest the year following. Others think it was left just within the veil, so that the priest, by putting his hand under the curtain, could take it out, and prepare it for his next entrance into the holiest.</p>
<p><i><b>The ark of the covenant</b></i> — This was a sort of chest overlaid with plates of gold, in which the two tables of the law, Aaron's rod, the pot of manna, &amp;c., were deposited. Its top, or lid, was the propitiatory or mercy-seat.</p>
