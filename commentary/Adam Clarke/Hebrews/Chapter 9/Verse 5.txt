<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:5">Hebrews 9:5</span>. <i><b>And over it the cherubims of glory</b></i> — Cherubim is the plural of <i>cherub</i>, and it is absurd to add our plural termination (s) to the plural termination of the Hebrew. The <i>glory</i> here signifies the <i>shechinah</i> or symbol of the Divine presence.</p>
<p><i><b>Shadowing the mercy-seat</b></i> — One at each end of the ark, with their faces turned toward each other, but looking down on the cover or propitiatory, ιλαστηριον, here called the <i>mercy-seat</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of which we cannot now speak particularly.</b></i> — The apostle did not judge any farther account of these to be necessary; and I may be excused from considering them particularly here, having said so much on each in the places where they occur in the Pentateuch. What these point out or signify is thus explained by St. Cyril: Christus licet unus sit, multifariam tamen a nobis intelligitur: Ipse est <i>Tabernaculum</i> propter carnis tegumenturn: Ipse est <i>Mensa</i>, quia noster cibus est et vita: Ipse est <i>Arca</i> habens legem Dei reconditam, quia est Verbum Patris: Ipse est <i>Candelabrum</i>, quia est lux spiritualis: Ipse est <i>Altare incensi</i>, quia est odor suavitatis in sanctificationem: Ipse est <i>Altare holocausti</i>, quia est hostia pro totius mundi vita in cruce oblata. "Although Christ be but one, yet he is understood by us under a variety of forms. He is the <i>Tabernacle</i>, on account of the human body in which he dwelt. He is the <i>Table</i>, because he is our Bread of life. He is the <i>Ark</i> which has the law of God enclosed within, because he is the Word of the Father. He is the <i>Candlestick</i>, because he is our spiritual light. He is the <i>Altar</i> of <i>incense</i>, because he is the sweet-smelling odour of sanctification. He is the <i>Altar of</i> <i>burnt-offering</i>, because he is the victim, by death on the cross, for the sins of the whole world." This father has said, in a few words, what others have employed whole volumes on, by refining, spiritualizing, and allegorizing.</p>
