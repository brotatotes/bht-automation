<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7">Hebrews 9:7</span>. <i><b>But into the second</b></i> — That is, the holy of holies, or <i>second part</i> of the tabernacle, <i>the high priest alone</i>, once every year, that is, on one day in the year only, which was the day on which the general atonement was made. The high priest could enter into this place only on one day in the year; but on that day he might enter several times. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:0">Leviticus 16:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Not without blood</b></i> — The day prescribed by the law for this great solemnity was the <i>tenth of the month Tisri</i>, in which the high priest brought in the incense or perfumes, which he placed on the golden censer; he brought also the blood of the bullock; and sprinkled some portion of it seven times before the ark, and the veil which separated the holy place from the holy of holies. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:14">Leviticus 16:14</span>. He then came out, and, taking some of the blood of the goat which had been sacrificed, he sprinkled it between the veil and the ark of the covenant, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:15">Leviticus 16:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people</b></i> — Ὑπερ των του λαου αγνοηματων· For transgressions of which they were not conscious: there were so many niceties in the ritual worship of the Jews, and so many ways in which they might offend against the law and incur guilt, that it was found necessary to institute sacrifices to atone for these sins of <i>ignorance</i>. And as the high priest was also clothed with infirmity, he required to have an interest in the same sacrifice, on the same account. This was a national sacrifice; and by it the people understood that they were absolved from all the errors of the past year, and that they now had a renewed right of access to the mercy-seat.</p>
