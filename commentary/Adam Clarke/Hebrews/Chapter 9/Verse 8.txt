Verse Hebrews 9:8. The Holy Ghost this signifying — These services were divinely appointed, and by each of them the Holy Spirit of God is supposed to speak.The way into the holiest — That full access to God was not the common privilege of the people, while the Mosaic economy subsisted. That the apostle means that it is only by Christ that any man and every man can approach God, is evident from Hebrews 10:19-22, and it is about this, and not about the tabernacle of this world, that he is here discoursing.I have already observed that the apostle appears to use the word σκηνη, or tabernacle, in the general sense of a dwelling place; and therefore applies it to the temple, which was reputed the house or dwelling place of God, as well as the ancient tabernacle. Therefore, what he speaks here concerning the first tabernacle, may be understood as applying with propriety to the then Jewish temple, as well as to the ancient tabernacle, which, even with all their sacrifices and ceremonies, could not make the way of holiness plain, nor the way to God's favour possible.
