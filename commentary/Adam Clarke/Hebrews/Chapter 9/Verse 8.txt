<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:8">Hebrews 9:8</span>. <i><b>The Holy Ghost this signifying</b></i> — These services were divinely appointed, and by each of them the Holy Spirit of God is supposed to speak.</p>
<p><i><b>The way into the holiest</b></i> — That full access to God was not the <i>common privilege</i> of the people, while the Mosaic economy subsisted. That the apostle means that it is only by Christ that any man and every man can approach God, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-22">Hebrews 10:19-22</span>, and it is about this, and not about the tabernacle of this world, that he is here discoursing.</p>
<p>I have already observed that the apostle appears to use the word σκηνη, or <i>tabernacle</i>, in the general sense of a <i>dwelling place</i>; and therefore applies it to the <i>temple</i>, which was reputed the <i>house</i> or <i>dwelling place</i> of God, as well as the ancient <i>tabernacle.</i> Therefore, what he speaks here concerning the <i>first tabernacle</i>, may be understood as applying with propriety to the then Jewish <i>temple</i>, as well as to the ancient tabernacle, which, even with all their sacrifices and ceremonies, could not make the way of holiness plain, nor the way to God's favour possible.</p>
