<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>. <i><b>Which</b></i> — Tabernacle and its services, was <i>a figure</i>, παραβολη, a dark enigmatical representation, <i>for the time then</i> <i>present</i> - for that age and dispensation, and for all those who lived under it.</p>
<p><i>In which</i>, καθον, <i>during which</i>, time or dispensation <i>were</i> <i>offered both gifts and sacrifices - eucharistic</i> offerings and <i>victims</i> for sin, <i>that could not make him that did the service</i>, whether the <i>priest</i> who made the offering, or the <i>person</i> who brought it in the behalf of his soul, <i>perfect as pertaining to the</i> <i>conscience</i> - could not take away guilt from the mind, nor purify the conscience from dead works. The whole was a <i>figure</i>, or dark representation, of a spiritual and more glorious system: and although a <i>sinner</i>, who made these offerings and sacrifices according to the law, might be considered as having done his duty, and thus he would be exempted from many ecclesiastical and legal disabilities and punishments; yet his <i>conscience</i> would ever tell him that the guilt of sin was still remaining, and that it was <i>impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take it away</i>. Thus even he that did the service best continued to be <i>imperfect</i> - had a guilty conscience, and an unholy heart.</p>
<p>The words καθον, <i>in which</i>, referred in the above paraphrase to τον καιρον, <i>the time</i>, are read καθ' ην by ABD, and several others, one copy of the <i>Slavonic</i>, the <i>Vulgate</i>, and some of the <i>fathers</i>, and thus refer to την σκηνην, <i>the tabernacle</i>; and this is the reading which our translators appear to have followed. Griesbach places it in his <i>margin</i>, as a very probable reading; but I prefer the other.</p>
