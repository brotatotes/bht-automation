<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>. <i><b>James, a servant of God</b></i> — For an account of this person, or rather for the conjectures concerning him, see the <i>preface</i>. He neither calls himself an <i>apostle</i>, nor does he say that he was the <i>brother of Christ</i>, or <i>bishop of Jerusalem</i>; whether he was <i>James the elder</i>, son of Zebedee, or <i>James the less</i>, called our Lord's brother, or some other person of the same name, we know not. The assertions of writers concerning these points are worthy of no regard. The Church has always received him as an <i>apostle</i> of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>To the twelve tribes - scattered abroad</b></i> — To the Jews, whether converted to Christianity or not, who lived out of Judea, and sojourned among the Gentiles for the purpose of trade or commerce. At this time there were Jews partly <i>travelling</i>, partly <i>sojourning</i>, and partly <i>resident</i> in most parts of the civilized world; particularly in Asia, Greece, Egypt, and Italy. I see no reason for restricting it to Jewish believers only; it was sent to all whom it might concern, but particularly to those who had received the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ; much less must we confine it to those who were scattered abroad at the persecution raised concerning Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>, c. That the twelve tribes were in actual existence when James wrote this epistle, Dr. Macknight thinks evident from the following facts:</p>
<p>"1. Notwithstanding Cyrus allowed all the Jews in his dominions to return to their own land, many of them did not return. This happened agreeably to God's purpose, in permitting them to be carried captive into Assyria and Babylonia for he intended to make himself known among the heathens, by means of the knowledge of his being and perfections, which the Jews, in their dispersion, would communicate to them. This also was the reason that God determined that the ten tribes should never return to their own land, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:6">Hosea 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+8:8">Hosea 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+9:3">Hosea 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+9:15-17">Hosea 9:15-17</span>. </p>
<p>2. That, comparatively speaking, few of the twelve tribes returned in consequence of Cyrus's decree, but continued to live among the Gentiles, appears from this: that in the days of Ahasuerus, one of the successors of Cyrus, who reigned from India to AEthiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="es+3:8">Esther 3:8</span>, <i>The Jews were dispersed among the people in all the provinces of</i> <i>his kingdom, and their laws were diverse from the laws of all</i> <i>other people, and they did not keep the king's laws</i>; so that, by adhering to their own usages, they kept themselves distinct from all the nations among whom they lived. </p>
<p>3. On the day of pentecost, which happened next after our Lord's ascension, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:5">Acts 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>, <i>There were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every</i> <i>nation under heaven; Parthians, Medes, and Elamites</i>, c. so numerous were the Jews, and so widely dispersed through all the countries of the world. </p>
<p>4. When Paul travelled through Asia and Europe, he found the Jews so numerous, that in all the noted cities of the Gentiles they had synagogues in which they assembled for the worship of God, and were joined by multitudes of proselytes from among the heathens, to whom likewise he preached the Gospel. </p>
<p>5. The same apostle, in his speech to King Agrippa, affirmed that the twelve tribes were then existing, and that they served God day and night, in expectation of the promise made to the fathers, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:6">Acts 26:6</span>. </p>
<p>6. Josephus, Ant. i. 14, cap. 12, tells us that one region could not contain the Jews, but they dwelt in most of the flourishing cities of Asia and Europe, in the islands and continent, not much less in number than the heathen inhabitants. From all this it is evident that the Jews of the dispersion were more numerous than even the Jews in Judea, and that James very properly inscribed this letter to the <i>twelve tribes which were in</i> <i>the dispersion</i>, seeing the twelve tribes really existed then, and do still exist, although not distinguished by separate habitations, as they were anciently in their own land.</p>
