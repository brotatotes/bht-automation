<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation</b></i> — This is a mere Jewish sentiment, and on it the Jews speak some excellent things. In <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sec. 31, fol. 129, and in Rab. <i>Tanchum</i>, fol. 29, 4, we have these words: "Blessed is the man שהיה עומד בנסיונו <i>shehayah omed benisyono</i> who stands in his temptation; for there is no man whom God does not <i>try</i>. He tries the <i>rich</i>, to see if they will open their hands to the poor. He tries the <i>poor</i>, to see if they will receive affliction and not murmur. If, therefore, the rich <i>stand in his temptation</i>, and give alms to the poor, he shall enjoy his riches in this world, and his horn shall be exalted in the world to come, and the holy blessed God shall deliver him from the punishment of hell. If the poor <i>stand in his temptation</i>, and do not repine, (kick back,) he shall have double in the world to come." This is exactly the sentiment of James. Every man is in this life in a state of temptation or trial, and in this state he is a candidate for another and a better world; he that <i>stands</i> in his trial shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. It is only <i>love to God</i> that can enable a man to endure the trials of life. Love feels no loads; all practicable things are possible to him who loveth.</p>
<p>There may be an allusion here to the contests in the Grecian games. He is crowned who conquers; and none else.</p>
