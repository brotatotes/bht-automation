<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Let no man say</b></i> â€” Lest the former sentiment should be misapplied, as the word <i>temptation</i> has two grand meanings, <i>solicitation to sin</i>, and trial from <i>providential situation</i> or <i>circumstances</i>, James, taking up the word in the former sense, after having used it in the latter, says: <i>Let no man say, when he</i> <i>is tempted</i>, (solicited to sin,) <i>I am tempted of God</i>; for God cannot be tempted with evil, <i>neither tempteth he</i> (thus) <i>any man</i>. Thus the author has explained and guarded his meaning.</p>
