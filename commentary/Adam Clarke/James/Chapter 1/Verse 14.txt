<p>Verse 14. <i><b>But every man is tempted</b></i> — Successfully solicited to sin, when <i>he is drawn away of his own lust</i>-when, giving way to the evil propensity of his own heart, he does that to which he is solicited by the enemy of his soul.</p>
<p>Among the rabbins we find some fine sayings on this subject. In <i>Midrash hanaalam</i>, fol. 20, and <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 17, it is said: "This is the custom of evil concupiscence, יצר הרע <i>yetser</i> <i>hara</i>: To-day it saith, Do this; to-morrow, Worship an idol. The man goes and worships. Again it saith, Be <i>angry</i>."</p>
<p>"Evil concupiscence is, at the beginning, like the thread of a spider's web; afterwards it is like a cart rope." <i>Sanhedrim</i>, fol. 99.</p>
<p>In the words, <i>drawn away by his own lust and enticed</i>, ὑπο της ιδιας επιθυμιας εξελκομενος και δελεαζομενος, there is a double metaphor; the first referring to the <i>dragging a fish</i> out of the water by a <i>hook</i> which it had swallowed, because <i>concealed by a</i> <i>bait</i>; the second, to the <i>enticements</i> of impure women, who draw away the unwary into their snares, and involve them in their ruin. Illicit connections of this kind the writer has clearly in view; and every word that he uses refers to something of this nature, as the following verse shows.</p>
