<p>Verse 15. <i><b>When lust hath conceived</b></i> — When the evil propensity works unchecked, <i>it bringeth forth sin</i>-the evil act between the parties is perpetrated.</p>
<p><i><b>And sin, when it is finished</b></i> — When this breach of the law of God and of innocence has been a sufficient time completed, it <i>bringeth forth death</i>-the spurious offspring is the fruit of the criminal connection, and the evidence of that <i>death</i> or <i>punishment</i> due to the transgressors.</p>
<p>Any person acquainted with the import of the verbs συλλαμβανειν, τικτειν, and αποκυειν, will see that this is the metaphor, and that I have not exhausted it. συλλαμβανω signifies concipio sobolem, <i>quae comprehenditur utero</i>; concipio foetum; - τικτω, pario, genero, efficio; - αποκυεω <i>ex</i> απο <i>et</i> κυω, <i>praegnans sum</i>, in utero gero. <i>Verbum proprium</i> praegnantium, <i>quae</i> <i>foetum maturum emittunt. Interdum etiam</i> gignendi <i>notionem</i> <i>habet</i>.-MAIUS, <i>Obser. Sacr</i>., vol. ii., page 184. <i>Kypke</i> and <i>Schleusner</i>.</p>
<p>Sin is a small matter in its commencement; but by indulgence it grows great, and multiplies itself beyond all calculation. To use the rabbinical metaphor lately adduced, <i>it is, in the</i> <i>commencement, like the thread of a spider's web</i>-almost <i>imperceptible</i> through its extreme <i>tenuity</i> or <i>fineness</i>, and as <i>easily broken</i>, for it is as yet but a <i>simple irregular</i> <i>imagination; afterwards it becomes like a cart rope</i>-it has, by being indulged produced <i>strong desire and delight</i>; next <i>consent</i>; then, time, place, and opportunity serving, that which was <i>conceived</i> in the <i>mind</i>, and <i>finished</i> in that <i>purpose</i>, is consummated by <i>act</i>.</p>
<p>"The <i>soul</i>, which the Greek philosophers considered as the seat of the appetites and passions, is called by <i>Philo</i> τοθηλυ, the <i>female</i> part of our nature; and the <i>spirit</i> τοαρρεν, the <i>male</i> part. In allusion to this notion, James represents men's <i>lust</i> as a <i>harlot</i>; which entices their understanding and will into its impure embraces, and from that conjunction <i>conceives</i> sin. Sin, being <i>brought forth</i>, immediately acts, and is nourished by frequent repetition, till at length it gains such strength that in its turn it <i>begets</i> death. This is the true <i>genealogy</i> of sin and death. <i>Lust</i> is the <i>mother</i> of sin, and <i>sin</i> the <i>mother</i> of <i>death</i>, and the <i>sinner</i> the <i>parent</i> of both." See <i>Macknight</i>.</p>
