<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above</b></i> — Whatever is good is from God; whatever is evil is from man himself. As from the <i>sun</i>, which is the <i>father</i> or fountain of <i>light</i>, all light comes; so from GOD, who is the infinite Fountain, Father, and <i>Source</i> of <i>good</i>, all good comes. And whatever can be called <i>good</i>, or <i>pure</i>, or <i>light</i>, or <i>excellence</i> of any kind, must necessarily spring from him, as he is the only source of all goodness and perfection.</p>
<p><i><b>With whom is no variableness</b></i> — The <i>sun</i>, the fountain of light to the whole of our system, may be obscured by clouds; or the different bodies which revolve round him, and particularly the earth, may from time to time suffer a diminution of his light by the intervention of other bodies <i>eclipsing</i> his splendour; and his apparent <i>tropical variation, shadow of turning</i>; when, for instance, in our winter, he has declined to the <i>southern tropic</i>, the tropic of Capricorn, so that our days are greatly shortened, and we suffer in consequence a great diminution both of <i>light</i> and <i>heat</i>. But there is nothing of this kind with God; he is never affected by the changes and chances to which mortal things are exposed. He occupies no <i>one</i> place in the universe; he fills the <i>heavens</i> and the <i>earth</i>, is <i>everywhere present</i>, sees all, pervades all, and shines upon all; dispenses his blessings equally to the universe; hates nothing that he has made; is loving to every man; and his tender mercies are over all his works: therefore he is not <i>affected with evil</i>, nor does he <i>tempt</i>, or influence to sin, <i>any</i> <i>man</i>. The sun, the source of light, rises and sets with a continual <i>variety</i> as to the <i>times</i> of both, and the <i>length</i> of the time in which, in the course of three hundred and sixty-five days, five hours, forty-eight minutes, and forty-eight seconds, it has its revolution through the ecliptic, or rather the earth has its revolution round the sun; and by which its light and heat are, to the inhabitants of the earth, either constantly <i>increasing</i> or <i>decreasing</i>: but God, the Creator and Preserver of all things, is eternally the same, dispensing his <i>good</i> and <i>perfect gifts</i>-his <i>earthly</i> and <i>heavenly</i> blessings, to all his creatures, ever unclouded in himself, and ever <i>nilling</i> EVIL and <i>willing</i> GOOD. Men may hide themselves from his light by the works of darkness, as owls and bats hide themselves in dens and caves of the earth during the prevalency of the solar light: but his good will to his creatures is permanent; he wills not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may come unto him and live; and no man walks in wretchedness or misery but he who <i>will not come unto God that he</i> <i>may have life</i>.
