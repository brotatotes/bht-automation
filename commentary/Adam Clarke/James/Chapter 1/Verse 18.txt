<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Of his own will begat he us</b></i> — <i>God's will</i> here is opposed to the <i>lust of man</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15">James 1:15</span>; his <i>truth</i>, the means of human salvation, to the <i>sinful means</i> referred to in the above verse; and the <i>new creatures</i>, to the <i>sin</i> <i>conceived</i> and <i>brought forth</i>, as above. As the <i>will</i> of God is essentially <i>good</i>, all its productions must be <i>good</i> also; as it is infinitely <i>pure</i>, all its productions must be <i>holy</i>. The <i>word</i> or <i>doctrine</i> of <i>truth</i>, what St. Paul calls <i>the word of the truth of</i> <i>the Gospel</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>, is the means which God uses to convert souls.</p>
<p><i><b>A kind of first fruits</b></i> — By <i>creatures</i> we are here to understand the <i>Gentiles</i>, and by <i>first fruits</i> the <i>Jews</i>, to whom the Gospel was first sent; and those of them that believed were the <i>first</i> <i>fruits</i> of that astonishing <i>harvest</i> which God has since reaped over the whole Gentile world. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>, &amp;c. There is a remarkable saying in <i>Philo</i> on this subject, <i>De Allegoris</i>, lib. ii. p. 101: <i>God begat Isaac, for he is the father of the perfect</i> <i>nature</i>, σπειρων εν ταις ψυχαις, <i>sowing seed in souls, and</i> <i>begetting happiness</i>.</p>
