<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Swift to hear</b></i> — <i>Talk little and work much</i>, is a rabbinical adage.-<i>Pirkey Aboth</i>, cap. i. 15.</p>
<p><i>The righteous speak little, and do much; the wicked speak much,</i> <i>and do nothing</i>.-<i>Bava Metzia</i>, fol. 87.</p>
<p>The son of Sirach says, cap. v. 11: Γινου ταχυς εν τῃ ακροασει σου, και εν μακροθυμιᾳ φθεγγου αποκρισιν. "Be swift to hear, and with deep consideration give answer."</p>
<p><i><b>Slow to wrath</b></i> — "There are <i>four</i> kinds of dispositions," says the <i>Midrash hanaalam</i>, cap. v. 11: "<i>First</i>, Those who are easily incensed, and easily pacified; these <i>gain</i> on one hand, and <i>lose</i> on the other. <i>Secondly</i>, Those who are not easily incensed, but are difficult to be appeased; these <i>lose</i> on the one <i>hand</i>, and <i>gain</i> on the <i>other</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>, Those who are difficult to be incensed, and are easily appeased; these are the <i>good</i>. <i>Fourthly</i>, Those who are easily angered, and difficult to be appeased; these are the <i>wicked</i>."</p>
<p>Those who are hasty in speech are generally of a peevish or angry disposition. A person who is careful to consider what he says, is not likely to be soon angry.</p>
