<p>Verse 20. <i><b>The wrath of man</b></i> â€” A furious zeal in matters of religion is detestable in the sight of God; he will have no sacrifice that is not consumed by fire from his own altar. The zeal that made the Papists persecute and burn the Protestants, was kindled in hell. This was <i>the wrath of man</i>, and did not work any <i>righteous act for God</i>; nor was it the means of working righteousness in others; the bad fruit of a bad tree. And do they still vindicate these cruelties? Yes: for still they maintain that no faith is to be kept with heretics, and they acknowledge the <i>inquisition</i>.</p>
