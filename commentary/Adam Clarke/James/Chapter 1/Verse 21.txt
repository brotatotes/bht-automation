<p>Verse 21. <i><b>All filthiness</b></i> — πασαν ροπαριαν. This word signifies any impurity that cleaves to the body; but applied to the mind, it implies all impure and unholy affections, such as those spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15">James 1:15</span>, which pollute the soul; in this sense it is used by the best Greek writers.</p>
<p><i><b>Superfluity of naughtiness</b></i> — περισσειαν κακιας. The <i>overflowing of wickedness</i>. Perhaps there is an allusion here to the part cut off in circumcision, which was the emblem of impure desire; and to lessen that propensity, God, in his mercy, enacted this rite. Put all these evil dispositions aside, for they blind the soul, and render it incapable of receiving any good, even from that ingrafted word of God which otherwise would have saved their souls.</p>
<p><i><b>The ingrafted word</b></i> — That doctrine which has already been <i>planted among you</i>, which has brought forth fruit in all them that have <i>meekly</i> and humbly received it, and is as <i>powerful to save</i> <i>your souls</i> as the souls of those who have already believed. I think this to be the meaning of εμφυτον λογον, the <i>ingrafted word</i> or <i>doctrine</i>. The seed of life had been sown in the land; many of them had received it to their salvation; others had partially credited it, but not so as to produce in them any saving effects. Besides, they appear to have taken up with other doctrines, from which they had got no salvation; he therefore exhorts them to receive the doctrine of Christ, which would be the means of saving them unto eternal life. And when those who were Jews, and who had been originally planted by God as altogether a right vine, received the faith of the Gospel, it is represented as being ingrafted on that right stock, the pure knowledge of the true God and his holy moral law. This indeed was a good stock on which to implant <i>Christianity</i>. This appears to be what the apostle means by the ingrafted word, which is able to save the soul.</p>
