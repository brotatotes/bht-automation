<p>Verse 22. <i><b>But be ye doers of the word</b></i> — They had heard this doctrine; they had believed it; but they had put it to no practical use. They were downright <i>Antinomians</i>, who put a sort of stupid, inactive faith in the place of all moral righteousness. This is sufficiently evident from the second chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>Deceiving your own selves.</b></i> — παραλογιζομενοι εαυτους. Imposing on your own selves by sophistical arguments; this is the meaning of the words. They had reasoned themselves into a state of carnal security, and the object of St. James is, to awake them out of their sleep.</p>
