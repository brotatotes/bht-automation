<p>Verse 25. <i><b>But whoso looketh into the perfect law</b></i> — The word παρακυψας, which we translate <i>looketh into</i>, is very emphatic, and signifies that deep and attentive consideration given to a thing or subject which a man cannot bring up to his eyes, and therefore must <i>bend his back and neck, stooping down</i>, that he may see it to the greater advantage. The <i>law of liberty</i> must mean the <i>Gospel</i>; it is a <i>law</i>, for it <i>imposes obligations</i> from God, and prescribes a <i>rule of life</i>; and it <i>punishes</i> transgressors, and <i>rewards</i> the obedient. It is, nevertheless, a law that gives <i>liberty</i> from the guilt, power, dominion, and influence of sin; and it is <i>perfect</i>, providing a <i>fulness of salvation</i> for the soul: and it may be called <i>perfect</i> here, in opposition to the <i>law</i>, which was a system of types and representations of which the Gospel is the sum and substance. Some think that the word τελειον, <i>perfect</i>, is added here to signify that the <i>whole</i> of the Gospel must be considered and received, not a <i>part</i>; all its threatenings with its promises, all its precepts with its privileges.</p>
<p><i><b>And continueth</b></i> — παραμεινας Takes time to see and examine the state of his soul, the grace of his God, the extent of his duty, and the height of the promised glory. The metaphor here is taken from those females who spend much time at their glass, in order that they may decorate themselves to the greatest advantage, and not leave one hair, or the smallest ornament, out of its place.</p>
<p><i><b>He being not a forgetful hearer</b></i> — This seems to be a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+4:9">Deuteronomy 4:9</span>: "Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life." <i>He who studies and forgets is like to a woman who brings</i> <i>forth children, and immediately buries them</i>. <i>Aboth R. Nathan</i>, cap. 23.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall be blessed in his deed.</b></i> — In <i>Pirkey Aboth</i>, cap. v. 14, it is said: "There are four kinds of men who visit the synagogues,</p>
<p>1. He who enters but does not work;</p>
<p>2. He who works but does not enter. </p>
<p>3. He who enters and works. </p>
<p>4. He who neither enters nor works.</p>
<p>The first two are indifferent characters; the <i>third</i> is the righteous man; the <i>fourth</i> is wholly evil."</p>
<p>As the path of duty is the way of <i>safety</i>, so it is the way of <i>happiness</i>; he who obeys God from a loving heart and pure conscience, will infallibly find continual blessedness.</p>
