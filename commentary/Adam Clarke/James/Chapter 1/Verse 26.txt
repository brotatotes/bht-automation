<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Seem to be religious</b></i> — The words θρησκος and θρησκεια, which we translate <i>religious</i> and <i>religion</i>, (see the next verse,) are of very uncertain etymology. <i>Suidas</i>, under the word θρησκευει, which he translates θεοσεβειυπηρετειτοιςθεοις, <i>he worships</i> or <i>serves the gods</i>, accounts for the derivation thus: "It is said that Orpheus, a <i>Thracian</i>, instituted the mysteries (or religious rites) of the Greeks, and called the worshipping of God θρησκευειν <i>threskeuein</i>, as being a <i>Thracian</i> invention." Whatever its derivation may be, the word is used both to signify <i>true religion</i>, and <i>superstition</i> or <i>heterodoxy</i>. See Hesychius, and <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Bridleth not his tongue</b></i> — He who speaks not according to the oracles of God, whatever pretences he makes to religion, only shows, by his want of scriptural knowledge, that his religion is <i>false</i>, ματαιος, or <i>empty</i> of solid truth, profit to others, and good to himself. Such a person should <i>bridle his tongue</i>, put the <i>bit in his mouth</i>; and particularly if he be a professed <i>teacher</i> of religion; ho matter where he has studied, or what else he has learned, if he have not learned <i>religion</i>, he can never teach it. And religion is of such a nature that no man can learn it but by <i>experience</i>; he who does not feel the doctrine of God to be the power of God to the salvation of his soul, can neither teach religion, nor act according to its dictates, because he is an unconverted, unrenewed man. If he be <i>old</i>, let him retire to the desert, and pray to God for light; if he be in the <i>prime of life</i>, let him turn his attention to some honest calling; if he be <i>young</i>, let him tarry at Jericho till his beard grows.</p>
