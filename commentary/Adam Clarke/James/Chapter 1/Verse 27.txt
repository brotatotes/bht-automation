<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span>. <i><b>Pure religion, and undefiled</b></i> — Having seen something of the etymology of the word θρησκεια, which we translate <i>religion</i>, it will be well to consider the etymology of the word <i>religion</i> itself.</p>
<p>In the 28th chapter of the 4th book of his <i>Divine Instructions</i>, LACTANTIUS, who flourished about A. D. 300, treats of <i>hope, true</i> <i>religion</i>, and <i>superstition</i>; of the two latter he gives Cicero's definition from his book <i>De Natura Deorum</i>, lib. ii. c. 28, which with his own definition will lead us to a correct view, not only of the <i>etymology</i>, but of the <i>thing</i> itself.</p>
<p>"<i>Superstition</i>," according to that philosopher, "had its name from the custom of those who offered daily prayers and sacrifices, that their children might SURVIVE THEM; <i>ut sui sibi liberi</i> superstites essent. Hence they were called <i>superstitiosi</i>, superstitious. On the other hand, religion, <i>religio</i>, had its name from those who, not satisfied with what was commonly spoken concerning the nature and worship of the gods, searched into the whole matter, and <i>perused the writings</i> of past times; hence they were called <i>religiosi</i>, from <i>re</i>, again, and <i>lego</i>, I read."</p>
<p>This definition Lactantius ridicules, and shows that religion has its name from <i>re</i>, intensive, and <i>ligo</i>, I bind, because of that <i>bond of piety</i> by which it <i>binds</i> us to God, and this he shows was the notion conceived of it by <i>Lucretius</i>, who laboured to <i>dissolve</i> this bond, and make men atheists. </p>
<p>The words καθαρα και αμιαντος, <i>pure and undefiled</i>, are supposed to have reference to a <i>diamond</i> or <i>precious stone</i>, whose perfection consists in its being <i>free from flaws</i>; not <i>cloudy</i>, but of a <i>pure</i> <i>water</i>. True religion is the <i>ornament</i> of the soul, and its <i>effects</i>, the ornament of the <i>life</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction</b></i> — Works of <i>charity</i> and <i>mercy</i> are the proper fruits of religion; and none are more especially the objects of charity and mercy than the <i>orphans</i> and <i>widows</i>. False religion may perform acts of mercy and charity; but its <i>motives</i> not being <i>pure</i>, and its principle being <i>defiled</i>, the <i>flesh</i>, self, and hypocrisy, <i>spot</i> the man, and <i>spot</i> his acts. True religion does not merely <i>give</i> something for the <i>relief</i> of the distressed, but it <i>visits them</i>, it takes <i>the</i> <i>oversight of them</i>, it takes them under its care; so επισκεπτεσθαι means. It goes to their houses, and speaks to their hearts; it relieves their wants, sympathizes with them in their distresses, instructs them in Divine things and recommends them to God. And all this it does for the Lord's sake. This is the religion of Christ. The religion that does not prove itself by works of charity and mercy is not of God. Reader, what religion hast thou? Has thine ever led thee to cellars, garrets, cottages, and houses, to find out the distressed? Hast thou ever fed, clothed, and visited a destitute representative of Christ?</p>
<p>The subject in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:11">James 1:11</span> suggests several reflections on the mutability of human affairs, and the end of all things.</p>
<p>1. Nature herself is subject to mutability, though by her secret and inscrutable exertions she effects her renovation from her decay, and thus <i>change</i> is prevented from terminating in <i>destruction</i>. Yet nature herself is tending, by continual mutations, to a final destruction; or rather to a fixed state, when <i>time</i>, the place and sphere of mutability, shall be absorbed in eternity. Time and nature are coeval; they began and must terminate together. All <i>changes</i> are efforts to arrive at destruction or renovation; and destruction must be the <i>term</i> or bound of all created things, had not the Creator purposed that his works should endure for ever. According to his promise, we look for a new heaven and a new earth; a fixed, permanent, and endless state of things; an everlasting sabbath to all the works of God.</p>
<p>I shall confirm these observations with the last verses of that incomparable poem, the <i>Faery Queene</i>, of our much neglected but unrivalled poet, <i>Edmund Spenser</i>: - </p>
<p>Dr. <i>Young</i> has written most nervously, in the spirit of the highest order of poetry, and with the knowledge and feeling of a sound divine, on this subject, in his Night Thoughts. Night vi. <i>in fine</i>. </p>
<p>2. Taken in every point of view, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17">James 1:17</span> is one of the most curious and singular in the New Testament. It has been well observed, that the first words make a regular <i>Greek hexameter</i> <i>verse</i>, supposed to be quoted from some Greek poet not now extant; and the last clause of the verse, with a very little change, makes another hexameter: - </p>
<p>3. In the latter part of the verse, παρ ᾡ ουκ ενι παραλλαγη, η τροπης αποσκιασμα, which we translate, <i>with whom is no</i> <i>variableness, neither shadow of turning</i>, there is an allusion to some of the most abstruse principles in astronomy. This is not accidental, for every word in the whole verse is astronomical. In his Πατηρ των φωτων, <i>Father of lights</i>, there is the most evident allusion to the SUN, who is the <i>father, author</i>, or <i>source</i> of all the <i>lights</i> or luminaries proper to our system. It is not only his light which <i>we</i> enjoy by day, but it is his light also which is reflected to us, from the moon's surface, by <i>night</i>. And it is demonstrable that all the <i>planets - Mercury, Venus</i>, the <i>Earth</i>, the <i>Moon, Mars, Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta, Jupiter, Saturn</i>, Saturn's <i>Rings</i>, and <i>Herschel</i>, or the <i>Georgium Sidus</i>, with the <i>four</i> satellites of Jupiter, the <i>seven</i> satellites of Saturn, and the <i>six</i> satellites of the Georgium Sidus, thirty-one bodies in all, besides the <i>comets</i>, all derive their light from the sun, being perfectly <i>opaque</i> or <i>dark</i> in themselves; the sun being the only luminous body in our system; all the rest being <i>illumined</i> by him.</p>
<p>The word παραλλαγη, which we translate <i>variableness</i>, from παραλλαττω, <i>to change alternately, to pass from one change to</i> <i>another</i>, evidently refers to <i>parallax</i> in astronomy. To give a proper idea of what astronomers mean by this term, it must be premised that all the diurnal motions of the heavenly bodies from east to west are only <i>apparent</i>, being occasioned by the rotation of the earth upon its axis in an opposite direction in about twenty-four hours. These diurnal motions are therefore performed <i>uniformly</i> round the axis or polar diameter of the earth, and not round the place of the spectator, who is upon the earth's surface. Hence every one who observes the apparent motion of the heavens from this surface will find that this motion is not even, equal arches being described in unequal times; for if a globular body, such as the earth, describe equally the circumference of a circle by its rotatory motion, it is evident the equality of this motion can be seen in no other points than those in the axis of the circle, and therefore any object viewed from the centre of the earth will appear in a different place from what it does when observed from the surface. This difference of place of the same object, seen at the same time from the earth's centre and surface, is called its <i>parallax</i>.</p>
<p>As I shall make some farther use of this point, in order to make it plain to those who are not much acquainted with the subject, to which I am satisfied St. James alludes, I shall introduce the following diagram: Let the circle OKNS. in the annexed figure, represent the earth, E its center, O the place of an observer on its surface, whose visible or sensible horizon is OH, and the line EST, parallel to OH, the rational, true, or mathematical horizon. Let ZDFT be considered a portion of a great circle in the heavens, and A the place of an object in the visible horizon. Join EA by a line produced to C: then C is the true place of the object, and H is its apparent place; and the angle CAH is its parallax; and, because the object is in the horizon, it is called its horizontal parallax. As OAE, the angle which the earth's radius or semidiameter subtends to the object, is necessarily equal to its opposite angle CAH, hence the horizontal parallax of an object is defined to be the angle which the earth's semidiameter subtends at that object.</p>
<p>The whole effect of parallax is in a vertical direction; for the parallactic angle is in the plane passing through the observer and the earth's center, which plane is necessarily perpendicular to the horizon, the earth being considered as a sphere. The more elevated an object is above the horizon, the less the parallax, the distance from the earth's center continuing the same. To make this sufficiently clear, let B represent an object at any given altitude above the visible horizon OAH; then the angle DBF, formed by the straight lines OB and EB produced to F and D, will be the parallax of the object at the given altitude, and is less than the parallax of the same object when in the visible horizon OAH, for the angle DBF is less than the angle CAH. Hence the horizontal parallax is the greatest of all diurnal parallaxes; and when the object is in the zenith, it has no parallax, the visual ray passing perpendicularly from the object through the observer to the earth's center, as in the line Zoe.</p>
<p>The quantity of the horizontal parallax of any object is in proportion to its distance from the place of observation, being greater or less as the object is nearer to or farther removed from the spectator. In illustration of this point, let I be the place of an object in the sensible horizon; then will LIH be its horizontal parallax, which is a smaller angle than CAH, the horizontal parallax of the nearer object A.</p>
<p>The horizontal parallax being given, the distance of the object from the earth's center, EA or EI, may be readily found in semidiameters of the earth by the resolution of the right-angled triangle OEA, in which we have given the angle OAE, the horizontal parallax, the side OE, the semidiameter of the earth, considered as unity, and the right angle AOE, to find the side EA, the distance of the object from the earth's center. The proportion to be used in this case is: The sine of the horizontal parallax is to unity, the semidiameter of the earth, as radius, i.e. the right angle AOE, the sine of ninety degrees being the radius of a circle, is to the side EA. This proportion is very compendiously wrought by logarithms as follows: Subtract the logarithmic sine of the horizontal parallax from 10, the radius, and the remainder will be the logarithm of the answer.</p>
<p>Example. When the moon's horizontal parallax is a degree, what is her distance from the earth's center in semidiameters of the earth?</p>
<p>From the radius 10.0000000 Subtract the sine of 1 degree 8.2418553 Remainder the logarithm of 57.2987 1.7581447</p>
<p>Which is the distance of the moon in semidiameters of the earth, when her horizontal parallax amounts to a degree. If 57.2987 be multiplied by 3977, the English miles contained in the earth's semidiameter, the product, 227876.9, will be the moon's distance from the earth's center in English miles.</p>
<p>The sun's horizontal parallax is about eight seconds and three-fifths, as is evident from the phenomena attending the transits of Venus, of 1761 and 1769, as observed in different parts of the world: a method of obtaining the solar parallax abundantly less liable to be materially affected by error of observation than that of Hipparchus, who lived between the 154th and 163d Olympiad, from lunar eclipses; or than that of Aristarchus the Samian, from the moon's dichotomy; or even than that of modern astronomers from the parallax of Mars when in opposition, and, at the same time, in or near his perihelion. The sun's horizontal parallax being scarcely the four hundred and eighteenth part of that of the moon given in the preceding example, if 227876.9, the distance of the moon as found above, be multiplied by 418.6, (for the horizontal parallax decreases nearly in proportion as the distance increases), the product will be the distance of the sun from the earth's center, which will be found to be upwards of ninety-five millions of English miles.</p>
<p>When we know the horizontal parallax of any object, its magnitude is easily determined. The apparent diameter of the sun, for example, at his mean distance from the earth, is somewhat more than thirty-two minutes of a degree, which is at least a hundred and eleven times greater than the double of the sun's horizontal parallax, or the apparent diameter of the earth as seen from the sun; therefore, the real solar diameter must be at least a hundred and eleven times greater than that of the earth; i.e. upwards of 880,000 English miles. And as spherical bodies are to each other as the cubes of their diameters, if 111 be cubed, we shall find that the magnitude of the sun is more than thirteen hundred thousand times greater than that of the earth.</p>
<p>The whole effect of parallax being in a vertical circle, and the circles of the sphere not being in this direction, the parallax of a star will evidently change its true place with respect to these different circles; whence there are five kinds of diurnal parallaxes, viz. the parallax of longitude, parallax of latitude, parallax of ascension or descension, parallax: of declination, and parallax of altitude, the last of which has been already largely explained; and the meaning of the first four, simply, is the difference between the true and visible longitude, latitude, right ascension, and declination of an object. Besides these, there is another kind of parallax, called by modern astronomers the parallax of the earth's Annual Orbit, by which is meant the difference between the places of a planet as seen from the sun and the earth at the same time, the former being its true or heliocentric place, and the latter its apparent or geocentric place. The ancient astronomers gave the term parallax only to the diurnal apparent inequalities of motion in the moon and planets; Ptolemy, who lived in the second century, calling prosaphaeresis orbis what is now named the parallax of the great or annual orbit. This parallax is more considerable than the diurnal parallax, as the earth's annual orbit is more considerable than the earth's semidiameter. This parallax, when greatest, amounts in Mars, the nearest superior planet, to upwards of forty-seven degrees; in Jupiter to near twelve degrees; in Saturn to more than six degrees, etc. In the region of the nearest fixed stars, i.e. those new ones of 1572 and 1604, double the radius of the earth's orbit does not subtend an angle of a single minute of a degree; whence it is evident the nearest fixed stars are at least hundreds of times more distant from us than the Georgium Sidus is, whose greatest annual parallax amounts to upwards of three degrees. The annual parallaxes of the fixed stars are, in general, too minute to be measured; hence their distances from the earth must be inconceivably great.</p>
<p>Any farther description of parallax would be useless in reference to the subject to be illustrated.</p>
<p>The words τροπης αποσκιασμα, shadow of turning, either refer to the darkness in which the earth is involved in consequence of its turning round its axis once in every twenty-four hours, by means of which one hemisphere, or half of its surface, is involved in darkness, being hidden from the sun by the opposite hemisphere; or to the different portions of the earth which come gradually into the solar light by its revolution round its orbit, which, in consequence of the pole of the earth being inclined nearly twenty-three degrees and a half to the plane of its orbit, and keeping its parallelism through every part of its revolution, causes all the vicissitudes of season, with all the increasing and decreasing proportions of light and darkness, and of cold and heat.</p>
<p>Every person who understands the images will see with what propriety St. James has introduced them; and through this his great object is at once discernible. It is evident from this chapter that there were persons, among those to whom he wrote, that held very erroneous opinions concerning the Divine nature; viz. that God tempted or influenced men to sin, and, consequently, that he was the author of all the evil that is in the world; and that he withholds his light and influence when necessary to convey truth and to correct vice. To destroy this error he shows that though the sun, for its splendor, genial heat, and general utility to the globe and its inhabitants, may be a fit emblem of God, yet in several respects the metaphor is very imperfect; for the sun himself is liable to repeated obscurations; and although, as to his mass, he is the focus of the system, giving light and heat to all, yet he is not everywhere present, and both his light and heat may be intercepted by a great variety of opposing bodies, and other causes. St. James refers particularly to the Divine ubiquity or omnipresence. Wherever his light and energy are, there is he himself; neither his word nor his Spirit gives false or inconsistent views of his nature and gracious purposes. He has no parallax, because he is equally present everywhere, and intimately near to all his creatures; He is never seen where he is not, or not seen where he is. He is the God and Father of all; who is Above all, and Through all, and In all; "in the wide waste, as in the city full;" nor can any thing be hidden from his light and heat. There can be no opposing bodies to prevent him from sending forth his light and truth, because he is everywhere essentially present. He suffers no eclipses; he changes not in his nature; he varies not in his designs; he is ever a full, free, and eternal fountain of mercy, goodness, truth, and good will, to all his intelligent offspring. Hallelujah, the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth! Amen.</p>
<p>In concluding these observations, I think it necessary to refer to Mr. Wakefield's translation of this text, and his vindication of that translation: Every good gift, and every perfect kindness, cometh down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no parallax, nor tropical shadow. "Some have affected," says he, "to ridicule my translation of this verse, if it be obscure, the author must answer for that, and not the translator. Why should we impoverish the sacred writers, by robbing them of the learning and science they display? Why should we conceal in them what we should ostentatiously point out in profane authors? And if any of these wise, learned, and judicious critics think they understand the phrase shadow of turning, I wish they would condescend to explain it." Yes, if such a sentiment were found in Aratus, or in any other ancient astronomical writer, whole pages of commentary would be written on it, and the subtle doctrine of the parallactic angle proved to be well known in itself, and its use in determining the distances and magnitudes of the heavenly bodies, to the ancients some hundreds of years before the Christian era.</p>
<p>The sentiment is as elegant as it is just, and forcibly points out the unchangeableness and beneficence of God. He is the Sun, not of a system, but of all worlds; the great Fountain and Dispenser of light and heat, of power and life, of order, harmony, and perfection. In him all live and move, and from him they have their being. There are no spots on his disk; all is unclouded splendor. Can he who dwells in this unsufferable and unapproachable light, in his own eternal self-sufficiency, concern himself with the affairs of mortals? Yes, for we are his offspring; and it is one part of his perfection to delight in the welfare of his intelligent creatures. He is loving to every man: he hates nothing that he has made; and his praise endureth for ever!</p>
