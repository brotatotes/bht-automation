<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:4">James 1:4</span>. <i><b>Let patience have</b></i><b> her </b><i><b>perfect work</b></i> — That is, Continue faithful, and your patience will be <i>crowned</i> with its full reward; for in this sense is εργον, which we translate <i>work</i>, to be understood. It is any <i>effect</i> produced by a cause, as <i>interest</i> from <i>money, fruit</i> from <i>tillage, gain</i> from <i>labour</i>, a <i>reward</i> for <i>services performed</i>; the <i>perfect work</i> is the <i>full reward</i>. See many examples in <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye may be perfect and entire</b></i> — τελειοι, <i>Fully instructed</i>, in every part of the doctrine of God, and in his whole will concerning you. ολοκληροι, having all your <i>parts, members</i>, and <i>portions</i>; that ye may have <i>every grace</i> which constitutes the mind that was in Christ, so that your knowledge and holiness may be complete, and bear a proper proportion to each other. These expressions in their present application are by some thought to be borrowed from the Grecian games: the man was τελειος, <i>perfect</i>, who in any of the athletic exercises had got the victory; he was ολοκληοος, <i>entire</i>, having <i>every thing complete</i>, who had the victory in the <i>pentathlon</i>, in each of the <i>five</i> exercises. Of this use in the last term I do not recollect an example, and therefore think the expressions are borrowed from the <i>sacrifices</i> under the law. A victim was τελειος, <i>perfect</i>, that was perfectly sound, having no <i>disease</i>; it was ολοκληρος, <i>entire</i>, if it had <i>all its</i> <i>members</i>, having nothing <i>redundant</i>, nothing <i>deficient</i>. Be then to the Lord what he required his sacrifices to be; let your whole heart, your body, soul, and spirit, be sanctified to the Lord of hosts, that he may fill you with all his fulness.</p>
