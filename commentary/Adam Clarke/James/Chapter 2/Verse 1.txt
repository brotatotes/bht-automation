<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span>. <i><b>My brethren, have not</b></i> — This verse should be read interrogatively: <i>My brethren, do ye not make profession of the</i> <i>faith or religion of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with</i> <i>acceptance of persons</i>? That is, preferring the rich to the poor merely because of their <i>riches</i>, and not on account of any moral excellence, personal piety, or public usefulness. πιστις, <i>faith</i>, is put here for religion; and τηςδοξης, <i>of glory</i>, should, according to some critics, be construed with it as the Syriac and Coptic have done. Some connect it with <i>our Lord Jesus Christ-the</i> <i>religion of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ</i>. Others translate thus, <i>the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus</i>. There are many various readings in the MSS. and versions on this verse: the meaning is clear enough, though the connection be rather obscure.</p>
