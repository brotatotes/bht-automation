<p>Verse 10. <i><b>For whosoever shall keep the whole law</b></i>, c.] This is a rabbinical form of speech. In the tract <i>Shabbath</i>, fol. 70, where they dispute concerning the thirty-nine works commanded by Moses, Rabbi Yochanan says: <i>But if a man do the whole, with the</i> <i>omission of one, he is guilty of the whole, and of every one</i>. In <i>Bammidar rabba</i>, sec. 9, fol. 200, and in <i>Tanchum</i>, fol. 60, there is a copious example given, how an <i>adulteress</i>, by that one crime, <i>breaks all the ten commandments</i>, and by the same mode of proof any one sin may be shown to be a breach of the whole decalogue. The truth is, any sin is against the Divine authority and he who has committed one transgression is guilty of death; and by his one deliberate act dissolves, as far as he can, the sacred connection that subsists between all the Divine precepts and the obligation which he is under to obey, and thus casts off in effect his allegiance to God. For, if God should be obeyed in any one instance, he should be obeyed in all, as the authority and reason of obedience are the same in every case; he therefore who breaks one of these laws is, in effect, if not in fact, guilty of the whole. But there is scarcely a more <i>common form of speech</i> among the rabbins than this, for they consider that any one sin has the seeds of all others in it. See a multitude of examples in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
