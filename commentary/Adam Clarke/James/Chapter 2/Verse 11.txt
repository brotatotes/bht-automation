<p>Verse 11. <i><b>For he that said</b></i> â€” That is, the authority that gave one commandment gave also the rest; and he who breaks one resists this authority; so that the breach of any one commandment may be justly considered a breach of the whole law. It was a maxim also among the Jewish doctors that, if a man kept any one commandment carefully, though he broke all the rest, he might assure himself of the favour of God; for while they taught that "He who transgresses all the precepts of the law has broken the yoke, dissolved the covenant, and exposed the law to contempt, and so has he done who has broken even one precept," (<i>Mechilta</i>, fol. 5, <i>Yalcut Simeoni</i>, part 1, fol. 59,) they also taught, "that he who observed any <i>principal</i> command was equal to him who kept the whole law;" (<i>Kiddushin</i>, fol. 39;) and they give for example, "If a man abandon idolatry, it is the same as if he had fulfilled the whole law," (<i>Ibid</i>., fol. 40.) To correct this false doctrine James lays down that in the 11th verse. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:11">James 2:11</span> Thus they <i>did</i> and <i>undid</i>.</p>
