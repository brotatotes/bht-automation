<p>Verse 13. <i><b>For he shall have judgment</b></i> — He who shows no mercy to man, or, in other words, he who does not exercise himself in works of charity and mercy to his needy fellow creatures, shall receive no mercy at the hand of God; for he hath said, <i>Blessed are</i> <i>the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy</i>. The unmerciful therefore are <i>cursed</i>, and they shall obtain no mercy.</p>
<p><i><b>Mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</b></i> — These words are variously understood. </p>
<p>1. <i>Mercy</i>, the merciful man, the abstract for the concrete, exults over judgment, that is, he is not afraid of it, having acted according to the law of liberty, <i>Thou shalt love thy</i> <i>neighbour as thyself</i>. </p>
<p>2. Ye shall be exalted by mercy above judgment. </p>
<p>3. For he (God) exalts mercy above judgment. </p>
<p>4. A merciful man rejoices rather in opportunities of showing mercy, than in acting according to strict justice. </p>
<p>5. In the great day, though justice might condemn every man according to the rigour of the law, yet God will cause mercy to triumph over justice in bringing those into his glory who, for his sake, had fed the hungry, clothed the naked, ministered to the sick, and visited the prisoners.

<p>In the MSS. and versions there is a considerable variety of readings on this verse, and some of the senses given above are derived from those readings. The spirit of the saying may be found in another scripture, <i>I will have mercy and not sacrifice</i>-I prefer works of charity and mercy to every thing else, and especially to all acts of worship. The ROYAL LAW, <i>Thou shalt love</i> <i>thy neighbour as thyself</i>, should particularly prevail among <i>men</i>, because of the miserable state to which all are reduced by sin, so that each particularly needs the help of his brother.</p>
