<p>Verse 14. <i><b>What</b></i><b> doth it </b><i><b>profit - though a man say he hath faith</b></i> — We now come to a part of this epistle which has appeared to some eminent men to contradict other portions of the Divine records. In short, it has been thought that James teaches the doctrine of <i>justification by the merit of good works</i>, while Paul asserts this to be insufficient, and that man is <i>justified by faith</i>. Luther, supposing that James did actually teach the doctrine of justification by works, which his good sense showed him to be absolutely insufficient for salvation, was led to condemn the epistle <i>in toto</i>, as a production unauthenticated by the Holy Spirit, and consequently worthy of no regard; he therefore termed it <i>epistola straminea, a chaffy epistle</i>, an <i>epistle of straw</i>, fit only to be burnt. Learned men have spent much time in striving to reconcile these two writers, and to show that St. Paul and St. James perfectly accord; one teaching the pure doctrine, the other guarding men against the abuse of it. Mr. <i>Wesley</i> sums the whole up in the following words, with his usual accuracy and precision: "From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:22">James 1:22</span> the apostle has been enforcing Christian practice. He now applies to those who neglect this under the pretence of faith. St. Paul had taught that <i>a man is justified by faith</i> <i>without the works of the law</i>. This some already began to wrest to their own destruction. Wherefore St. James, purposely repeating, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21">James 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:23">James 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:25">James 1:25</span>, the same phrases, testimonies, and examples which St. Paul had used, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:17">Hebrews 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:31">Hebrews 11:31</span>, refutes not the doctrine of St. Paul, but the error of those who abused it. There is therefore no contradiction between the apostles; they both delivered the truth of God, but in a different manner, as having to do with different kinds of men. This verse is a summary of what follows: <i>What profiteth it</i>, is enlarged on, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:15-17">James 2:15-17</span>; <i>though a man say</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:18">James 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:19">James 2:19</span>; <i>can that faith save him</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:20">James 2:20</span>. It is not <i>though he have faith</i>, but <i>though he say, I have faith</i>. Here therefore true living faith is meant. But in other parts of the argument the apostle speaks of a dead imaginary faith. He does not therefore teach that true faith <i>can</i>, but that it <i>cannot</i>, subsist without works. Nor does he oppose <i>faith</i> to <i>works</i>, but that empty name of faith to real faith working by love. <i>Can that</i> <i>faith which is without works save him</i>? No more than it can profit his neighbour." - <i>Explanatory notes</i>.</p>
<p>That St James quotes the same scriptures, and uses the same phrases, testimonies, and examples which St. Paul has done, is fully evident; but it does not follow that he wrote <i>after</i> St. Paul. It is <i>possible</i> that one had seen the epistle of the other; but if so, it is strange that neither of them should quote the other. That St. Paul might write to correct the abuses of St. James' doctrine is as possible as that James wrote to prevent St. Paul's doctrine from being abused; for there were <i>Antinomians</i> in the Church in the time of St. James, as there were <i>Pharisaic</i> <i>persons</i> in it at the time of St. Paul. I am inclined to think that James is the elder writer, and rather suppose that neither of them had ever seen the other's epistle. Allowing them both to be inspired, God could teach each what was necessary for the benefit of the Church, without their having any knowledge of each other. See the preface to this epistle.</p>
<p>As the Jews in general were very strenuous in maintaining the <i>necessity of good works</i> or <i>righteousness</i> in order to justification, wholly neglecting the doctrine of <i>faith</i>, it is not to be wondered at that those who were converted, and saw the absolute necessity of <i>faith</i> in order to their justification, should have gone into the contrary extreme.</p>
<p><i><b>Can faith save him?</b></i> — That is, his profession of faith; for it is not said that he <i>has faith</i>, but that <i>he says</i>, I have faith. St. James probably refers to that faith which simply took in the being and unity of God.
