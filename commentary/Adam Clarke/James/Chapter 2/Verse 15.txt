Verse 15. If a brother or sister be naked — That is, ill-clothed; for γυμνος, naked, has this meaning in several parts of the New Testament, signifying bad clothing, or the want of some particular article of dress. See Matthew 25:36; Matthew 25:38; Matthew 25:43; Matthew 25:44, and John 21:7. It has the same comparative signification in most languages.
