<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Be ye warmed and filled</b></i> â€” Your saying so to them, while you give them nothing, will just profit them as much as your professed faith, without those works which are the genuine fruits of true faith, will profit you in the day when God comes to sit in judgment upon your soul.</p>
