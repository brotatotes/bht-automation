<p>Verse 17. <i><b>If it hath not works, is dead</b></i> â€” The faith that does not produce works of charity and mercy is without the living principle which animates all true faith, that is, <i>love to God</i> and <i>love to man</i>. They had faith, such as a man has who credits a well-circumstanced relation because it has all the appearance of truth; but they had nothing of that faith that a sinner, convinced of his sinfulness, God's purity, and the strictness of the Divine laws, is obliged to exert in the Lord Jesus, in order to be saved from his sins.</p>
