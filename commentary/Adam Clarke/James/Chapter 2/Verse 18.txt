<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Show me thy faith without thy works</b></i> — Your pretending to have faith, while you have no works of charity or mercy, is utterly vain: for as <i>faith</i>, which is a principle in the mind, cannot be discerned but by the <i>effects</i>, that is, <i>good works</i>; he who has no good works has, presumptively, no faith.</p>
<p><i><b>I will show thee my faith by my works.</b></i> — My works of charity and mercy will show that I have faith; and that it is the living tree, whose root is love to God and man, and whose fruit is the good works here contended for.</p>
