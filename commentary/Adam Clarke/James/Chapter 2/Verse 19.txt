<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Thou believest that there is one God</b></i> — This is the faith in which these persons put their hope of pleasing God, and of obtaining eternal life. Believing in the <i>being and unity of</i> <i>God</i> distinguished them from all the nations of the world; and having been circumcised, and thus brought into the covenant, they thought themselves secure of salvation. The insufficiency of this St. James immediately shows.</p>
<p><i><b>The devils also believe, and tremble.</b></i> — It is well to believe there is one only true God; this truth universal nature proclaims. Even the <i>devils</i> believe it; but far from <i>justifying</i> or <i>saving</i> <i>them</i>, it leaves them in their damned state, and every act of it only increases their torment; φρισσουσι, <i>they shudder with horror</i>, they believe and tremble, are increasingly tormented; but they can neither <i>love</i> nor <i>obey</i>.</p>
