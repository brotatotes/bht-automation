<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>. <i><b>If there come unto your assembly</b></i> — εις την συναγωγην. <i>Into the synagogue</i>. It appears from this that the apostle is addressing <i>Jews</i> who frequented their synagogues, and carried on their worship there and judicial proceedings, as the Jews were accustomed to do. Our word <i>assembly</i> does not express the original; and we cannot suppose that these synagogues were at this time occupied with Christian worship, but that the Christian Jews continued to frequent them for the purpose of hearing the law and the prophets read, as they had formerly done, previously to their conversion to the Christian faith. But St. James may refer here to proceedings in a court of justice.</p>
<p><i><b>With a gold ring, in goodly apparel</b></i> — The ring on the finger and the splendid garb were proofs of the man's opulence; and his <i>ring</i> and his <i>coat</i>, not his <i>worth</i>, moral good qualities, or the righteousness of his cause, procured him the respect of which St. James speaks.</p>
<p><i><b>There come in also a poor man</b></i> — In ancient times petty courts of judicature were held in the synagogues, as <i>Vitringa</i> has sufficiently proved, <i>De Vet. Syn</i>. l. 3, p. 1, c. 11; and it is probable that the case here adduced was one of a judicial kind, where, of the two <i>parties</i>, one was <i>rich</i> and the other <i>poor</i>; and the master or ruler of the synagogue, or he who presided in this court, paid particular deference to the rich man, and neglected the poor man; though, as <i>plaintiff</i> and <i>defendant</i>, they were equal in the eye of justice, and should have been considered so by an impartial judge.</p>
