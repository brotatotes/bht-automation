<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Ye see then how</b></i> â€” It is evident from this example that Abraham's faith was not merely <i>believing that there is a God</i>; but a principle that led him to credit God's promises relative to the future Redeemer, and to implore God's mercy: this he received, and was justified by faith. His faith now began to work by love, and therefore he was found ever obedient to the will of his Maker. He brought forth the fruits of righteousness; and his works <i>justified</i>-proved the genuineness of his faith; and he continued to enjoy the <i>Divine approbation</i>, which he could not have done had he not been thus obedient; for the Spirit of God would have been grieved, and his principle of faith would have perished. Obedience to God is essentially requisite to maintain faith. Faith lives, under God, by works; and works have their being and excellence from faith. Neither can subsist without the other, and this is the point which St. James labours to prove, in order to convince the Antinomians of his time that their faith was a delusion, and that the hopes built on it must needs perish.</p>
