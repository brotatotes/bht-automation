<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Rahab the harlot</b></i> â€” <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:1">Joshua 2:1</span>, c., and <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:31">Hebrews 11:31</span><i>"</i>, &amp;c. Rahab had the <i>approbation</i> due to genuine faith, which she actually possessed, and gave the fullest proof that she did so by her conduct. As justification signifies, not only the pardon of sin, but receiving the <i>Divine approbation</i>, James seems to use the word in this latter sense. God <i>approved</i> of them, because of their obedience to his will and he <i>approves</i> of no man who is not <i>obedient</i>.</p>
