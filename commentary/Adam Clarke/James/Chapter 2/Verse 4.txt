Verse James 2:4. Are ye not then partial — ου διεκριθητε. Do ye not make a distinction, though the case has not been heard, and the law has not decided?Judges of evil thoughts? — κριται διαλογισμων πονηρων. Judges of evil reasonings; that is, judges who reason wickedly; who, in effect, say in your hearts, we will espouse the cause of the rich, because they can befriend us; we will neglect that of the poor, because they cannot help us, nor have they power to hurt us.
