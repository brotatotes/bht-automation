<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:4">James 2:4</span>. <i><b>Are ye not then partial</b></i> — ου διεκριθητε. <i>Do ye not</i> <i>make a distinction</i>, though the case has not been heard, and the law has not decided?</p>
<p><i><b>Judges of evil thoughts?</b></i> — κριται διαλογισμων πονηρων. <i>Judges</i> <i>of evil reasonings</i>; that is, <i>judges who reason wickedly</i>; who, in effect, say in your hearts, we will espouse the cause of the <i>rich</i>, because they can befriend us; we will neglect that of the poor, because they cannot help us, nor have they power to hurt us.</p>
