<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:5">James 2:5</span>. <i><b>Hath not God chosen the poor of this world</b></i> â€” This seems to refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span>: <i>And the poor have the Gospel preached to them</i>. These believed on the Lord Jesus, and found his salvation; while the <i>rich</i> despised, neglected, and persecuted him. These had that faith in Christ which put them in possession of the <i>choicest spiritual blessings</i>, and gave them a <i>right</i> to the <i>kingdom of heaven</i>. While, therefore, they were despised of men, they were highly prized of God.</p>
