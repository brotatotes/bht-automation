<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Do not rich men oppress you</b></i> — The administration of justice was at this time in a miserable state of corruption among the Jews; but a <i>Christian</i> was one who was to expect no justice any where but from his God. The words καταδυναστευουσιν, <i>exceedingly</i> <i>oppress</i>, and ελκουσινειςκριτηρια, <i>drag you to courts of justice,</i> show how grievously oppressed and maltreated the Christians were by their countrymen the Jews, who made <i>law</i> a pretext to afflict their bodies, and spoil them of their property.</p>
