<p>Verse 8. <i><b>The royal law</b></i> — νομον βασιλικον. This epithet, of all the New Testament writers, is peculiar to James; but it is frequent among the Greek writers in the sense in which it appears St. James uses it. βασιλικος, <i>royal</i>, is used to signify any thing that is of general concern, is suitable to all, and necessary for all, as brotherly love is. This commandment; <i>Thou shalt love thy</i> <i>neighbour as thyself</i>, is a <i>royal law</i>, not only because it is ordained of God, and proceeds from his <i>kingly</i> authority over men, but because it is so <i>useful, suitable</i>, and <i>necessary</i> to the present state of man; and as it was given us particularly by Christ himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:12">John 15:12</span>, who is our <i>King</i>, as well as Prophet and Priest, it should ever put us in mind of his <i>authority</i> over us, and our <i>subjection</i> to him. As the <i>regal state</i> is the most excellent for secular dignity and civil utility that exists among men, hence we give the epithet <i>royal</i> to whatever is excellent, noble, grand, or useful.</p>
