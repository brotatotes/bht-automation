<p>Verse 9. <i><b>But if ye have respect to persons</b></i> — In judgment, or in any other way; <i>ye commit sin</i> against God, and against your brethren, and are <i>convinced</i>, ελεγχομενοι, and are <i>convicted</i>, by the law; by this royal law, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; <i>as transgressors</i>, having shown this sinful acceptance of persons, which has led you to refuse <i>justice</i> to the <i>poor man</i>, and uphold the <i>rich</i> in his oppressive conduct.</p>
