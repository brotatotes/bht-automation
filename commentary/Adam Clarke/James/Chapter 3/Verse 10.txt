<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Out of the same mouth</b></i> â€” This saying is something like that, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+18:21">Proverbs 18:21</span>: <i>Death and life are in the power of the tongue</i>; and on this, for an illustration of St. James' words, hear <i>Vayikra Rabba</i>, sec. 33: "Rabbi Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, said to his servant Tobias, Go and bring me some <i>good food</i> from the market: the servant went, and he bought <i>tongues</i>. At another time he said to the same servant, Go and buy me some <i>bad food</i>: the servant went, and bought <i>tongues</i>. The master said, What is the reason that when I ordered thee to buy me <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i> food, thou didst bring <i>tongues</i>? The servant answered, From the <i>tongue</i> both <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i> come to man: if it be <i>good</i>, there is nothing <i>better</i>; if <i>bad</i>, there is nothing <i>worse</i>."</p>
<p>A saying very like that of St. James as found in <i>Rabbi Tanchum</i>, fol. 10, 4: "The mouth desires to study in the law, and to speak good words; to praise God, to glorify him, and to celebrate him with hymns: but it can also slander, blaspheme, reproach, and swear falsely." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>To find a man who officiates in sacred things to be a common swearer, a slanderer, c., is truly monstrous but there have been many cases of this kind, and I have known several. Let me say to all such, <i>My brethren, these things ought not so to be</i>.</p>
