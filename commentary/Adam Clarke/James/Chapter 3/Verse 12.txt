<p>Verse 12. <i><b>So</b></i><b> can </b><i><b>no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</b></i> — For the reading of the common text, which is οὑτως ουδεμια πηγη ἁλυκον και γλυκυ ποιησαι ὑδωρ, <i>so no fountain can produce salt</i> <i>water and sweet</i>, there are various other readings in the MSS. and versions. The word ουτως, <i>so</i>, which makes this a continuation of the comparison in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:11">James 3:11</span>, is wanting in ABC, one other, with the <i>Armenian</i> and ancient <i>Syriac</i>; the later <i>Syriac</i> has it in the margin with an asterisk. ABC, five others, with the <i>Coptic,</i> <i>Vulgate</i>, one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, and <i>Cyril</i>, have ουτε ἁλυκον γλυκυ ποιησαι ὑδωρ, <i>neither can salt water produce sweet</i>. In the <i>Syriac</i> and the <i>Arabic</i> of Erpen, it is, <i>So, likewise, sweet water</i> <i>cannot become bitter; and bitter water cannot become sweet</i>. The true reading appears to be, <i>Neither can salt water produce sweet</i>, or, <i>Neither can the sea produce fresh water</i>; and this is a new comparison, and not an inference from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:11">James 3:11</span>. This reading <i>Griesbach</i> has admitted into the text; and of it Professor <i>White</i>, in his <i>Crisews</i>, says, <i>Lectio indubie genuina</i>, "a reading undoubtedly genuine." There are therefore, <i>four</i> distinct comparisons here:</p>
<p>1. A fountain cannot produce sweet water and bitter. </p>
<p>2. A fig tree cannot produce olive berries. </p>
<p>3. A vine cannot produce figs. </p>
<p>4. Salt water cannot be made sweet. That is, according to the ordinary operations of nature, these things are impossible. Chemical analysis is out of the question.</p>
