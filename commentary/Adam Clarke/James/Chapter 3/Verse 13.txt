<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Who</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>a wise man</b></i> — One truly religious; who, although he can neither bridle nor tame other men's tongues, can restrain his own.</p>
<p><i><b>And endued with knowledge</b></i> — και επιστημων. And qualified to teach others.</p>
<p><i><b>Let him show</b></i> — Let him by a holy life and chaste conversation show, through meekness and gentleness, joined to his Divine information, that he is a Christian indeed; his works and his spirit proving that God is in him of a truth; and that, from the fulness of a holy heart, his feet walk, his hands work; and his tongue speaks. We may learn from this that <i>genuine wisdom</i> is ever accompanied with <i>meekness</i> and <i>gentleness</i>. Those <i>proud,</i> <i>overbearing</i>, and <i>disdainful men</i>, who pass for <i>great scholars</i> and <i>eminent critics</i>, may have <i>learning</i>, but they have not <i>wisdom</i>. Their learning implies their correct knowledge of the <i>structure</i> of <i>language</i>, and of <i>composition in general</i>; but <i>wisdom</i> they have none, nor any <i>self-government</i>. They are like the blind man who carried a lantern in daylight to keep others from jostling him in the street. That <i>learning</i> is not only <i>little worth</i>, but <i>despicable</i>, that does not teach a man to <i>govern his own spirit</i>, and to be humble in his conduct towards others.</p>
