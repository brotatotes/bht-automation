<p>Verse 16. <i><b>For where envying and strife</b></i><b> is</b>] ζηλοςκαιεριθεια. <i>Zeal</i>-fiery, inflammatory passion, and <i>contention</i>-altercations about the different points of the law, of no use for edification, such as those mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:9">Titus 3:9</span>. The <i>Jews</i> were the most intolerant of all mankind; it was a maxim with them to kill those who would not conform to their law; and their salvation they believed to be impossible. This has been the spirit of <i>Popery</i>, and of the Romish Church at large; in vain do they attempt to deny it; they have written it in characters of <i>blood</i> and <i>fire</i> even in this country, (England,) when they were possessed of political power. With them it is still an established maxim, that out of their Church there is no redemption; and fire and faggot have been in that Church legal means of <i>conversion</i> or <i>extinction</i>. In the short popish reign of <i>Mary</i> in this country, besides multitudes who suffered by fine, imprisonment, confiscation, c., two hundred and seventy-seven were <i>burnt alive</i>, among whom were <i>one</i> archbishop, <i>four</i> bishops, <i>twenty-one</i> clergymen, <i>eight</i> lay gentlemen, <i>eighty-four</i> tradesmen, <i>one hundred</i> husbandmen, <i>fifty-five</i> women, and <i>four</i> children! O earth! thou hast not drunk their <i>blood</i> but their <i>ashes</i> have been strewed on the face of the field.</p>
