Verse 16. For where envying and strife is] ζηλοςκαιεριθεια. Zeal-fiery, inflammatory passion, and contention-altercations about the different points of the law, of no use for edification, such as those mentioned, Titus 3:9. The Jews were the most intolerant of all mankind; it was a maxim with them to kill those who would not conform to their law; and their salvation they believed to be impossible. This has been the spirit of Popery, and of the Romish Church at large; in vain do they attempt to deny it; they have written it in characters of blood and fire even in this country, (England,) when they were possessed of political power.

In the short popish reign of Mary in this country, besides multitudes who suffered by fine, imprisonment, confiscation, c., two hundred and seventy-seven were burnt alive, among whom were one archbishop, four bishops, twenty-one clergymen, eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four tradesmen, one hundred husbandmen, fifty-five women, and four children! O earth! thou hast not drunk their blood but their ashes have been strewed on the face of the field.
