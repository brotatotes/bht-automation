<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span>. <i><b>In many things we offend all.</b></i> — πταιομεν απαντες. <i>We</i> <i>all stumble</i> or <i>trip</i>. Dr. Barrow very properly observes: "As the general course of life is called a <i>way</i>, and particular actions <i>steps</i>, so going on in a regular course of right action is <i>walking</i> <i>uprightly</i>; and acting amiss, <i>tripping</i> or <i>stumbling</i>." There are very few who walk so closely with God, and inoffensively with men, as never to stumble; and although it is the privilege of every follower of God <i>to be sincere and without offence to the day of</i> <i>Christ</i>, yet few of them are so. Were this <i>unavoidable</i>, it would be useless to make it a subject of regret; but as every man may receive grace from his God to enable him to walk in every respect <i>uprightly</i>, it is to be deplored that so few live up to their privileges. Some have produced these words as a <i>proof</i> that "no man can live without sinning against God; for James himself, a holy apostle speaking of himself, all the apostles, and the whole Church of Christ, says, <i>In many things we offend all</i>." This is a very bad and dangerous doctrine; and, pushed to its consequences, would greatly affect the credibility of the whole Gospel system. Besides, were the doctrine as true as it is dangerous and false, it is foolish to ground it upon such a text; because St. James, after the common mode of all teachers, includes himself in his addresses to his hearers. And were we to suppose that where he appears by the use of the plural pronoun to include himself, he means to be thus understood, we must then grant that himself was one of those many <i>teachers</i> who were to <i>receive</i> a <i>great</i> <i>condemnation</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>; that he was a <i>horse-breaker</i>, because he says, "<i>we</i> put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey <i>us</i>," <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:3">James 3:3</span>; that <i>his</i> tongue was a world of iniquity, and set on fire of hell, for he says, "so is the tongue among <i>our</i> members," <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span>; that he cursed men, "wherewith curse <i>we</i> men, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:9">James 3:9</span>. No man possessing common sense could imagine that James, or any man of even tolerable morals, could be guilty of those things. But some of those were thus guilty to whom he wrote; and to soften his reproofs, and to cause them to enter the more deeply into their hearts, he appears to include himself in his own censure; and yet not one of his readers would understand him as being a brother delinquent.</p>
<p><i><b>Offend not in word, the same</b></i> is <i>a perfect man</i>] To understand this properly we must refer to the caution St. James gives in the preceding verse: <i>Be not many masters or teachers</i>-do not affect that for which you are not qualified, because in your <i>teaching</i>, not knowing the heavenly doctrine, ye may <i>sin</i> against the <i>anology</i> <i>of faith</i>. But, says he, <i>if any man offend not</i>, ουπταιει, <i>trip</i> <i>not</i>, ενλογω, <i>in doctrine</i>, teaching the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, <i>the same is</i> τελειοςανηρ, <i>a man fully</i> <i>instructed</i> in Divine things: How often the term λογος, which we render <i>word</i>, is used to express <i>doctrine</i>, and the <i>doctrine of the</i> <i>Gospel</i>, we have seen in many parts of the preceding comment. And how often the word τελειος, which we translate <i>perfect</i>, is used to signify <i>an adult Christian</i>, one <i>thoroughly instructed</i> in the doctrines of the Gospel, may be seen in various parts of St. Paul's writings. See among others, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:15">Philippians 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>. The man, therefore, who advanced no false doctrine, and gave no imperfect view of any of the great truths of Christianity; that man proved himself thereby to be <i>thoroughly instructed</i> in Divine things; to be no novice, and consequently, among the <i>many teachers</i>, to be a <i>perfect master</i>, and worthy of the sacred vocation.</p>
<p><i><b>Able also to bridle the whole body.</b></i> — Grotius, by <i>body</i>, believed that the Church of Christ was intended; and this the view we have taken of the preceding clauses renders very probable. But some think the <i>passions</i> and <i>appetites</i> are intended; yet these persons understand <i>not offending in word</i> as referring simply to well guarded speech. Now how a man's cautiousness in <i>what he says</i> can be a proof that he has <i>every passion</i> and <i>appetite under control</i>, I cannot see. Indeed, I have seen so many examples of a contrary kind, that I can have no doubt of the impropriety of this exposition. But it is objected "that χαλιναγωγεω signifies to <i>check, turn</i>, or <i>rule with a bridle</i>; and is never applied to the government of the Church of Christ." Probably not: but St. James is a very peculiar writer; his phraseology, metaphors, and diction in general, are different from all the rest of the New Testament writers, so as to have scarcely any thing in common with them, but only that he writes in Greek. The sixth verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span> is supposed to be a proof against the opinion of <i>Grotius</i>; but I conceive that verse to belong to a different subject, which commences <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:3">James 3:3</span>.</p>
