<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:3">James 3:3</span>. <i><b>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths</b></i> â€” In order to show the necessity of regulating the tongue, to which St. James was led by his exhortation to them who wished to thrust themselves into the teacher's office, supposing, because they had the <i>gift of</i> <i>a ready flow of speech</i>, that therefore they might commence teachers of Divine things; he proceeds to show that the tongue must be bridled as the horse, and governed as the ships; because, though it is small, it is capable of ruling the whole man; and of irritating and offending others.</p>
