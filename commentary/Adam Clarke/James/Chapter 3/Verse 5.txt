<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:5">James 3:5</span>. <i><b>Boasteth great things.</b></i> — That is, <i>can do great</i> <i>things</i>, whether of a <i>good</i> or <i>evil</i> kind. He seems to refer here to the powerful and all commanding eloquence of the Greek orators: they could carry the great mob whithersoever they wished; calm them to peaceableness and submission, or excite them to furious sedition.</p>
<p><i><b>Behold, how great a matter</b></i> — See what a flame of discord and insubordination one man, merely by his persuasive tongue, may kindle among the common people.</p>
