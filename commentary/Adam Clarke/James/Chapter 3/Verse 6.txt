<p>Verse 6. <i><b>The tongue</b></i> is <i>a fire</i>] It is often the instrument of producing the most desperate contentions and insurrections.</p>
<p><i><b>A world of iniquity</b></i> — This is an unusual form of speech, but the meaning is plain enough; WORLD signifies here a <i>mass</i>, a <i>great</i> <i>collection</i>, an <i>abundance</i>. We use the term in the same sense-a <i>world of troubles, a world of toil, a world of anxiety</i>; for <i>great</i> troubles, <i>oppressive</i> toil, <i>most distressing</i> anxiety. And one of our lexicographers calls his work <i>a world of words</i>; i.e. a vast collection of words: so we also say, a <i>deluge of wickedness</i>, a <i>sea</i> <i>of troubles</i>; and the Latins, <i>oceanus malorum</i>, an ocean of evils. I do not recollect an example of this use of the word among the Greek writers; but in this sense it appears to be used by the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:6">Proverbs 17:6</span>: Του πιστου ὁλος ὁ κοσμος των χρηματων, του δε απιστου ουδε οβολος, which may be translated, "The faithful has a <i>world of riches</i>, but the unfaithful not a penny." This clause has nothing answering to it in the <i>Hebrew</i> text. Some think that the word is thus used, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>: <i>And brought the flood</i>, κοσμω ασεβων, <i>on the multitude of the</i> <i>ungodly</i>. Mr. <i>Wakefield</i> translates the clause thus: The tongue is the <i>varnisher of injustice</i>. We have seen that κοσμος signifies adorned, elegant, beautiful, c., but I can scarcely think that this is its sense in this place. The <i>Syriac</i> gives a curious turn to the expression: <i>And the tongue is a fire and the world of</i> <i>iniquity is like a wood</i>. Above, the same version has: <i>A little</i> <i>fire burns great woods</i>. So the world of iniquity is represented as inflamed by the wicked tongues of men; the world being <i>fuel</i>, and the tongue a <i>fire</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>So is the tongue among our members</b></i> — I think St. James refers here to those well known speeches of the rabbins, <i>Vayikra Rabba</i>, sec. 16, fol. 159. "Rabbi Eleazar said, Man has one hundred and forty-eight members, some confined, others free. The tongue is placed between the jaws; and from under it proceeds a fountain of water, (the great sublingual salivary gland,) and it is folded with various foldings. Come and see <i>what a flame the tongue</i> <i>kindles</i>! Were it one of the unconfined members, what would it not do?" The same sentiment, with a little variation, may be found in <i>Midrash, Yalcut Simeoni</i>, par. 2, fol. 107; and in <i>Erachin</i>, fol. xv. 2, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+120:3">Psalms 120:3</span>: <i>What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be done unto thee,</i> <i>thou false tongue</i>? "The holy blessed God said to the tongue: All the rest of the members of the body are <i>erect</i>, but thou <i>liest</i> <i>down</i>; all the rest are <i>external</i>, but thou art <i>internal</i>. Nor is this enough: I have built <i>two walls</i> about thee; the one <i>bone</i>, the other <i>flesh: What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done</i> <i>unto thee, O thou false tongue</i>?"</p>
<p><i><b>Setteth on fire the course of nature</b></i> — Φλογιζουσα τον τροχον της γενεσεως· <i>And setteth on fire the wheel of life</i>. I question much whether this verse be in general well understood. There are three different interpretations of it:</p>
<p>1. St. James does not intend to express the whole circle of human affairs, so much affected by the tongue of man; but rather the <i>penal wheel</i> of the Greeks, and not unknown to the Jews, on which they were accustomed to extend criminals, to induce them to confess, or to punish them for crimes; under which <i>wheels, fire</i> was often placed to add to their torments. In the book, <i>De Maccabaeis</i>, attributed to Josephus, and found in <i>Haverkamp's</i> edition, vol. ii., p. 497-520, where we have the account of the martyrdom of seven Hebrew brothers, in chap. ix, speaking of the death of the eldest, it is said: Ανεβαλον αυτον επι τον τροχοι - περι ὁν κατατεινομενος· "They cast him on the <i>wheel</i>, over which they extended him; πυρ ὑπεστρωσαν και διηρεθισαν τον τροχον προσεπικατατεινοντες· they put <i>coals</i> under it, and strongly agitated the wheel." And of the martyrdom of the sixth brother it is said, cap. 11: Παρηγον επι τον τροχον, εφ' οὑ κατατεινομενος εκμελως και εκσφονδυλιζομενος ὑπεκαιετο, και οβελισκους δε οξεις πυρωσαντες, τοις νοτοις προσεφερον, και τα πλευρα διαπειραντες αυτου, και τα σπλαγχνα διεκαιον· They brought him to the <i>wheel</i>, on which, having distended his limbs, and broken his joints, they <i>scorched</i> him with the <i>fire</i> placed underneath; and with sharp spits <i>heated in the</i> <i>fire</i>, they pierced his sides, and burned his bowels.</p>
<p>The <i>fire</i> and the <i>wheel</i> are mentioned by <i>Achilles Tatius</i>, lib. 7, p. 449. "Having stripped me of my garments, I was carried aloft, των μεν μαστιγας κομιζοντων, των δε πυρ και τροχον, some bringing scourges, others the <i>fire</i> and the <i>wheel</i>." Now as γενεσις often signifies <i>life</i>, then the <i>wheel of life</i> will signify the miseries and torments of life. To <i>set on fire the wheel of life</i> is to increase a man's torments; and to be <i>set on fire from hell</i> implies having these miseries rendered more active by diabolic agency; or, in other words, bad men, instigated by the devil, through their <i>lies</i> and <i>calumnies</i>, make life burdensome to the objects of their malicious tongues. The <i>wheel</i> and the <i>fire</i>, so pointedly mentioned by St. James, make it probable that this sort of punishment might have suggested the idea to him. See more in <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p>2. But is it not possible that by the <i>wheel of life</i> St. James may have the <i>circulation of the blood</i> in view? Angry or irritating language has an astonishing influence on the circulation of the blood: the heart beats high and frequent; the blood is hurried through the arteries to the veins, through the veins to the heart, and through the heart to the arteries again, and so on; an extraordinary degree of <i>heat</i> is at the same time engendered; the eyes become more prominent in their sockets; the capillary vessels suffused with blood; the face flushed; and, in short, the whole <i>wheel of nature is set on fire of hell</i>. No description can be more natural than this: but it may be objected that this intimates that the <i>circulation of the blood</i> was known to St. James. Now supposing it does, is the thing impossible? It is allowed by some of the most judicious medical writers, that Solomon refers to this in his celebrated <i>portraiture of old age</i>, particularly in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ec+12:6">Ecclesiastes 12:6</span>: "Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the <i>pitcher be broken at the</i> <i>fountain</i>, or the <i>wheel broken at the cistern</i>." Here is the very <i>wheel of life</i> from which St. James might have borrowed the idea; and the different times evidently refer to the <i>circulation of the</i> <i>blood</i>, which might be as well known to St. James as the doctrine of the <i>parallax of the sun</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17">James 1:17</span>.</p>
<p>3. It is true, however, that the rabbins use the term גלגל תולדות <i>gilgal toledoth</i>, "the wheel of generations," to mark the successive generations of men: and it is possible that St. James might refer to this; as if he had said: "The tongue has been the instrument of confusion and misery through all the ages of the world." But the other interpretations are more likely.</p>
