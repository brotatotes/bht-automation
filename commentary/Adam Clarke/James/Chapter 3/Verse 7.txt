<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Every kind of beasts</b></i> — That is, every <i>species</i> of wild beasts, πασα φυσις θηριων, <i>is tamed</i>, i.e. brought under man's power and dominion. Beasts, birds, serpents, and some kinds of fishes have been <i>tamed</i> so as to be domesticated; but every kind, particularly των εναλιων, of <i>sea monsters</i>, has not been <i>thus</i> tamed; but all have been subjected to the power of man; both the <i>shark</i> and <i>whale</i> become an easy prey to the skill and influence of the human being. I have had the most credible information, when in the Zetland Isles, of the <i>seals</i> being domesticated, and of one that would pass part of his time on shore, receive his allowance of milk, &amp;c., from the servants, go again to sea, and return, and so on.</p>
