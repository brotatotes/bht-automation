<p>Verse 8. <i><b>But the tongue wan no man tame</b></i> — No cunning, persuasion, or influence has ever been able to silence it. Nothing but the grace of God, <i>excision</i>, or <i>death</i>, can bring <i>it</i> under subjection.</p>
<p>It is <i><b>an unruly evil</b></i> — ακατασχετον κακον. An <i>evil</i> that <i>cannot</i> be <i>restrained</i>; it cannot be <i>brought</i> under any kind of government; it breaks all bounds.</p>
<p><i><b>Full of deadly poison.</b></i> — He refers here to the tongues of serpents, supposed to be the means of conveying their poison into wounds made by their teeth. Throughout the whole of this poetic and highly declamatory description, St. James must have the tongue of the <i>slanderer, calumniator, backbiter, whisperer</i>, and <i>tale-bearer</i>, particularly in view. Vipers, basilisks; and rattlesnakes are not more dangerous to <i>life</i>, than these are to the peace and reputation of men.</p>
