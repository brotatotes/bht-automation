<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Therewith bless we God</b></i> — The tongue is capable of rehearsing the praises, and setting forth the glories, of the eternal King: what a pity that it should ever be employed in a contrary work! It can proclaim and vindicate the truth of God, and publish the Gospel of peace and good will among men: what a pity that it should ever be employed in falsehoods, calumny, or in the cause of infidelity!</p>
<p><i><b>And therewith curse we men</b></i> — In the true Satanic spirit, many pray to God, the <i>Father</i>, to destroy those who are objects of their displeasure! These are the <i>common swearers</i>, whose mouths are generally full of direful imprecations against those with whom they are offended.</p>
<p>The consideration that <i>man is made after the image of God</i> should restrain the tongue of the swearer; but there are many who, while they pretend to <i>sing the high praises of God</i>, are ready to wish the direst imprecations either on those who offend them, or with whom they choose to be offended.</p>
