<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1">James 4:1</span>. <i><b>From whence come wars and fightings</b></i> — About the time in which St. James wrote, whether we follow the <i>earlier</i> or the <i>later date</i> of this epistle, we find, according to the accounts given by Josephus, <i>Bell. Jud</i>. lib. ii. c. 17, c., that the Jews, under pretence of defending their religion, and procuring that liberty to which they believed themselves entitled, made various insurrections in Judea against the Romans, which occasioned much bloodshed and misery to their nation. The <i>factions</i> also, into which the Jews were split, had violent contentions among themselves, in which they massacred and plundered each other. In the provinces, likewise, the Jews became very turbulent particularly in Alexandria, and different other parts of Egypt, of Syria, and other places, where they made war against the heathens, killing many, and being massacred in their turn. They were led to these outrages by the opinion that they were bound by their law to extirpate idolatry, and to kill all those who would not become proselytes to Judaism. These are probably the <i>wars</i> and <i>fightings</i> to which St. James alludes; and which they undertook rather from a principle of <i>covetousness</i> than from any sincere desire to convert the heathen. See <i>Macknight</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Come</b></i><b> they </b><i><b>not hence - of your lusts</b></i> — This was the principle from which these Jewish contentions and predatory wars proceeded, and the principle from which all the wars that have afflicted and desolated the world have proceeded. One nation or king <i>covets</i> another's <i>territory</i> or <i>property</i>; and, as <i>conquest</i> is supposed to give right to all the possessions gained by it, they kill, slay, burn, and destroy, till one is overcome or exhausted, and then the other makes his own terms; or, several neighbouring potentates fall upon one that is weak; and, after murdering one half of the people, partition among themselves the fallen king's territory; just as the <i>Austrians, Prussians</i>, and <i>Russians</i> have done with the kingdom of <i>Poland</i>! - a stain upon their justice and policy which no lapse of time can ever wash out.</p>
<p>These <i>wars</i> and <i>fightings</i> could not be attributed to the Christians in that time; for, howsoever fallen or degenerate, they had no power to raise <i>contentions</i>; and no political consequence to enable them to resist their enemies by the edge of the sword, or resistance of any kind.</p>
