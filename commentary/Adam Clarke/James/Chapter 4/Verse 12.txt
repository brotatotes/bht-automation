<p>Verse 12. <i><b>There is one lawgiver</b></i> — και κριτης, <i>And judge</i>, is added here by AB, about <i>thirty</i> others, with both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic, Armenian, AEthiopic, Slavonic,</i> <i>Vulgate</i>, two copies of the <i>Itala, Cyril</i> of Antioch, <i>Euthalius,</i> <i>Theophylact</i>, and <i>Cassiodorus</i>. On this evidence Griesbach has received it into the text.</p>
<p>The man who breaks the law, and teaches others so to do, thus in effect set himself up as a <i>lawgiver</i> and <i>judge</i>. But there is only one such lawgiver and judge-God Almighty, who is <i>able to save</i> all those who obey him, and <i>able to destroy</i> all those who trample under feet his testimonies.</p>
<p><i><b>Who art thou that judgest another?</b></i> — Who art thou who darest to usurp the office and prerogative of the supreme Judge? But what is that <i>law</i> of which St. James speaks? and who is this <i>lawgiver</i> and <i>judge</i>? Most critics think that the <i>law</i> mentioned here is the same as that which he elsewhere calls the <i>royal law</i> and <i>the law of</i> <i>liberty</i>, thereby meaning the <i>Gospel</i>; and that <i>Christ</i> is the person who is called the <i>lawgiver</i> and <i>judge</i>. This, however, is not clear to me. I believe James means the <i>Jewish law</i>; and by the <i>lawgiver</i> and <i>judge</i>, God Almighty, as acknowledged by the Jewish people. I find, or think I find, from the closest examination of this epistle, but few references to Jesus Christ or his Gospel. His Jewish creed, forms, and maxims, this writer keeps constantly in view; and it is proper he should, considering the persons to whom he wrote. Some of them were, doubtless, <i>Christians</i>; some of them certainly <i>no Christians</i>; and some of them <i>half Christians</i> and <i>half Jews</i>. The two latter descriptions are those most frequently addressed.</p>
