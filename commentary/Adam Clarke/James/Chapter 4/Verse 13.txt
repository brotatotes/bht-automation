<p><i><b>To-day, or to-morrow, we will go</b></i> — This presumption on a precarious life is here well reproved and the ancient Jewish rabbins have some things on the subject which probably St. James had in view. In <i>Debarim Rabba</i>, sec. 9, fol. 261, 1, we have the following little story; "Our rabbins tell us a story which happened in the days of Rabbi Simeon, the son of Chelpatha. He was present at the circumcision of a child, and stayed with its father to the entertainment. The father brought out wine for his guests that was seven years old, saying, <i>With this wine will I</i> <i>continue for a long time to celebrate the birth of my new-born</i> <i>son</i>.
