Verse 14. Whereas ye know not — This verse should be read in a parenthesis. It is not only impious, but grossly absurd, to speak thus concerning futurity, when ye know not what a day may bring forth. Life is utterly precarious; and God has not put it within the power of all the creatures he has made to command one moment of what is future.It is even a vapour — Ατμις γαρ εστιν· It is a smoke, always fleeting, uncertain, evanescent, and obscured with various trials and afflictions. This is a frequent metaphor with the Hebrews; see Psalms 102:11; My days are like a shadow: Job 8:9; Our days upon earth are a shadow: 1 Chronicles 29:15; Our days on the earth are a shadow, and there is no abiding. Quid tam circumcisum, tam breve, quam hominis vita longissima? Plin. l. iii., Ep. 7. "What is so circumscribed, or so short, as the longest life of man?" "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field. The grass withereth, and the flower fadeth, because the breath of the Lord bloweth upon it. Surely the people is like grass." St. James had produced the same figure, James 1:10; James 1:11. But there is a very remarkable saying in the book of Ecclesiasticus, which should be quoted: "As of the green leaves of a thick tree, some fall and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood: one cometh to an end, and another is born." Ecclus. xiv. 18.We find precisely the same image in Homer as that quoted above. Did the apocryphal writer borrow it from the Greek poet?  Οἱη περ φυλλων γενεη, τοιηδε και ανδρων· Φυλλα τα μεν τ' ανεμος χαμαδις χεει, αλλα δε θ' ὑλη Τηλεθοωσα φυει, εσρος δ' επιγιγνεται ὡρη· Ὡς ανδρων γενεη, ἡ μεν φυει, ἡ δ' αποληγει. Il. l. vi., ver. 146.  Like leaves on trees the race of man is found, Now green in youth, now withering on the ground Another race the following spring supplies; They fall successive, and successive rise. So generations in their course decay; So flourish these, when those are pass'd away. POPE.
