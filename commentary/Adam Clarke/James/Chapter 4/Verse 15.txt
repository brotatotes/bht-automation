<p>Verse 15. <i><b>For that ye ought to say</b></i> — Αντι τοι λεγειν ὑμας· <i>Instead of saying</i>, or <i>instead of which ye should say</i>,</p>
<p><i><b>If the Lord will, we shall live</b></i> — I think St. James had another example from the rabbins in view, which is produced by <i>Drusius,</i> <i>Gregory, Cartwright</i>, and <i>Schoettgen</i>, on this clause: "<i>The bride</i> <i>went up to her chamber, not knowing what was to befall her there</i>." On which there is this comment: "No man should ever say that he <i>will do this or that, without the condition</i> IF GOD WILL. A certain man said, 'To-morrow shall I sit with my bride in my chamber, and there shall rejoice with her.' To which some standing by said, אם גוזר השם <i>im gozer hashshem</i>, '<i>If the Lord</i> <i>will</i>.' To which he answered, 'Whether the Lord will or not, to-morrow will I sit with my bride in my chamber.' He did so; he went with his bride into his chamber, and at night they lay down; but they both died, <i>antequam illam cognosceret</i>." It is not improbable that St. James refers to this case, as he uses the <i>same</i> <i>phraseology</i>.</p>
<p>On this subject I shall quote another passage which I read when a schoolboy, and which even then taught me a lesson of caution and of respect for the providence of God. It may be found in Lucian, in the piece entitled, Χαρων, η επισκοπουντες, c. 6: Επι δειπνον, οιμαι, κληθεις ὑπο τινος των φιλων ες την ὑστεραιαν, μαλιστα ἡξω, εφη· και μεταξυ λεγοντος, απο του τεγους κεραμις επιπεσουσα, ουκ οιδ' ὁτου κινησαντος, απεκτεινεν αυτον· εγελασα ουν, ουκ επιτελεσαντος την ὑποσχεσιν. "A man was invited by one of his friends to come the next day to supper. <i>I will certainly come</i>, said he. In the mean time a tile fell from a house, I knew not who threw it, and killed him. I therefore laughed at him for not fulfilling his engagement." It is often said <i>Fas est et ab hoste</i> <i>doceri</i>, " we should learn even from our enemies." Take heed, Christian, that this heathen buffoon laugh thee not out of countenance.</p>
