<p>Verse 16. <i><b>But now ye rejoice in your boastings</b></i> — Ye glory in your proud and self-sufficient conduct, exulting that ye are free from the trammels of <i>superstition</i>, and that ye can live independently of God Almighty. <i>All such boasting is wicked</i>, πονηραεστιν, is impious. In an old English work, entitled, <i>The</i> <i>godly man's picture drawn by a Scripture pencil</i>, there are these words: "Some of those who despise religion say, <i>Thank God we are</i> <i>not of this holy number</i>! They who thank God for their unholiness had best go ring the bells for joy that they shall never see God."</p>
