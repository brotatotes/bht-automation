<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:17">James 4:17</span>. <i><b>To him that knoweth to do good</b></i> â€” As if he had said: After this warning none of you can plead <i>ignorance</i>; if, therefore, any of you shall be found to act their ungodly part, not acknowledging the Divine providence, the uncertainty of life, and the necessity of standing every moment prepared to meet God-as you will have the greater sin, you will infallibly get the greater punishment. This may be applied to all who know better than they act. He who does not the Master's will because he does <i>not know</i> it, will be beaten with few stripes; but he who knows it and does not do it, shall be beaten with many; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:47">Luke 12:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span>. St. James may have the <i>Christians</i> in view who were converted from Judaism to Christianity. They had much more light and religious knowledge than the Jews had; and God would require a proportionable improvement from them.</p>
<p>1. SAADY, a celebrated Persian poet, in his <i>Gulistan</i>, gives us a remarkable example of this going from city to city to buy and sell, and get gain. "I knew," says he, "a merchant who used to travel with a hundred camels laden with merchandise, and who had forty slaves in his employ. This person took me one day to his warehouse, and entertained me a long time with conversation good for nothing. 'I have,' said he, 'such a partner in Turquestan; such and such property in India; a bond for so much cash in such a province; a security for such another sum.' Then, changing the subject, he said, 'I purpose to go and settle at Alexandria, because the air of that city is salubrious.' Correcting himself, he said, 'No, I will not go to Alexandria; the African sea (the Mediterranean) is too dangerous. But I will make another voyage; and after that I will retire into some quiet corner of the world, and give up a mercantile life.' I asked him (says Saady) what voyage he intended to make. He answered, 'I intend to take <i>brimstone</i> to <i>Persia</i> and <i>China</i>, where I am informed it brings a good price; from <i>China</i> I shall take <i>porcelain</i> to <i>Greece</i>; from <i>Greece</i> I shall take <i>gold tissue</i> to <i>India</i>; from <i>India</i> I shall carry <i>steel</i> to <i>Haleb</i> (Aleppo;) from <i>Haleb</i> I shall carry <i>glass</i> to <i>Yemen</i> (Arabia Felix;) and from <i>Yemen</i> I shall carry <i>printed</i> <i>goods</i> to <i>Persia</i>. When this is accomplished I shall bid farewell to the mercantile life, which requires so many troublesome journeys, and spend the rest of my life in a shop.' He said so much on this subject, till at last he wearied himself with talking; then turning to me he said, 'I entreat thee, Saady, to relate to me something of what thou hast seen and heard in thy travels.' I answered, Hast thou never heard what a traveller said, who fell from his camel in the desert of Joor? <i>Two things</i> <i>only can fill the eye of a covetous man-contentment</i>, or the <i>earth</i> that is cast on him when laid in his grave."</p>
<p>This is an instructive story, and is taken from <i>real life</i>. In this very way, to those same places and with the above specified goods, trade is carried on to this day in the Levant. And often the same person takes all these journeys, and even more. We learn also from it that a covetous man is restless and unhappy, and that to avarice there are no bounds. This account properly illustrates that to which St. James refers: <i>To-day or to-morrow we will go</i> <i>into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and</i> <i>get gain</i>.</p>
<p>2. Providence is God's government of the world; he who properly trusts in Divine providence trusts in God; and he who expects God's direction and help must walk uprightly before him; for it is absurd to expect God to be our <i>friend</i> if we continue to be his <i>enemy</i>.</p>
<p>3. That man walks most safely who has the least confidence in himself. True <i>magnanimity</i> keeps God continually in view. He appoints it its work, and furnishes discretion and power; and its chief excellence consists in being a resolute worker together with him. Pride ever sinks where humility swims; for that man who abases himself God will exalt. To <i>know</i> that we are dependent creatures is well; to <i>feel</i> it, and to act suitably, is still better.</p>
