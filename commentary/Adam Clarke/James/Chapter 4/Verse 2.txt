<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:2">James 4:2</span>. <i><b>Ye lust, and have not</b></i> — Ye are ever covetous, and ever poor.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye kill, and, desire to have</b></i> — Ye are constantly engaged in insurrections and predatory wars, and never gain any advantage.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye have not, because ye ask not.</b></i> — Ye get no especial blessing from God as your fathers did, because ye do not pray. Worldly good is your god; ye leave no stone unturned in order to get it; and as ye ask nothing from God but to <i>consume it upon your evil</i> <i>desires and propensities</i>, your prayers are not heard.</p>
