Verse James 4:2. Ye lust, and have not — Ye are ever covetous, and ever poor.Ye kill, and, desire to have — Ye are constantly engaged in insurrections and predatory wars, and never gain any advantage.Ye have not, because ye ask not. — Ye get no especial blessing from God as your fathers did, because ye do not pray. Worldly good is your god; ye leave no stone unturned in order to get it; and as ye ask nothing from God but to consume it upon your evil desires and propensities, your prayers are not heard.
