<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:3">James 4:3</span>. <i><b>Ye ask, and receive not</b></i> — Some think that this refers to their prayers for the conversion of the heathen; and on the pretence that they were not converted thus; they thought it lawful to extirpate them and possess their goods.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye ask amiss</b></i> — κακως αιτεισθε. <i>Ye ask evilly, wickedly</i>. Ye have not the proper <i>dispositions</i> of prayer, and ye have an improper <i>object</i>. Ye ask for worldly prosperity, that ye may employ it in riotous living. This is properly the meaning of the original, ἱνα εν ταις ἡδοναις ὑμων δαπανησητε, <i>That ye may expend</i> <i>it upon your pleasures</i>. The rabbins have many good observations on <i>asking amiss</i> or <i>asking improperly</i>, and give examples of different kinds of this sort of prayer; the phrase is <i>Jewish</i> and would naturally occur to St. James in writing on this subject. Whether the <i>lusting</i> of which St. James speaks were their desire to make proselytes, in order that they might increase their power and influence by means of such, or whether it were a desire to cast off the Roman yoke, and become independent; the <i>motive</i> and the <i>object</i> were the same, and the prayers were such as God could not <i>hear</i>.</p>
