Verse James 4:4. Ye adulterers and adulteresses — The Jews, because of their covenant with God, are represented as being espoused to him; and hence their idolatry, and their iniquity in general, are represented under the notion of adultery. And although they had not since the Babylonish captivity been guilty of idolatry; according to the letter; yet what is intended by idolatry, having their hearts estranged from God, and seeking their portion in this life and out of God, is that of which the Jews were then notoriously guilty. And I rather think that it is in this sense especially that St. James uses the words. "Lo! they that are far from thee shall perish; thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee." But perhaps something more than spiritual adultery is intended. See James 4:9.The friendship of the world — The world was their god; here they committed their spiritual adultery; and they cultivated this friendship in order that they might gain this end.The word μοιχαλιδες, adulteresses, is wanting in the Syriac, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, and one copy of the Itala.Whosoever-will be a friend of the world — How strange it is that people professing Christianity can suppose that with a worldly spirit, worldly companions, and their lives governed by worldly maxims, they can be in the favour of God, or ever get to the kingdom of heaven! When the world gets into the Church, the Church becomes a painted sepulchre; its spiritual vitality being extinct.
