<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span>. <i><b>Ye adulterers and adulteresses</b></i> — The Jews, because of their <i>covenant</i> with God, are represented as being <i>espoused</i> to him; and hence their idolatry, and their iniquity in general, are represented under the notion of <i>adultery</i>. And although they had not since the Babylonish captivity been guilty of <i>idolatry</i>; according to the <i>letter</i>; yet what is intended by idolatry, having their hearts estranged from God, and seeking their portion in this life and out of God, is that of which the Jews were then notoriously guilty. And I rather think that it is in this sense especially that St. James uses the words. "Lo! they that are far from thee shall perish; thou hast destroyed all them that <i>go a</i> <i>whoring</i> from thee." But perhaps something more than spiritual adultery is intended. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:9">James 4:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The friendship of the world</b></i> — The world was their god; here they committed their <i>spiritual adultery</i>; and they cultivated this friendship in order that they might gain this end.</p>
<p>The word μοιχαλιδες, <i>adulteresses</i>, is wanting in the <i>Syriac,</i> <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and one copy of the <i>Itala</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whosoever-will be a friend of the world</b></i> — How strange it is that people professing Christianity can suppose that with a worldly spirit, worldly companions, and their lives governed by worldly maxims, they can be in the favour of God, or ever get to the kingdom of heaven! When the <i>world</i> gets into the <i>Church</i>, the Church becomes a painted sepulchre; its spiritual vitality being extinct.</p>
