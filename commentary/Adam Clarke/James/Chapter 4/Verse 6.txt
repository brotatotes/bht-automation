Verse 6. But he giveth more grace — μειζονα χαριν, A greater benefit, than all the goods that the world can bestow; for he gives genuine happiness, and this the world cannot confer. May this be St. James' meaning?God resisteth the proud — αντιτασσεται. Sets himself in battle array against him.Giveth grace unto the humble. — The sure way to please God is to submit to the dispensation of his grace and providence; and when a man acknowledges him in all his ways, he will direct all his steps. The covetous man grasps at the shadow, and loses the substance.
