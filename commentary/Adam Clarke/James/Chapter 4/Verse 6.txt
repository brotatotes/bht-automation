<p>Verse 6. <i><b>But he giveth more grace</b></i> — μειζονα χαριν, <i>A greater</i> <i>benefit</i>, than all the goods that the world can bestow; for he gives genuine happiness, and this the world cannot confer. May this be St. James' meaning?</p>
<p><i><b>God resisteth the proud</b></i> — αντιτασσεται. <i>Sets himself in battle</i> <i>array</i> against him.</p>
<p><i><b>Giveth grace unto the humble.</b></i> — The sure way to please God is to submit to the dispensation of his grace and providence; and when a man acknowledges him in all his ways, he will direct all his steps. The covetous man grasps at the <i>shadow</i>, and loses the <i>substance</i>.</p>
