<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Submit - to God</b></i> — Continue to bow to all his decisions, and to all his dispensations.</p>
<p><i><b>Resist the devil</b></i> — He cannot conquer you if you continue to resist. Strong as he is, God never permits him to conquer the man who continues to resist him; he cannot <i>force</i> the human will. He who, in the <i>terrible name</i> of JESUS, opposes even the devil himself, is sure to have a speedy and glorious conquest. He flees from that <i>name</i>, and from his conquering blood.</p>
