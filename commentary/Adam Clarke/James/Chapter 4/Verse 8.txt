<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Draw nigh to God</b></i> — Approach HIM, in the name of Jesus, by faith and prayer, and <i>he will draw nigh to you</i>-he will <i>meet</i> you at your coming. When a soul sets out to seek God, God sets out to meet that soul; so that while we are drawing near to him, he is drawing near to us. The <i>delicacy</i> and <i>beauty</i> of these expressions are, I think, but seldom noted.</p>
<p><i><b>Cleanse your hands, ye sinners</b></i> — This I think to be the beginning of a new address, and to different persons; and should have formed the commencement of a new verse. Let your whole conduct be changed; cease to do evil learn to do well. <i>Washing</i> or <i>cleansing the hands</i> was a token of innocence and purity.</p>
<p><i><b>Purify your hearts</b></i> — <i>Separate</i> yourselves from the world, and consecrate yourselves to God: this is the true notion of sanctification. We have often seen that to sanctify signifies to separate a thing or person from profane or common use, and consecrate it or him to God. This is the true notion of קדש <i>kadash</i>, in Hebrew, and αγιαζω in Greek. The person or thing thus consecrated or separated is considered to be <i>holy</i>, and to be God's property; and then God hallows it to himself. There are, therefore, two things implied in a man's sanctification:</p>
<p>1. That he separates himself from evil ways and evil companions, and devotes himself to God.</p>
<p>2. That God separates guilt from his conscience, and sin from his soul, and thus makes him internally and externally <i>holy</i>.</p>
<p>This double sanctification is well expressed in Sohar, Levit. fol. 33, col. 132, on the words, <i>be ye holy, for I the Lord am</i> <i>holy</i>: אותו מלמעלה ארס מקדש עצמו מלמטה מקישין, a man sanctifies <i>himself on the earth, and then he is sanctified from heaven</i>. As a man is a <i>sinner</i>, he must have his <i>hands cleansed</i> from wicked works; as he is <i>double-minded</i>, he must have his <i>heart sanctified</i>. <i>Sanctification</i> belongs to the <i>heart</i>, because of <i>pollution of mind;</i> <i>cleansing</i> belongs to the <i>hands</i>, because of <i>sinful acts</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:8">James 1:8</span>, for the signification of <i>double-minded</i>.</p>
