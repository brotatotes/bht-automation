<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Be afflicted, and mourn</b></i> — Without true and deep repentance ye cannot expect the mercy of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Let your laughter be turned to mourning</b></i> — It appears most evidently that many of those to whom St. James addressed this epistle had lived a very <i>irregular</i> and <i>dissolute life</i>. He had already spoken of their <i>lust</i>, and <i>pleasures</i>, and he had called them <i>adulterers</i> and <i>adulteresses</i>; and perhaps they were so in the <i>grossest</i> sense of the words. He speaks here of their <i>laughter</i> and their <i>joy</i>; and all the terms taken together show that a <i>dissolute</i> <i>life</i> is intended. What a strange view must he have of the nature of primitive Christianity, who can suppose that these words can possibly have been addressed to people professing the <i>Gospel of</i> <i>Jesus Christ</i>, who were few in number, without wealth or consequence, and were persecuted and oppressed both by their brethren the Jews and by the Romans!</p>
