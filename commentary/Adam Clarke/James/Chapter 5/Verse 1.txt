<p><i><b>Weep and howl for your miseries</b></i> — St. James seems to refer here, in the spirit of prophecy, to the destruction that was coming upon the Jews, not only in Judea, but in all the provinces where they sojourned. He seems here to assume the very air and character of a <i>prophet</i>; and in the most dignified language and peculiarly expressive and energetic images, foretells the desolations that were coming upon this bad people.</p>
