<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Above all things - swear not</b></i> — What relation this exhortation can have to the subject in question, I confess I cannot see. It may not have been designed to stand in any connection, but to be a separate piece of advice, as in the several cases which immediately follow. That the Jews were notoriously guilty of <i>common swearing</i> is allowed on all hands; and that swearing by <i>heaven, earth, Jerusalem</i>, the <i>temple</i>, the <i>altar</i>, different parts of the <i>body</i>, was not considered by them as <i>binding</i> <i>oaths</i>, has been sufficiently proved. Rabbi Akiba taught that "a man might swear with his <i>lips</i>, and annul it in his <i>heart</i>; and then the oath was not binding." <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:33">Matthew 5:33</span>, c., where the subject is considered in great detail.</p>
<p><i><b>Let your yea be yea</b></i>, c.] Do not pretend to say <i>yea</i> with your <i>lips</i>, and annul it in your <i>heart</i> let the <i>yea</i> or the <i>nay</i> which you <i>express</i> be <i>bona fide</i> such. Do not imagine that any mental reservation can cancel any such <i>expressions</i> of obligation in the sight of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest ye fall into condemnation.</b></i> — ιναμηυποκρισινπεσητε. <i>Lest ye fall under judgment</i>. Several MSS. join υπο and κρισιν together, υποκρισιν, and prefix εις, <i>into</i>, which makes a widely different reading: <i>Lest ye fall into hypocrisy</i>. Now, as it is a fact, that the Jews did teach that there might be <i>mental</i> <i>reservation</i>, that would <i>annul the oath</i>, how solemnly soever it was taken the object of St. James, if the last reading be genuine, and it is supported by a great number of excellent MSS., some <i>versions</i>, and some of the most eminent of the <i>fathers</i>, was to guard against that <i>hypocritical</i> method of taking an oath, which is subversive of all moral feeling, and must make conscience itself callous.</p>
