<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders</b></i> — This was also a Jewish maxim. Rabbi Simeon, in <i>Sepher Hachaiyim</i>, said: "What should a man do who goes to visit the sick? <i>Ans</i>. He who studies to restore the health of the body, should first lay the foundation in the health of the soul. The wise men have said, No healing is equal to that which comes from the word <i>of God</i> and <i>prayer</i>. Rabbi Phineas, the son of Chamma, hath said, 'When sickness or disease enters into a man's family, let him apply to a wise man, who will implore mercy in his behalf.'" See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>St. James very properly sends all such to the elders of the Church, who had power with God through the great Mediator, that they might pray for them.</p>
<p><i><b>Anointing him with oil</b></i> — That St. James neither means any kind of <i>incantation</i>, any kind of <i>miracle</i>, or such <i>extreme unction</i> as the Romish Church prescribes, will be sufficiently evident from these considerations:</p>
<p>1. Be was a holy man, and could prescribe nothing but what was holy. </p>
<p>2. If a <i>miracle</i> was intended, it could have been as well wrought <i>without the oil</i>, as <i>with</i> it. </p>
<p>3. It is not intimated that even this unction is to save the sick man, but the prayer of faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:15">James 5:15</span>. </p>
<p>4. What is here recommended was to be done as a natural means of restoring health, which, while they used prayer and supplication to God, they were not to neglect. </p>
<p>5. <i>Oil</i> in Judea was celebrated for its <i>sanative</i> qualities; so that they scarcely ever took a journey without carrying oil with them, (see in the case of the Samaritan,) with which they anointed their bodies, healed their wounds, bruises, c. </p>
<p>6. <i>Oil</i> was and in frequently used in the east as a means of cure in very dangerous diseases and in Egypt it is often used in the cure of the <i>plague</i>. Even in Europe it has been tried with great success in the cure of <i>dropsy</i>. And <i>pure olive oil</i> is excellent for recent wounds and bruises; and I have seen it tried in this way with the best effects. </p>
<p>7. But that it was the custom of the Jews to apply it as a means of healing, and that St. James refers to this custom, is not only evident from the case of the wounded man ministered to by the good Samaritan, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:34">Luke 10:34</span>, but from the practice of the Jewish rabbins. In <i>Midrash Koheleth</i>, fol. 73, 1, it is said: "Chanina, son of the brother of the Rabbi Joshua, went to visit his uncle at Capernaum; he was taken ill; and Rabbi Joshua went to him and <i>anointed him with oil, and he was</i> <i>restored</i>." They had, therefore, recourse to this as a <i>natural</i> remedy; and we find that the disciples used it also in this way to heal the sick, not exerting the miraculous power but in cases where natural means were ineffectual. <i>And they cast out many</i> <i>devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed</i> <i>them</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span>. On this latter place I have supposed that it might have been done <i>symbolically</i>, in order to prepare the way for a miraculous cure: this is the opinion of many commentators; but I am led, on more mature consideration, to doubt its propriety, yet dare not decide. In short, <i>anointing the sick with oil</i>, in order to their recovery, was a constant practice among the Jews. See <i>Lightfoot</i> and Wetstein on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span>. And here I am satisfied that it has no other meaning than as a <i>natural means</i> of restoring health; and that St. James desires them to use <i>natural means</i> while looking to God for an especial blessing. And no wise man would direct otherwise. </p>
<p>8. That the <i>anointing</i> recommended here by St. James cannot be such as the Romish Church prescribes, and it is on this passage principally that they found their sacrament of <i>extreme unction</i>, is evident from these considerations:</p>
<p>1. St. James orders the sick person to be <i>anointed</i> in reference to <i>his</i> <i>cure</i>; but they anoint the sick in the <i>agonies of death</i>, when there is <i>no prospect of his recovery</i>; and never administer that <i>sacrament</i>, as it is called, while there is <i>any hope of life</i>. </p>
<p>2. St James orders this <i>anointing</i> for the cure of the <i>body</i>, but they apply it for the cure of the <i>soul</i>; in reference to which use of it St. James gives no directions: and what is said of the <i>forgiveness</i> <i>of sins</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:15">James 5:15</span>, is rather to be referred to <i>faith</i> and <i>prayer</i>, which are often the means of restoring lost health, and preventing premature death, when <i>natural means</i>, the most skillfully used, have been useless.</p>
<p>3. The <i>anointing with oil</i>, if ever used as a means or <i>symbol</i> in <i>working miraculous cures</i>, was only applied in <i>some cases</i>, perhaps <i>very few</i>, if any; but the Romish Church uses it in <i>every case</i>; and makes it <i>necessary</i> to <i>the salvation</i> of every departing soul. Therefore, St. <i>James' unction</i>, and the <i>extreme unction</i> of the Romish Church, are essentially different. See below.</p>
