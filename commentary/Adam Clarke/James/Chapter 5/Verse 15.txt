<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And the prayer of faith; shall save the sick</b></i> — That is, God will often make these the means of a sick man's recovery; but there often are cases where <i>faith</i> and <i>prayer</i> are both ineffectual, because God sees it will be prejudicial to the patient's salvation to be restored; and therefore all faith and prayer on such occasions should be exerted on this ground: "If it be most for thy glory, and the eternal good of this man's soul, let him be restored; if otherwise, Lord, pardon, purify him, and take him to thy glory."</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord shall raise him up</b></i> — Not the <i>elders</i>, how faithfully and fervently soever they have prayed.</p>
<p><i><b>And if he have committed sins</b></i> — So as to have occasioned his present malady, <i>they shall be forgiven him</i>; for being the <i>cause</i> of the affliction it is natural to conclude that, if the <i>effect</i> be to cease, the <i>cause</i> must be removed. We find that in the miraculous restoration to health, under the powerful hand of Christ, the sin of the party is generally said to be <i>forgiven</i>, and this also <i>before</i> the miracle was wrought on the <i>body</i>: hence there was a maxim among the Jews, and it seems to be founded in <i>common sense</i> and <i>reason</i>, that God never restores a man miraculously to health till he has pardoned his sins; because it would be incongruous for God to exert his miraculous power in saving a <i>body</i>, the <i>soul</i> of which was in a state of condemnation to eternal death, because of the crimes it had committed against its Maker and Judge. Here then it is GOD that <i>remits the sin</i>, not in reference to the <i>unction</i>, but in reference to the <i>cure</i> of the <i>body</i>, which he is miraculously to effect.</p>
