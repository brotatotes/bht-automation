<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Confess your faults one to another</b></i> — This is a good general direction to Christians who endeavour to maintain among themselves the communion of saints. This social confession tends much to humble the soul, and to make it watchful. We naturally wish that our friends in general, and our religious friends in particular, should think well of us; and when we confess to them offences which, without this confession, they could never have known, we feel humbled, are kept from self-applause, and induced to watch unto prayer, that we may not increase our offences before God, or be obliged any more to undergo the painful humiliation of acknowledging our weakness, fickleness, or infidelity to our religious brethren.</p>
<p>It is not said, <i>Confess your faults to the</i> ELDERS <i>that they may</i> <i>forgive them</i>, or prescribe <i>penance</i> in order to forgive them. No; the members of the Church were to <i>confess their faults to each</i> <i>other</i>; therefore <i>auricular confession</i> to a priest, such as is prescribed by the Romish Church, has no foundation in this passage. Indeed, had it any foundation here it would prove more than they wish, for it would require the <i>priest</i> to <i>confess his</i> <i>sins</i> to the <i>people</i>, as well as the people to confess theirs to the priest.</p>
<p><i><b>And pray one for another</b></i> — There is no instance in <i>auricular</i> <i>confession</i> where the <i>penitent</i> and the <i>priest</i> pray together for pardon; but here the people are commanded to pray for each other that they may be healed.</p>
<p><i><b>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</b></i> — The words δεησις ενεργουμενη signify <i>energetic supplication</i>, or such a prayer as is <i>suggested</i> to the <i>soul</i> and <i>wrought in it by a</i> <i>Divine energy</i>. When God designs to do some particular work in his Church he pours out on his followers the spirit of grace and supplication; and this he does sometimes when he is about to do some especial work for an <i>individual</i>. When such a power of prayer is granted, faith should be immediately called into exercise, that the blessing may be given: the spirit of prayer is the proof that the power of God is present to heal. <i>Long prayers</i> give no particular evidence of <i>Divine inspiration</i>: the following was a maxim among the ancient Jews, שתפלת צדיקים קצדה <i>the prayers of the</i> <i>righteous are short</i>. This is exemplified in almost every instance in the Old Testament.</p>
