Verse 17. Elias was a man subject to like passions — This was Elijah, and a consistency between the names of the same persons as expressed in the Old and the New Testaments should be kept up.The word ομοιοπαθης signifies of the same constitution, a human being just as ourselves are. See the same phrase and its explanation in Acts 14:15, and the note there. There was some reason to apprehend that because Elijah was translated, that therefore he was more than human, and if so, his example could be no pattern for us; and as the design of St. James was to excite men to pray, expecting the Divine interference whenever that should be necessary, therefore he tells them that Elijah was a man like themselves, of the same constitution, liable to the same accidents, and needing the same supports.And he prayed earnestly — προσευχη προσηυξατο. He prayed with prayer; a Hebraism for, he prayed fervently.That it might not rain — See this history, 1 Kings 17:1, c.And it rained not on the earth — επι της γης. On that land, viz. the land of Judea for this drought did not extend elsewhere.Three years and six months. — This is the term mentioned by our Lord, Luke 4:25; but this is not specified in the original history. In 1 Kings 18:1, it is said, In the third year the word of the Lord came to Elijah, that is, concerning the rain; but this third year is to be computed from the time of his going to live at Zarephath, which happened many days after the drought began, as is plain from this, that he remained at the brook Cherith till it was dried up, and then went to Zarephath, in the country of Zidon; 1 Kings 17:7-9. Therefore the three years and six months must be computed from his denouncing the drought, at which time that judgment commenced. Macknight.
