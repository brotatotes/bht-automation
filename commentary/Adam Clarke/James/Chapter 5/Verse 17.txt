<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Elias was a man subject to like passions</b></i> — This was <i>Elijah</i>, and a consistency between the <i>names</i> of the same persons as expressed in the Old and the New Testaments should be kept up.</p>
<p>The word ομοιοπαθης signifies of <i>the same constitution</i>, a human being just as ourselves are. See the same phrase and its explanation in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>, and the note there. There was some reason to apprehend that because Elijah was <i>translated</i>, that therefore he was more <i>than human</i>, and if so, his example could be no pattern for us; and as the design of St. James was to excite men to pray, expecting the Divine interference whenever that should be necessary, therefore he tells them that <i>Elijah was a man</i> <i>like themselves, of the same constitution, liable to the same</i> <i>accidents</i>, and <i>needing the same supports</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And he prayed earnestly</b></i> — προσευχη προσηυξατο. <i>He prayed with</i> <i>prayer</i>; a Hebraism for, he <i>prayed fervently</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That it might not rain</b></i> — See this history, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:1">1 Kings 17:1</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>And it rained not on the earth</b></i> — επι της γης. <i>On that land</i>, viz. the land of Judea for this drought did not extend elsewhere.</p>
<p><i><b>Three years and six months.</b></i> — This is the term mentioned by our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:25">Luke 4:25</span>; but this is not specified in the original history. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:1">1 Kings 18:1</span>, it is said, <i>In the third year the word of the Lord came to Elijah,</i> that is, concerning the <i>rain</i>; but this <i>third year</i> is to be computed from the time of his going to live at Zarephath, which happened many days after the <i>drought began</i>, as is plain from this, that he remained at the <i>brook Cherith</i> till it was dried up, and then went to Zarephath, in the country of Zidon; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:7-9">1 Kings 17:7-9</span>. Therefore the <i>three years</i> and <i>six months</i> must be computed from his denouncing the drought, at which time that judgment commenced. <i>Macknight</i>.</p>
