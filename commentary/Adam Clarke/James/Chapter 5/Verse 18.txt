<p>Verse 18. <i><b>And he prayed again</b></i> â€” This <i>second</i> prayer is not mentioned in the history in express words, but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:42">1 Kings 18:42</span>, it is said, <i>He cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face</i> <i>between his knees</i>; that was probably the time of the second praying, namely, that rain might come, as this was the proper posture of prayer.</p>
