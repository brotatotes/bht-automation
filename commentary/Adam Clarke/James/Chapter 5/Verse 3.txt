<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:3">James 5:3</span>. <i><b>Your gold and silver is cankered</b></i> — Instead of helping the poor, and thus honouring God with your substance, ye have, through the principle of covetousness, kept all to yourselves.</p>
<p><i><b>The rust of them shall be a witness against you</b></i> — Your putrefied stores, your moth-eaten garments, and your tarnished coin, are so many proofs that it was not for want of property that you assisted not the poor, but through a principle of avarice; <i>loving money</i>, not for the sake of what it could procure, but for its <i>own sake</i>, which is the genuine principle of the <i>miser</i>. This was the very character given to this people by our Lord himself; he called them φιλαργυροι, <i>lovers of money</i>. Against this despicable and abominable disposition, the whole of the 12th chapter of St. Luke is levelled; but it was their easily besetting sin, and is so to the present day.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall eat your flesh as it were fire.</b></i> — This is a very bold and sublime figure. He represents the rust of their coin as becoming a canker that should produce gangrenes and phagedenous ulcers in their flesh, till it should be eaten away from their bones.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye have heaped treasure together</b></i> — This verse is variously <i>pointed</i>. The word ως, <i>like as</i>, in the preceding clause, is left out by the <i>Syriac</i>, and some others; and πυρ, <i>fire</i>, is added here from that clause; so that the whole verse reads thus: "Your gold and your silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall consume your flesh. Ye have treasured up FIRE against the last days." This is a bold and fine image: instead of the <i>treasures of corn, wine</i>, and <i>oil</i>, rich <i>stuffs</i>, with <i>silver</i> and <i>gold</i>, which ye have been laying up, ye shall find a <i>treasure</i>, a <i>magazine</i> of <i>fire</i>, that shall burn up your city, and consume even your temple. This was literally true; and these solemn denunciations of Divine wrath were most completely fulfilled. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>, where all the circumstances of this tremendous and final destruction are particularly noted.</p>
<p>By the <i>last days</i> we are not to understand the <i>day of judgment</i>, but the <i>last days</i> of the <i>Jewish commonwealth</i>, which were not long distant from the date of this epistle, whether we follow the <i>earlier</i> or <i>later</i> computation, of which enough has been spoken in the preface.</p>
