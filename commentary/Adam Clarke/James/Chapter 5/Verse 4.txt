<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:4">James 5:4</span>. <i><b>The hire of the labourers</b></i> — The law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+19:13">Leviticus 19:13</span>, had ordered: <i>The wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee</i> <i>all night until the morning</i>, every day's labour being paid for as soon as ended. This is more clearly stated in another law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+24:15">Deuteronomy 24:15</span>: <i>At his day thou shalt give him his hire; neither shall the sun go</i> <i>down upon it;-lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be</i> <i>sin unto thee</i>. And that God particularly resented this defrauding of the hireling we see from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:5">Malachi 3:5</span>: <i>I will come near to you in judgment, and will be a swift witness</i> <i>against those who oppress the hireling in his wages</i>. And on these laws and threatenings is built what we read in <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, p. 100, l. 45: "When a poor man does any work in a house, the vapour proceeding from him, through the severity of his work, ascends towards heaven. Wo to his employer if he delay to pay him his wages." To this James seems particularly to allude, when he says: <i>The cries of them who have reaped are entered into the ears</i> <i>of the Lord of hosts</i>; and the rabbins say, "The vapour arising from the sweat of the hard-worked labourer <i>ascends up before God</i>." Both images are sufficiently expressive.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord of sabaoth.</b></i> — St. James often conceives in <i>Hebrew</i> though he writes in <i>Greek</i>. It is well known that יהוה צבאות <i>Yehovah tsebaoth</i>, Lord of hosts, or Lord of armies, is a frequent appellation of God in the Old Testament; and signifies his uncontrollable power, and the infinitely numerous means he has for governing the world, and defending his followers, and punishing the wicked.</p>
