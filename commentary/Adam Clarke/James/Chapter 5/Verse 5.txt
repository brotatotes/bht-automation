Verse James 5:5. Ye have lived in pleasure — ετρυφησατε. Ye have lived luxuriously; feeding yourselves without fear, pampering the flesh.And been wanton — εσπαταλησατε. Ye have lived lasciviously. Ye have indulged all your sinful and sensual appetites to the uttermost; and your lives have been scandalous.Ye have nourished your hearts — εθρεψατε. Ye have fattened your hearts, and have rendered them incapable of feeling, as in a day of slaughter, ημεραα φαγης, a day of sacrifice, where many victims are offered at once, and where the people feast upon the sacrifices; many, no doubt, turning, on that occasion, a holy ordinance into a riotous festival.
