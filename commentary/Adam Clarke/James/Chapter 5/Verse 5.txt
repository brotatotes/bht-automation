<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:5">James 5:5</span>. <i><b>Ye have lived in pleasure</b></i> — ετρυφησατε. <i>Ye have</i> <i>lived luxuriously</i>; feeding yourselves without fear, pampering the flesh.</p>
<p><i><b>And been wanton</b></i> — εσπαταλησατε. <i>Ye have lived lasciviously</i>. Ye have indulged all your sinful and sensual appetites to the uttermost; and your lives have been scandalous.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye have nourished your hearts</b></i> — εθρεψατε. <i>Ye have fattened</i> <i>your hearts</i>, and have rendered them incapable of <i>feeling, as in a</i> <i>day of slaughter</i>, ημεραα φαγης, <i>a day of sacrifice</i>, where many victims are offered at once, and where the people feast upon the sacrifices; many, no doubt, turning, on that occasion, a holy ordinance into a riotous festival.</p>
