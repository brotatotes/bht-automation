<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Ye have condemned</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>killed the just;</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>he doth</b></i><b> </b><i><b>not resist you</b></i><i>.</i>] Several by τονδικαιον, <i>the just one</i>, understand Jesus Christ, who is so called, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:52">Acts 7:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>; but the structure of the sentence, and the connection in which it stands, seem to require that we should consider this as applying to the <i>just</i> or <i>righteous in general</i>, who were persecuted and murdered by those oppressive rich men; and their death was the consequence of their <i>dragging them before the judgment seats</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6">James 2:6</span>, where, having no influence, and none to plead their cause, they were unjustly condemned and executed.</p>
<p>And he doth not resist you. - In this, as in τονδικαιον, <i>the</i> <i>just</i>, there is an <i>enallege</i> of the <i>singular</i> for the <i>plural</i> number. And in the word ουκ αντιτασσεται, <i>he doth not resist</i>, the idea is included of <i>defence in a court of justice</i>. These poor righteous people had none to plead their cause; and if they had it would have been useless, as their oppressors had all power and all influence, and those who sat on these judgment seats were lost to all sense of justice and right. Some think that <i>he doth not</i> <i>resist you</i> should be referred to GOD; as if he had said, God permits you to go on in this way at present, but he will shortly awake to judgment, and destroy you as enemies of truth and righteousness.</p>
