<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Be patient, therefore</b></i> — Because God is coming to execute judgment on this wicked people, therefore be patient till he comes. He seems here to refer to the coming of the Lord to execute judgment on the Jewish nation, which shortly afterwards took place.</p>
<p><i><b>The husbandman waiteth</b></i> — The <i>seed</i> of your deliverance is already sown, and by and by the harvest of your salvation will take place. God's counsels will ripen in due time.</p>
<p><i><b>The early and latter rain.</b></i> — The rain of <i>seed time</i>; and the rain of ripening before <i>harvest</i>: the first fell in Judea, about the beginning of <i>November</i>, after the seed was sown; and the second towards the end of <i>April</i>, when the ears were filling, and this prepared for a full harvest. Without these two rains, the earth would have been unfruitful. These God had promised: <i>I will give</i> <i>you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and</i> <i>the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy</i> <i>wine, and thy oil</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+11:14">Deuteronomy 11:14</span>. But for these they were not only to <i>wait patiently</i>, but also to <i>pray, Ask ye of the Lord rain in the</i> <i>time of the latter rain; so shall the Lord make bright clouds, and</i> <i>give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+10:1">Zechariah 10:1</span>.</p>
