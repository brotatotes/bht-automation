<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Be ye also patient</b></i> — Wait for God's deliverance, as ye wait for his bounty in providence.</p>
<p><i><b>Stablish your hearts</b></i> — Take courage; do not sink under your trials.</p>
<p><i><b>The coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</b></i> — ηγγικε. <i>Is at hand</i>. He is already on his way to destroy this wicked people, to raze their city and temple, and to destroy their polity for ever; and this judgment will soon take place.</p>
