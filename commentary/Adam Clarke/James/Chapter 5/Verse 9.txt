<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Grudge not</b></i> — μη στεναζετε. <i>Groan not</i>; grumble not; do not murmur through impatience; and let not any ill treatment which you receive, induce you to vent your feelings in imprecations against your oppressors. Leave all this in the hands of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest ye be condemned</b></i> — By giving way to a spirit of this kind, you will get under the condemnation of the wicked.</p>
<p><i><b>The judge standeth before the door.</b></i> — His eye is upon every thing that is <i>wrong in you</i>, and every <i>wrong that is done to you</i>; and he is now entering into judgment with your oppressors.</p>
