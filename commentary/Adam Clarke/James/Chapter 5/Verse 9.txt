Verse 9. Grudge not — μη στεναζετε. Groan not; grumble not; do not murmur through impatience; and let not any ill treatment which you receive, induce you to vent your feelings in imprecations against your oppressors. Leave all this in the hands of God.Lest ye be condemned — By giving way to a spirit of this kind, you will get under the condemnation of the wicked.The judge standeth before the door. — His eye is upon every thing that is wrong in you, and every wrong that is done to you; and he is now entering into judgment with your oppressors.
