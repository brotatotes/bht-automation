<p>John's introduction is from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span>. Some harmonists suppose it to end with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. but, from the connection of the whole, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span> appears to be its natural close, at it contains a reason why the <i>Logos</i> or <i>Word was made flesh</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span> refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:6-8">John 1:6-8</span>, and in these passages John's testimony is anticipated in order of time, and is very fitly mentioned to illustrate Christ's pre-eminence. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span> have a plain reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. See Bp. Newcome.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. <i><b>In the beginning</b></i> — That is, before any thing was formed - ere God began the great work of creation. This is the meaning of the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>, to which the evangelist evidently alludes. This phrase fully proves, in the mouth of an inspired writer, that Jesus Christ was <i>no part of the creation</i>, as he existed when no part of that existed; and that consequently he is no creature, as all created nature was formed by him: for <i>without</i> <i>him was nothing made that is made</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>. Now, as what was <i>before</i> creation must be <i>eternal</i>, and as what gave <i>being</i> to all things, could not have borrowed or derived its being from <i>any</i> <i>thing</i>, therefore Jesus, who was <i>before all things</i> and who made all things, must necessarily be the ETERNAL God.</p>
<p><i><b>Was the Word</b></i> — Or, <i>existed the Logos</i>. This term should be left untranslated, for the very same reason why the names <i>Jesus</i> and <i>Christ</i> are left untranslated. The first I consider as proper an apellative of the Saviour of the world as I do either of the two last. And as it would be highly improper to say, <i>the Deliverer,</i> <i>the Anointed</i>, instead of <i>Jesus Christ</i>, so I deem it improper to say, <i>the Word</i>, instead of <i>the Logos</i>. But as every appellative of the Saviour of the world was descriptive of some <i>excellence</i> in his <i>person, nature</i>, or <i>work</i>, so the epithet Λογος, <i>Logos</i>, which signifies <i>a word spoken, speech, eloquence, doctrine, reason</i>, or <i>the faculty of reasoning</i>, is very properly applied to him, who is the <i>true light which lighteth every man who cometh into the</i> <i>world</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>; who is the fountain of all <i>wisdom</i>; who giveth <i>being, life, light, knowledge</i>, and <i>reason</i>, to all men; who is the grand Source of <i>revelation</i>, who has declared God unto mankind; who spake by the prophets, for the <i>testimony of</i> <i>Jesus is the spirit of prophecy</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>; who has illustrated life and immortality by his Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>; and who has fully made <i>manifest</i> the deep <i>mysteries</i> which lay hidden in the bosom of the invisible God from all eternity, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>.</p>
<p>The apostle does not borrow this mode of speech from the writings of <i>Plato</i>, as some have imagined: he took it from the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and from the subsequent style of the ancient Jews. It is true the <i>Platonists</i> make mention of the Logos in this way: - καθ' ὁν, αει οντα, τα γενομενα εγενετο - <i>by whom,</i> <i>eternally existing, all things were made</i>. But as <i>Plato,</i> <i>Pythagoras, Zeno</i>, and others, travelled among the Jews, and conversed with them, it is reasonable to suppose that <i>they</i> borrowed this, with many others of their most important notions and doctrines, from them.</p>
<p><i><b>And the Word was God.</b></i> — Or, <i>God was the Logos</i>: therefore no subordinate being, no <i>second</i> to the Most High, but the supreme eternal Jehovah.</p>
