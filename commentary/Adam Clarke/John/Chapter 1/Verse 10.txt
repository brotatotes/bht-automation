<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10">John 1:10</span>. <i><b>He was in the world</b></i> — From its very commencement-he governed the universe-regulated his Church-spake by his prophets-and often, as the angel or messenger of Jehovah, appeared to them, and to the patriarchs.</p>
<p><i><b>The world knew him not.</b></i> — αυτον ουκ εγνω - <i>Did not acknowledge him</i>; for the Jewish rulers <i>knew</i> well enough that he was a teacher come from God; but they did not choose to <i>acknowledge</i> him as such. Men love the world, and this love hinders them from knowing him who made it, though he made it only to make himself known. Christ, by whom all things were made, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>, and by whom all things are continually supported, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>, has way every where, is continually manifesting himself by his providence and by his grace, and yet the foolish heart of man regardeth it not! See the reason, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>.</p>
