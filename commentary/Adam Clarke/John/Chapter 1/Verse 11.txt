Verse John 1:11. He came unto his own — τα ιδια - to those of his own family, city, country:-and his own people, οιιδιοι-his own citizens, brethren, subjects.The Septuagint, Josephus, and Arrian, use these words, τα ιδιοι and οι ιδιοι, in the different senses given them above.Received him not. — Would not acknowledge him as the Messiah, nor believe in him for salvation.How very similar to this are the words of Creeshna, (an incarnation of the Supreme Being, according to the theology of the ancient Hindoos!) Addressing one of his disciples, he says: "The foolish, being unacquainted with my supreme and divine nature, as Lord of all things, despise me in this human form; trusting to the evil, diabolic, and deceitful principle within them. They are of vain hope, of vain endeavours, of vain wisdom, and void of reason; whilst men of great minds, trusting to their divine natures, discover that I am before all things, and incorruptible, and serve me with their hearts undiverted by other beings." See Bhagvat Geeta, p. 79.To receive Christ is to acknowledge him as the promised Messiah; to believe in him as the victim that bears away the sin of the world; to obey his Gospel, and to become a partaker of his holiness, without which no man, on the Gospel plan, can ever see God.
