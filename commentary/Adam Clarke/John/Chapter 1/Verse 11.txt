<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>. <i><b>He came unto his own</b></i> — τα ιδια - to those of his own <i>family, city, country:-and his own people</i>, οιιδιοι-his own <i>citizens, brethren, subjects</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Septuagint, Josephus</i>, and <i>Arrian</i>, use these words, τα ιδιοι and οι ιδιοι, in the different senses given them above.</p>
<p><i><b>Received him not.</b></i> — Would not acknowledge him as the <i>Messiah</i>, nor believe in him for salvation.</p>
<p>How very similar to this are the words of <i>Creeshna</i>, (an incarnation of the Supreme Being, according to the theology of the ancient Hindoos!) Addressing one of his disciples, he says: "The foolish, being unacquainted with my supreme and divine nature, as Lord of all things, <i>despise me in this human form</i>; trusting to the evil, diabolic, and deceitful principle within them. They are of vain hope, of vain endeavours, of vain wisdom, and void of reason; whilst men of great minds, trusting to their divine natures, discover that <i>I am before all things</i>, and incorruptible, and serve me with their hearts undiverted by other beings." See Bhagvat Geeta, p. 79.</p>
<p>To <i>receive</i> Christ is to acknowledge him as the promised <i>Messiah</i>; to believe in him as the <i>victim</i> that bears away the sin of the world; to <i>obey</i> his Gospel, and to become a partaker of his holiness, without which no man, on the Gospel plan, can ever see God.</p>
