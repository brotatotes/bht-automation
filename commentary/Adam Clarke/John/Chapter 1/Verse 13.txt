<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:13">John 1:13</span>. <i><b>Which were born, not of blood</b></i> — Who were regenerated, ουκ εξ αιματων, <i>not of bloods</i>-the union of father and mother, or of a distinguished or illustrious ancestry; for the Hebrew language makes use of the <i>plural</i> to point out the dignity or excellence of a thing: and probably by this the evangelist intended to show his countrymen, that having Abraham and Sarah for their parents would not entitle them to the blessings of the new covenant; as no man could lay claim to them, but in consequence of being born of God; therefore, neither <i>the will of the flesh</i>-any thing that the corrupt heart of man could purpose or determine in its own behalf; nor <i>the will of man</i>-any thing that <i>another</i> may be disposed to do in our behalf, can avail here; this new birth must come through the <i>will of God</i>-through; his own unlimited power and boundless mercy, prescribing salvation by Christ Jesus alone. It has been already observed that the Jews required circumcision, baptism, and sacrifice, in order to make a proselyte. They allow that the Israelites had in Egypt cast off circumcision, and were consequently out of the covenant; but at length they were circumcised, and they mingled the blood of circumcision with the blood of the paschal lamb, and from this union of <i>bloods</i> they were again made the children of God. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. This was the only way by which the Jews could be made the sons of God; but the evangelist shows them that, under the Gospel dispensation, no person could become a child of God, but by being spiritually regenerated.</p>
