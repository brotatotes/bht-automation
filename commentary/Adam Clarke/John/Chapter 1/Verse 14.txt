<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. <i><b>And the Word was made flesh</b></i> — That very person who was in the beginning-who was with God-and who was God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>, in the fulness of time became flesh-became incarnated by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the virgin. Allowing this apostle to have written by Divine inspiration, is not this verse, taken in connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>, an absolute and incontestable proof of the proper and eternal Godhead of Christ Jesus?</p>
<p><i><b>And dwelt among us</b></i> — και εσκηνωσεν εν ημιν, <i>And tabernacled among</i> <i>us</i>: the human nature which he took of the virgin, being as the <i>shrine, house</i>, or <i>temple</i>, in which his immaculate Deity condescended to dwell. The word is probably an allusion to the Divine Shechinah in the Jewish temple; and as God has represented the whole Gospel dispensation by the types and ceremonies of the old covenant, so the Shechinah in the tabernacle and temple pointed out this manifestation of God in the flesh. The word is thus used by the Jewish writers: it signifies with them a manifestation of the Divine Shechinah.</p>
<p>The original word, σκηνοω, from σκια, <i>a shadow</i>, signifies:</p>
<p>1. To build a booth, tent, or <i>temporary</i> hut, for present shelter or convenience; and does not properly signify a <i>lasting</i> habitation or dwelling place; and is therefore fitly applied to the human nature of Christ, which, like the tabernacle of old, was to be here only for a temporary residence for the eternal Divinity.</p>
<p>2. It signifies to erect such a building as was used on festival occasions, when a man invited and enjoyed the company of his friends. To this meaning of the word, which is a common one in the best Greek writers, the evangelist might allude, to point out Christ's associating his disciples with himself; living, conversing, eating, and drinking with them: so that, while they had the fullest proof of his <i>Divinity</i> by the miracles which he wrought, they had the clearest evidence of his <i>humanity</i>, by his tabernacling among, eating, drinking, and conversing with them. Concerning the various acceptations of the verb σκηνοω see Raphelius on this verse.</p>
<p>The doctrine of <i>vicarious sacrifice</i> and the <i>incarnation</i> of the Deity have prevailed among the most ancient nations in the world, and even among those which were not favoured with the letter of Divine revelation. The Hindoos believe that their god has already become <i>incarnate</i>, not less than nine times, to save the wretched race of man.</p>
<p>On this subject, <i>Creeshna</i>, an incarnation of the supreme God, according to the Hindoo theology, is represented in the <i>Bhagvat</i> <i>Geeta</i>, as thus addressing one of his disciples: "Although I am not in my nature subject to birth or decay, and am the Lord of all created beings, yet, having command over my own nature, I am made <i>evident</i> by my own power; and, as often as there is a decline of virtue and an insurrection of vice and injustice in the world, I make myself <i>evident</i>; and thus I appear from age to age, for the preservation of the just, the destruction of the wicked, and the establishment of virtue." <i>Geeta</i>, pp. 51, 52.</p>
<p>The following piece, already mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68">Luke 1:68</span>, translated from the <i>Sanscreet</i>, found on a stone, in a cave near the ancient city of <i>Gya</i> in the East Indies, is the most astonishing and important of any thing found out of the compass of the Sacred Writings, and a proper illustration of this text.</p>
<p>"The Deity, who is the Lord, the possessor of all, APPEARED in this ocean of natural beings, at the beginning of the <i>Kalee Yoog</i> (the age of contention and baseness.) He who is omnipresent, and everlastingly to be contemplated, the Supreme Being, the eternal ONE, the Divinity worthy to be adored-<i>APPEARED here, with a</i> <i>PORTION of his DIVINE NATURE</i>. Reverence be unto thee in the form of (a) <i>Bood-dha</i>! Reverence be unto the Lord of the earth! Reverence be unto thee, an INCARNATION of the Deity, and the Eternal ONE! Reverence be unto thee, O GOD! in the form of the God of mercy! the <i>dispeller</i> of PAIN and TROUBLE, the Lord of ALL things, the Deity who overcometh the sins of the <i>Kalee Yoog</i>, the guardian of the universe, the emblem of mercy towards those who serve thee! (b) <i>O'M</i>! the possessor of all things, in VITAL FORM! Thou art (c) <i>Brahma</i>, (d) <i>Veeshnoo</i>, and (e) <i>Mahesa</i>! Thou art Lord of the universe! Thou art under the form of all things, movable and immovable, the possessor of the whole! And thus I adore thee! Reverence be unto the BESTOWER of SALVATION, and the ruler of the faculties! Reverence be unto thee, the DESTROYER of the EVIL SPIRIT! O <i>Damordara</i>, (f) show me favour! I adore thee who art celebrated by a thousand names, and under various forms, in the shape of Bood-dha, the God of mercy! Be propitious, O most high God!" Asiatic Researches, vol. i. p. 284, 285.</p>
<p><i><b>We beheld his glory</b></i> — This refers to the transfiguration, at which John was present, in company with Peter and James.</p>
<p><i><b>The glory as of the only begotten</b></i> — That is, such a glory as <i>became</i>, or was <i>proper</i> to, the Son of God; for thus the particle ως should be here understood. There is also here an allusion to the manifestations of God above the ark in the tabernacle: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:22">Exodus 25:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+7:89">Numbers 7:89</span>; and this connects itself with the first clause, <i>he tabernacled</i>, or <i>fixed his tent among us</i>. While God dwelt in the tabernacle, among the Jews, the priests saw his glory; and while Jesus dwelt among men his glory was manifested in his gracious words and miraculous acts.</p>
<p><i><b>The only begotten of the Father</b></i> — That is, the only person born of a woman, whose human nature never came by the ordinary way of generation; it being a mere creation in the womb of the virgin, by the energy of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><i><b>Full of grace and truth.</b></i> — Full of favour, kindness, and mercy to men; teaching the way to the kingdom of God, with all the simplicity, plainness, dignity, and energy of <i>truth</i>.</p>

<p>(a) <i>Bood-dha</i>. The name of the Deity, as <i>author of happiness</i>.</p>
<p>(b) <i>O'M</i>. A mystic emblem of the Deity, forbidden to be pronounced but in silence. It is a syllable formed of the <i>Sanscreet</i> letters <i>a, o o</i>, which in composition coalesce, and make <i>o</i>, and the nasal consonant <i>m</i>. The first letter stands for the <i>Creator</i>, the second for the <i>Preserver</i>, and the third for the <i>Destroyer</i>. It is the same among the <i>Hindoos</i> as <i>Yehovah</i> is among the <i>Hebrews</i>.</p>
<p>(c) <i>Brahma</i>, the Deity in his <i>creative</i> quality.</p>
<p>(d) <i>Veeshnoo</i>. He <i>who filleth all space</i>: the Deity in his <i>preserving</i> quality.</p>
<p>(c) <i>Mahesa</i>. The Deity in his <i>destroying</i> quality. This is properly the Hindoo Trinity: for these three names belong to the <i>same</i> God. See the notes to the <i>Bhagvat Geeta</i>.</p>
<p>(f) <i>Damordara</i>, or <i>Darmadeve</i>, the Indian god of virtue.</p>
