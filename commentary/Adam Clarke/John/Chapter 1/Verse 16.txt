<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>. This verse should be put in place of the <i>fifteenth</i>, and the 15th inserted between the 18th and 19th, which appears to be its proper place: thus John's testimony is properly connected. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15-19">John 1:15-19</span></p>
<p><i><b>And of his fulness</b></i> — Of the plenitude of his <i>grace</i> and <i>mercy</i>, by which he made an <i>atonement</i> for sin; and of the plenitude of his <i>wisdom</i> and <i>truth</i>, by which the mysteries of heaven have been <i>revealed</i>, and the science of eternal truth <i>taught, we have all</i> <i>received</i>: all we apostles have received <i>grace</i> or <i>mercy</i> to pardon our sins, and <i>truth</i> to enable us so to <i>write</i> and <i>speak</i>, concerning these things, that those who attend to our testimony shall be unerringly directed in the way of salvation, and with us continue to receive <i>grace upon grace</i>, one blessing after another, till they are filled with all the fulness of God. I believe the above to be the meaning of the evangelist, and think it improper to distract the mind of the reader with the various translations and definitions which have been given of the phrase, <i>grace for</i> <i>grace</i>. It is only necessary to add, that John seems here to refer to the Gospel as succeeding the law: the law was certainly a dispensation both of <i>grace</i> and <i>truth</i>; for it pointed out the gracious design of God to save men by Christ Jesus; and it was at least a most expressive and well-defined <i>shadow</i> of good things to come: but the Gospel, which had now taken place, introduced that plenitude of <i>grace</i> and <i>truth</i> to the <i>whole world</i>, which the law had only <i>shadowed</i> forth to the <i>Jewish people</i>, and which they imagined should have been restrained to themselves alone. In the most gracious economy of God, one dispensation of mercy and truth is designed to make way for, and to be followed by, another and a greater: thus the law succeeded the patriarchal dispensation, and the Gospel the law; more and more of the plenitude of the grace of the Gospel becomes daily manifest to the genuine followers of Christ; and, to those who are faithful unto death, a heaven full of eternal glory will soon succeed to the grace of the Gospel. To illustrate this point more fully, the following passage in <i>Philo</i> the Jew has been adduced: "God is always sparing of his first blessings or graces, (πρωτας χαριτας,) and afterwards gives other graces <i>upon</i> them, (αντ εκεινων,) and a third sort <i>upon</i> the second, and always new ones <i>upon</i> old ones, sometimes of a different kind, and at other times of the same sort." Vol. i. p. 254, ed. Mang. In the above passage the preposition αντι <i>for</i>, is used thrice in the sense of επι, <i>upon</i>. To confirm the above interpretation Bp. Pearce produces the following quotations. Ecclus xxvi. 15: Χαρις επι χαριτι γυνη αισχυντηρα - <i>A modest woman</i> <i>is a grace upon a grace</i>, i.e. a <i>double</i> grace or blessing. <i>Euripides</i> uses the very same phrase with John, where he makes <i>Theoclymenus</i> say to <i>Helena</i>. Χαρις αντι χαριτος ελθετω, <i>May</i> <i>grace upon grace come to you</i>! Helen v. 1250. ed. Barn.</p>
