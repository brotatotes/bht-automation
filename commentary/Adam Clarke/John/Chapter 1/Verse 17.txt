<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span>. <i><b>The law was given by Moses</b></i> — Moses received the law from God, and <i>through</i> him it was given to the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span>.</p>
<p>But <i><b>grace and truth</b></i> — Which he had already mentioned, and which were to be the subject of the book which he was now writing, <i>came</i> to all mankind <i>through Jesus Christ</i>, who is the <i>mediator</i> of the <i>new</i> covenant, as Moses was of the <i>old</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>. See a fine discourse on this text by Mr. <i>Claude</i>, "Essay on the Composition of a Sermon," vol. i. p. 119, c. edit. Lond. 1788.</p>
<p>The law of Moses, however excellent in itself, was little in comparison of the Gospel: as it proceeded from the justice and holiness of God, and was intended to convict men of sin, that the way of the Gospel might be the better prepared, it was a law of <i>rigour, condemnation</i>, and <i>death</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7-8">2 Corinthians 3:7-8</span>. It was a law of <i>shadows, types</i>, and <i>figures</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>, and incapable of expiating sin by its sacrifices: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18-19">Hebrews 7:18-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11">Hebrews 10:11</span>. But Christ has brought that <i>grace</i> which is opposed to <i>condemnation</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20-21">Romans 5:20-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>; and he is himself the <i>spirit</i> and <i>substance</i> of all those <i>shadows</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Jesus Christ.</b></i> — JESUS <i>the</i> CHRIST, the <i>Messiah</i>, or <i>anointed</i> <i>prophet, priest</i>, and <i>king</i>, sent from heaven. To what has already been said on the important <i>name Jesus</i>, (See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>, and the places there referred to,) I shall add the following explanation, chiefly taken from Professor <i>Schultens</i>, who has given a better view of the <i>ideal</i> meaning of the root ישע <i>yasha</i>, than any other divine or critic.</p>
<p>He observes that this root, in its true force, meaning, and majesty, both in Hebrew and Arabic, includes the ideas of <i>amplitude, expansion</i>, and <i>space</i>, and should be translated, <i>he</i> <i>was spacious-open-ample</i>; and, particularly, <i>he possessed a</i> <i>spacious</i> or <i>extensive degree</i> or <i>rank</i>: and is applied,</p>
<p>1. To a person possessing <i>abundance of riches</i>.</p>
<p>2. To one possessing <i>abundant power</i>.</p>
<p>3. To one possessing <i>abundant</i> or <i>extensive</i> <i>knowledge</i>.</p>
<p>4. To one possessing <i>abundance of happiness, beatitude</i>, and <i>glory</i>.</p>
<p>Hence we may learn the true meaning of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span>: <i>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion - behold, thy king cometh unto</i> <i>thee; he is JUST, and having SALVATION</i>: - הושיע - he is possessed of all power to <i>enrich, strengthen, teach, enlarge</i>, and <i>raise</i> to <i>glory</i> and <i>happiness</i>, them who trust in him. Man by nature is in <i>want</i> and <i>poverty</i>: in <i>abjectness</i> and <i>weakness</i>: in <i>darkness</i> and <i>ignorance</i>: in <i>straits</i> and <i>captivity</i>: in <i>wretchedness</i> and <i>infamy</i>. His Redeemer is called ישועה JESUS - he who <i>looses,</i> <i>enlarges</i>, and <i>endows with salvation</i>.</p>
<p>1. He <i>enriches</i> man's <i>poverty</i>:</p>
<p>2. <i>strengthens</i> his <i>weakness</i>:</p>
<p>3. <i>teaches</i> his <i>ignorance</i>:</p>
<p>4. brings him out of <i>straits</i> and <i>difficulties</i>: and</p>
<p>5. raises him to <i>happiness, beatitude</i>, and <i>glory</i>.</p>
<p>And the aggregate of these is SALVATION. Hence that saying, <i>His name shall be called</i> <i>JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins</i>. See <i>Schultens</i> Origines Hebraeae, p. 15.</p>
