<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>. <i><b>No man hath seen God at any time</b></i> — Moses and others <i>heard</i> his voice, and <i>saw</i> the cloud and the fire, which were the <i>symbols</i> of his presence; but such a manifestation of God as had now taken place, in the person of Jesus Christ, had never before been exhibited to the world. It is likely that the word <i>seen</i>, here, is put for <i>known</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:32">John 3:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:6">1 John 3:6</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:11">3 John 1:11</span>; and this sense the latter clause of the verse seems to require:- <i>No man</i>, how highly soever favoured, <i>hath</i> fully <i>known God,</i> <i>at any time</i>, in any nation or age; <i>the only begotten Son</i>, (<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span></span>,) <i>who is in the bosom of the Father</i>, who was intimately acquainted with all the counsels of the Most High, <i>he hath declared him</i>, εξηγησατο, hath announced the Divine oracles unto men; for in this sense the word is used by the best Greek writers. See Kypke in loco. 1095</p>
<p><i>Lying in the bosom</i>, is spoken of in reference to the Asiatic custom of reclining while at meals; the person who was next the other was said to <i>lie in his bosom</i>; and he who had this place in reference to the master of the feast was supposed to share his peculiar regards, and so be in a state of the utmost favour and intimacy with him.</p>
