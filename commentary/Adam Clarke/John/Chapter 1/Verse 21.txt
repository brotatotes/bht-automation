<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>. <i><b>Art thou Elias?</b></i> — The scribes themselves had taught that Elijah was to come before the Messiah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:10">Matthew 17:10</span>; and this belief of theirs they supported by a literal construction of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Art thou that prophet?</b></i> — the prophet spoken of by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:18">Deuteronomy 18:18</span>. This text they had also misunderstood: for the <i>prophet</i> or <i>teacher</i> promised by Moses was no other than the Messiah himself. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22">Acts 3:22</span>. But the Jews had a tradition that Jeremiah was to return to life, and restore the pot of manna, the ark of the covenant, c., which he had hidden that the Babylonians might not get them. Besides this, they had a general expectation that all the prophets should come to life in the days of the Messiah.</p>
<p><i><b>I am not.</b></i> — I am not the prophet which <i>you</i> expect, nor <i>Elijah</i>: though he was the <i>Elijah</i> that <i>was to come</i> for in the spirit and power of that eminent prophet he came, proclaiming the necessity of reformation in Israel.
