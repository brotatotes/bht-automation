<p>Verse 26. <i><b>I baptize with water</b></i> — <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:8">Mark 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:8">Mark 1:8</span></span>. I use the common form, though I direct the baptized to a different end, viz. that they shall repent of their sins, and believe in the Messiah.</p>
<p><i><b>There standeth one among you</b></i> — That is, the person whose forerunner I am is now <i>dwelling in the land of Judea</i>, and will shortly make his appearance among you. Christ was not <i>present</i> when John spoke thus, as may be seen from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>.</p>
