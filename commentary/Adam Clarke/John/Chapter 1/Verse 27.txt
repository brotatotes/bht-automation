<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Is preferred before me</b></i> — Ὁς εμπροσθεν μου γεγονεν, <i>Who</i> <i>was before me</i>. This clause is wanting in BC*L, four others, the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Slavonic</i>, and two copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and in some of the primitive fathers. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text. It is likely that it was omitted by the above, because it was found in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:30">John 1:30</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:30">John 1:30</span> At the end of this verse, EG, and ten others, with some copies of the <i>Slavonic</i>, add, <i>He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire</i>.</p>
