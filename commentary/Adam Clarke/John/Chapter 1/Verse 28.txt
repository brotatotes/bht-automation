<p>Verse 28. <i><b>These things were done in Bethabara</b></i> â€” It is very probable that the word <i>Bethany</i> should be inserted here, instead of <i>Bethabara</i>. This reading, in the judgment of the best critics, is the genuine one. The following are the authorities by which it is supported: ABCEGHLMSX, BV, of Matthai, upwards of a hundred others, <i>Syriac, Armenian, Persic, Coptic, Slavonic, Vulgate,</i> <i>Saxon</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i>, with some of the most eminent of the primitive fathers, before the time of Origen, who is supposed to have first changed the reading. <i>Bethabara</i> signifies literally <i>the</i> <i>house of passage</i>, and is thought to be the place where the Israelites passed the river Jordan under Joshua. There was a place called <i>Bethany</i>, about two miles from Jerusalem, at the foot of the mount of Olives. But there was another of the same name, beyond Jordan, in the tribe of Reuben. It was probably of this that the evangelist speaks; and Origen, not knowing of this second Bethany, altered the reading to <i>Bethabara</i>. See <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
