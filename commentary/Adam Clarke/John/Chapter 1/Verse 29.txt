<p>Verse 29. <i><b>The next day</b></i> â€” The day after that on which the Jews had been with John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Behold the Lamb of God</b></i>, c.] This was said in allusion to what was spoken <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:7">Isaiah 53:7</span>. Jesus was the true Lamb or Sacrifice required and appointed by God, of which those offered <i>daily</i> in the tabernacle and temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:38-39">Exodus 29:38-39</span>, and especially the <i>paschal</i> lamb, were only the types and representatives. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:4-5">Exodus 12:4-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>. The <i>continual</i> morning and evening sacrifice of a lamb, under the Jewish law, was intended to point out the <i>continual</i> efficacy of the blood of atonement: for even at the throne of God, Jesus Christ is ever represented as a lamb newly slain, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. But John, pointing to Christ, calls him <i>emphatically, the Lamb of</i> <i>God</i>:-all the lambs which had been hitherto offered had been furnished by <i>men</i>: this was provided by GOD, as the only sufficient and available sacrifice for the sin of the world. In three essential respects, this lamb differed from those by which it was represented.</p>
<p>1st. It was the <i>Lamb of God</i>; the most <i>excellent</i>, and the most <i>available</i>.</p>
<p>2nd. It made an <i>atonement</i> for <i>sin</i>: it carried sin away in <i>reality</i>, the others only <i>representatively</i>.</p>
<p>3rd. It carried away the <i>sin</i> of the WORLD, whereas the other was offered only on behalf of the <i>Jewish people</i>. In <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 30, it is said, "The Messiah shall bear the sins of the Israelites." But this salvation was now to be extended to the <i>whole world</i>.</p>
