<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>. <i><b>All things were made by him</b></i> â€” That is, by this Logos. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>, GOD is said to have created all things: in this verse, <i>Christ</i> is said to have created all things: the same unerring Spirit spoke in <i>Moses</i> and in the <i>evangelists</i>: therefore <i>Christ</i> and the <i>Father</i> are ONE. To say that Christ made all things by a delegated power from God is <i>absurd</i>; because the thing is <i>impossible</i>. Creation means causing that to exist that had no previous being: this is evidently a work which can be effected only by <i>omnipotence</i>. Now, God cannot delegate his <i>omnipotence</i> to another: were this possible, he <i>to</i> whom this omnipotence was delegated would, in consequence, become GOD; and he <i>from</i> whom it was delegated would <i>cease to be such</i>: for it is impossible that there should be <i>two</i> omnipotent beings.</p>
<p>On these important passages I find that many eminently learned men differ from me: it seems they cannot be of my opinion, and I feel I cannot be of theirs. May He, who is the Light and the Truth, guide them and me into all truth!</p>
