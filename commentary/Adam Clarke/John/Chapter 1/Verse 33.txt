<p>Verse 33. <i><b>He that sent me - said unto me</b></i> â€” From this we may clearly perceive that John had a most intimate acquaintance with the Divine Being; and received not only his call and mission at first, but every subsequent direction, by <i>immediate, unequivocal</i> <i>inspiration</i>. Who is fit to proclaim Jesus, but he who has continual intercourse with God; who is constantly receiving light and life from Christ their fountain; who bears a steady, uniform testimony to Jesus, even in the presence of his enemies; and who at all times <i>abases</i> himself, that Jesus alone may be <i>magnified</i>! <i>Reformation</i> of <i>manners</i>, and <i>salvation</i> of <i>souls</i>, will accompany such a person's labours whithersoever he goeth.</p>
