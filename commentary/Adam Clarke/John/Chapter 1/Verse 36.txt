<p>Verse 36. <i><b>And looking upon Jesus</b></i> — <i>Attentively beholding</i>, εμβλεψας, from εν, <i>into</i>, and βλεπω, <i>to look </i>- to view with steadfastness and attention. He who desires to discover the glories and excellencies of this Lamb of God, must <i>thus</i> look on him. At first sight, he appears only as a man among men, and as dying in testimony to the truth, as many others have died. But, on a more attentive consideration, he appears to be no less than God manifest in the flesh, and, by his death, making an atonement for the sin of the world.</p>
<p><i><b>Behold the Lamb of God!</b></i> — By this the Baptist designed to direct the attention of his own disciples to Jesus, not only as the great sacrifice for the sin of the world, but also as the complete teacher of heavenly truth.</p>
