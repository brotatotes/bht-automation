<p>Verse 38. <i><b>What seek ye?</b></i> — These disciples might have felt some embarrassment in addressing our blessed Lord, after hearing the character which the Baptist gave of him; to remove or prevent this, he graciously accosts them, and gives them an opportunity of explaining themselves to him. Such questions, we may conceive, the blessed Jesus still puts to those who in simplicity of heart desire an acquaintance with him. A question of this nature we may profitably ask ourselves: <i>What seek ye</i>? In <i>this</i> place! In the <i>company</i> you frequent? In the <i>conversation</i> you engage in? In the <i>affairs</i> with which you are occupied? In the <i>works</i> which you perform? Do you seek the humiliation, illumination, justification, edification, or sanctification of your soul? The edification of your neighbour? The good of the Church of Christ? Or, The glory of God? Questions of this nature often put to our hearts, in the fear of God, would induce us to do many things which we now leave undone, and to leave undone many things which we now perform.</p>
<p><i><b>Rabbi</b></i> — <i>Teacher</i>. Behold the modesty of these disciples-we wish to be <i>scholars</i>, we are <i>ignorant</i>-we desire to be <i>taught</i>; we believe thou art a teacher come from God.</p>
<p><i><b>Where dwellest thou?</b></i> — That we may come and receive thy instructions.</p>
