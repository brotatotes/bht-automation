<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Come and see.</b></i> — If those who know not the salvation of God would <i>come</i> at the command of Christ, they should soon <i>see</i> that with him is the fountain of life, and in his light they should see light. Reader, if thou art seriously inquiring <i>where</i> Christ dwelleth, take the following for answer: He dwells not in the <i>tumult of worldly affairs</i>, nor in <i>profane assemblies</i>, nor in <i>worldly pleasures</i>, nor in the <i>place</i> where <i>drunkards</i> proclaim their shame, nor in <i>carelessness</i> and <i>indolence</i>. But he is found in his <i>temple</i>, wherever <i>two or three are gathered together in his</i> <i>name</i>, in <i>secret prayer</i>, in <i>self-denial</i>, in <i>fasting</i>, in <i>self-examination</i>. He also <i>dwells</i> in the <i>humble, contrite spirit</i>, in the <i>spirit of faith</i>, of <i>love</i>, of <i>forgiveness</i>, of universal <i>obedience</i>; in a word, he dwells in the <i>heaven</i> of <i>heavens</i>, whither he graciously purposes to bring thee, if thou wilt <i>come</i> and <i>learn</i> of him, and <i>receive</i> the salvation which he has bought for thee by his own blood.</p>
<p><i><b>The tenth hour</b></i> — Generally supposed to be about what we call <i>four</i> o'clock in the <i>afternoon</i>. According to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:9">John 11:9</span>, the Jews reckoned twelve hours in the day; and of course each hour of the day, thus reckoned, must have been something longer or shorter, according to the different times of the year in that climate. The <i>sixth</i> hour with them answered to our twelve o'clock, as appears from what Josephus says in his life, chap. liv. <i>That on the</i> <i>Sabbath day it was the rule for the Jews to go to dinner at the</i> <i>sixth hour</i>, (εκτη ωρα.) The Romans had the same way of reckoning twelve hours in each of their days. Hence what we meet with in Hor. lib. ii. sat. vi. l. 34: <i>ante secundam</i> signifies, as we should express it, <i>before eight o'clock</i>. And when, in lib. i. sat. vi. l. 122, he says, <i>ad quartam jaceo</i>, he means that he lay in bed <i>till ten o'clock</i>. See Bishop Pearce on this place. Dr. Macknight, however, is of opinion that the evangelist is to be understood as speaking of the Roman hour, which was ten o'clock in the morning; and as the evangelist remarks, <i>they abode with him that day</i>, it implies that there was a considerable portion of time spent with our Lord, in which, by his conversation, he removed all their scruples, and convinced them that he was the <i>Messiah</i>. But, had it been the Jewish tenth hour, it would have been useless to remark <i>their abiding with him that day</i>, as there were only <i>two</i> hours of it still remaining.
