<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>. <i><b>In him was life</b></i> — Many MSS., versions, and fathers, connect this with the preceding verse, thus: <i>All things were made</i> <i>by him, and without him was nothing made. What was made had life</i> <i>in it; but THIS LIFE was the light of men</i>. That is, though every thing he made had a principle of life in it, whether <i>vegetable,</i> <i>animal</i>, or <i>intellectual</i>, yet this, that life or animal principle in the human being, was not the <i>light</i> of men; not <i>that light</i> which could guide them to heaven, for <i>the world by wisdom knew not God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span>. Therefore, the expression, <i>in him was life</i>, is not to be understood of life <i>natural</i>, but of that life <i>eternal</i> which he revealed to the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>, to which he taught the way, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>, which he promised to believers, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:28">John 10:28</span>, which he purchased for them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:53-54">John 6:53-54</span>, which he is appointed to give them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>, and to which he will raise them up, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>, because he hath the life in himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>. All this may be proved:</p>
<p>1. From the like expressions; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:5">2 John 1:5</span>:11, <i>This is the promise that God hath given unto us, eternal life,</i> <i>and this life is in his Son</i>: whence he is styled the <i>true God and</i> <i>eternal life</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>; <i>the resurrection and the life</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>; <i>the way, the truth, and the life</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>.</p>
<p>2. From these words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:7">John 1:7</span>, <i>John came to bear witness of this light, that all might believe</i> <i>through him</i>, viz. to eternal life, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span>; for so John witnesseth, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:15">John 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>.</p>
<p>And hence it follows that this life must be <i>the light of men</i>, by giving them the knowledge of this life, and of the way leading to it. See Whitby on the place. Is there any reference here to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:20">Genesis 3:20</span>: And Adam called his wife's name Eve, חוה <i>chava</i>, ζωη, LIFE, because she was the mother of all <i>living</i>? And was not Jesus that seed of the woman that was to bruise the head of the serpent, and to give life to the world?</p>
