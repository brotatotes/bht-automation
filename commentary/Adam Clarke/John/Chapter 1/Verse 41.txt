<p>Verse 41. <i><b>Findeth his own brother Simon</b></i> â€” Every discovery of the Gospel of the Son of God produces benevolence, and leads those to whom it is made to communicate it to others. Those who find Jesus find in him a treasure of <i>wisdom</i> and <i>knowledge</i>, through which they may not only become rich themselves, but be instruments, in the hand of God, of enriching others. These disciples, having tasted the good word of Christ, were not willing to eat their bread alone, but went and invited others to partake with them. Thus the knowledge of Christ became diffused-one invited another to <i>come</i> <i>and see</i>: Jesus received all, and the number of disciples was increased, and the attentive hearers were innumerable. Every man who has been brought to an acquaintance with God should endeavour to bring, at least, <i>another</i> with him; and his first attention should be fixed upon those of his own household.</p>
