Verse 45. Nathanael — This apostle is supposed to be the same with Bartholomew, which is very likely, for these reasons1. That the evangelists who mention Bartholomew say nothing of Nathanael; and that St. John, who speaks of Nathanael, says nothing of Bartholomew.2. No notice is taken any where of Bartholomew's vocation, unless his and that of Nathanael mentioned here be the same.3. The name of Bartholomew is not a proper name; it signifies the son of Ptolomy; and Nathanael might have been his own name.4. St. John seems to rank Nathanael with the apostles, when he says that Peter and Thomas, the two sons of Zebedee, Nathanael, and two other disciples, being gone a fishing, Jesus showed himself to them, John 21:2-4.Moses in the law — See Genesis 3:16; Genesis 22:18; Genesis 49:10; Deuteronomy 18:18.And the prophets — See Isaiah 4:2; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5; Isaiah 40:10; Isaiah 53:1, c.; Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 33:14-15; Ezekiel 34:23; Ezekiel 37:24; Daniel 9:24; Micah 5:2; Zechariah 6:12; Zechariah 9:9; Zechariah 12:10.
