<p>Verse 46. <i><b>Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?</b></i> — Bp. Pearce supposes that the τι αγαθον of the evangelist has some particular force in it: for, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+33:14">Jeremiah 33:14</span>, God says, I will perform <i>that good thing</i> which I promised, c. and this, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+33:15">Jeremiah 33:15</span> is explained to mean, his causing <i>the branch of righteousness</i> (i.e. the Messiah) to grow up unto David, from whom Jesus was descended: in this view, Nathanael's question seems to imply, that not <i>Nazareth</i>, but <i>Bethlehem</i>, was to be the birth-place of the Messiah, according to what the chief priests and scribes had determined, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4-6">Matthew 2:4-6</span>. If this conjecture be not thought solid, we may suppose that Nazareth, at this time, was become so <i>abandoned</i> that no good could be expected from any of those who dwelt in it, and that its wickedness had passed into a proverb: Can any thing good be found in Nazareth? Or, that the question is illiberal, and full of national prejudice.</p>
<p><i><b>Come and see.</b></i> — He who candidly examines the evidences of the religion of Christ will infallibly become a believer. No history ever published among men has so many external and internal proofs of authenticity as this has. A man should judge of nothing by first appearances, or human prejudices. Who are they who cry out, <i>The Bible is a fable</i>? Those who have never read it, or read it only with the fixed purpose to gainsay it. I once met with a person who professed to disbelieve every tittle of the New Testament, a chapter of which, he acknowledged, he had never read. I asked him, had he ever read the <i>Old</i>? He answered, No! And yet this man had the assurance to reject the whole as an imposture! God has mercy on those whose ignorance leads them to form prejudices against the truth; but he confounds those who take them up through envy and malice, and endeavour to communicate them to others.</p>
