<p>Verse 47. <i><b>Behold an Israelite indeed</b></i> — A worthy descendant of the patriarch Jacob, who not only professes to believe in Israel's God, but who worships him in sincerity and truth, according to his light.</p>
<p><i><b>In whom is no guile!</b></i> — Deceitfulness ever has been, and still is, the deeply marked characteristic of the Jewish people.

Behold this man! and, while you see and admire, imitate his conduct.</p>
