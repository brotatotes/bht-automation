<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Whence knowest thou me?</b></i> — He was not yet acquainted with the divinity of Christ, could not conceive that he could search his heart, and therefore asks how he could acquire this knowledge of him, or who had given him that character. It is the comfort of the sincere and upright, that God knows their hearts; and it should be the terror of the deceitful and of the hypocrite, that their false dealing is ever noticed by the all-seeing eye of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Under the fig tree</b></i> — Probably engaged in prayer with God, for the speedy appearing of the salvation of Israel; and the shade of <i>this</i> <i>fig tree</i> was perhaps the <i>ordinary</i> place of retreat for this upright man. It is not <i>A fig tree</i>, but την συκην, <i>THE fig tree</i>, one particularly distinguished from the others. There are many proofs that the Jewish rabbins chose the shade of trees, and particularly the <i>fig tree</i>, to sit and study under. See many examples in <i>Schoettgen</i>. How true is the saying, The eyes of the Lord are through all the earth, beholding the evil and the good! Wheresoever we are, whatsoever we are about, may a deep conviction of this truth rest upon our hearts, <i>Thou God seest ME</i>!</p>
