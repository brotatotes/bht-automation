<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:50">John 1:50</span>. <i><b>Because I said - I saw thee</b></i>, &amp;c.] As thou hast credited my Divine mission on this simple proof, that I saw thee when and where no human eye, placed where mine was, could see thee, thy faith shall not rest merely upon this, for <i>thou shalt see greater</i> <i>things than these </i>- more numerous and express proofs of my eternal power and Godhead.</p>
