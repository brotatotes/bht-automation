<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>. <i><b>Verily, verily</b></i> — <i>Amen, amen</i>. The doubling of this word probably came from this circumstance: that it was written both in Hebrew אמן and in Greek αμην, signifying, <i>it is true</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Heaven open</b></i> — This seems to be a figurative expression:</p>
<p>1. Christ may be understood by this saying to mean, that a <i>clear</i> and <i>abundant revelation</i> of God's will should be now made unto men; that heaven itself should be <i>laid</i> as it were <i>open</i>, and all the mysteries which had been shut up and hidden in it from eternity, relative to the salvation and glorification of man; should be now fully revealed.</p>
<p>2. That by the <i>angels of God ascending and</i> <i>descending</i>, is to be understood, that a <i>perpetual intercourse</i> should now be opened between heaven and earth, through the medium of Christ, who was God manifested in the flesh. Our blessed Lord is represented in his mediatorial capacity as the <i>ambassador of</i> <i>God to men</i>; and the <i>angels ascending and descending upon the Son</i> <i>of man</i>, is a metaphor taken from the custom of despatching <i>couriers</i> or <i>messengers</i> from the prince to his ambassador in a foreign court, and from the ambassador back to the prince.</p>
<p>This metaphor will receive considerable light when compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19-20">2 Corinthians 5:19-20</span>: God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself:- <i>We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech</i> <i>you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God</i>. The whole concerns of human salvation shall be carried on, from henceforth, through the Son of man; and an incessant intercourse be established between heaven and earth. Some have illustrated this passage by the account of Jacob's vision, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+28:12">Genesis 28:12</span>. But though that vision may intimate that God had established at that time a communication between heaven and earth, through the medium of angels, yet it does not appear that our Lord's saying here has any reference to it; but that it should be understood as stated above.</p>
<p>What a glorious view does this give us of the Gospel dispensation! It is heaven opened to earth; and heaven opened on earth. The Church militant and the Church triumphant become one, and the whole heavenly family, in both, see and adore their common Lord. Neither the world nor the Church is left to the caprices of time or chance. The <i>Son of man</i> governs as he upholds all. Wherever we are praying, studying, hearing, meditating, his gracious eye is upon us. He notes our wants, our weakness, and our petitions; and his eye affects his heart. Let us be without <i>guile</i>, deeply, habitually sincere, serious, and upright; and then we may rest assured, that not only the eye, but the hand, of our Lord shall be ever upon us for good. Happy the man whose heart can rejoice in the reflection, Thou God seest me!</p>
