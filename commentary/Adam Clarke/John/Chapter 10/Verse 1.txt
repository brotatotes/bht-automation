<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>. <i><b>Verily, verily</b></i>, c.] From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:6">John 10:6</span>, we learn that this is a <i>parable</i>, i.e. a representation of heavenly things through the medium of earthly things. Some think our Lord delivered this discourse immediately after that mentioned in the preceding chapter others think it was spoken not less than three months after. The former, says Bishop Pearce, was spoken at <i>the feast of</i> <i>tabernacles</i>, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:0">John 7:0</span>, or about the end of September, and this at the feast of <i>dedication</i>, or in December. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:22">John 10:22</span>.</p>
<p>Christ, says Calmet, having declared himself to be the <i>light of</i> <i>the world</i>, which should blind some while it illuminated others, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:41">John 9:41</span>, continues his discourse, and, under the similitude of a <i>shepherd</i> and his <i>flock</i>, shows that he was about to form his Church of Jews and Gentiles, and that into it he would admit none but those who heard his voice. The unbelieving and presumptuous Jews, who despised his doctrine, are the sheep which <i>hear not the</i> <i>voice of the shepherd</i>: the proud and self-sufficient Pharisees are those who imagine they <i>see clearly</i> while they are <i>blind</i>. The <i>blind</i> who become illuminated are the <i>Gentiles</i> and <i>Jews</i> who turn from their sins and believe in Jesus.</p>
<p><i>The light of the world, the good shepherd</i>, and <i>the door</i> which leads into the sheepfold, are all to be understood as meaning <i>Jesus Christ</i>; the <i>hireling shepherds</i>, the wilfully <i>blind</i>; the <i>murderers</i> and <i>robbers</i> are the <i>false Christs, false prophets,</i> <i>scribes, Pharisees</i>, wicked <i>hireling priests</i>, and <i>ungodly ministers</i> of all sorts, whether among primitive Jews or modern Christians.</p>
<p>Our Lord introduces this discourse in a most solemn manner, <i>Verily, verily</i>!-Amen, amen!-<i>it is true, it is true</i>! - a Hebraism for, This is a most important and interesting truth; a truth of the utmost concern to mankind. At all times our Lord speaks what is infallibly true; but when he delivers any truths with this particular asseveration, it is either,</p>
<p>1. Because they are of greater importance; or,</p>
<p>2. because the mind of man is more averse from them; or,</p>
<p>3. because the small number of those who will practise them may render them incredible. <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He that entereth not by the door</b></i> â€” Christ assures us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>, that he is <i>the door</i>; whoever, therefore, enters not by Jesus Christ into the pastoral office, is no other than a thief and a robber in the sheepfold. And he enters not by Jesus Christ who <i>enters</i> with a prospect of any other interest besides that of Christ and his people. Ambition, avarice, love of ease, a desire to enjoy the conveniences of life, to be distinguished from the crowd, to promote the interests of one's family, and even the sole design of providing against want-these are all ways by which <i>thieves and robbers enter into the Church</i>. And whoever enters by any of these ways, or by simony, craft, solicitation, c. deserves no better name. Acting through motives of self-interest, and with the desire of providing for himself and his family, are innocent, yea, laudable, in a secular business but to enter into the ministerial office through motives of this kind is highly criminal before God.</p>
