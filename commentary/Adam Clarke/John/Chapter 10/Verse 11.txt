Verse John 10:11. I am the good shepherd — Whose character is the very reverse of that which has already been described. In John 10:7; John 10:9, our Lord had called himself the door of the sheep, as being the sole way to glory, and entrance into eternal life; here he changes the thought, and calls himself the shepherd, because of what he was to do for them that believe in him, in order to prepare them for eternal glory.Giveth his life for the sheep. — That is, gives up his soul as a sacrifice to save them from eternal death.Some will have the phrase here only to mean hazarding his life in order to protect others; but the 15th, 17th, and 18th verses, John 10:15; John 10:17; John 10:18, as well as the whole tenor of the new covenant, sufficiently prove that the first sense is that in which our Lord's words should be understood.
