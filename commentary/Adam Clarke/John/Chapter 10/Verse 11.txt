<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>. <i><b>I am the good shepherd</b></i> — Whose character is the very reverse of that which has already been described. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:9">John 10:9</span>, our Lord had called himself <i>the door of the sheep</i>, as being the <i>sole way</i> to glory, and <i>entrance</i> into eternal life; here he changes the thought, and calls himself <i>the shepherd</i>, because of what he was to do for them that believe in him, in order to prepare them for eternal glory.</p>
<p><i><b>Giveth his life for the sheep.</b></i> — That is, gives up his soul as a sacrifice to save them from eternal death.</p>
<p>Some will have the phrase here only to mean <i>hazarding his life</i> in order to protect others; but the 15th, 17th, and 18th verses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:15">John 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:18">John 10:18</span>, as well as the whole tenor of the new covenant, sufficiently prove that the first sense is that in which our Lord's words should be understood.</p>
