<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:12">John 10:12</span>. <i><b>But he that is a hireling</b></i> — Or, as my old MS. Bible reads it, <i>the marchaunt</i>, he who makes <i>merchandise</i> of men's souls; bartering them, and his own too, for filthy lucre. Let not the reader apply this, or any of the preceding censures, to any particular <i>class</i> or <i>order</i> of men: every religious party may have a hireling priest, or minister; and where the provision is the greatest there the danger is most.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose own the sheep are not</b></i> — A hireling priest, who has never been the instrument of bringing souls to God, will not abide with them in the time of danger or persecution. They are not the produce of his labour, faith, and prayers: he has no other interest in their welfare than that which comes from the fleece and the fat. The hireling counts the sheep his <i>own</i>, no longer than they are <i>profitable to him</i>; the good shepherd looks upon them as his, so long as he can be profitable to <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>Among the ancient Jews some kept their own flocks, others <i>hired</i> shepherds to keep them for them. And every <i>owner</i> must naturally have felt more interest in the preservation of his flock than the <i>hireling</i> could possibly feel.</p>
