<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14">John 10:14</span>. <i><b>I - know my sheep</b></i> — I know, ταεμα, them that are mine: I <i>know</i> their hearts, their wishes, their purposes, their circumstances; and I <i>approve</i> of them; for in this sense the word <i>to know</i> is often taken in the Scriptures. Homer represents the goatherds as being so well acquainted with their <i>own</i>, though mixed with others, as easily to distinguish them. </p>
