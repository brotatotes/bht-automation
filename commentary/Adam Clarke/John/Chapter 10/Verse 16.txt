<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>. <i><b>Other sheep I have</b></i> — The <i>Gentiles</i> and Samaritans. As if our Lord had said, Do not imagine that I shall lay down my life for the Jews, <i>exclusively</i> of all other people; no: I shall die also for the Gentiles; for <i>by the grace</i>, the merciful design and loving purpose <i>of God, I am to taste death for every man</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>; and, though they are not of <i>this fold</i> now, those among them that believe shall be <i>united</i> with the believing Jews, and made one fold under one shepherd, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:13-17">Ephesians 2:13-17</span>.</p>
<p>The original word, αυλη, which is here translated <i>fold</i>, dignifies properly <i>a court</i>. It is probable that our blessed Lord was now standing in what was termed the <i>inner court</i>, or <i>court of</i> <i>the people</i>, in the temple, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:23">John 10:23</span>; and that he referred to the <i>outer court</i>, or <i>court of the Gentiles</i>, because the Gentiles who were proselytes of the gate were permitted to worship in that place; but only those who were <i>circumcised</i> were permitted to come into the <i>inner court</i>, over the entrance of which were written, in large characters of gold, these words, <i>Let no uncircumcised person</i> <i>enter here</i>! Our Lord therefore might at this time have <i>pointed out</i> to the worshippers in that court, when he spoke these words, and the people would at once perceive that he meant the <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
