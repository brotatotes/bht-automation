<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span>. <i><b>Therefore doth my Father love me</b></i> â€” As I shall be shortly crucified by you, do not imagine that I am abandoned by my heavenly Father, and therefore fall thus into your hands. The <i>Father loveth me</i> particularly on this account, because I am going <i>to lay down my life</i> for the life of the world. Again, do not suppose that I shall be put to death by your rulers, because I have not strength to resist them. I LAY DOWN <i>my life</i> voluntarily and cheerfully; no one can <i>take it</i> away from me, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:18">John 10:18</span>; and I shall give you the fullest proof of my supreme power by raising, in three days, that very crucified, wounded body from the grave.</p>
