<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:20">John 10:20</span>. <i><b>He hath a devil, and is mad</b></i> â€” So, then, a <i>demoniac</i> and a <i>madman</i> were not exactly the same in the apprehension of the Jews; no more than the <i>effect</i> is the same with the <i>cause</i> which produces it. Some will have it that, when the Jews told our Lord that he had a <i>demon</i>, they meant no more than that he was <i>deranged</i>; but here these matters are evidently distinguished. They believed him to be possessed by a <i>demon</i>, who <i>deranged</i> his faculties, and that he must have been a wicked man, and a deceiver, thus to be put under the power of such a spirit.</p>
