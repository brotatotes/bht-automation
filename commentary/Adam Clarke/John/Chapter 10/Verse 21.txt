<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:21">John 10:21</span>. <i><b>These are not the words of him that hath a devil.</b></i> â€” If he were <i>deranged</i> by an <i>unclean spirit</i>, his words would bear a similitude to the spirit that produced them; but these are words of <i>deep sense, soberness</i>, and <i>piety</i>: besides, could a demoniac open the eyes of blind men? "This is not the work of a demon. Now we have seen that this man has restored a man who was born blind.

<p>Behold the usage which the blessed Lord received from his creatures! And behold with what meekness and gentleness he conducts himself!-not a word of impatience proceeds from his lips; nor a look of contempt or indignation is seen in his face. And what was he doing to merit all this? Why, he was instructing the ignorant, and telling the wretched that he was just going to die to save their souls! Amazing love of God, and ingratitude and obduracy of men! Let not the disciple suppose that, in this respect, he shall be above his master. When a minister of Christ has done his utmost to do good to his fellow creatures, let him not be surprised if he meet with nothing from many but reproaches and persecutions for his pains. The grand point is to take Jesus for an example of suffering, and to be armed with the same mind. It appears that the words spoken by the friendly Jews prevailed; and that the others were obliged to abandon the field.</p>
