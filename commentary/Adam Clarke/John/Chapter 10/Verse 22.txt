<p>Verse 22. <i><b>The feast of the dedication</b></i> — This was a feast instituted by <i>Judas Maccabeus</i>, in commemoration of his purifying the temple after it had been defiled by <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i>. This feast began on the twenty-fifth of the month <i>Cisleu</i>, (which answers to the eighteenth of our December,) and continued for eight days. When Antiochus had heard that the Jews had made great rejoicings, on account of a report that had been spread of his death, he hastened out of Egypt to Jerusalem, took the city by storm, and slew of the inhabitants in three days <i>forty thousand</i> <i>persons</i>; and <i>forty thousand</i> more he sold for <i>slaves</i> to the neighbouring nations. Not contented with this, he sacrificed a great <i>sow</i> on the altar of burnt offerings; and, broth being made by his command of some of the flesh, he sprinkled it all over the temple, that he might defile it to the uttermost. See Prideaux's Connection, vol. iii. p. 236, edit. 1725. After this, the whole of the temple service seems to have been suspended for <i>three years</i>, great dilapidations having taken place also in various parts of the buildings: see 1 Macc. 4:36, c. As <i>Judas Maccabaeus</i> not only restored the temple service, and cleansed it from pollution, c., but also <i>repaired</i> the ruins of it, the feast was called τα εγκαινια, the <i>renovation</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>It was winter.</b></i> — χειμων ην, or, it was <i>stormy</i> or <i>rainy</i> <i>weather</i>. And this is the reason, probably, why our Lord is represented as walking in Solomon's porch, or portico, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:23">John 10:23</span>. Though it certainly was in <i>winter</i> when this feast was held, yet it does not appear that the word above refers so much to the <i>time</i> of the <i>year</i> as to the <i>state</i> of the <i>weather</i>. Indeed, there was no occasion to add <i>it was winter</i>, when the feast of the dedication was mentioned, because every body knew that, as that feast was held on the twenty-fifth of the month <i>Cisleu</i>, it was in the winter season.</p>
<p>John has here omitted all that Jesus did from the time when he left Jerusalem, after the <i>feast of tabernacles</i> in <i>September</i> was ended, until the <i>feast of the dedication</i> in the <i>December</i> following: and he did it probably because he found that the other evangelists had given an account of what our Lord did in the interval. St. Luke relates what our Lord did on his way from Galilee to Jerusalem, to this feast, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11-37">Luke 17:11-37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:1-14">Luke 18:1-14</span>. Observe, likewise, that this time here mentioned was the <i>fourth</i> time (according to John's account) that Jesus went up to the <i>feasts</i> at Jerusalem in about a year: for, <i>first</i>, he went up to the feast of the <i>passover</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span>; <i>next</i> to the feast of <i>pentecost</i>, as it seems to have been, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>; <i>then</i> to the feast of <i>tabernacles</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:2">John 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:10">John 7:10</span>; and, <i>lastly</i>, to the feast of the <i>passover</i> in which he was crucified. John seems purposely to have pointed out his presence in Jerusalem at these <i>four</i> feasts, because all the other evangelists have omitted the mention of every one of them. See Bishop <i>Pearce</i>; and <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span></span>.</p>
