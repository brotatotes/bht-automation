<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Solomon's porch.</b></i> â€” By what we find in Josephus, Ant. b. xx. c. 8, s. 7, a portico built by Solomon, on the east side of the outer court of the temple, was left standing by Herod, when he rebuilt the temple. This portico was four hundred cubits long, and was left standing, probably, because of its grandeur and beauty. But when Agrippa came to Jerusalem, a few years before the destruction of the city by the Romans, and about eighty years after Herod had begun his building, (till which time what Herod had begun was not completed,) the Jews solicited Agrippa to repair this portico at his own expense, using for argument, not only that the building was growing ruinous, but that otherwise <i>eighteen</i> <i>thousand</i> workmen, who had all of them, until then, been employed in carrying on the works of the temple, would be all at once deprived of a livelihood.</p>
