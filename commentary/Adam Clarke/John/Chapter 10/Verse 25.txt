<p>Verse 25. <i><b>I told you</b></i>, c.] That is, I told you before what I tell you now again, <i>that the works which I do, bear testimony to</i> <i>me</i>. I have told you that <i>I am the light of the world: the Son of</i> <i>God: the good shepherd</i>: that I am come to <i>save </i>- to give <i>life </i>- to <i>give liberty</i>-to <i>redeem</i> you: that, in order to this, I must <i>die</i>, and <i>rise</i> again and that I am absolute <i>master</i> of my <i>life</i>, and of my <i>death</i>. Have you not noticed my <i>omniscience</i>, in searching and discovering the very secrets of your hearts? Have you not seen my <i>omnipotence</i> in the miracles which I have wrought? Have not all these been sufficient to convince you? - and yet ye will not believe!-See the works which bore testimony to him, as the Messiah, enumerated, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span>.</p>
