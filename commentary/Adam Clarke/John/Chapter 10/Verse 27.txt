<p>Verse 27. <i><b>My sheep hear my voice</b></i> â€” But ye <i>will</i> not hear:- <i>my sheep</i> <i>follow me</i>; but ye will neither follow nor acknowledge me. Any person who reads without prejudice may easily see, that our Lord does not at all insinuate that these persons <i>could not</i> believe, because God had made it <i>impossible</i> to them; but simply because they <i>did not hear and follow Christ</i>, which the whole of our blessed Lord's discourse proves that <i>they might have done</i>. The sheep of Christ are not those who are included in any eternal decree, to the <i>exclusion of others</i> from the yearnings of the bowels of eternal mercy; but they are those who <i>hear, believe in,</i> <i>follow</i>, and <i>obey the Saviour</i> of the world.</p>
