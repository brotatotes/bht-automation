<p>Verse 28. <i><b>They shall never perish</b></i> â€” Why? Because they <i>hear</i> my voice, and <i>follow</i> me; therefore I <i>know</i>, I approve of and love them, <i>and give them eternal life</i>. They who <i>continue</i> to hear Christ's voice, and to follow him, shall never perish. They give themselves up to God-believe so on Jesus that he <i>lives in their</i> <i>hearts: God hath given unto them eternal life, and this life is in</i> <i>his Son; and he that hath the Son hath life</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:11-12">1 John 5:11-12</span>. Now it is evident that only those who have Christ living in and governing their souls, so that they possess the mind that was in him, are <i>his sheep</i>-are <i>those that shall never perish</i>, because they have this eternal life abiding in them: therefore to talk of a man's being <i>one of the elect</i>-one that shall never perish - one who shall have eternal life-who shall never be plucked out of the hand of God, &amp;c., while he lives in sin, has no Christ in his heart, has either <i>never received</i> or <i>fallen away</i> from the <i>grace</i> of God, is as contrary to common sense as it is to the nature and testimonies of the Most High. Final perseverance implies final faithfulness-he that endures to the end shall be saved-he that is faithful unto death shall have a crown of life. And will any man attempt to say that he who does <i>not endure</i> to the end, and <i>is unfaithful</i>, shall ever enter into life?</p>
