<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:3">John 10:3</span>. <i><b>To him the porter openeth</b></i> — Sir Isaac Newton observes that our Lord being near the temple, where sheep were kept in folds to be sold for sacrifices, spoke many things parabolically of sheep, of their shepherds, and of the door to the sheepfold; and discovers that he alluded to the sheepfolds which were to be hired in the market place, by speaking of such folds as a thief could not enter by the door, nor the shepherd himself open, but a porter opened to the shepherd. In the porter opening the door to the true shepherd, we may discover the <i>second</i> mark of a true minister-his labour is crowned with <i>success</i>. The Holy Spirit <i>opens</i> his way into the hearts of his hearers, and he becomes the instrument of their salvation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:3">Colossians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The sheep hear his voice</b></i> — A <i>third</i> mark of a good shepherd is that he speaks so as to <i>instruct</i> the people - <i>the sheep hear HIS</i> <i>voice</i>; he does not take the <i>fat</i> and the <i>fleece</i>, and leave another <i>hireling</i> on less pay to do the work of the pastoral office. No: himself preaches Christ Jesus the Lord, and in that simplicity too, that is best calculated to instruct the common people. A man who preaches in such a language as the people cannot comprehend may do for a stage-player or a mountebank, but not for a minister of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>He calleth his own sheep by name</b></i> — A <i>fourth</i> mark of a good pastor is that he is well acquainted with his flock; he knows them by name - he takes care to acquaint himself with the spiritual states of all those that are entrusted to him. He speaks to them concerning their souls, and thus getting a thorough knowledge of their state he is the better qualified to profit them by his public ministrations. He who has not a proper acquaintance with the Church of Christ, can never by his preaching build it up in its most holy faith.</p>
<p><i><b>And leadeth them out.</b></i> — A <i>fifth</i> mark of a good shepherd is, he <i>leads</i> the flock, does not <i>lord</i> it over God's heritage; nor attempts by any <i>rigorous discipline</i> not founded on the Gospel of Christ, to <i>drive</i> men <i>into</i> the way of life; nor drive them <i>out</i> of it, which many do, by a severity which is a disgrace to the <i>mild</i> Gospel of the God of peace and love.</p>
<p><i>He leads them out</i> of themselves to Christ, <i>out</i> of the follies, diversions, and amusements of the world, into the path of Christian holiness: in a word, he leads them, by those gentle yet powerful persuasions that flow from a heart full of the word and love of Christ, into the kingdom and glory of his God.</p>
