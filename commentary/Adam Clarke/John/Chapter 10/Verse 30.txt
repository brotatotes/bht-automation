<p>Verse 30. <i><b>I and my Father are one.</b></i> — If Jesus Christ were not God, could he have said these words without being guilty of blasphemy? It is worthy of remark that Christ does not say, <i>I and</i> <i>MY Father</i>, which <i>my</i> our translation very improperly supplies, and which in this place would have conveyed a widely different meaning: for then it would imply that the <i>human</i> nature of Christ, of which <i>alone</i>, I conceive, God is ever said to be the Father in Scripture, was <i>equal</i> to <i>the Most High</i>: but he says, speaking then <i>as God over all, I and THE Father</i>, εγω και ὁ πατηρ ἑν εσμεν - the Creator of all things, the Judge of all men, the Father of the spirits of all flesh - <i>are</i> ONE, ONE in <i>nature</i>, ONE in all the <i>attributes</i> of <i>Godhead</i>, and ONE in all the <i>operations</i> of those <i>attributes</i>: and so it is evident the Jews understood him.
