<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Many good works have I showed you</b></i> â€” I have healed your sick, delivered those of you who were possessed from the power of demons; I have fed multitudes of your poor, and I have taught you in all places, at all times, without expense, with patience; and is this my reward?</p>
<p>To <i>show good works</i> or <i>good things</i> is a Hebraism, which signifies to <i>do</i> them <i>really</i>, to <i>give</i> good things <i>liberally</i>. The phrase is similar to the following: <i>Who will SHOW us</i> any <i>good</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+4:6">Psalms 4:6</span>; i.e. who shall <i>give</i> us good things. SHOW <i>us thy mercy</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+85:7">Psalms 85:7</span>; i.e. <i>give</i> us to <i>feel</i> the effects of thy mercy. <i>Thou hast SHOWED</i> <i>thy people hard things</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+60:3">Psalms 60:3</span>; i.e. thou hast <i>treated</i> them with <i>rigour</i>. <i>Thou hast SHOWED me great and sore</i> <i>troubles</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+71:20">Psalms 71:20</span>; i.e. thou hast <i>exposed</i> me to terrible <i>hardships</i>.</p>
