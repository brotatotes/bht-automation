Verse 32. Many good works have I showed you â€” I have healed your sick, delivered those of you who were possessed from the power of demons; I have fed multitudes of your poor, and I have taught you in all places, at all times, without expense, with patience; and is this my reward?To show good works or good things is a Hebraism, which signifies to do them really, to give good things liberally. The phrase is similar to the following: Who will SHOW us any good? Psalms 4:6; i.e. who shall give us good things. SHOW us thy mercy, Psalms 85:7; i.e. give us to feel the effects of thy mercy. Thou hast SHOWED thy people hard things, Psalms 60:3; i.e. thou hast treated them with rigour. Thou hast SHOWED me great and sore troubles, Psalms 71:20; i.e. thou hast exposed me to terrible hardships.
