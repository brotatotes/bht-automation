<p>Verse 33. <i><b>But for blasphemy</b></i> — I have elsewhere shown that the original word, βλασφημειν, when applied to men, signifies <i>to speak</i> <i>injuriously</i> of their persons, character, connections, c. but when applied to God it signifies <i>to speak impiously</i>, i.e. contrary to his nature, perfections, the wisdom of his providence, or goodness of his works.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou, being a man</b></i> — That is, only a man - <i>makest thyself God</i>. When Christ said before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:30">John 10:30</span>, <i>I and the Father are one</i>, had the Jews understood him (as many called Christians profess to do) as only saying he had a <i>unity of</i> <i>sentiments</i> with the Father, they would not have attempted to treat him for this as a blasphemer; because in this sense Abraham, Isaac, Moses, David, and all the prophets, were <i>one</i> with God. But what irritated them so much was that they understood him as speaking of a <i>unity of nature</i>. Therefore they say here, <i>thou</i> <i>makest thyself God</i>; which word they understood, not in a figurative, metaphorical, or improper sense, but in the most literal meaning of the term.</p>
