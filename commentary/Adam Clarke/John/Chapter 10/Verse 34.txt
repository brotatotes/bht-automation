<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Is it not written in your law</b></i> — The words which our Lord quotes are taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:6">Psalms 82:6</span>, which shows that, under the word <i>law</i>, our Lord comprised the Jewish <i>sacred writings</i> in general. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:25">John 15:25</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye are gods?</b></i> — That is, <i>judges</i>, who are called אלהים <i>elohim</i>. That judges are here meant appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:2">Psalms 82:2</span>, &amp;c., and also from what follows here. And this is probably the only place where the word אלהים is applied to any but the true God. See <i>Parkhurst</i> under the root אלה.</p>
