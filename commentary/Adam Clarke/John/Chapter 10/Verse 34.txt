Verse 34. Is it not written in your law — The words which our Lord quotes are taken from Psalms 82:6, which shows that, under the word law, our Lord comprised the Jewish sacred writings in general. See also John 12:34; John 15:25.Ye are gods? — That is, judges, who are called אלהים elohim. That judges are here meant appears from Psalms 82:2, &c., and also from what follows here. And this is probably the only place where the word אלהים is applied to any but the true God. See Parkhurst under the root אלה.
