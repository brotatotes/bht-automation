<p>Verse 35. <i><b>Unto whom the word of God came</b></i> — Bishop Pearce thinks that "the word λογος, here, is put for λογος κρισεως, <i>the word</i> or <i>matter of judgment</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+19:6">2 Chronicles 19:6</span>, where Jehoshaphat, setting up judges in the land of Judah, says: <i>Take heed what ye do: judge</i> <i>not for men, but for the Lord, who is with you in judgment </i>- λογοι της κρισεως, <i>in the words</i> or <i>matters of judgment</i>, - SEPT., which is nearly according to the Hebrew to בדבר משפט <i>bedebar mishpat</i>, in the word or matter of judgment. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:17">Deuteronomy 1:17</span>, when a charge is given to the judges that they should not be <i>afraid of the face of</i> <i>man</i>, this reason is given: <i>for the judgment is God's</i>. Hence it appears probable that λογος is here used for λογος κρισεως: and it is called λογος Θεου, because it is <i>the judgment</i> that properly belongs to <i>God</i>, and which they who give it on earth give only as acting in the stead of God. A way of speaking very like to this is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:13">Hebrews 4:13</span>, where the writer says, προς ὁν ἡμιν ὁ λογος, <i>with whom we have to do</i>, i.e. by whom we are to be judged."</p>
<p>But the words λογος Θεου may be here understood for the <i>order,</i> <i>commission</i>, or <i>command of God</i>; and so it properly signifies, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>; and in this sense it is found often employed in the Old Testament. When it is there said that <i>the word of the Lord came</i>, c., it means, God gave an <i>order, commission</i>, c., to such a person, to <i>declare</i> or <i>do</i> such and such things.</p>
<p><i><b>And the scripture cannot be broken</b></i> — αυθηναι, <i>dissolved</i>, rendered of none effect, i.e. it cannot be gainsayed or set aside every man must believe this, because it is the declaration of God. If those were termed gods who were only <i>earthly magistrates,</i> <i>fallible</i> mortals, and had no <i>particular</i> influence of the <i>Divine</i> <i>Spirit</i> and that they are termed gods is evident from that scripture which cannot be gainsayed; what greater reason then have I to say, <i>I am the Son of God</i>, and <i>one with God</i>, when, as <i>Messiah</i>, I have been <i>consecrated</i>, sent into the world, to instruct and save men; and when, as <i>God</i>, I have wrought miracles which could be performed by no power less than that of omnipotence?</p>
