<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Believe the works</b></i> â€” Though ye do not now credit what I have said to you, yet consider my works, and then ye will see that these works prove that <i>I am in the Father and the Father in me</i>; and, consequently, that <i>I and the Father are one</i>. This seems to be the force of our Lord's argument; and every man must see and feel that it is conclusive. There was no possibility of weakening the force of this reasoning but by asserting that these miracles were not wrought by the power of God; and then they must have <i>proved</i> that not only <i>a man</i>, but a <i>bad man</i>, such as they said Jesus was, could work these miracles. As this was impossible, then the argument of Christ had a complete triumph.</p>
