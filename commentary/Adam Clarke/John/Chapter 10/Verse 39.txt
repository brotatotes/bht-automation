<p>Verse 39. <i><b>They sought again to take him</b></i> — They could not reply to his <i>arguments</i> but by <i>stones</i>. The evidence of the truth could not be resisted; and they endeavoured to destroy the person who spoke it. Truth may confound the obstinately wicked, but it does not convert them; and it is a just judgment of God, to leave those to perish in their gainsayings who <i>obstinately continue</i> to gainsay and disbelieve.</p>
<p><i><b>But he escaped</b></i> — In such a way as we know not, for the evangelist has not specified the manner of it.</p>
