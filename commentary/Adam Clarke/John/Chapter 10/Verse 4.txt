<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:4">John 10:4</span>. <i><b>He goeth before them</b></i> â€” A <i>sixth</i> mark of a true pastor is, he gives them a good example: he not only <i>preaches</i>, but he <i>lives</i>, the truth of the Gospel; he enters into the depths of the salvation of God; and, having thus explored the path, he knows how to lead those who are entrusted to his care into the fulness of the blessings of the Gospel of peace. He who does not endeavour to realize in his own soul the truths which he preaches to others will soon be as salt without its savour; his preaching cannot be accompanied with that unction which alone can make it acceptable and profitable to those whose hearts are right with God. The minister who is in this state of salvation <i>the sheep</i>, genuine Christians, <i>will follow, for they know his voice</i>. It was the custom in the eastern countries for the shepherd to go at the head of his sheep, and they <i>followed</i> him from pasture to pasture. I have seen many hundreds of sheep thus following their shepherd on the extensive downs in the western parts of England.</p>
