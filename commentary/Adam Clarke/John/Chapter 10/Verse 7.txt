<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>. <i><b>I am the door of the sheep.</b></i> â€” It is through me only that a man can have a lawful entrance into the ministry; and it is through me alone that mankind can be saved. Instead of, <i>I am the</i> <i>door</i>, the <i>Sahidic</i> version reads, <i>I am the shepherd</i>; but this reading is found in no other version, nor in any MS. It is evidently a mistake of the scribe.</p>
