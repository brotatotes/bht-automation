<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:8">John 10:8</span>. <i><b>All that ever came before me</b></i> — Or, as some translate, <i>all that came instead of me</i>, προ εμου, i.e. all that came as <i>the</i> <i>Christ</i>, or Messiah, such as <i>Theudas</i>, and <i>Judas</i> the <i>Gaulonite</i>, who are mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:36-37">Acts 5:36-37</span>; and who were indeed no other than <i>thieves</i>, plundering the country wherever they came; and <i>murderers</i>, not only slaying the simple people who resisted them, but leading the multitudes of their followers to the slaughter.</p>
<p>But our Lord probably refers to the <i>scribes and Pharisees</i>, who pretended to show the way of salvation to the people-who in fact stole into the fold, and clothed themselves with the fleece, and devoured the sheep.</p>
<p>The words, προεμου, <i>before me</i>, are wanting in EGMS, Mt. BKV, <i>seventy</i> others; <i>Syriac, Persic, Syriac Hieros., Gothic, Saxon,</i> <i>Vulgate, eleven</i> copies of the <i>Itala; Basil, Cyril, Chrysostom,</i> <i>Theophylact, Euthymius, Augustin</i>, and some others. <i>Griesbach</i> has left them in the text with a note of doubtfulness. The reason thy these words are wanting in so many respectable MSS., versions, and fathers, is probably that given by <i>Theophylact</i>, who says that the Manicheans inferred from these words that all the Jewish prophets were impostors. But our Lord has borne sufficient testimony to <i>their</i> inspiration in a variety of places.</p>
<p>κλεπτης, and ληστης, the thief and the robber, should be properly distinguished; one takes by <i>cunning</i> and <i>stealth</i>; the other <i>openly</i> and by <i>violence</i>. It would not be difficult to find bad ministers who answer to both these characters. Tithes have been often enforced and collected in a most exceptionable manner, and in a most disgraceful spirit.</p>
<p>The reflection of pious Quesnel on this verse is well worth attention. A pastor ought to remember that whoever boasts of being the <i>way</i> of salvation, and the <i>gate</i> of heaven, shows himself to be a <i>thief</i> and an <i>impostor</i>; and though few are arrived at this degree of folly, yet there are many who rely too much upon their own <i>talents, eloquence</i>, and <i>labours</i>, as if the salvation of the sheep depended necessarily thereon: in which respect they are always <i>robbers</i>, since they rob the grace of Christ of the glory of saving the sheep. God often puts such pastors to shame, by not opening the hearts of the people to receive their word: while he blesses those who are humble, in causing them to be heard with attention, and accompanying their preaching with an unction which converts and saves souls. Let every man know that in this respect his <i>sufficiency</i> and <i>success</i> are of the Lord.</p>
