<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:9">John 10:9</span>. <i><b>I am the door: by me if any man enter</b></i>, c.] Those who come for salvation to God, through Christ, <i>shall</i> obtain it: <i>he</i> <i>shall be saved</i>-he shall have his sins blotted out, his soul purified, and himself preserved unto eternal life. This the scribes and Pharisees could neither promise nor impart.</p>
<p><i><b>Go in and out</b></i> â€” This phrase, in the style of the Hebrews, points out all the actions of a man's life, and the liberty he has of acting, or not acting. A good shepherd conducts his flock to the fields where good pasturage is to be found watches over them while there, and brings them back again and secures them in the fold. So he that is taught and called of God feeds the flock of Christ with those truths of his word of grace which nourish them unto eternal life; and God blesses together both the shepherd and the sheep, so that <i>going out</i> and <i>coming in</i> they find pasture: every occurrence is made useful to <i>them</i>; and all things work together for their good.</p>
