Verse John 11:11. Lazarus sleepeth â€” It was very common among the Jews to express death by sleep; and the expression, falling asleep - sleeping with their fathers, &c., were in great use among them. The Hebrews probably used this form of speech to signify their belief in the immortality of the soul, and the resurrection of the body.It is certain that our Lord received no intimation of Lazarus's death from any person, and that he knew it through that power by which he knows all things.
