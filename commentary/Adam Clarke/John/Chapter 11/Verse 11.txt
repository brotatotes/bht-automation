<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span>. <i><b>Lazarus sleepeth</b></i> â€” It was very common among the Jews to express <i>death</i> by <i>sleep</i>; and the expression, <i>falling</i> <i>asleep - sleeping with their fathers</i>, &amp;c., were in great use among them. The Hebrews probably used this form of speech to signify their belief in the <i>immortality</i> of the <i>soul</i>, and the <i>resurrection</i> of the <i>body</i>.</p>
<p>It is certain that our Lord received no intimation of Lazarus's death from any person, and that he knew it through that power by which he knows all things.</p>
