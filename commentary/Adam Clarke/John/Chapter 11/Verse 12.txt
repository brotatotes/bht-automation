<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:12">John 11:12</span>. <i><b>If he sleep, he shall do well.</b></i> — That is, <i>if he sleep</i> <i>only</i>, c. Though the word sleep frequently meant death, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:18">1 Corinthians 15:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>), yet, as it was an ambiguous term, the disciples appear here to have mistaken its meaning. Because, in certain acute disorders, the composing the patient to rest was a favourable sign; therefore the words, <i>If he sleep, he</i> <i>shall do well</i>, or <i>recover</i>, became a proverbial forth of speech among the Jews. In most diseases, sleep is a very favourable prognostic: hence that saying of Menander: -</p>
<p>Ὑπνος δε πασης εϚιν ὑγιεια νοσου.</p>
<p><i>Sleep is a remedy for every disease</i>.</p>
<p>See <i>Grotius</i> here. The meaning of the disciples seems to have been this: There can be no need for thee to go into Judea to awake our friend Lazarus; he will awake time enough, and his very sleep is a presage of his recovery: therefore do not hazard thy life by going.</p>
