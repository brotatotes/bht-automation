<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:15">John 11:15</span>. <i><b>I am glad for your sakes that I was not there</b></i> â€” "I tell you plainly, Lazarus is dead: and I am glad I was not there - if I had been, I should have been prevailed on to have healed him almost as soon as he fell sick, and I should not have had so striking an occasion to manifest the glory of God to you, and to establish you in the faith." It was a miracle to <i>discover</i> that Lazarus was dead, as no person had come to announce it. It was a <i>greater</i> miracle to <i>raise</i> a <i>dead man</i> than to <i>cure</i> a <i>sick</i> <i>man</i>. And it was a <i>still greater</i> miracle, to raise one that was <i>three</i> or <i>four days</i> buried, and in whose body <i>putrefaction</i> might have begun to take place, than to raise one that was but <i>newly</i> dead.
