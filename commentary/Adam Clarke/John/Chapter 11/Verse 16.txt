<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:16">John 11:16</span>. <i><b>Thomas, which is called Didymus</b></i> — <i>Thomas</i>, or תאום <i>Thaom</i>, was his <i>Hebrew</i> name, and signifies a <i>twin </i>- one who had a brother or a sister born with him at the same time: <i>Didymus</i>, διδυμος, is a literal translation of the Hebrew word into <i>Greek</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:24">Genesis 25:24</span>, <i>Esau</i> and <i>Jacob</i> are called תומים <i>thomeem, twins</i>; Septuag. διδυμα, from διδυμος, <i>a twin </i>- from the Anglo-Saxon [A.S.], <i>to</i> <i>double</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Let us also go, that we may die with him.</b></i> — That is, "Seeing we cannot dissuade our Lord from going, and his death is likely to be the inevitable consequence, let us give him the fullest proof we can of our love, by going and suffering death with him." Some think Thomas spoke these words <i>peevishly</i>, and that they should be translated thus, <i>Must we also go, and expose ourselves to</i> <i>destruction with him</i>? which is as much as to say: "If he will obstinately go and risk his life in so imminent a danger, let us act with more prudence and caution." But I think the first sense is to be preferred. When a matter is spoken which concerns the moral character of a person, and which may be understood in a good and a bad sense, that sense which is most favourable to the person should certainly be adopted. This is taking things by the best handle, and both justice and mercy require it. The conduct of most men widely differs from this: of such an old proverb says, "They feed like the <i>flies </i>- pass over all a man's <i>whole</i> parts, to light upon his <i>sores</i>."</p>
