<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:17">John 11:17</span>. <i><b>He had</b></i><b> lain </b><i><b>in the grave four days already.</b></i> â€” Our Lord probably left <i>Bethabara</i> the day, or the day after, Lazarus died. He came to <i>Bethany</i> three days after; and it appears that Lazarus had been buried about four days, and consequently that he had been put in the grave the day or day after he died. Though it was the Jewish custom to embalm their dead, yet we find, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:39">John 11:39</span>, that he had not been embalmed; and God wisely ordered this, that the miracle might appear the more striking.</p>
