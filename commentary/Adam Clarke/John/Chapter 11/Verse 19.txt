<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:19">John 11:19</span>. <i><b>Many of the Jews came</b></i> â€” Bethany being so nigh to Jerusalem, many of the relatives and friends of the family came, according to the Jewish custom, to mourn with the afflicted sisters. Mourning, among the Jews, lasted about <i>thirty</i> days: the <i>three</i> first days were termed days of <i>weeping</i>: then followed <i>seven</i> of lamentation. During the <i>three</i> days, the mourner did no servile work; and, if any one saluted him, he did not return the salutation. During the <i>seven</i> days, he did no servile work, except in private-lay with his bed on the floor - did not put on his sandals-did not wash nor anoint himself - had his head covered-and neither read in the <i>law</i>, the <i>Mishnah</i>, nor the <i>Talmud</i>. All the <i>thirty</i> days he continued unshaven, wore no white or new clothes, and did not sew up the rents which he had made in his garments. See <i>Lightfoot</i>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:31">John 11:31</span>.</p>
