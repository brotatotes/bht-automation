<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:2">John 11:2</span>. <i><b>It was</b></i><b> that </b><i><b>Mary which anointed</b></i> — There is much disagreement between learned men relative to the two anointings of our Lord, and the persons who performed these acts. The various conjectures concerning these points the reader will find in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:7">Matthew 26:7</span>, c., but particularly at the end of that chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:7- :">Matthew 26:7- :</span></p>
<p>Dr. Lightfoot inquires, Why should Bethany be called the town of Martha and Mary, and not of Lazarus? And he thinks the reason is, that Martha and Mary had been well known by that <i>anointing</i> of our Lord, which is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37">Luke 7:37</span> (see the note there;) but the name of Lazarus had not been mentioned till now, there being no transaction by which he could properly be brought into view. He therefore thinks that the <i>aorist</i> αλειψασα, which we translate <i>anointed</i>, should have its full force, and be translated, who <i>had</i> <i>formerly anointed</i>; and this he thinks to have been the reason of that familiarity which subsisted between our Lord and this family; and, on this ground, they could confidently send for our Lord when Lazarus fell sick. This seems a very reasonable conjecture; and it is very likely that the familiarity arose out of the anointing.</p>
<p>Others think that the anointing of which the evangelist speaks is that mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>, &amp;c., and which happened about six days before the passover. St. John, therefore, is supposed to <i>anticipate</i> the account, because it served more particularly to designate the person of whom he was speaking.</p>
