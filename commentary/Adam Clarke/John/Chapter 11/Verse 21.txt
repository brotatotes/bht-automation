<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:21">John 11:21</span>. <i><b>If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</b></i> â€” Mary said the same words to him a little after, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:32">John 11:32</span>, which proves that these sisters had not a complete knowledge of the omnipotence of Christ: they thought he could cure at hand, but not at a distance; or they thought that it was because he did <i>not know</i> of their brother's indisposition that he permitted him to die. In either of these cases it plainly appears they had not a proper notion of his <i>divinity</i>; and indeed the following verse proves that they considered him in no other light than that of a prophet. Query - Was it not proper that Christ should, in general, as much as might be, hide the knowledge of his divinity from those with whom he ordinarily <i>lodged</i>? Had they known him fully, would not the <i>reverence</i> and <i>awe</i> connected with such a knowledge have overwhelmed them?</p>
