<p>Verse 24. <i><b>I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection</b></i> â€” The doctrine of the <i>resurrection of the dead</i> was then commonly received; and though it was our Lord who fully <i>exemplified</i> it by his own resurrection, yet the opinion was common, not only among God's people, but among all those who believed in the God of Israel. The Jewish writings after the captivity are full of this doctrine. See 2 Macc. 7:9, 14, 23, 36; 12:43; 14:46; Wisd. 5:1, 7, 17; 6:6, 7. See also <i>Josephus</i> and the <i>Targums, passim</i>.</p>
