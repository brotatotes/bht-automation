<p>Verse 25. <i><b>I am the resurrection, and the life</b></i> — Thou sayest that thy brother shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day; but by whom shall he arise if not by ME, who am the author of the resurrection, and the source of life? And is it not as easy for me to raise him <i>now</i> as to raise him <i>then</i>? Thus our blessed Lord raises her hope, animates her faith, and teaches her that he was not a mere man, but the essential principle and author of existence.</p>
<p><i><b>Though he were dead</b></i> — Every man who has believed or shall believe in me, though his believing shall not prevent him from dying a natural death, yet his body shall be re-animated, and he shall live with me in an eternal glory. And every one who is <i>now</i> dead, dead to God, dead in trespasses and sins, if he believe in me, trust on me as his sole Saviour, <i>he shall live</i>, shall be quickened by my Spirit, and live a life of faith, working by love.</p>
