<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Shall never die.</b></i> — Or, <i>Shall not die for ever</i>. Though he die a temporal death. he shall not continue under its power for ever; but shall have a resurrection to life eternal.</p>
<p><i><b>Believest thou this?</b></i> — God has determined to work in the behalf of men only in proportion to their <i>faith</i> in him: it was necessary, therefore, that these persons should be well instructed concerning his nature, that they might find no obstacles to their faith. These sisters had considered him only as a prophet hitherto; and it was necessary that they should now be farther instructed, that, as God was to exert himself, they might believe that God was there.</p>
