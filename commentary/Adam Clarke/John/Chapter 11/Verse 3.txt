<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:3">John 11:3</span>. <i><b>He whom thou lovest is sick.</b></i> â€” Nothing could be more <i>simple</i>, nor more <i>modest</i>, than this prayer: they do not say, Come and heal him: or, Command the disease to depart even where thou art, and it will obey thee: - they content themselves with simply stating the case, and using an <i>indirect</i> but a most <i>forcible</i> argument, to induce our Lord to show forth his power and goodness: - <i>He is sick</i>, and <i>thou lovest him</i>; therefore thou canst neither abandon <i>him</i>, not <i>us</i>.</p>
