<p>Verse 31. <i><b>She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</b></i> â€” It appears that it was the custom for the nearest relatives of the deceased to go at times, during the three days of weeping, accompanied by their friends and neighbours, to mourn near the graves of the deceased. They supposed that the spirit hovered about the place where the body was laid for <i>three</i> days, to see whether it might be again permitted to enter, but, when it saw the face change, it knew that all hope was now past. It was on this ground that the <i>seven</i> days of <i>lamentation</i> succeeded the <i>three</i> days of <i>weeping</i>, because all hope was now taken away. They had traditions that, in the course of <i>three</i> days, persons who had died were raised again to life. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Ward says: "I once saw some <i>Mussulman women</i>, near Calcutta, lying on the new-made grave of a relation, weeping bitterly. In this manner the Mussulman females weep and strew flowers over the graves of relations, at the expiration of <i>four</i> days, and <i>forty</i> days, after the <i>interment</i>."</p>
