<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Could not this man, which opened the eyes</b></i>, c.] Through the maliciousness of their hearts, these Jews considered the tears of Jesus as a proof of his weakness. We may suppose them to have spoken thus: "If he loved him so well, why did he not heal him? And if he could have healed him, why did he not do it, seeing he testifies so much sorrow at his death? Let none hereafter vaunt the miracle of the blind man's cure if he had been capable of doing that, he would not have permitted his friend to die." Thus will men <i>reason</i>, or rather <i>madden</i>, concerning the works and providence of God; till, by his farther miracles of <i>mercy</i> or <i>judgment</i>, he <i>converts</i> or <i>confounds</i> them.</p>
