<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Take ye away the stone.</b></i> — He desired to convince all those who were at the place, and especially those who took away the stone, that Lazarus was not only <i>dead</i>, but that <i>putrescency</i> had already taken place, that it might not be afterwards said that Lazarus had only fallen into a lethargy; but that the greatness of the miracle might be fully evinced.</p>
<p><i><b>He stinketh</b></i> — The body is in a state of putrefaction. The Greek word οζω signifies simply <i>to smell</i>, whether the scent be <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>; but the circumstances of the case sufficiently show that the latter is its meaning here. Our translators might have omitted the uncouth term in the common text; but they chose literally to follow the Anglo-Saxon, [A.S.], and it would be now useless to attempt any change, as the common reading would perpetually recur, and cause all attempts at mending to sound even worse than that in the text.</p>
<p><i><b>For he hath been</b></i> dead <i>four days.</i>] τεταρταιος γαρ εστι, <i>This</i> <i>is the fourth day</i>, i.e. since his interment. Christ himself was buried on the same day on which he was crucified, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:42">John 19:42</span>, and it is likely that Lazarus was buried also on the same day on which he died. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:17">John 11:17</span>.</p>
