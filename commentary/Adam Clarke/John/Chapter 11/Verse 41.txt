<p>Verse 41. <i><b>Where the dead was laid.</b></i> — These words are wanting in BC*DL, <i>three</i> others; <i>Syriac, Persic, Arabic, Sahidic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Vulgate, Saxon</i>, and in all the <i>Itala</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves them out of the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Father, I thank thee</b></i> — As it was a common opinion that great miracles might be wrought by the power and in the name of the devil, Jesus lifted up his eyes to <i>heaven</i>, and invoked the supreme God before these unbelieving Jews, that they might see that it was by his power, and by his only, that this miracle was done; that every hinderance to this people's faith might be completely taken out of the way, and that their faith might stand, not in the wisdom of man, but in the power of the Most High. On this account our Lord says, <i>he spoke because of the multitude</i>, that they might see there was no diabolic influence here, and that God in his mercy had visited his people.</p>
