<p>Verse 43. <i><b>He cried with a loud voice</b></i> â€” In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>, our Lord had said, <i>that the time was coming, in which the dead should hear the</i> <i>voice of the Son of God, and live</i>. He now fulfils that prediction, and <i>cries aloud</i>, that the people may take notice, and see that even death is subject to the sovereign command of Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, says Quesnel, omitted nothing to save this dead person: he underwent the fatigue of a <i>journey</i>, he <i>wept</i>, he <i>prayed</i>, he <i>groaned</i>, he <i>cried with a loud voice</i>, and commanded the dead to <i>come forth</i>. What ought not a minister to do in order to raise a soul, and especially a soul long dead in trespasses and sins!</p>
