<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Bound hand and foot with grave - clothes</b></i> — <i>Swathed about</i> <i>with rollers </i>- κειριαις, from κειρω, <i>I cut</i>. These were long slips of linen a few inches in breadth, with which the body and limbs of the dead were swathed, and especially those who were embalmed, that the aromatics might be kept in contact with the flesh. But as it is evident that Lazarus had not been embalmed, it is probable that his limbs were not swathed <i>together</i>, as is the constant case with those who are embalmed, but <i>separately</i>, so that he could come out of the tomb at the command of Christ, though he could not walk <i>freely</i> till the rollers were taken away. But some will have it that he was swathed exactly like a <i>mummy</i>, and that his coming out in that state was <i>another miracle</i>. But there is no need of multiplying miracles in this case: there was <i>one</i> wrought which was a most sovereign proof of the unlimited power and goodness of God. Several of the primitive fathers have adduced this resurrection of Lazarus as the <i>model, type, proof</i>, and <i>pledge</i> of the general resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p><i><b>Loose him, and let him go.</b></i> — He would have the disciples and those who were at hand take part in this business, that the fullest conviction might rest on every person's mind concerning the reality of what was wrought. He whom the grace of Christ converts and restores to life comes forth, at his call, from the dark, dismal grave of sin, in which his soul has long been buried: he walks, according to the command of Christ, in newness of life; and gives, by the holiness of his conduct, the fullest proof to all his acquaintance that he is alive from the dead.</p>
