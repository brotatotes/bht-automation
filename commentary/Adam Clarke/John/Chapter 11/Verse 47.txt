<p>Verse 47. <i><b>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a</b></i><b> </b><i><b>council</b></i> — The Pharisees, as such, had no power to assemble councils; and therefore only those are meant who were scribes or elders of the people, in conjunction with <i>Annas</i> and his son-in-law <i>Caiaphas</i>, who were the <i>high priests</i> here mentioned.

They told them what they had seen, and on <i>their</i> word, as being in league with themselves against Jesus, they could confidently rely.</p>
