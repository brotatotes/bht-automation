<p>Verse 48. <i><b>All men will believe on him</b></i> — If we permit him to work but a few more miracles like these two last (the cure of the blind man, and the resurrection of Lazarus) he will be universally acknowledged for the Messiah; the people will proclaim him king; and the Romans, who can suffer no government here but their own, will be so irritated that they will send their armies against us, and destroy our temple, and utterly dissolve our civil and ecclesiastical existence. Thus, under the pretense of the public good, these men of blood hide their hatred against Christ, and resolve to put him to death. To get the people on their side, they must give the alarm of destruction to the nation: if this man be permitted to live, <i>we shall be all destroyed</i>! Their former weapons will not now avail. On the subject of keeping the Sabbath, they had been already confounded; and his last miracles were so incontestable that they could no longer cry out, <i>He is a deceiver</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Both our place and nation.</b></i> — Literally, <i>this place</i>, τον τοπον: but that the <i>temple</i> only is understood is dear from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13-14">Acts 6:13-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span> Macc. 1:14; 2:18; 3:18; 5:16, 17; 10:7; where it is uniformly called <i>the place</i>, or <i>the holy place</i>, because they considered it the most glorious and excellent place in the world. When men act in opposition to God's counsel, the very evils which they expect thereby to avoid will come upon them. They said, If we do not put Jesus to death, the Romans will destroy both our temple and nation. Now, it was because they put him to death that the Romans burnt and razed their temple to the ground, and put a final period to their political existence.
