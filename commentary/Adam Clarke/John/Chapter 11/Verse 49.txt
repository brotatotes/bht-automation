<p>Verse 49. <i><b>Caiaphas being the high priest that same year</b></i> — By the law of Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:15">Exodus 40:15</span>, the office of high priest was <i>for life</i>, and the son of Aaron's race always succeeded his father, But at this time the high priesthood was almost <i>annual</i>: the Romans and Herod put down and raised up <i>whom</i> they pleased, and <i>when</i> they pleased, without attending to any other rule than merely that the person put in this office should be of the <i>sacerdotal</i> race. According to Josephus, Ant. xviii. c. 3, the proper name of this person was <i>Joseph</i>, and <i>Caiaphas</i> was his surname. He possessed the high priesthood for eight or nine years, and was deposed by Vitellius, governor of Judea. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span></span>.</p>
