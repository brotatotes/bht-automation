<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:5">John 11:5</span>. <i><b>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</b></i> â€” Therefore his staying <i>two days longer</i> in Bethabara was not through lack of affection for this distressed family, but merely that he might have a more favourable opportunity of proving to them <i>how</i> <i>much</i> he loved them. Christ never denies a <i>less</i> favour, but in order to confer a <i>greater</i>. God's <i>delays</i>, in answering prayers offered to him by persons in distress, are often proofs of his purpose to confer some great kindness, and they are also proofs that his wisdom finds it necessary to permit an <i>increase</i> of the affliction, that his goodness may be more conspicuous in its removal.</p>
