<p>Verse 50. <i><b>Nor consider</b></i> — Ye talk more at <i>random</i> than according to <i>reason</i>, and the exigencies of the case. There is a various reading here in some MSS. that should be noticed. Instead of ουδε διαλογιζεσθε, which we translate, <i>ye do not consider</i>, and which properly conveys the idea of <i>conferring</i>, or <i>talking together</i>, ουδε λογιζεσθε, neither <i>do ye reason</i> or <i>consider rightly</i>, is the reading of ABDL, three others, and some of the primitive fathers. Griesbach, by placing it in his inner margin, shows that he thinks it bids fair to be the true reading. Dr. White thinks that this reading is equal, and probably preferable, to that in the text: <i>Lectio aequalis, forsitan praeferenda receptae</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That one man should die for the people</b></i> — In saying these remarkable words, Caiaphas had no other intention than merely to state that it was better to put Jesus to death than to expose the whole nation to ruin on his account. His maxim was, it is better to sacrifice <i>one man</i> than a <i>whole nation</i>. In politics nothing could be more just than this; but there are two words to be spoken to it: First, The religion of God says, <i>we must not do evil that</i> <i>good may come</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>. Secondly, It is not certain that Christ will be acknowledged as <i>king</i> by all the people; nor that he will make any <i>insurrection</i> against the Romans; nor that the Romans will, on his account, <i>ruin</i> the temple, the city, and the nation. This Caiaphas should have considered. A person should be always sure of his <i>premises</i> before he attempts to draw any <i>conclusion</i> from them. See Calmet. This saying was proverbial among the Jews: see several instances of it in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
