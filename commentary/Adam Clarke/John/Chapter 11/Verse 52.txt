<p>Verse 52. <i><b>And not for that nation only</b></i>, c.] These, and the preceding words in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:51">John 11:51</span>, are John's explication of what was <i>prophetic</i> in the words of Caiaphas: as if John had said, He is indeed to die for the sins of the Jewish nation, but not for theirs alone, but for the sins of the whole world: see his own words afterwards, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1-2">1 John 2:1-2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Gather together in one</b></i> — That he should <i>collect into one</i> body-form one Church out of the Jewish and Gentile believers.</p>
<p><i><b>Children of God that were scattered abroad.</b></i> — Probably John only meant the <i>Jews</i> who were dispersed among all nations since the conquest of Judea by the Romans; and these are called the <i>dispersed</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:35">John 7:35</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>; and it is because he refers to these only, that he terms them here, <i>the children of God</i>, which was an ancient character of the Jewish people: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:5">Deuteronomy 32:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:6">Isaiah 43:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:11">Isaiah 45:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+32:1">Jeremiah 32:1</span>. Taking his words in this sense, then his meaning is this: that Christ was to die, not only for the then inhabitants of Judea, but for all the Jewish race wheresoever scattered; and that the consequence would be, that they should be all collected from their various dispersions, and made one body. This comports with the predictions of St. Paul: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1-32">Romans 11:1-32</span>. This probably is the sense of the passage; and though, according to this interpretation, the apostle may seem to confine the benefits of Christ's death to the <i>Jewish</i> people only, yet we find from the passage already quoted from his first epistle, that his views of this subject were afterwards very much extended; and that he saw that Jesus Christ was not only a propitiation for their sins (the Jews) but for the sins of the whole world: see his 1st epistle, chap. 2. ver. 2. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span> All the truths of the Gospel were not revealed at <i>once</i>, even to the apostles themselves.</p>
