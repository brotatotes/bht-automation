<p>Verse 54. <i><b>Walked no more openly</b></i> — παρρησια, He did not go as before through the cities and villages, teaching, preaching, and healing the sick.</p>
<p><i><b>Near to the wilderness</b></i> — Some MSS. add, of <i>Samphourein</i>, or <i>Samphourim</i>, or <i>Sapfurim</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A city chilled Ephraim</b></i> — Variously written in the MSS., <i>Ephraim,</i> <i>Ephrem, Ephram</i>, and <i>Ephratha</i>. This was a little village, situated in the neighbourhood of <i>Bethel</i>; for the scripture, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+13:19">2 Chronicles 13:19</span>, and Josephus, War, b. iv. c. 8. s. 9, join them both together. Many believe that this city or village was the same with that mentioned, 1 Macc. 5:46; 2 Macc. 12:27. Joshua gave it to the tribe of Judah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:9">Joshua 15:9</span>; and Eusebius and Jerome say it was about twenty miles north of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><i><b>And there continued</b></i> — <i>Calmet</i> says, following <i>Toynard</i>, that he stayed there two months, from the 24th of January till the 24th of March.</p>
