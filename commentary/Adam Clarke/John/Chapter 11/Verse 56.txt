<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:56">John 11:56</span>. <i><b>Then sought they for Jesus</b></i> â€” Probably those of <i>Ephraim</i>, in whose company Christ is supposed to have departed for the feast, but, having stayed behind, perhaps at Jericho, or its vicinity, the others had not missed him till they came to the temple, and then inquired among each other whether he would not attend the feast. Or the persons mentioned in the text might have been the agents of the high priest, &amp;c., and hearing that Christ had been at Ephraim, came and inquired among the people that came from that quarter, whether Jesus would not attend the festival, knowing that he was punctual in his attendance on all the Jewish solemnities.</p>
