<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:57">John 11:57</span>. <i><b>Had given a commandment</b></i> — Had given order; εντολην, <i>positive order</i>, or <i>injunction</i>, and perhaps with a grievous <i>penalty</i>, that no one should keep the place of his residence a secret. This was their hour, and the power of darkness; and now they are fully determined to take away his life. The order here spoken of was given in consequence of the determination of the council, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:48-53">John 11:48-53</span>.</p>
<p>CHRIST'S sympathy and tenderness, one of the principal subjects in this chapter, have already been particularly noted on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span>. His eternal power and Godhead are sufficiently manifested in the resurrection of Lazarus. The whole chapter abounds with great and important truths, delivered in language the most impressive and edifying. In the whole of our Lord's conduct in the affair of Lazarus and his sisters, we find majesty, humanity, friendship, and sublime devotion, blended in the most intimate manner, and illustrating each other by their respective splendour and excellence. In every act, in every word, we see GOD manifested in the FLESH: - Man in all the amiableness and charities of his nature; GOD in the plenitude of his power and goodness. How sublime is the lesson of instruction conveyed by the words, <i>Jesus</i> <i>wept</i>! The heart that feels them not must be in the <i>gall</i> of <i>bitterness</i>, and <i>bond</i> of <i>iniquity</i>, and consequently lost to every generous feeling.</p>
<p>On the quotation from Virgil, on the 50th verse, a learned friend has sent me the following lines.</p>
<p>My dear Sir, - I have observed that in one part of your Commentary you quote these words of Virgil, <i>Unum pro multis dabitur caput</i>; and you are of opinion that Virgil here recognizes the doctrine of atonement. There is a passage in Lucan where this doctrine is exhibited more clearly and fully. It is in the <i>second</i> book, v. 306. Cato, in a speech to Brutus, declares his intention of fighting under the standard of Pompey, and then expresses the following sentiment:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> O utinam, coelique Deis Erebique liberet,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Hoc caput in cunctas damnatum exponere poenas!</p>

<p>A little after,<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:0">John 11:0</span>v. 377, Lucan portrays the character of Cato with a very masterly hand; but he applies expressions to a mortal which are applicable to Christ alone. </p>
