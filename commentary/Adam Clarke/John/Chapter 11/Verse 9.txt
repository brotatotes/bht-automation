<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:9">John 11:9</span>. <i><b>Are there not twelve hours in the day?</b></i> — The Jews, as well as most other nations, divided the day, from sun-rising to sun-setting, into twelve equal parts; but these parts, or hours, were longer or shorter, according to the different seasons of the year. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:39">John 1:39</span>.</p>
<p>Our Lord alludes to the case of a traveller, who has to walk the whole day: the day points out the time of life-the <i>night</i> that of <i>death</i>. He has already used the same mode of speech, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span>: <i>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the</i> <i>night cometh when no man can work</i>. Here he refers to what the apostles had just said-<i>The Jews were but just now going to stone</i> <i>thee</i>. Are there not, said he, <i>twelve</i> hours in the day? I have not travelled these twelve hours yet-my last hour is not yet come; and the Jews, with all their malice and hatred, shall not be able to bring it a moment sooner than God has purposed. I am immortal till my work is done; and this, that I am now going to Bethany to perform, is a part of it. When all is completed, then <i>their hour</i>, and that of the power of darkness, shall commence. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not</b></i> — A traveller should use the <i>day</i> to walk in, and not the <i>night</i>. During the day he has the <i>sun, the light of this world</i>: he sees his way, and does not stumble: but, if he walk in the <i>night</i>, he stumbleth, <i>because there</i> <i>is no light in it</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:10">John 11:10</span>; i.e. there is no <i>sun</i> above the horizon. The words εν αυτω, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:10">John 11:10</span>, refer not to the man, but to the <i>world</i>, the sun, its light, not being above the horizon. Life is the time to fulfil the will of God, and to prepare for glory. Jesus is the light of the world; he that walks in his Spirit, and by his direction, cannot stumble - cannot fall into sin, nor be surprised by an unexpected death. But he who walks in the <i>night</i>, in the darkness of his own heart, and according to the maxims of this dark world, <i>he</i> stumbles-falls into sin, and at last falls into hell. Reader! do not dream of walking to heaven in the night of thy death. God has given thee the warning: receive it, and begin to live to him, and for eternity.</p>
