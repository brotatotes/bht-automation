Verse John 12:20. Certain Greeks â€” There are three opinions concerning these:1. That they were proselytes of the gate or covenant, who came up to worship the true God at this feast.2. That they were real Jews, who lived in Grecian provinces, and spoke the Greek language.3. That they were mere Gentiles, who never knew the true God: and hearing of the fame of the temple, or the miracles of our Lord, came to offer sacrifices to Jehovah, and to worship him according to the manner of the people of that land. This was not an unfrequent case: many of the Gentiles, Romans, and others, were in the habit of sending sacrifices to the temple at Jerusalem. Of these opinions the reader may choose; but the first seems best founded.
