<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:21">John 12:21</span>. <i><b>The same came therefore to Philip</b></i> — Some suppose that these Gentiles were of <i>Phoenicia</i> or <i>Syria</i>, or perhaps inhabitants of <i>Decapolis</i>, near to the lake of <i>Gennesareth</i> and <i>Bethsaida</i>; and therefore they addressed themselves to Philip, who was of the latter city, and probably known to them. The later <i>Syriac</i> calls them <i>Arameans</i> or <i>Syrians</i>. The <i>Vulgate</i>, and several copies of the <i>Itala</i>, call them <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Sir, we would see Jesus.</b></i> — We have heard much concerning him, and we wish to see the person of whom we have heard such strange things. The final salvation of the soul often originates, under God, in a principle of simple <i>curiosity</i>. Many have only wished to se or hear a man who speaks much of Jesus, his miracles, and his mercies; and in hearing have felt the powers of the world to come, and have become genuine converts to the truths of the Gospel.</p>
