<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</b></i> â€” How pleasing to God is this union, when the ministers of his Gospel agree and unite together to bring souls to Christ. But where <i>self-love</i> prevails, and the <i>honour</i> that comes from God is not sought, this union never exists. <i>Bigotry</i> often ruins every generous sentiment among the different denominations of the people of God.</p>
