<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die</b></i> â€” Our Lord compares <i>himself</i> to a <i>grain</i> of wheat; his <i>death</i>, to a grain <i>sown</i> and <i>decomposed</i> in the ground; his <i>resurrection</i>, to the <i>blade</i> which springs up from the dead grain; which grain, thus dying, brings forth an abundance of fruit. I must die to be glorified; and, unless I am glorified, I can not establish a glorious Church of Jews and Gentiles upon earth. In comparing himself thus to a grain of wheat, our Lord shows us: - </p>
<p>1. The <i>cause</i> of his death - the order of God, who had rated the redemption of the world at this price; as in nature he had attached the <i>multiplication</i> of the corn to the <i>death</i> or <i>decomposition</i> of the <i>grain</i>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>end</i> of his death - the redemption of a lost world; the justification, sanctification, and glorification of men: as the multiplication of the corn is the end for which the grain is sown and dies.</p>
<p>3. The <i>mystery</i> of his death, which we must credit without being able fully to comprehend, as we believe the <i>dead grain</i> multiplies itself, and we are nourished by that multiplication, without being able to comprehend how it is done.</p>
<p>The greatest philosopher that ever existed could not tell how one grain became thirty, sixty, a hundred, or a thousand - how it vegetated in the earth - how earth, air, and water, its component parts, could assume such a form and consistence, emit such odours, or produce such tastes. Nor can the wisest man on earth tell how the <i>bodies</i> of <i>animals</i> are <i>nourished</i> by this produce of the ground; how wheat, for instance, is <i>assimilated</i> to the very nature of the bodies that receive it, and how it becomes <i>flesh</i> and <i>blood, nerves, sinews, bones</i>, c. All we can say is, the thing <i>is</i> so and it has pleased God that is <i>should be</i> so, and not otherwise. So there are many things in the person, death, and sacrifice of Christ, which we can neither explain nor comprehend. All we should say here is, It is by this means that the world was redeemed - through this sacrifice men are saved: it has pleased God that it should be <i>so</i>, and not otherwise. Some say: "Our Lord spoke this according to the philosophy of those days, which was by no means correct." But, I would ask, has ever a more correct philosophy on this point appeared? Is it not a physical truth that the whole <i>body</i> of the grain <i>dies</i>, is converted into <i>fine earth</i>, which forms the first nourishment of the embryo plant, and prepares it to receive a grosser support from the surrounding soil; and that nothing lives but the <i>germ</i>, which was included in this body, and which must die also, if it did not receive, from the death or putrefaction of the body of the grain, nourishment, so as to enable it to unfold itself? Though the body of our Lord died, there was still the <i>germ</i>, the quickening power of the Divinity, which re-animated that body, and stamped the atonement with infinite merit. Thus the merit was <i>multiplied</i>; and, through the death of that <i>one</i> person, the man Christ Jesus united to the eternal WORD, salvation was procured for the <i>whole</i> world. Never was a simile more appropriate, nor an illustration more happy or successful.</p>
