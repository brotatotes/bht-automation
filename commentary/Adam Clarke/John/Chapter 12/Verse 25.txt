Verse 25. He that loveth his life â€” Matthew 10:39; Matthew 10:39; and see Clarke "Luke 14:26". I am about to give up my life for the salvation of men; but I shall speedily receive it back with everlasting honour, by my resurrection from the dead. In this I should be imitated by my disciples, who should, when called to it, lay down their lives for the truth; and, if they do, they shall receive them again with everlasting honour.
