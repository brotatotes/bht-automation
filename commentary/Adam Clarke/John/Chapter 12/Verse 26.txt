<p>Verse 26. <i><b>If any man serve me</b></i> â€” Christ is a <i>master</i> in a twofold sense:</p>
<p>1. To <i>instruct</i> men.</p>
<p>2. To <i>employ</i> and <i>appoint</i> them their work. He who wishes to <i>serve</i> Christ must become:</p>
<p>1. His <i>disciple</i> or <i>scholar</i>, that he may be <i>taught</i>:</p>
<p>2. His <i>servant</i>, that he may be <i>employed</i> by and <i>obey</i> his master. To such a person a twofold promise is given:</p>
<p>1. He shall be <i>with Christ</i>, in eternal fellowship with him; and</p>
<p>2. He shall be <i>honoured by the Lord</i>: he shall have an abundant <i>recompense</i> in glory; but how great, eye hath not seen, ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive.</p>
<p>How similar to this is the saying of <i>Creeshna</i> (an <i>incarnation</i> of the supreme <i>God</i>, according to the <i>Hindoo</i> theology) to his disciple <i>Arjoon</i>! "If one whose ways were ever so evil <i>serve me alone</i>, he soon becometh of a virtuous spirit, is as respectable as the just man, and obtaineth eternal happiness. Consider this world as a finite and joyless place, and <i>serve me</i>. Be of my <i>mind</i>, my <i>servant</i>, my <i>adorer</i>, and bow down before <i>me</i>. <i>Unite</i> thy <i>soul</i> unto <i>me</i>, make me thy <i>asylum</i>, and <i>thou shalt go unto me</i>." And again: "I am extremely dear to the wise man, and he is dear to me-I esteem the wise man even as myself, because his devout spirit dependeth upon me alone as his ultimate resource." <i>Bhagvat Geeta</i>, pp. 71 and 82.</p>
<p>The rabbins have an extravagant saying, viz. "God is more concerned for the honour of the just man than for his own."</p>
