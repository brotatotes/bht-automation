<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Now is my soul troubled</b></i> — Our blessed Lord took upon him our <i>weaknesses</i>, that he might sanctify them to <i>us</i>. As a man he was <i>troubled</i> at the prospect of a <i>violent</i> death. Nature <i>abhors</i> <i>death</i>: God has implanted that abhorrence in nature, that it might become a principle of self preservation; and it is to this that we owe all that <i>prudence</i> and <i>caution</i> by which we avoid danger. When we see Jesus working miracles which demonstrate his omnipotence, we should be led to conclude that he was not <i>man</i> were it not for such passages as these. The reader must ever remember that it was essentially necessary that he should be <i>man</i>; for, without being such, he could hot have <i>died</i> for the sin of the world.</p>
<p><i><b>And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour</b></i> — Και τι ειπω; πατερ, σωσον με εκ της ὡρας ταυτης· which may be paraphrased thus: <i>And why should I say, Father, save me from this hour? when</i> <i>for this cause I am come to this hour</i>. The common version makes our blessed Lord <i>contradict</i> himself here, by not attending to the proper punctuation of the passage, and by translating the particle τι <i>what</i>, instead of <i>why</i> or <i>how</i>. The sense of our Lord's words is this: "When a man feels a fear of a sudden or violent death, it is natural to him to cry out, Father, save me from this death! for he hopes that the glory of God and his welfare may be accomplished some other way, less dreadful to his nature: but why should <i>I</i> say so, seeing for this very purpose, that I might die this violent death for the sins of mankind, I am come into the world, and have almost arrived at the hour of my crucifixion."</p>
