Verse 28. Father, glorify thy name. â€” By the name of God is to be understood himself, in all his attributes: his wisdom, truth, mercy, justice, holiness, c., which were all more abundantly glorified by Christ's death and resurrection, (i.e. shown forth in their own excellence,) than they had ever been before. Christ teaches here a lesson of submission to the Divine will. Do with me what thou wilt, so that glory may redound to thy name. Some MSS. read, Father, glorify my name: others, glorify thy Son.Then came there a voice from heaven, c.] The following is a literal translation of Calmet's note on this passage, which he has taken from Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, and others: "I have accomplished my eternal designs on thee. I have sent thee into the world to make an atonement for the sin of the world, and to satisfy my offended justice. I will finish my work. Thou shalt shed thy blood upon the cross. My glory is interested in the consummation of thy sacrifice. But, in procuring my own glory, I shall procure thine. Thy life and thy death glorify me: I have glorified thee by the miracles which have accompanied thy mission and I will continue to glorify thee at thy death, by unexampled prodigies, and thy resurrection shall be the completion of thy glory and of thy elevation."Christ was glorified:1st. By the prodigies which happened at his death.2. In his resurrection.3. In his ascension, and sitting at the right hand of God.4. In the descent of the Holy Ghost on the apostles. and5. In the astonishing success with which the Gospel was accompanied, and by which the kingdom of Christ has been established in the world. 2 Corinthians 2:14.
