<p>Verse 29. <i><b>The people - said that it thundered: others - an angel</b></i><b> </b><i><b>spake to him.</b></i> â€” Bishop <i>Pearce</i> says, Probably there was thunder as well as a voice, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:16-17">Exodus 19:16-17</span>, and some persons, who were at a small distance, might hear the thunder without hearing the voice; while others heard the voice too; and these last said, "An angel hath spoken to him."</p>
<p><i>Wetstein</i> supposes that the <i>voice</i> was in the language then in use among the Jews; which the Greeks, not understanding, took for <i>thunder</i>; the others, the Jews, who did understand it, said it was the voice of an angel. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span>, the voice of one of the living creatures is compared to <i>thunder</i>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+10:3">Revelation 10:3</span>, the voice of an angel is compared to <i>seven thunders</i>. The voice mentioned was probably <i>very loud</i>, which some heard <i>distinctly</i>, others <i>indistinctly</i>; hence the <i>variety</i> of opinion.</p>
