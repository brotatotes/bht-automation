<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Now is the judgment of this world</b></i> — The judgment spoken of in this place is applied by some to the punishment which was about to fall on the Jewish people for rejecting Christ. And the ruler or prince, ο αρχων, of this world, is understood to be <i>Satan</i>, who had blinded the eyes of the Jews, and hardened their hearts, that they might not believe on the Son of God; but his kingdom, not only among the Jews, but in all the world, was about to be destroyed by the abolition of idolatry and the vocation of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>The epithet סר העולם <i>sar ha-olam</i>, prince of this world, is repeatedly applied to the devil, or to <i>Samael</i>, who is termed the <i>angel of death</i>. The Jews fabled that, into the hands of this <i>chief</i>, God had delivered all the nations of the earth, except the Israelites. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. The words are understood by others as addressed to these believing <i>Greeks</i>, and to have the following meaning, which is extremely different from the other. "In a short time (four or five days afterwards) ye shall see what sort of a <i>judgment</i> this world passes. <i>I</i>, who am its <i>ruler</i> and <i>prince</i>, shall be <i>cast out</i>, shall be condemned by my own creatures, as an impious and wicked person. But do not be discouraged: though I be lifted up on the cross, and die like a malefactor, nevertheless I will draw all men unto myself. The Gospel of Christ crucified shall be the grand agent, in the hand of the Most High, of the conversion and salvation of a ruined world."
