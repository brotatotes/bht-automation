<p>Verse 32. <i><b>I - will draw all</b></i><b> men </b><i><b>unto me.</b></i> — After I shall have died and risen again, by the preaching of my word and the influence of my <i>Spirit</i>, I shall attract and illuminate both Jews and Gentiles. It was one of the peculiar characteristics of the Messiah, that unto him should the <i>gathering of the people be</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>. And probably our Lord refers to the prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span>, which peculiarly belonged to the <i>Gentiles</i>: "There shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ENSIGN of the people, to it shall the GENTILES seek, and his rest shall be glorious." There is an allusion here to the <i>ensigns</i> or <i>colours</i> of commanders of regiments, elevated on high places, on long poles, that the people might see where the pavilion of their general was, and so flock to his standard.</p>
<p>Instead of παντας, the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, another, several versions, and many of the fathers, read παντα, <i>all men</i>, or <i>all things</i>: so the Anglo-Saxon, [A.S.], <i>I will draw all things to myself</i>. But παντα may be here the accusative singular, and signify <i>all men</i>.</p>
<p>The ancients fabled that Jupiter had a <i>chain of gold</i>, which he could at any time let down from heaven, and by it <i>draw the earth</i> <i>and all its inhabitants to himself</i>. See a fine passage to this effect in <i>Homer</i>, Iliad viii. ver. 18-27. </p>
<p>So <i>justice</i> was sometimes represented under the emblem of a <i>golden chain</i>, and in some cases such a chain was constructed, one end attached to the emperor's apartment, and the other hanging within reach; that if any person were oppressed he might come and lay hold on the chain, and by shaking it give the king notice that he was oppressed, and thus claim protection from the fountain of justice and power. In the <i>Jehangeer Nameh</i>, a curious account of this kind is given, which is as follows. The first order which <i>Jehangeer</i> issued on his accession to the throne (which was A.H. 1014, answering to A.D. 1605) was for the construction of the GOLDEN CHAIN of <i>Justice</i>. It was made of pure gold, and measured thirty yards in length, consisting of sixty links, and weighing, in the whole, <i>four</i> Hindostany <i>maunds</i> (about four hundred pounds avoirdupois.) One end of the chain was suspended from the royal bastion of the fortress of Agra, and the other fastened in the ground near the side of the river. The intention of this was, that if the officers of the courts of law were partial in their decisions, or dilatory in the administration of justice, the injured parties might come themselves to this chain, and, making a noise by shaking the links of it, give notice that they were waiting to represent their grievances to his majesty. Hist. of Hindostan, p. 96, <i>Calcutta</i>, 1788. Such a <i>communication, prayer</i> and <i>faith</i> establish between the most just and most merciful GOD, and the wretched and <i>oppressed</i> children of men. "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." <i>O thou that hearest</i> <i>prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come</i>! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+65:2">Psalms 65:2</span>.</p>
