<p>Verse 34. <i><b>We have heard out of the law</b></i> — That is, out of the sacred writings. The words here are quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>; but the Jews called every part of the sacred writings by the name, <i>The</i> <i>Law</i>, in opposition to the words or sayings of the scribes. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That Christ abideth for ever</b></i> — There was no part of the law nor of the Scripture that said the Messiah <i>should not die</i>; but there are several passages that say as expressly as they can that Christ must die, and die for the sin of the world too. See especially <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1">Isaiah 53:1</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:27">Daniel 9:27</span>. But as there were several passages that spoke of the <i>perpetuity</i> of his reign, as <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:25">Ezekiel 37:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14">Daniel 7:14</span>, they probably confounded the one with the other, and thus drew the conclusion, The Messiah cannot die; for the Scripture hath said, his throne, kingdom, and reign shall be eternal. The prophets, as well as the evangelists and apostles, speak sometimes of the <i>Divine</i>, sometimes of the <i>human</i> nature of Christ: when they speak of the former, they show forth its glory, excellence, omnipotence, omniscience, and eternity; when they speak of the latter, they show forth its humiliations, afflictions, sufferings, and death. And those who do not make the proper distinction between the two natures of Christ, the <i>human</i> and the <i>Divine</i>, will ever make blunders as well as the Jews. It is only on the ground of <i>two natures</i> in Christ that the Scriptures which speak of him, either in the Old or New Testament, can be possibly understood. No position in the Gospel is plainer than this, <i>God</i> was manifest in the <i>flesh</i>.</p>
