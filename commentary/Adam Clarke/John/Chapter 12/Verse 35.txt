<p>Verse 35. <i><b>Yet a little while is the light with you.</b></i> — In answer to their objection, our Lord compares himself to a light, which was about to disappear for a short time, and afterwards to shine forth with more abundant lustre; but not to their comfort, if they continued to reject its present beamings. He exhorts them to follow this light while it was among them. The Christ shall abide for ever, it is true; but he will not always be <i>visible</i>. When he shall depart from you, ye shall be left in the thickest darkness; in impenitence and hardness of heart. Then shall ye wish to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:22">Luke 17:22</span>. Then shall ye seek me, but shall not find me, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:34">John 7:34</span>. For the kingdom of God shall be taken from <i>you</i>, and given to the <i>Gentiles</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:43">Matthew 21:43</span>. If ye believe not in me <i>now</i>, ye shall <i>then</i> wish ye had done it, when wishing shall be for ever fruitless.</p>
<p>Instead of μεθ υμων, <i>with you</i>, εν υμιν, <i>among you</i>, is the reading of BDL, <i>seventeen</i> others; <i>Coptic, Gothic, Slavonic,</i> <i>Vulgate, Itala; Cyril, Nonnus</i>, and <i>Victorinus</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> has received it into the text. The meaning of both is nearly the same.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest darkness come upon you</b></i> — Ye have a good part of your journey yet to go: ye cannot travel safely but in the daylight - that light is almost gone - run, that the darkness overtake you not, or in it ye shall stumble, fall, and perish!</p>
<p>Reader, is thy journey near an end? There may be but a very little time remaining to thee. O, run, fly to Christ, lest the darkness of death overtake thee, before thy soul have found redemption in his blood!</p>
