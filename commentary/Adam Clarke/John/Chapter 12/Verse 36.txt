<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Children of light</b></i> — Let the light, the truth of Christ, so dwell in and work by you that ye may be all light in the Lord: that as truly as a child is the produce of his own parent, and partakes of <i>his</i> nature, so ye may be children of the light, having nothing in you but <i>truth</i> and <i>righteousness</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Did hide himself from them.</b></i> — Either by rendering himself <i>invisible</i>, or by suddenly mingling with the crowd, so that they could not perceive him. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span>. Probably it means no more than that he withdrew from them, and went to Bethany, as was his custom a little before his crucifixion; and concealed himself there during the night, and taught publicly every day in the temple. It was in the night season that they endeavoured to seize upon him, in the absence of the multitude.</p>
