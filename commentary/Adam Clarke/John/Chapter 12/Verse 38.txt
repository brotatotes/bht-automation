<p>Verse 38. <i><b>That the saying of Esaias</b></i> — Or, <i>Thus the word of Isaiah</i> <i>was fulfilled</i>. So I think ινα (commonly rendered <i>that</i>) should be translated. For it certainly does not mean the <i>end</i> the Pharisees had in view by not believing; nor the <i>end</i> which the prophet had in view in predicting the incredulity of the Jews; but simply, such a thing was spoken by the prophet, concerning the Jews of his own time, and it had its literal fulfilment in those of our Lord's time.</p>
<p><i><b>Our report</b></i> — The testimony of the prophets, concerning the <i>person, office, sufferings, death</i>, and <i>sacrifice</i> of the Messiah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1">Isaiah 53:1</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>The arm of the Lord</b></i> — The power, strength, and miracles of Christ.</p>
