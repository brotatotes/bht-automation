<p>Verse 40. <i><b>And I should heal them.</b></i> â€” This verse is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:9">Isaiah 6:9</span>, and, perhaps, refers more to the judgments that should fall upon them as a nation, which God was determined should not be averted, than it does to their eternal state. To suppose that the text meant that God was unwilling that they should turn unto him, lest he should be obliged to save them, is an insupportable blasphemy.</p>
