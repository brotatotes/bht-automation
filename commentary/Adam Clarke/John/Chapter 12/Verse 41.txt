<p>Verse 41. <i><b>When he saw his glory</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:1">Isaiah 6:1</span>, c. <i>I saw Jehovah</i>, said the prophet, <i>sitting upon a throne, high and</i> <i>lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the</i> <i>seraphim and one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy</i>, is <i>Jehovah, God of hosts; the whole earth</i> shall be <i>full of his</i> <i>glory</i>! It appears evident, from this passage, that the glory which the prophet saw was the glory of Jehovah: John, therefore, saying here that it was the glory of Jesus, shows that he considered Jesus to be Jehovah. See Bishop <i>Pearce</i>. Two MSS. and a few versions have Θεου, and του Θεου αὑτου, <i>the glory of God</i>, or <i>of</i> <i>his God</i>.</p>
