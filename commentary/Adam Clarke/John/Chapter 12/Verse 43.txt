Verse 43. They loved the praise of men — δοξαν, the glory or honour that cometh from men.How common are these four obstacles of faith! says Quesnel:1. Too great a regard to men.2. Riches and temporal advantages.3. The fear of disgrace.4. The love of the praise of men.Abundance of persons persuade themselves that they love God more than the world, till some trying occasion fully convinces them of their mistake. It is a very great misfortune for a person not to know himself but by his falls; but it is the greatest of all not to rise again after he has fallen. This is generally occasioned by the love of the praise of men, because in their account it is more shameful to rise again than it was to fall at first.
