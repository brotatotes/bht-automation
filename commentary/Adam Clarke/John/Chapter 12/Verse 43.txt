<p>Verse 43. <i><b>They loved the praise of men</b></i> — δοξαν, the <i>glory</i> or <i>honour</i> that cometh from men.</p>
<p>How common are these four obstacles of faith! says Quesnel:</p>
<p>1. Too great a regard to men.</p>
<p>2. Riches and temporal advantages.</p>
<p>3. The fear of disgrace.</p>
<p>4. The love of the praise of men.</p>
<p>Abundance of persons persuade themselves that they love God more than the world, till some trying occasion fully convinces them of their mistake. It is a very great misfortune for a person not to know himself but by his falls; but it is the greatest of all not to rise again after he has fallen. This is generally occasioned by the <i>love</i> of the <i>praise of men</i>, because in their account it is more shameful to rise again than it was to fall at first.</p>
