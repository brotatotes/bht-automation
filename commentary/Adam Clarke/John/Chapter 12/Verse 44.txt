<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Jesus cried and said</b></i> — This is our Lord's concluding discourse to this wicked people: probably this and the following verses should be understood as a part of the discourse which was left off at the 36th verse. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:36">John 12:36</span></p>
<p><i>Jesus cried </i>- he spoke these words <i>aloud</i>, and showed his <i>earnest</i> desire for their salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Believeth not on me</b></i><b>, (only,) </b><i><b>but on him that sent me.</b></i> — Here he asserts again his indivisible unity with the Father: - he who believes on the Son believes on the Father: he who hath seen the Son hath seen the Father: he who honours the Son honours the Father. Though it was for asserting this (his oneness with God) that they were going to crucify him, yet he retracts nothing of what he had spoken, but strongly reasserts it, in the very jaws of death!</p>
