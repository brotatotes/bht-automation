Verse 46. I am come a light into the world â€” Probably referring to what his forerunner had said, John 1:5. Before the coming of this Saviour, this sun of righteousness, into the world, all was darkness: at his rising the darkness is dispersed; but it only profits those whose eyes are open to receive the rays of this sun of righteousness. See on John 1:5; John 3:19; John 8:12; John 9:5.
