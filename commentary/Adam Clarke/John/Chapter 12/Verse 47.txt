Verse John 12:47. And believe not — και μη φυλαξη, And keep them not, is the reading of ABL, seven others; Syriac, Wheelock's Persian, two of the Arabic, Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Armenian, later Syriac, Vulgate, six of the Itala, and some of the fathers.A man must hear the words of Christ in order to believe them; and he must believe, in order to keep them; and he must keep them in order to his salvation.I judge him not — I need not do it: the words of Moses and the prophets judge and condemn him. See the notes on John 3:17; John 5:45.
