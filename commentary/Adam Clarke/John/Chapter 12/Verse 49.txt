<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:49">John 12:49</span>. <i><b>For I have not spoken of myself</b></i> — I have not spoken for my secular interest: I have not aimed at making any gain of you: I have not set up myself as your teachers in general do, to be supported by my disciples, and to be credited on my own testimony. I have taught you, not the things of <i>men</i>, but the deep, everlasting truths of God. As <i>his</i> envoy, I came to you; and his <i>truth</i> only I proclaim.</p>
<p><i><b>Gave me a commandment</b></i> — Or, <i>commission</i>. So I understand the original word, εντολη. Christ, as the Messiah, received his <i>commission</i> from God; <i>what he should command</i>-every thing that related to the formation and establishment of the Christian institution: <i>and what he should speak </i>- all his private conversations with his disciples or others, he, as man, commanded and spoke through the constant inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</p>
