<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span>. <i><b>Not that HE cared for the poor</b></i> — There should be a particular emphasis laid on the word <i>he</i>, as the evangelist studies to show the most determined detestation to his conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>And bare what was put therein.</b></i> — Or rather, as some eminent critics contend, <i>And stole what was put in it</i>. This seems the proper meaning of εβαϚαζεν; and in this sense it is used, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:15">John 20:15</span>: <i>If thou hast STOLEN him away</i> - ει συ εβαϚασας αυτον. In the same sense the word is used by Josephus, Ant. b. xii. c. 5, s 4; where speaking of the pillage of the temple by Antiochus, he says, Τα σκευη του Θεου βαϚασαι, <i>He carried off</i>, or STOLE, <i>also the</i> <i>vessels of the Lord</i>. See also Ant. b. viii. c. 2, s. 2, where the harlot says before Solomon, concerning her child, βαϚασασα δε τουμον εκ των γονατων προς αὑτην μεταφερει - <i>She STOLE away my child</i> <i>out of my bosom, and removed it to herself</i>. And <i>Ibid</i>. b. ix. c. 4, s. 5, speaking of the ten lepers that went into the Syrian camp, he says, finding the Syrians fled, <i>They entered into the camp, and</i> <i>ate, and drank; and, having STOLEN away</i> (εβαϚασαν) <i>garments, and</i> <i>much gold, they hid them without the camp</i>. See the objections to this translation answered by <i>Kypke</i>, and the translation itself vindicated. See also <i>Pearce</i> in loc., <i>Wakefield, Toup</i>. Em. ad <i>Suid</i>. p. iii. p. 203. If <i>stealing</i> were not intended by the evangelist, the word itself must be considered as superfluous; for, when we are told that he had the <i>bag</i>, we need not be informed that he had what was <i>in</i> it. But the apostle says he was a <i>thief</i>; and because he was a thief, and had the common <i>purse</i> in his power, therefore he <i>stole</i> as much as he conveniently could, without subjecting himself to detection. And, as he saw that the death of Christ was at hand, he wished to secure a provision for himself, before he left the company of the apostles. I see that several copies of the old <i>Itala</i> version understood the word in this sense, and therefore have translated the word by <i>auferebat, exportabat - took away,</i> <i>carried away</i>. Jerome, who professed to <i>mend</i> this version, has in this place (as well as in many others) <i>marred</i> is, by rendering εβαϚαζεν, by <i>portabat</i>.</p>
<p>The γλωσσοκομον, which we translate <i>bag</i>, meant originally the little box, or sheath, in which the tongues or reeds used for <i>pipes</i> were carried; and thus it is interpreted by <i>Pollux</i> in his <i>Onomasticon</i>; and this is agreeable to the etymology of the word. The Greek word is used in Hebrew letters by the Talmudists to signify a <i>purse, scrip, chest, coffer</i>, &amp;c. As our Lord and his disciples lived on charity, a bag or scrip was provided to carry those pious donations by which they were supported. And Judas was steward and treasurer to this holy company.</p>
