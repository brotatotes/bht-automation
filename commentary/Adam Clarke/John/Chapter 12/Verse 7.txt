<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:7">John 12:7</span>. <i><b>Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she</b></i><b> </b><i><b>kept this.</b></i> — Several MSS. and versions read thus: - Αφες αυτην, ἱνα εις την ἡμεραντου ενταφιασμου μου τηρησῃ - <i>Let her alone, THAT she</i> <i>may keep it to the day of my embalming</i>. This is the reading of BDLQ, <i>four</i> others, <i>Arabic, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, <i>Slavonic, Vulgate</i>, all the <i>Itala</i> but one; <i>Nonnus, Ambrosius, Gaudentius</i>, and <i>Augustin</i>. This reading, which has the approbation of <i>Mill, Bengel, Griesbach, Pearce</i>, and others, intimates that only a <i>part</i> of the ointment was then used, and that the rest was kept till the time that the women came to embalm the body of Jesus: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>.
