Verse John 13:1. Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew, c.] Or, as some translate, Now Jesus having known, before the feast of the passover, that his hour was come, c. The supper mentioned in John 13:2 is supposed to have been that on the Thursday evening, when the feast of the passover began and though, in our common translation, this passage seems to place the supper before that feast, yet, according to the amended translation, what is here said is consistent with what we read in the other evangelists. See 2 John 1:12; John 12:1.Having loved his own — His disciples.Which were in the world — Who were to continue longer in its troubles and difficulties.He loved them unto the end. — Continued his fervent affection towards them to his latest breath, and gave them that convincing proof of it which is mentioned John 13:5. That the disciples alone are meant here every man must see.
