<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>. <i><b>Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew</b></i>, c.] Or, as some translate, <i>Now Jesus having known, before the</i> <i>feast of the passover, that his hour was come</i>, c. The supper mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:2">John 13:2</span> is supposed to have been that on the Thursday evening, when the feast of the passover began and though, in our common translation, this passage seems to place the supper <i>before</i> that feast, yet, according to the amended translation, what is here said is consistent with what we read in the other evangelists.

<p><i><b>Having loved his own</b></i> — His disciples.</p>
<p><i><b>Which were in the world</b></i> — Who were to continue longer in its troubles and difficulties.</p>
<p><i><b>He loved them unto the end.</b></i> — Continued his fervent affection towards them to his latest breath, and gave them that convincing proof of it which is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:5">John 13:5</span>. That the disciples alone are meant here every man must see.</p>
