<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:10">John 13:10</span>. <i><b>He that is washed</b></i> — That is, he who has been in the bath, as probably all the apostles had lately been, in order to prepare themselves the better for the paschal solemnity; for on that occasion, it was the custom of the Jews to bathe twice.</p>
<p><i><b>Needeth not save to wash</b></i> his <i>feet</i>] To cleanse them from any dirt or dust that might have adhered to them, in consequence of walking from the bath to the place of supper. The washing, therefore, of the <i>feet</i> of such persons was all that was necessary, previously to their sitting down to table; The Hindoos walk home from bathing <i>barefoot</i>, and, on entering the house <i>wash their feet again</i>. To this custom our Lord evidently alludes.</p>
<p>If these last words of our Lord had any spiritual reference, it is not easy to say what it was. A common opinion is the following: <i>He who is washed</i>-who is justified through the blood of the Lamb, <i>needeth only to wash his feet</i>-to regulate all his affections and desires; and to get, by faith, his conscience cleansed from any <i>fresh guilt</i>, which he may have contracted since his justification.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye are clean, but not all</b></i> — <i>Eleven</i> of you are upright and sincere; the <i>twelfth</i> is a traitor. So it appears he had washed the feet of all the twelve; but as no external ablutions can purify a hypocrite or a traitor, therefore Judas still remained unclean.</p>
