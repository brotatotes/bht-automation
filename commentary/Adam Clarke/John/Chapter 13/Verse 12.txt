<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:12">John 13:12</span>. <i><b>Know ye what I have done</b></i> — Our Lord had told Peter, in the presence of the rest, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:7">John 13:7</span>, that he should <i>afterwards</i> know what was the intent and meaning of this washing; and now he begins to fulfil his promise; therefore I think it more likely that he gives a <i>command</i>, here, than asks a <i>question</i>, as he knew himself that they did not comprehend his design. On this account γινωσκετε might be translated in the <i>imperative</i> mood, <i>CONSIDER what I have done</i>.</p>
