<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:16">John 13:16</span>. <i><b>The servant is not greater than his lord</b></i> — Christ has ennobled the acts of humility by practising them himself. The true glory of a Christian consists in being, in his measure, as humble as his Lord.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither he that is sent</b></i> — Ουδε αποϚολος <i>Nor an apostle</i>. As I think these words were intended for the suppression of all worldly ambition and lordly conduct in the <i>apostles</i> and their <i>successors</i> in the ministry, therefore I think the original word αποϚολος, should be translated <i>apostle</i>, rather than <i>he that is sent</i>, because the former rendering ascertains and determines the meaning better.</p>
