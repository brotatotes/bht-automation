<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:17">John 13:17</span>. <i><b>If ye know these things, happy</b></i>, c.] True <i>happiness</i> consists in the <i>knowledge</i> of God, and in <i>obedience</i> to him. A man is not happy because he <i>knows</i> much but because he receives much of the Divine nature, and is, in all his conduct, conformed to the Divine will. "They who have <i>read</i> many books (says <i>Menu</i>) are more exalted than such as have <i>seldom</i> studied; they who <i>retain</i> what they have read, than <i>forgetful</i> readers; they who <i>fully understand</i>, than such as only <i>remember</i>; and they who <i>perform</i> their <i>known</i> <i>duty</i>, than such as barely <i>know</i> it. <i>Sacred knowledge</i> and <i>devotedness</i> to God are the means by which a man can arrive at <i>beatitude</i>." See <i>Institutes</i> of MENU, c. xii. Inst. 103, 104. For a <i>heathen</i> this saying is very remarkable.</p>
