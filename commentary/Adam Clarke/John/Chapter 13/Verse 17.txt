Verse John 13:17. If ye know these things, happy, c.] True happiness consists in the knowledge of God, and in obedience to him. A man is not happy because he knows much but because he receives much of the Divine nature, and is, in all his conduct, conformed to the Divine will. "They who have read many books (says Menu) are more exalted than such as have seldom studied; they who retain what they have read, than forgetful readers; they who fully understand, than such as only remember; and they who perform their known duty, than such as barely know it. Sacred knowledge and devotedness to God are the means by which a man can arrive at beatitude." See Institutes of MENU, c. xii. Inst. 103, 104. For a heathen this saying is very remarkable.
