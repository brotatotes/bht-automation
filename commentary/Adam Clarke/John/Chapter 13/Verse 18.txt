Verse John 13:18. I speak not of you all — This is a continuation of that discourse which was left off at the tenth verse. The preceding verses may be read in a parenthesis.I know whom I have chosen — I am not deceived in my choice; I perfectly foresaw every thing that has happened, or can happen. I have chosen Judas, not as a wicked man, nor that he should become such; but I plainly foresaw that he would abuse my bounty, give way to iniquity, deliver me into the hands of my enemies, and bring ruin upon himself.That the scripture may be fulfilled — Or, thus the scripture is fulfilled. Christ applies to Judas what David had said of his rebellious son Absalom, Psalms 41:9, who was one of the most express emblems of this traitor. See on John 12:38-39.He that eateth bread with me — That is, he who was in habits of the utmost intimacy with me.Hath lifted up his heel — An allusion to a restive, ill-natured horse, that sometimes kicks even the person who feeds and takes care of him.
