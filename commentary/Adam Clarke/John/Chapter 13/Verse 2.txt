<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:2">John 13:2</span>. <i><b>And supper being ended</b></i> — Rather, δειπνου γενομενου, <i>while supper was preparing</i>. To support this new translation of the words, it may be remarked that, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:26">John 13:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:30">John 13:30</span>, it appears that the supper was <i>not</i> then <i>ended</i>: nay, it is probable that it was not then <i>begun</i>; because the washing of feet (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:5">John 13:5</span>) was usually practised by the Jews <i>before</i> they entered upon their meals, as may be gathered from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:44">Luke 7:44</span>, and from the reason of the custom. I think that John wrote, not γενομενου, but γινομενου, as in BL. <i>Cant</i>. and <i>Origen</i>, which latter reading is approved by several eminent critics, and should be translated as above. By the <i>supper</i> I suppose to be meant, not only the <i>eating</i> of it, but the <i>preparing</i> and <i>dressing</i> of it, and doing all things necessary previously to the eating of it. The devil had, before this time of the supper, put it into Judas's heart to betray his Master. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:14">Matthew 26:14</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:10-11">Mark 14:10-11</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3">Luke 22:3</span>, &amp;c. See also Bishop <i>Pearce</i>, from whose judicious commentary the preceding notes are principally taken.</p>
<p><i>Calmet</i> observes that John, designing only to supply what was omitted by the other evangelists, passes over all the transactions of the Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, before the passion, and at once goes from Monday evening to Thursday evening. It is remarkable that St. John says nothing about the institution of the holy sacrament, which Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span>, &amp;c., Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:22">Mark 14:22</span>, &amp;c., and Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>, &amp;c., describe so particularly. No other reason can be assigned for this than that he found it completely done by the others, and that he only designed to supply their defects.</p>
<p><i><b>The devil having now put it into the heart</b></i> — Judas formed his plot six days before this, on occasion of what happened at the house of Simon the leper: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:14">Matthew 26:14</span>. <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
