Verse John 13:21. Was troubled in spirit. — John 11:33.And testified — Spoke with great earnestness.Shall betray me. — παραδωσει με, Will deliver me up. Judas had already betrayed our blessed Lord, and he was now on the point of delivering him up into the hands of the chief priests. By all these warnings, did not our Lord intend that Judas should be benefited?-that he should repent of his iniquity, and turn and find mercy?
