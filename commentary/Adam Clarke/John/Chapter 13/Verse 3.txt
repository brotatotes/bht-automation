<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:3">John 13:3</span>. <i><b>Knowing that the Father had given</b></i>, c.] Our Lord, seeing himself almost at the end of his race, and being about to leave his apostles, thought it necessary to leave them a lesson of humility exemplified by himself, to deliver them from the bad influence of those false ideas which they formed concerning the nature of his kingdom. On all occasions previously to this, the disciples had shown too much attachment to worldly honours and dignities: if this ambition had not been removed, the consequences of it would have been dreadful in the establishment of the religion of Christ as after his death, it would have divided and infallibly dispersed them. It was necessary therefore to restrain this dangerous passion, and to confirm by a remarkable example what he had so often told them,-that true greatness consisted in the depth of humility, and that those who were the willing servants of all should be the highest in the account of God.</p>
