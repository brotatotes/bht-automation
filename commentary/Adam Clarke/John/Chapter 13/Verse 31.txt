<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Now is the Son of man glorified</b></i> — νυν εδοξασθη, <i>Hath</i> <i>been glorified</i>. Now it fully appears that I am the person appointed to redeem a lost world by my blood. I <i>have</i> already <i>been</i> <i>glorified</i> by this appointment, and am about to be farther <i>glorified</i> by my death, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
