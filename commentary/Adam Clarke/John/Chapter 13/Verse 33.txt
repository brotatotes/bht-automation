<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Little children</b></i> — Or, rather, <i>beloved children</i>. τεκνια, a word frequently used by this apostle in his epistles. It is an expression which implies great tenderness and affection, and such as a fond mother uses to her most beloved babes. Now that Judas was gone out, he could use this epithet without any restriction of meaning.</p>
<p><i><b>Yet a little while</b></i> — The end of my life is at hand; Judas is gone to consummate his treason; I have but a few hours to be with you, and you shall be by and by scattered.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye shall seek me</b></i> — For a few days ye shall feel great distress because of my absence.</p>
<p><i><b>Whither I go, ye cannot come</b></i> — Your time is not up. The Jews shall die in their sins, <i>martyrs</i> to their <i>infidelity</i>; but ye shall die in the <i>truth</i>, martyrs for your <i>Lord</i>.</p>
