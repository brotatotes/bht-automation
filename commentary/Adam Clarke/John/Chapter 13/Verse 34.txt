<p>Verse 34. <i><b>A new commandment I give unto you</b></i> â€” In what sense are we to understand that this was a <i>new</i> commandment? <i>Thou shalt love</i> <i>thy neighbour as thyself</i>, was a positive precept of the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span>, and it is the very same that Christ repeats here; how then was it <i>new</i>? Our Lord answers this question, <i>Even AS I have</i> <i>loved you</i>. Now Christ <i>more</i> than fulfilled the Mosaic precept; he not only loved his neighbour AS <i>himself</i>, but he loved him MORE than <i>himself</i>, for he laid down his life for men. In this he calls upon the disciples to imitate him; to be ready on all occasions to lay down their lives for each other. This was, strictly, a <i>new</i> commandment: no system of morality ever prescribed any thing so pure and disinterested as this. Our blessed Lord has outdone all the moral systems in the universe in two words:</p>
<p>1. Love your enemies;</p>
<p>2. Lay down your lives for each other.</p>
