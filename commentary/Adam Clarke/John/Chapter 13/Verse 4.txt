<p><i><b>Laid aside his garments</b></i> — That is, his <i>gown</i> or upper coat, with the <i>girdle</i> wherewith it was girded close to his <i>tunic</i> or under coat; and, instead of this girdle, he tied a <i>towel</i> about him:</p>
<p>1. that he might appear in the character of a <i>servant</i>; and</p>
<p>2. that he might have it in readiness to dry their feet after he had washed them.</p>
