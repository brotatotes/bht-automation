<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:8">John 13:8</span>. <i><b>If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</b></i> â€” Thou canst not be my disciple unless I wash thee. It is certain Christ did not mean to exclude him from the apostolic office, if he should persist, through the deepest reverence for his Master, to refuse to let him wash his <i>feet</i>: this act of his was emblematical of something spiritual; of something that concerned the salvation of Peter; and without which washing he could neither be an apostle or be finally saved; therefore our Lord said, <i>If I wash thee not,</i> <i>thou hast no part with me</i>. There is a mystical washing by the blood of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>; and by his Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5-6">Titus 3:5-6</span>. It was the common custom of our Lord to pass from sensible and temporal things to those which were spiritual and eternal; and to take occasion from every thing that presented itself, to instruct his disciples, and to raise their souls to God. If the discourse was of <i>bread, water, leaven, father, mother,</i> <i>riches</i>, c., he immediately changed the literal sense, and under the figure of these things, spoke of matters altogether spiritual and Divine. I have met with many good persons who have attempted to imitate our blessed Lord in this, but I never knew one to succeed in it. The reason is, it requires not only <i>very deep</i> <i>piety</i>, but <i>sound sense</i>, together with an <i>accurate knowledge</i> of the <i>nature</i> and <i>properties</i> of the subjects which, in this way, the person wishes to illustrate and very few can be found who have such deep, philosophical knowledge as such cases require. The large folio which a good-intentioned man printed on the <i>metaphors</i> is, alas! a standing proof how little mere piety can do in matters of this kind, where the <i>sciences</i>, and especially <i>practical</i> <i>philosophy</i>, are totally wanting. Jesus Christ was a consummate philosopher: every subject appears grand and noble in his hands. See an ample proof in the preceding chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:24">John 12:24</span>.</p>
