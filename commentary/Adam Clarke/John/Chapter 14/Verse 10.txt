Verse John 14:10. I am in the Father, and the Father in me? — We are essentially one; and those who have seen me have seen him who sent me.He doeth the works. — We are not only one in nature, but one also in operation. The works which I have done bear witness of the infinite perfection of my nature. Such miracles as I have wrought could only be performed by unlimited power.
