<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>. <i><b>And greater</b></i><b> works </b><i><b>than these</b></i> — The miracles which I have wrought could not have been wrought but by the omnipotence of God; but that omnipotence can work <i>greater</i>. And those who believe on my name shall, through my almighty power, be enabled to work <i>greater</i> miracles than those which l have ordinarily wrought. An impostor might seduce the people by false miracles; but he could not make his power and cunning pass to all those who were seduced by him: but <i>I</i> will give you this proof of the divinity of my mission and the truth of my doctrine.</p>
<p>Perhaps the <i>greater works</i> refer to the immense multitudes that were brought to God by the ministry of the apostles. By the apostles was the doctrine of Christ spread far and wide; while Christ confined his ministry chiefly to the precincts of Judea. It is certainly the greatest miracle of Divine grace to convert the obstinate, wicked heart of man from sin to holiness. This was done in numberless cases by the disciples, who were endued with power from on high, while proclaiming remission of sins through faith in his blood.</p>
<p>Some account for the greater works thus:</p>
<p>1. The very <i>shadow</i> of Peter healed the diseased, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span>.</p>
<p>2. Diseases were cured, and demons cast out, by applying to the persons <i>handkerchiefs</i> and <i>aprons</i> that had before touched the body of Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:12">Acts 19:12</span>.</p>
<p>3. By the <i>word</i> of Peter, Ananias and Sapphira were <i>struck dead</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:5">Acts 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:9-10">Acts 5:9-10</span>.</p>
<p>4. Elymas the sorcerer was <i>struck blind</i> by the <i>word</i> of Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span>.</p>
<p>5. Christ only preached in <i>Judea</i>, and in the <i>language</i> only of that country; but the apostles preached through the most of the then known <i>world</i>, and in <i>all</i> the <i>languages</i> of all countries. But let it be remarked that all this was done by the power of Christ; and I think it still more natural to attribute the <i>greater works</i> to the greater number of conversions made under the apostles' ministry. The reason which our Lord gives for this is worthy of deep attention:-</p>
<p><i><b>Because I go unto my Father.</b></i> — Where I shall be an <i>Intercessor</i> for you, that:-</p>
