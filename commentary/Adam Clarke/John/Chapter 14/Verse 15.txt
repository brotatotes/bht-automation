<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:15">John 14:15</span>. <i><b>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</b></i> â€” Do not be afflicted at the thought of my being separated from you: the most solid proof ye can give of your attachment to and affection for me is to keep my commandments. This I shall receive as a greater proof of your affection than your tears.</p>
