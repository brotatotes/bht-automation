<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>. <i><b>I will pray the Father</b></i> — After having made an atonement for the sin of the world, I will become the <i>Mediator</i> between God and man; and through my <i>mediation</i> and <i>intercession</i> shall all the blessings of grace and glory be acquired.</p>
<p><i><b>Another Comforter</b></i> — The word παρακλητος signifies not only a <i>comforter</i>, but also an <i>advocate</i>, a <i>defender</i> of a cause, a <i>counsellor, patron, mediator</i>. Christ is thus termed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>, where the common translation renders the word <i>advocate</i>. Christ is thus called, because he is represented as <i>transacting</i> the <i>concerns</i> of our souls with God; and for this cause, he tells us, he goes unto the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>. The Holy Spirit is thus called, because he transacts the cause of God and Christ with us, <i>explains</i> to us the nature and importance of the great atonement, shows the necessity of it, <i>counsels</i> us to receive it, <i>instructs</i> us how to lay hold on it, <i>vindicates</i> our claim to it, and makes <i>intercessions</i> in us with unutterable groanings. As Christ acted with his disciples while he sojourned with them, so the Holy Ghost acts with those who believe in his name.</p>
<p><i><b>For ever</b></i> — As the death and atonement of Christ will be necessary to man till the conclusion of the world, so the office of the Holy Spirit must be continued among men till the end of time: therefore says Christ, <i>he shall continue with you for ever</i>, teaching, comforting, advising, defending, and interceding for you and for all my followers to the end of time.</p>
