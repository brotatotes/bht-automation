<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span>. <i><b>I will not leave you comfortless</b></i> — Literally, <i>orphans</i>. The original word ορφανος, is by some derived from ορφνος, <i>obscure, dark</i>, because, says <i>Mintert</i>, an <i>orphan</i> (one deprived of father and mother) is little esteemed, neglected, and is obliged to wander about in obscurity and darkness. Others derive it from the Hebrew חרף <i>charaph</i>, to <i>strip</i> or <i>make bare, despoil</i>, because such a child is <i>destitute</i> of <i>comfort, direction</i>, and <i>support</i>, and is a <i>prey</i> to <i>misery</i> and <i>disease</i>, to <i>sin</i> and to <i>death</i>.</p>
<p>The disciples of a particular teacher among the Hebrews called him <i>father</i>; his <i>scholars</i> were called his <i>children</i>, and, on his <i>death</i>, were considered as <i>orphans</i>. Christ calls his disciples <i>children, beloved children</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:33">John 13:33</span>; and, now that he is about to be removed from them by death, he assures them that they shall not be left <i>fatherless</i>, or without a teacher; for in a little time he should <i>come again</i>, (rise from the dead,) and, after his ascension, they should be made partakers of that Spirit which would be their comforter, advocate, teacher, and guide for ever.</p>
