Verse 23. If a man — Not only my present disciples, but all those who shall believe on me through their word, or that of their successors:Love me — Receive me as his Saviour, and get the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost:He will keep my words — Observe all my sayings, and have his affections and conduct regulated by my Spirit and doctrine:My Father will love him — Call him his child; support, defend, and preserve him as such.And we will come unto him — God the Father, through his Son, will continue to pour out his choicest blessings upon his head and upon his heart:And make our abode with him. — Will make his heart our temple, where God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, shall rest, receive homage, and dwell to eternity. Thus will I manifest myself to the believing, loving, obedient disciple, and not to the world, who will not receive the Spirit of the truth.
