<p>Verse 23. <i><b>If a man</b></i> — Not only my present disciples, but all those who shall believe on me through <i>their</i> word, or that of their successors:</p>
<p><i><b>Love me</b></i> — Receive me as his Saviour, and get the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p><i><b>He will keep my words</b></i> — Observe all my sayings, and have his affections and conduct regulated by my Spirit and doctrine:</p>
<p><i><b>My Father will love him</b></i> — Call him his <i>child</i>; support, defend, and preserve him as such.</p>
<p><i><b>And we will come unto him</b></i> — God the Father, through his Son, will continue to pour out his choicest blessings upon his head and upon his heart:</p>
<p><i><b>And make our abode with him.</b></i> — Will make his heart our temple, where God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, shall rest, receive homage, and dwell to eternity. Thus will <i>I manifest myself</i> to the believing, loving, obedient disciple, and <i>not to the world</i>, who will not receive the Spirit of the truth.</p>
