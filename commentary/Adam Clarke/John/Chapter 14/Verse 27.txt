<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Peace I leave with you</b></i> — The Jewish form of <i>salutation</i> and <i>benediction</i>. A wish of peace among them is thus to be understood: <i>May you prosper in body and soul, and enjoy every</i> <i>earthly and heavenly good</i>! For the meaning of this word, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>My peace I give unto you</b></i> — Such tranquillity of soul, such uninterrupted happiness of mind, such everlasting friendship with God as I enjoy, may <i>ye</i> all enjoy! And such blessedness I <i>bequeath</i> unto you: it is my <i>last</i>, my <i>best</i>, my <i>dying</i> legacy.</p>
<p><i><b>Not as the world giveth</b></i> — Not as the Jews, in empty wishes: not as the people of the world, in empty compliments. Their salutations and benedictions are generally matters of custom and polite ceremony, given without <i>desire</i> or <i>design</i>; but I <i>mean what</i> I <i>say</i>; what I wish you, that I will give you. To his followers Jesus <i>gives</i> peace, <i>procures</i> it, <i>preserves</i> it, and <i>establishes</i> it. He is the <i>author, prince, promoter</i>, and <i>keeper</i> of peace.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither let it be afraid.</b></i> — μηδε δειλιατω, Let not your heart <i>shrink back</i> through <i>fear</i> of any <i>approaching evil</i>. This is the proper meaning of the word. In a few hours ye will be most powerfully assaulted; but stand firm: - the evil will only fall upon <i>me</i>; and this evil will result in your comfort and salvation, and in the redemption of a lost world.</p>
