<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:28">John 14:28</span>. <i><b>I go away</b></i> — To the Father by my death:</p>
<p><i><b>And come again unto you.</b></i> — By my resurrection.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye would rejoice</b></i> — Because, as the <i>Messiah</i>, I am going to receive a kingdom, and power, and glory, for ever. Therefore as my friends ye should rejoice in my elevation, though for a while it may put you to the pain of being separated from me: besides, I am going that I may send you the Holy Spirit, which shall fill you with the fulness of God: on your <i>own account</i>, therefore, ye should have rejoiced and not mourned.</p>
<p><i><b>My Father is greater than I.</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:24">John 14:24</span>, Christ tells his disciples that the Father had <i>sent</i> him: i.e. in his quality of <i>Messiah</i>, he was <i>sent</i> by the Father to instruct, and to save mankind. Now, as the <i>sender</i> is <i>greater</i> than the <i>sent</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:16">John 13:16</span>, so in this sense is the <i>Father</i> greater than the <i>Son</i>; and in this sense was the passage understood by <i>Origen, Jerome, Novatian</i>, and <i>Vigilius</i>, who read the text thus: <i>The Father</i>, ο πεμψας, <i>who sent me, is greater than I</i>. It certainly requires very little argument, and no sophistry, to reconcile this saying with the most orthodox notion of the Godhead of Christ; as he is repeatedly speaking of his <i>Divine</i> and of his <i>human</i> nature. Of the <i>former</i> he says, <i>I and the Father are one</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:30">John 10:30</span>; and of the <i>latter</i> he states, with the same truth, <i>The Father is greater than</i> <i>I</i>.</p>
