<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:29">John 14:29</span>. <i><b>I have told you before it come to pass</b></i> â€” Lest my death should be a stumbling-block to you, I have spoken of it beforehand, and showed you the necessity of it, that when it happens ye may believe, that as I could predict it so clearly, and so circumstantially, so all the good which I have promised shall be the result may be confidently expected by you; and that your sorrow, if not entirely removed, may at least be much mitigated.</p>
