<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span>. <i><b>The prince of this world</b></i> — τουτου, <i>of this</i>, is omitted by ABDEGHKLMS, Mt. BH, one hundred others; both the <i>Syriac</i>, later <i>Persic</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, and several of the primitive fathers. I rather think the omission of the pronoun makes the sense more <i>general</i>; for, had he said <i>THIS world</i>, the words might have been restrained to the <i>Jewish state</i>, or to the <i>Roman government</i>. But who is the person called here the <i>prince</i> <i>of the world</i>?</p>
<p>1. Mr. <i>Wakefield</i> thinks that Christ speaks here of himself, as he does in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>, (see the note there,) and translates this verse and the following thus: <i>For the ruler of this world is</i> <i>coming; and I have nothing now to do, but to convince the world</i> <i>that I love the Father, and do as he commanded me</i>. On which he observes that our Lord speaks of what he <i>shall be</i>, when he <i>comes</i> <i>again</i>, and not of what he <i>then</i> was: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:16">John 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>. And how often does he speak of himself, as <i>the Son of man</i>, in the <i>third person</i>! See his vindication of this translation in the third vol. of his New Testament.</p>
<p>2. Others think that our Lord refers to the <i>Roman government,</i> <i>the ruler of the world</i>, who, by its <i>deputy, Pilate</i>, was going to judge him, but who should <i>find nothing</i> (ευρησει ουδεν, which is the reading found in some excellent MSS. and versions, and is followed by almost all the primitive fathers,) as a just cause of death in him-nothing in the whole of his conduct which was in the least reprehensible; and this indeed Pilate witnessed in the most solemn manner. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:4">John 19:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:12">John 19:12</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:4">Luke 23:4</span>, c., and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:24">Matthew 27:24</span>.</p>
<p>3. But the most general opinion is that <i>Satan</i> is meant, who is called the <i>prince of the power of the air</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span> and who is supposed to be the same that is called <i>the god of this world</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>; and who at his last and most desperate trial, the agony in the garden, should be convinced that there was <i>nothing of</i> <i>his nature</i> in Christ, nothing that would coincide with his solicitations, and that he should find himself completely foiled in all his attacks, and plainly foresee the impending ruin of his kingdom. It is very difficult to ascertain the real meaning here: of the different opinions proposed above, the reader must take that which he deems the most likely.</p>
