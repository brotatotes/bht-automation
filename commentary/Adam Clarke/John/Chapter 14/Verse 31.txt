Verse John 14:31. Arise, let us go hence. â€” Calmet supposes that Christ, having rendered thanks to God, and sung the usual hymn, Matthew 26:30; Mark 14:26; rose from the table, left the city, and went towards the garden of Olives, or garden of Gethsemane, on the road to which, a part of the following discourse was delivered. It was now about midnight, and the moon was almost full, it being the 14th day of her age, about the time in which the Jewish passover was to be slain.THE reader should carefully note the conduct of our Lord. He goes to die as a SACRIFICE, out of love to mankind, in obedience to the Divine will, and with unshaken courage. All our actions should be formed on this plan. They should have the love of God and man for their principle and motive; his glory for their end; and his will for their rule. He who lives and acts thus shall live for ever. Amen.
