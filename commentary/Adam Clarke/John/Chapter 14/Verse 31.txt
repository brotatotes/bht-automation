<p>THE reader should carefully note the conduct of our Lord. He goes to die as a SACRIFICE, out of <i>love</i> to mankind, in <i>obedience</i> to the Divine <i>will</i>, and with unshaken <i>courage</i>. All <i>our</i> actions should be formed on this plan. They should have the <i>love</i> of <i>God</i> and <i>man</i> for their <i>principle</i> and <i>motive</i>; his <i>glory</i> for their <i>end</i>; and his <i>will</i> for their <i>rule</i>. He who lives and acts thus shall live for ever. Amen.</p>
