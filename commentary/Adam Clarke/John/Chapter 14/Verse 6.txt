Verse John 14:6. I am the WAY — That leads so the Father: - the TRUTH that teaches the knowledge of God, and directs in the way: - the LIFE that animates all those who seek and serve him, and which is to be enjoyed eternally at the end of the way. He is the LIFE, both in grace and glory; the life that not only saves from death, but destroys it.No man cometh unto the Father — By any other doctrine, by any other merit, or by any other intercession than mine.
