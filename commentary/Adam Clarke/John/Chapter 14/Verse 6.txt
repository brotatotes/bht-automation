<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>. <i><b>I am the WAY</b></i> — That leads so the Father: - the TRUTH that teaches the knowledge of God, and directs in the way: - the LIFE that animates all those who seek and serve him, and which is to be enjoyed eternally at the end of the way. </p>
<p>He is the LIFE, both in grace and glory; the life that not only saves from death, but destroys it.</p>
<p><i><b>No man cometh unto the Father</b></i> — By any other doctrine, by any other merit, or by any other intercession than mine.</p>
