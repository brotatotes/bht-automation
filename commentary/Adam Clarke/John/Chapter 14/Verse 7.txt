Verse John 14:7. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father â€” Because I and the Father are ONE, John 10:30. Or, if ye had properly examined the intention and design of the law, ye would have been convinced that it referred to me; and that all that I have done and instituted was according to the design and intention of the Father, as expressed in that law.
