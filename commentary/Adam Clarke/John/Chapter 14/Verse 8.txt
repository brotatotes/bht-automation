<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:8">John 14:8</span>. <i><b>Show us the Father</b></i> â€” As if he had said, We have seen and adored <i>thee</i>, and our happiness will be complete if thou show us the Father. The demand of Philip was similar to that made by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:18">Exodus 33:18</span>. He wished to see the glory of God. In Peter, James, or John, this would have been inexcusable; but Philip had not seen the <i>transfiguration</i> on the mount. The Jewish history is full of the <i>manifestations</i> which God made of himself, and especially when he gave the law. As Christ was introducing a new law, Philip wished to have an additional <i>manifestation</i> of God.</p>
