<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1">John 15:1</span>. <i><b>I am the true vine</b></i> â€” Perhaps the vines which they met with, on their road from Bethany to Gethsemane, might have given rise to this discourse. Some of the disciples were probably making remarks on the different kinds of them, and our Lord took the opportunity of improving the conversation, according to his usual manner, to the instruction of their souls. He might here term himself the <i>true vine</i>, or <i>vine</i> of the <i>right sort</i>, in opposition to the <i>wild</i> and <i>barren vine</i>. Some MSS. and several of the fathers read the verse thus: <i>I am the true vine, ye are the branches, and</i> <i>my Father is the husbandman</i>. Some think that, as this discourse followed the celebration of the Eucharist, our Lord took occasion from the <i>fruit of the vine</i>, used in that ordinance, to introduce this similitude.</p>
