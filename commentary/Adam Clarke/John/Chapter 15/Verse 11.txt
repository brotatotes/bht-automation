<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:11">John 15:11</span>. <i><b>That my joy may remain in you</b></i> — That the joy which I now feel, on account of your steady, affectionate attachment to me, may be lasting, I give you both warnings and directions, that ye may abide in the faith.</p>
<p><i><b>That your joy might be full.</b></i> — Or, <i>complete </i>- πληρωθη, <i>filled</i> <i>up</i>: a metaphor taken from a vessel, into which water or any other thing is poured, till it is full to the brim. The religion of Christ expels <i>all misery</i> from the hearts of those who receive it in its fulness. It was to drive wretchedness out of the world that Jesus came into it.</p>
<p>Bishop Pearce, by joining εν εμοι to χαρα, and not to μεινη, translates the verse thus: <i>These things have I spoken, that my joy</i> <i>in you may remain</i>-which is according to the meaning given to the first clause.</p>
