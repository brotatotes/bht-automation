<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:13">John 15:13</span>. <i><b>That a man lay down his life for his friends.</b></i> — No man can carry his love for his friend farther than this: for, when he gives up his life, he gives up all that he has. This proof of my love for you I shall give in a few hours; and the doctrine which I recommend to you I am just going to exemplify myself. There are several remarkable cases, in heathen antiquity, where one friend offered his life for another.

<p>When Cyrus had made war on the king of <i>Armenia</i>, and had taken him, his wife, and children, with <i>Tigranes</i> his son, and <i>his</i> wife, prisoners; treating with the old king concerning his ransom, he said, How much money wilt thou give me to have thy wife again?

<p>The second example, which is too long to be inserted, is that affecting account of the friendship of <i>Nisus</i> and <i>Euryalus</i>, given by <i>Virgil</i>, in the ninth book of the <i>AEneis</i>. These two friends, leagued together, had slain many of the Rutulians in a night attack: at last Euryalus was taken prisoner. Nisus, concealed in a thicket, slew several of the enemy's chiefs with his javelins: Volscens, their general, not seeing the hand by which his officers were slain, determines to wreak his vengeance upon his prisoner. Nisus, seeing his friend about to be transfixed with the sword, rushing out of the wood where he lay hidden, suddenly cries: - </p>
<p>The friendship of David and Jonathan is well known: the latter cheerfully gave up his crown to his friend, though himself was every way worthy to wear it. But when all these instances of rare friendship and affection are seen, read, and admired, let the affected reader turn his astonished eyes to Jesus, pouring out his blood, not for his <i>friends</i>, but for his ENEMIES; and, in the agonies of death, making supplication for his murderers, with, <i>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do</i>!-and then let him help exclaiming, if he can, </p>
