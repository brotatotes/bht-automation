<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>. <i><b>Ye have not chosen me</b></i> — Ye have not elected me as your Teacher: I have called you to be my disciples; witnesses and depositories of the truth. It was customary among the Jews for every person to choose his own teacher.</p>
<p><i><b>And ordained you</b></i> — Rather, <i>I have appointed you</i>: the word is εθηκα, I have PUT or <i>placed you</i>, i.e. in the vine.</p>
<p><i>Theodorus Mopsuensis</i>, as quoted by Wetstein, observes that εθηκα is here used for εφυτευσα; (I have planted;) "and, in saying this, our Lord still makes use of the metaphor of the vine; as if he had said: I have not only <i>planted</i> you, but I have given you the greatest benefits, causing your branches to extend every where through the habitable world."</p>
<p>The first ministers of the Gospel were the <i>choice</i> of Jesus Christ; no wonder, then, that they were so <i>successful</i>. Those whom men have since sent, without the appointment of God, have done no good. The choice should still continue with God, who, knowing the heart, knows best who is most proper for the Gospel ministry.</p>
<p>To be a genuine preacher of the Gospel, a man must -</p>
<p>1. Be <i>chosen</i> of God to the work.</p>
<p>2. He must be <i>placed</i> in the <i>true vine</i>-united to Christ by faith.</p>
<p>3. He must not think to lead an idle life, but <i>labour</i>.</p>
<p>4. He must not wait till work be brought to him, but he must <i>go</i> and seek it.</p>
<p>5. He must labour so as to bring <i>forth fruit</i>, i.e. to get souls converted to the Lord.</p>
<p>6. He must refer all his fruit to <i>God</i>, who gave him the power to labour, and blessed him in his work.</p>
<p>7. He must take care to water what he has planted, that his <i>fruit may remain </i>- that the souls whom he has gathered in be not scattered from the flock.</p>
<p>8. He must continue instant in prayer, that his labours may be accompanied with the presence and blessing of God - <i>Whatsoever ye shall ASK</i>.</p>
<p>9. He must consider Jesus Christ as the great <i>Mediator</i> between God and man, proclaim his salvation, and pray <i>in his name. - Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my</i> <i>name</i>, &amp;c. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
