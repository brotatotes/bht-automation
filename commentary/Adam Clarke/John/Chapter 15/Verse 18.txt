<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18">John 15:18</span>. <i><b>If the world hate you</b></i> — As the followers of Christ were to be exposed to the hatred of the world, it was no small consolation to them to know that that hatred would be only in proportion to their faith and holiness; and that, consequently, instead of being troubled at the prospect of persecution, they should rejoice, because that should always be a proof to them that they were in the very path in which Jesus himself had trod. Dr. <i>Lardner</i> thinks that πρωτον is a substantive, or at least an adjective used substantively, and this clause of the text should be translated thus: <i>If the world hate you, know that it hated me,</i> <i>your CHIEF</i>. It is no wonder that the world should hate you, when it hated me, your <i>Lord</i> and <i>Master</i>, whose lips were without guile, and whose conduct was irreproachable. See the doctor's vindication of this translation, WORKS, vol. i. p. 306.</p>
