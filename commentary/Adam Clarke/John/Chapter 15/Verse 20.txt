Verse John 15:20. If they have kept my saying — Or, doctrine. Whosoever acknowledges me for the Christ will acknowledge you for my ministers.Some translate the passage thus: If they have WATCHED my sayings, i.e. with an intent to accuse me for something which I have said, they will WATCH yours also: therefore be on your guard. παρατηρειν has this sense, as we have had occasion to observe before; and perhaps τηρειν has the same sense here, as it is much more agreeable to the context.
