<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:20">John 15:20</span>. <i><b>If they have kept my saying</b></i> — Or, <i>doctrine</i>. Whosoever acknowledges <i>me</i> for <i>the Christ</i> will acknowledge <i>you</i> for my <i>ministers</i>.</p>
<p>Some translate the passage thus: <i>If they have WATCHED my</i> <i>sayings</i>, i.e. with an intent to accuse me for something which I have said, <i>they will WATCH yours also</i>: therefore be on your guard. παρατηρειν has this sense, as we have had occasion to observe before; and perhaps τηρειν has the same sense <i>here</i>, as it is much more agreeable to the context.</p>
