Verse 22. But now they have no cloke for their sin. â€” They are without excuse. See the margin, and John 9:41. Christ had done such works as demonstrated him to be the Messiah - yet they rejected him: here lay their sin; and this sin, and the punishment to which it exposed them, still remain; for they still continue to reject the Lord that bought them.
