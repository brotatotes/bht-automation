Verse John 15:25. Written in their law â€” John 10:34. These words are taken from Psalms 69:4. This psalm is applied to Christ, John 2:17; John 19:28; to the vengeance of God against Judea, Acts 1:20. The psalm seems entirely prophetic of Christ. His deep abasement is referred to, Psalms 69:2-5; his prayer for his disciples and followers, Psalms 69:6; that for himself, in the garden of Gethsemane, Psalms 69:15-19; his crucifixion, Psalms 69:20-22; the vengeance of God against the Jews, from Psalms 69:23-29; the glorious manner in which he gets out of all his sufferings, Psalms 69:30; the abolition of the Mosaic rites and ceremonies, Psalms 69:31, compared with Isaiah 66:3; and, finally, the establishment of the Gospel through the whole world, in Psalms 69:33 and following verses. The reader will do well to consult the psalm before he proceeds.
