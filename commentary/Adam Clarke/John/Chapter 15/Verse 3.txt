Verse John 15:3. Now ye are clean — καθαροι εστε, Ye are pruned. As our Lord has not changed the metaphor, it would be wrong to change the expression.Through the word — δια τον λογος, Through that word-that doctrine of holiness which I have incessantly preached unto you, and which ye have received. Perhaps our Lord more immediately refers here to the words which he had spoken concerning Judas, John 13:21-30, in consequence of which Judas went out and finished his bargain with the chief priests; he being gone off, the body of the apostles vas purified; and thus he might say, Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
