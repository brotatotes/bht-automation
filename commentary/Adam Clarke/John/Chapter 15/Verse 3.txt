<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:3">John 15:3</span>. <i><b>Now ye are clean</b></i> — καθαροι εστε, <i>Ye are pruned</i>. As our Lord has not changed the metaphor, it would be wrong to change the expression.</p>
<p><i><b>Through the word</b></i> — δια τον λογος, <i>Through that word</i>-that doctrine of holiness which I have incessantly preached unto you, and which ye have received. Perhaps our Lord more immediately refers here to the words which he had spoken concerning Judas, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:21-30">John 13:21-30</span>, in consequence of which Judas went out and finished his bargain with the chief priests; he being gone off, the body of the apostles vas purified; and thus he might say, <i>Now</i> <i>ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you</i>.</p>
