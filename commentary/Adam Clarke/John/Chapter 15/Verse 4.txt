Verse John 15:4. Abide in me â€” Hold fast faith and a good conscience; and let no trials turn you aside from the truth. And I will abide in you-ye shall receive every help and influence from me that your souls can require, in order to preserve and save them to eternal life.These two things are absolutely necessary to our salvation:1. That we continue closely united to Christ by faith and love, and live in and to him.2. That we continually receive from him the power to do good; for as the branch, however good in itself, cannot bear fruit from itself, through its own juice, which it has already derived from the tree, and can be no longer supported than it continues in union with the parent stock, neither can ye, unless ye abide in me. As the branch partakes of the nature of the tree, is nourished by its juice, and lives by its life, so ye must be made partakers of my Divine nature, be wise in my wisdom, powerful in my might, and pure through my holiness.
