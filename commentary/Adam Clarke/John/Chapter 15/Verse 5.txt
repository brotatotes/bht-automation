<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:5">John 15:5</span>. <i><b>Without me ye can do nothing.</b></i> — Χωρις εμου ου δυνασθε ποιειν ουδεν - <i>Separated from me, ye can do nothing at all</i>. God can do without man, but man cannot do without God. Following the metaphor of our Lord, it would be just as possible to do any good without him, as for a branch to live, thrive, and bring forth fruit, while cut off from that tree from which it not only derives its juices, but its very existence also.</p>
<p>Nearly similar to this saying of our Lord, is that of <i>Creeshna</i> (the incarnate God of the Hindoos) to his disciple <i>Arjoon</i>: "God is the <i>gift</i> of charity; God is the <i>offering</i>: God is the <i>fire</i> of the altar; by God the <i>sacrifice</i> is performed; and God is to be obtained by him who maketh God alone the object of his works." And again: "I am the <i>sacrifice</i>; I am the <i>worship</i>; I am the <i>spices</i>; I am the <i>invocation</i>; I am the <i>fire</i>; and I am the <i>victim</i>. I am the <i>Father</i> and <i>Mother</i> of this world, and the <i>Preserver</i>. I am the <i>Holy One</i>, worthy to be known; the <i>mystic figure</i> OM; (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>;) I am the <i>journey</i> of the good; the <i>Comforter</i>; the <i>Creator</i>; the <i>Witness</i>; the <i>resting-place</i>; the <i>asylum</i>, and the <i>Friend</i>. <i>I am the place</i> <i>of all things</i>; and the inexhaustible seed of nature; I am sunshine, and I am rain; I now draw in, and now let forth." See Bhagvat Geeta, pp. 54 and 80. Could such sentiments as these ever come from any other source than Divine revelation? There is a saying in <i>Theophilus</i> very similar to one of those above: Θεος ου χωρειται, αλλα αυτος εστι τοπος των ὁλων. - God is not comprehended, but he <i>is the place of all things</i>.</p>
