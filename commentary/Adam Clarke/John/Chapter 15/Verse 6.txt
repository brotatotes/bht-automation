<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:6">John 15:6</span>. <i><b>If a man abide not in me</b></i> — Our Lord in the plainest manner intimates that a person may as truly be united to him as the branch is to the tree that produces it, and yet be afterwards cut off and cast into the fire; <i>because he has not brought forth</i> <i>fruit to the glory of his God</i>. No man can cut off a branch from a tree to which that branch was <i>never united</i>: it is absurd, and contrary to the letter and spirit of the metaphor, to talk of being <i>seemingly</i> in Christ-because this means nothing. If there was only a <i>seeming</i> union, there could be only a seeming <i>excision</i>: so the matter is just where it began; nothing is done on either side, and nothing said to any purpose.</p>
<p><i><b>He is cast forth</b></i> — Observe, that person who abides not in Christ, in a believing loving, obedient spirit, is -</p>
<p>1. <i>Cut off</i> from Jesus, having no longer any right or title to him or to his salvation.</p>
<p>2. He is <i>withered </i>- deprived of all the influences of God's grace and Spirit; loses all his heavenly unction; becomes indifferent, cold, and dead to every holy and spiritual word and work.</p>
<p>3. He is <i>gathered </i>- becomes (through the judgment of God) again united with backsliders like himself and other workers of iniquity; and, being abandoned to his own heart and Satan, he is,</p>
<p>4. <i>Cast into the</i> <i>fire </i>- separated from God's people, from God himself, and from the glory of his power. And,</p>
<p>5. <i>He is burned </i>- is eternally tormented with the devil and his angels, and with all those who have lived and died in their iniquity. Reader! pray God that this may never be thy portion.</p>
