Geeta, p. 59.</p>
<p>Observe, in order to have influence with God, we must -</p>
<p>1. Be united to Christ - <i>if ye abide in me</i>.</p>
<p>2. That in order to be preserved in this union, we must have our lives regulated by the doctrine of Christ-<i>and my words abide in you</i>.</p>
<p>3. That to profit by this union and doctrine, we must <i>pray - ye shall ask</i>.</p>
<p>4. That every heavenly blessing shall be given to those who continue in this union, with a loving, obedient, praying spirit: - <i>ye shall ask what</i> <i>ye will</i>, &amp;c.</p>
