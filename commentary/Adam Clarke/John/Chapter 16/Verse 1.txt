Verse John 16:1. These things have I spoken — Particularly what is mentioned in the two last chapters.Be offended. — Ἱνα μη σκανδαλισθητε, That ye should not be stumbled. May not fall away from the faith, nor receive any injury to your souls, as that man does to his body who stumbles, or falls over a stone, or block, in the way which he has not discovered.
