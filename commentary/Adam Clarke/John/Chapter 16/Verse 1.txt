<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:1">John 16:1</span>. <i><b>These things have I spoken</b></i> — Particularly what is mentioned in the two last chapters.</p>
<p><i><b>Be offended.</b></i> — Ἱνα μη σκανδαλισθητε, <i>That ye should not be</i> <i>stumbled</i>. May not fall away from the faith, nor receive any injury to your souls, as that man does to his body who <i>stumbles</i>, or falls over a <i>stone</i>, or <i>block</i>, in the way which he has not discovered.</p>
