<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:10">John 16:10</span>. <i><b>Of righteousness</b></i> â€” Of my <i>innocence</i> and <i>holiness</i>, because I go away to my Father; of which my resurrection from the dead, and my ascension to heaven, shall be complete proofs. Christ was treated by the Jews as an <i>impostor</i>; as a <i>magician</i>; as one <i>possessed by the devil</i>; as a <i>wicked person, seducer</i>, and <i>destroyer</i> of the <i>law</i>. His vindication from these charges he chiefly referred to the Holy Spirit, the <i>Advocate</i>, who, by his influences on the minds of the people, and by his eloquence and energy in the ministry of the apostles, convinced both the Jews and the Gentiles that the sentence of the Jewish rulers was <i>unjust</i> and <i>infamous</i>, and that the very person whom they had crucified was both <i>Lord</i> and <i>Christ - Lord</i>, the great governor of the universe; and <i>Christ</i>, the Lord's anointed, the promised <i>Messiah</i>. It was a matter of the utmost consequence to the Christian cause to have the <i>innocence</i> and <i>holiness</i> of its founder <i>demonstrated</i>, and the crime of the Jews in putting him to death made manifest to the world. This also has been literally fulfilled: the universe that has heard of him believes the righteousness and innocence of Jesus; and the Jews, his persecutors, are confounded and execrated throughout the habitable globe.</p>
