<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span>. <i><b>Of judgment</b></i> â€” Of the false judgment of the Jews in condemning the Lord Jesus, who, as some think, is intended here by <i>the ruler of this world</i>: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span>. Others think that <i>Satan</i> is meant whose usurped power over the world was now to be greatly restrained, and by and by totally destroyed: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10-11">Revelation 12:10-11</span>. Perhaps our Lord's meaning is, that as a most astonishing judgement, or punishment, was now about to fall upon the Jews, in consequence of their obstinate infidelity, the Holy Ghost, by the ministry of the apostles, should <i>demonstrate</i> that this judgment, severe as it might seem, was amply merited by this worst of all people; and may we not say that their continuance in the same crime sufficiently vindicates the judgment of God, not only in its being poured out upon them at <i>first</i>, but in <i>continuing</i> to pursue them?</p>
<p>It is necessary to observe that it was one office of the Spirit to convince of a <i>judgment to come</i>; and this he did particularly by the apostles, in declaring that God had appointed a day in which he would judge the world by him whom he had appointed for that purpose: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>. And we find that while Peter was asserting this doctrine at Caesarea, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:42">Acts 10:42</span>, the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Jews and the Gentiles which were present, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44">Acts 10:44</span>, c., and many were converted unto the Lord.</p>
<p>One general exposition may be given of these three verses. The Holy Spirit will <i>convince the world of sin</i> committed, and guilt and condemnation thereby incurred. Of <i>righteousness </i>- of the necessity of being pardoned, and made righteous through the blood of the Lamb, who, after being offered up for sin, went to the Father, ever to appear in his presence as our intercessor: and of <i>judgment </i>- of the <i>great day</i> thereof, when none shall be able to stand but those whose <i>sins</i> are pardoned, and whose souls are made <i>righteous</i>. In all that our Lord says here, there seems to be an allusion to the office of an <i>advocate</i> in a cause, in a court of justice who, by producing witnesses, and pleading upon the proof, <i>convicts</i> the <i>opposite</i> party of <i>sin, demonstrates</i> the <i>righteousness</i> of his client, and shows the necessity of passing <i>judgment</i> upon the accuser.</p>
<p>The faith of the Gospel discovers unto us <i>three</i> different states of man: it shows him:</p>
<p>1. Under <i>sin</i>, in which there is nothing but infidelity towards God, because there is no faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>2. Under <i>grace</i>, in which sin is pardoned, and righteousness acquired by faith in Christ; who is gone to the Father to carry on, by his intercession, the great work of redemption.</p>
<p>3. In the <i>peace</i> and <i>glory</i> of <i>heaven</i>, where Christ will reign with his members; the devil, with his angels and servants, being banished into hell by the last <i>judgment</i>.</p>
<p>Thus, in the Christian revelation, we are made acquainted with <i>three</i> grand truths, which contain the sum and substance of all true religion.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> is the general <i>corruption</i> of human nature, and the <i>reign</i> of sin till the coming of Christ.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> is the <i>reparation</i> of our nature by the Lord Jesus, and the <i>reign</i> of <i>righteousness</i> by his grace: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> is the <i>condemnation</i> of sinners, and the total destruction of the kingdom of sin, and of all the power of the devil, by the last judgment.</p>
