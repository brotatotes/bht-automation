<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:12">John 16:12</span>. <i><b>Ye cannot bear them now.</b></i> â€” In illustration of these three points, Christ had many things to say; but he found that his disciples could only bear general truths; yet, in saying what he did, he sowed the <i>seeds</i> of the whole system of theological knowledge, and heavenly wisdom, which the Holy Spirit of this truth afterwards <i>watered</i> and <i>ripened</i> into a glorious <i>harvest</i> of light and salvation, by the ministry of the apostles. Dr. Lightfoot supposes that the things which the apostles could not bear now were such as these:</p>
<p>1. The institution of the Christian Sabbath, and the abolition of the Jewish.</p>
<p>2. The rejection of the whole Jewish nation, at the very time in which they expected to be set up and established for ever.</p>
<p>3. The entire change of the whole Mosaic dispensation, and the bringing the Gentiles into the Church of God.</p>
