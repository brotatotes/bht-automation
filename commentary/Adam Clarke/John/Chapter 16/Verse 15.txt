Verse John 16:15. All things that the Father hath are mine — If Christ had not been equal to God, could he have said this without blasphemy?And show it unto you. — As Christ is represented the Ambassador of the Father, so the Holy Spirit is represented the ambassador of the Son, coming vested with his authority, as the interpreter and executor of his will.
