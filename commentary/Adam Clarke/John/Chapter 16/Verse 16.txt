Verse John 16:16. A little while — He had but a few hours to live.And ye shall not see me — I shall be hidden from your view in the grave.Again a little while — In three days after my death:Ye shall see me — I will rise again, and show myself to you. Or, As I am going by my ascension to the Father, in a short time, ye shall see me personally no more; but in a little while I shall pour out my Spirit upon you, and others through your ministry; and ye shall see me virtually in the great and wonderful work which shall then take place in the hearts and lives of men.This may also refer to his coming again to destroy the Jewish state, and also to judge the world; but how can this latter be said to be in a little while? Because a thousand years are but as a day in the sight of God: Psalms 90:4.
