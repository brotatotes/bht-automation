<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:16">John 16:16</span>. <i><b>A little while</b></i> — He had but a few hours to live.</p>
<p><i><b>And ye shall not see me</b></i> — I shall be hidden from your view in the grave.</p>
<p><i><b>Again a little while</b></i> — In three days after my death:</p>
<p><i><b>Ye shall see me</b></i> — I will rise again, and show myself to you. Or, As I am going by my ascension to the Father, in a short time, ye shall see me personally no more; but in a little while I shall pour out my Spirit upon you, and others through your ministry; and ye shall see me <i>virtually</i> in the great and wonderful work which shall then take place in the hearts and lives of men.</p>
<p>This may also refer to his coming again to destroy the Jewish state, and also to judge the world; but how can this <i>latter</i> be said to be in a <i>little while</i>? Because a thousand years are but as a day in the sight of God: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+90:4">Psalms 90:4</span>.</p>
