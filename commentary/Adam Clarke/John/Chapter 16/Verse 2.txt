<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:2">John 16:2</span>. <i><b>They shall put you out of the synagogues</b></i> â€” They will <i>excommunicate</i> you, and consider you as execrable, and utterly unworthy to hold any commerce with God by religion; or with man by civil fellowship. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:22">John 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:22">John 9:22</span></span>. In these excommunications they were spoiled of all their substance, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ezr+10:8">Ezra 10:8</span>, and see also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:34">Hebrews 10:34</span>, and deprived of their character, their influence, and every necessary of life. Though the Jewish people had the most humane laws, yet they were a most vindictive and cruel people.</p>
<p><i><b>That whosoever killeth you</b></i>, c.] This Paul found for more than forty Jews bound themselves under a curse that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed <i>him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:12-13">Acts 23:12-13</span>; and agreeably to this, it is said, in that Tract of the <i>Talmud</i> which is entitled <i>Bammidbar</i>, R. xxi. ad. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:13">Numbers 25:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:13">Numbers 25:13</span>: "He who sheds the blood of the ungodly, is equal to him who brings an offering to God." What the Zealots did is notorious in history. They butchered any person, in cold blood, who, they pretended to believe, was an enemy to God, to the law, or to Moses; and thought <i>they</i> were fulfilling the will of God by these human sacrifices. We had the same kind of sacrifices here in the time of our Popish Queen Mary. May God ever save our state from the <i>Stuarts</i>!</p>
