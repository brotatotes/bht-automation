<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:20">John 16:20</span>. <i><b>Ye shall weep and lament</b></i> — To see me crucified and laid in the grave.</p>
<p><i><b>But the world shall rejoice</b></i> — The chief priests, scribes, Pharisees, and persecuting Jews in general, will triumph, hoping that their bad cause is crowned with success.</p>
<p><i><b>But your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</b></i> — When ye see me risen from the dead.</p>
<p>It is very evident that our Lord uses the word <i>world</i>, in several parts of this discourse of his, to signify the <i>unbelieving</i> and <i>rebellious Jews</i>.</p>
