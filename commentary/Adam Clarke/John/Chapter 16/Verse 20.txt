Verse John 16:20. Ye shall weep and lament — To see me crucified and laid in the grave.But the world shall rejoice — The chief priests, scribes, Pharisees, and persecuting Jews in general, will triumph, hoping that their bad cause is crowned with success.But your sorrow shall be turned into joy. — When ye see me risen from the dead.It is very evident that our Lord uses the word world, in several parts of this discourse of his, to signify the unbelieving and rebellious Jews.
