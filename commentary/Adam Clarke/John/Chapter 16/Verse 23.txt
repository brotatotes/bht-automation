<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Ye shall ask me nothing.</b></i> â€” Ye shall then be led, by that Spirit which guides into all truth, to consider <i>me</i> in the character of <i>Mediator</i> in the kingdom of God, and to address your prayers to the Father <i>in my name </i>- in the name of <i>Jesus</i> the <i>Saviour</i>, because I have died to <i>redeem</i> you - in the name of Christ the <i>Anointer</i>, because I have ascended to send down the gift of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>.</p>
