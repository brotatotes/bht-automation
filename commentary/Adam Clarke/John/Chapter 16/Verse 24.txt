<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name</b></i> — Ye have not as yet considered me the great <i>Mediator</i> between God and man; but this is one of the truths which shall be <i>more fully revealed</i> to you by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>Ask</b></i> — In my name; and <i>ye shall receive</i>-all the salvation ye thus request; the consequence of which shall be that <i>your joy shall be</i> <i>full</i>-ye shall be thoroughly <i>happy</i> in being made completely <i>holy</i>.</p>
