<p>Verse 26. <i><b>I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for</b></i><b> </b><i><b>you</b></i> â€” I need not tell you that I will continue your intercessor: I have given you already so many proofs of my love that ye cannot possibly doubt this: besides, the Father himself needs no entreaty to do you good, for he <i>loves you</i>, and is graciously disposed to save you to the uttermost, because <i>ye have loved me and believed</i> <i>in me as coming from God</i>, for the salvation of the world.</p>
