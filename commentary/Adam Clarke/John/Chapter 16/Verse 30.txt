<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:30">John 16:30</span>. <i><b>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things</b></i> â€” Is not the following the meaning of the disciples? We believe that thou art not only the <i>Messiah who camest out from God</i>, but that thou art that <i>God</i> who <i>searchest</i> the <i>heart</i> and <i>triest</i> the <i>reins</i>, and <i>needest not to be asked</i> in order to make thee acquainted with the necessities of thy creatures; for thou perfectly knowest their wants, and art infinitely disposed to relieve them.</p>
