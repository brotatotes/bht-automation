<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span>. <i><b>The hour cometh</b></i> â€” Ye shall shortly have need of all the faith ye profess: ye now believe me to be the <i>Omniscient</i>; but ye will find difficulty to maintain this faith when ye see me seized, condemned, and crucified as a malefactor. Yea, your faith will be then so shaken that ye shall run away, each striving to save himself at his <i>own home</i>, or among his <i>kindred</i>.</p>
