<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:9">John 16:9</span>. <i><b>Of sin</b></i> — Of the sin of the Jews in not receiving me as the Messiah, though my mission was accredited by the very miracles which the prophets foretold: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:3-6">Isaiah 35:3-6</span>. This was literally fulfilled on the day of pentecost, when the Spirit was given; for multitudes of Jews were then convinced of this sin, and converted to God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:37">Acts 2:37</span>.</p>
<p>If we take this prediction of our Lord in a more general sense, then we may consider that it is one of the grand offices of the Holy Spirit <i>to convince of sin</i>, to show men what sin is, to demonstrate to them that they <i>are</i> sinners, and to show the necessity of an <i>atonement</i> for sin; and in this sense the phrase, περι αμαρτιας, may be understood, and in this sense it is used in multitudes of places in the Septuagint, but the words, <i>because</i> <i>they believe not in me</i>, restrict the meaning particularly to the <i>sin</i> of the <i>Jews</i> in rejecting Jesus as the Messiah.</p>
