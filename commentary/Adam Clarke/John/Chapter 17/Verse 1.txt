<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>. <i><b>These words spake Jesus</b></i> — That is, what is related in the preceding chapters. We may consider our Lord as still moving on towards Gethsemane, not having yet passed the brook Cedron, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:1">John 18:1</span>.</p>
<p>Our Lord, who was now going to act as <i>high priest</i> for the whole human race, imitates in his conduct that of the Jewish high priest on the great day of <i>expiation</i>; who, in order to offer up the grand atonement for the sins of the people:-</p>
<p>1. <i>Washed</i> himself, and put on <i>clean linen garments</i>. This Christ appears to have imitated, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:4">John 13:4</span>. He laid aside his garments, girded himself with a towel, c. There is no room to doubt that he and his disciples had been at the <i>bath</i> before: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:10">John 13:10</span>.</p>
<p>2. The high priest addressed a solemn <i>prayer</i> to God:</p>
<p>1. For <i>himself</i> this Christ imitates, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1-5">John 17:1-5</span>.</p>
<p>2. For the <i>sons of Aaron</i>: our Lord imitates this in praying for his <i>disciples</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:9-19">John 17:9-19</span>.</p>
<p>3. For all the people: our Lord appears to imitate this also in praying for his <i>Church</i>, all who should believe on him through the preaching of the apostles and their successors, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20-24">John 17:20-24</span>. After which he returns again to his disciples, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:26">John 17:26</span>. See CALMET'S Dict. under <i>Expiation</i> and see La Grande Bible de M. MARTIN, <i>in loc</i>.</p>
<p>I. Our Lord's prayer for himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1-5">John 17:1-5</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Father</b></i> — Here our Lord addresses the whole Divine nature, as he is now performing his last acts in his state of humiliation.</p>
<p><i><b>Glorify thy Son</b></i> — Cause him to be acknowledged as the promised Messiah by the Jewish people, and as the universal Saviour by the Gentile world; and let such proofs of his Godhead be given as shall serve to convince and instruct mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>That thy son also may glorify thee</b></i> — That by dying be may magnify thy law and make it honourable, respected among men-show the strictness of thy justice, and the immaculate purity of thy nature.</p>
