Verse John 17:11. I am no more in the world — I am just going to leave the world, and therefore they shall stand in need of peculiar assistance and support. They have need of all the influence of my intercession, that they may be preserved in thy truth.Keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me — Instead of ους δεδωκας μοι, THOSE whom thou hast given me, ABCEHLMS, Mt. BHV, and nearly one hundred others, read ω, which refers to the τω ονοματι σου, thy name, immediately preceding. The whole passage should be read thus: Holy Father, keep them through thy own name WHICH thou hast given me, that they may be one, c. By the name, here, it is evident that the doctrine or knowledge of the true God is intended as if our Lord had said, Keep them in that doctrine WHICH thou hast given me, that they may be one, &c. This reading is supported by the most ample evidence and indisputable authority. Griesbach has admitted it into the text, and Professor White in his CRISEΩS says of it, Lectio indubie genuina, "It is, without doubt, the genuine reading."That they may be ONE — That they, and all that believe through their word, (the doctrine which I have given them,) may be one body, united by one Spirit to me their living head. The union which Christ recommends here, and prays for, is so complete and glorious as to be fitly represented by that union which subsists between the Father and the Son.
