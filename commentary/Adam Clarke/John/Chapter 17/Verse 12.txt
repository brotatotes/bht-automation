<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>. <i><b>I kept them in thy name</b></i> — In thy doctrine and truth.</p>
<p><i><b>But the son of perdition</b></i> — So we find that Judas, whom all account to have been <i>lost</i>, and whose case at best is extremely dubious, was first <i>given</i> by God to Christ? But why was he lost? Because, says St. <i>Augustin</i>, he <i>would</i> not be saved: and he farther adds, After the commission of his crime, he might have returned to God and have found mercy. Aug. Serm. 125; n. 5; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+146:0">Psalms 146:0</span> n. 20; Ser. 352, n. 8; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+108:0">Psalms 108:0</span> See <i>Calmet</i>, who remarks: Judas only became the <i>son of perdition</i> because of his wilful malice, his abuse of the grace and instructions of Christ, and was condemned through his own <i>avarice, perfidy, insensibility</i>, and <i>despair</i>. In behalf of the <i>mere possibility</i> of the salvation of Judas, see the observations at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:0">Acts 1:0</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:0- :">Acts 1:0- :</span></p>
<p><i>Perdition</i> or <i>destruction</i> is personified; and Judas is represented as being her <i>son</i>, i.e. one of the <i>worst</i> of men-one whose crime appears to have been an attempt to <i>destroy</i>, not only the <i>Saviour</i> of the world, but also the whole <i>human race</i>. And all this he was capable of through the <i>love of money</i>! How many of those who are termed <i>creditable persons</i> in the world have acted his crime over a thousand times! To Judas and to all his brethren, who sell God and their souls for money, and who frequently go out of this world by a violent voluntary death, we may apply those burning words of Mr. Blair, with very little alteration: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "O cursed lust of gold! when for thy sake</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The wretch throws up his interest in <i>both</i> worlds,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> First <i>hanged</i> in this, then <i>damned</i> in that to come."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p><i><b>That the scripture might be fulfilled.</b></i> — Or, <i>Thus the scripture</i> <i>is fulfilled</i>: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9">Psalms 41:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:8">Psalms 109:8</span>; compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:20">Acts 1:20</span>. Thus the traitorous conduct of Judas has been represented and illustrated by that of <i>Ahitophel</i>, and the rebellion of <i>Absalom</i> against his father <i>David</i>. Thus what was spoken concerning them was also fulfilled in Judas: to him therefore these scriptures are properly applied, though they were originally spoken concerning other traitors. Hence we plainly see that the treachery of Judas was not the effect of the prediction, for that related to a different case; but, as his was of the same nature with that of the others, to it the same scriptures were applicable.</p>
