Verse John 17:14. I have given them thy word — Or, thy doctrine - του λογον σου. In this sense the word λογος is often used by St. John.And the world hath hated them — The Jewish rulers, &c., have hated them. - Why? Because they received the doctrine of God, the science of salvation, and taught it to others. They knew Jesus to be the Messiah, and as such they proclaimed him: our Lord speaks prophetically of what was about to take place. How terrible is the perversion of human nature! Men despise that which they should esteem, and endeavour to destroy that without which they must be destroyed themselves!
