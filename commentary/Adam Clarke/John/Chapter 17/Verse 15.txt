<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>. <i><b>That thou shouldest take them out of the world</b></i> — They must not yet leave the land of Judea: they had not as yet borne their testimony there, concerning Christ crucified and risen again from the dead. To take them away before this work was finished would not answer the gracious design of God. -</p>
<p>1. Christ does not desire that his faithful apostles should <i>soon</i> die, and be taken to God. No: but that they may <i>live long, labour long</i>, and bring forth <i>much fruit</i>.</p>
<p>2. He does not intimate that they should <i>seclude</i> themselves from the world by going to the <i>desert</i>, or to the <i>cloisters</i>; but that they should continue <i>in</i> and <i>among</i> the world, that they may have the opportunity of recommending the salvation of God.</p>
<p>3. Christ only prays that <i>while</i> they are <i>in the world</i>, employed in the work of the ministry, they may be preserved from the influence, του πονηρου, of <i>the evil one</i>, the <i>devil</i>, who had lately entered into Judas, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:27">John 13:27</span>, and who would endeavour to enter into <i>them</i>, ruin their souls, and destroy their work. A devil <i>without</i> can do no harm; but a devil <i>within</i> ruins all.</p>
