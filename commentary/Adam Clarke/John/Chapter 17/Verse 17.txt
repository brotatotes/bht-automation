<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span>. <i><b>Sanctify them</b></i> — αγιασον, from α, <i>negative</i>, and γη, <i>the earth</i>. This word has <i>two</i> meanings:</p>
<p>1. It signifies to <i>consecrate</i>, to <i>separate</i> from <i>earth</i> and <i>common use</i>, and to <i>devote</i> or <i>dedicate</i> to God and his service.</p>
<p>2. It signifies to <i>make holy</i> or <i>pure</i>. The prayer of Christ may be understood in <i>both</i> these senses. He prayed -</p>
<p>1. That they might be fully <i>consecrated</i> to the work of the ministry, and <i>separated</i> from all <i>worldly</i> concerns.</p>
<p>2. That they might be <i>holy</i>, and <i>patterns</i> of all holiness to those to whom they announced the salvation of God. A minister who engages himself in <i>worldly</i> concerns is a reproach to the Gospel; and he who is <i>not saved</i> from his own <i>sins</i> can with a bad grace recommend salvation to <i>others</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Through thy truth</b></i> — It is not only <i>according</i> to the <i>truth</i> of God that ministers are to be set apart to the sacred work; but it is <i>from</i> that <i>truth</i>, and <i>according</i> to it, that they must preach to others. That doctrine which is not drawn from the <i>truth of God</i> can never save souls. God blesses no word but his own; because none is truth, without mixture of error, but that which has proceeded from himself. Our Lord still acts here in reference to the conduct of the high priest, to whom it belonged to <i>sanctify</i> the priests, the sons of Aaron: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>.</p>
