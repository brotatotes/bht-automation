<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>. <i><b>I sanctify myself</b></i> — I <i>consecrate</i> and <i>devote</i> myself to death-that I may thereby purchase eternal salvation for them. There seems to be here an allusion to the <i>entering</i> of the high priest into the holy of holies, when, having offered the sacrifice, he sprinkled the blood before the ark of the covenant. So Jesus entered into the holiest of all by his own blood, in order to obtain everlasting redemption for men: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11-13">Hebrews 9:11-13</span>. The word, αγιαζω, to <i>consecrate</i> or <i>sanctify</i>, is used in the sense of <i>devoting</i> to death, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+12:3">Jeremiah 12:3</span>, both in the <i>Hebrew</i> and in the <i>Septuagint</i>: the Hebrew קדש signifies also to <i>sacrifice</i>.</p>
