Verse John 17:2. As thou hast given him power â€” As the Messiah, Jesus Christ received from the Father universal dominion. All flesh, i.e. all the human race, was given unto him, that by one sacrifice of himself, he might reconcile them all to God; having by his grace tasted death for every man, Hebrews 2:9. And this was according to the promise of the universal inheritance made to Christ, Psalms 2:8, which was to be made up of the heathen, and the uttermost parts of the land, all the Jewish people. So that he got all from God, that he might give his life a ransom for the whole. See 2 Corinthians 5:14-15; Romans 5:21; 1 Timothy 2:4; 1 Timothy 2:6.That he should have eternal life, c.] As all were delivered into his power, and he poured out his blood to redeem all, then the design of God is that all should have eternal life, because all are given for this purpose to Christ and, that this end might be accomplished, he has become their sacrifice and atonement.
