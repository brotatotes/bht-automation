<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>. <i><b>As thou hast given him power</b></i> â€” As the Messiah, Jesus Christ received from the Father <i>universal dominion</i>. <i>All flesh</i>, i.e. all the <i>human race</i>, was given unto him, that by one sacrifice of himself, he might reconcile them all to God; having by his grace tasted death for every man, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>. And this was according to the promise of the <i>universal inheritance</i> made to Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:8">Psalms 2:8</span>, which was to be made up of the <i>heathen</i>, and the <i>uttermost parts of the land</i>, all the Jewish people. So that he got <i>all</i> from God, that he might give his life a ransom for the whole. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14-15">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:6">1 Timothy 2:6</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That he should have eternal life</b></i>, c.] As all were delivered into his <i>power</i>, and he poured out his blood to redeem all, then the design of God is that all should have <i>eternal life</i>, because all are <i>given</i> for this purpose to Christ and, that this end might be accomplished, he has become their sacrifice and atonement.</p>
