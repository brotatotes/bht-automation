<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>. <i><b>That they all may be one</b></i> — This prayer was literally answered to the <i>first</i> believers, who were all of <i>one heart</i> and of <i>one soul</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32">Acts 4:32</span>. And why is it that believers are not in the same spirit now? Because they neither attend to the <i>example</i> nor to the <i>truth</i> of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>That the world may believe</b></i> — are have already seen that the word, κοσμος, <i>world</i>, is used in several parts of this last discourse of our Lord to signify the <i>Jewish people</i> only.</p>
<p>Christ will have all his members to be <i>one</i> in <i>spirit-one</i> in <i>rights</i> and <i>privileges</i>, and <i>one</i> in the <i>blessedness</i> of the future <i>world</i>.</p>
