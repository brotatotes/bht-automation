Verse John 17:21. That they all may be one — This prayer was literally answered to the first believers, who were all of one heart and of one soul: Acts 4:32. And why is it that believers are not in the same spirit now? Because they neither attend to the example nor to the truth of Christ.That the world may believe — are have already seen that the word, κοσμος, world, is used in several parts of this last discourse of our Lord to signify the Jewish people only.Christ will have all his members to be one in spirit-one in rights and privileges, and one in the blessedness of the future world.
