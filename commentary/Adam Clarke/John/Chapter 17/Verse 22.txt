<p>Verse 22. <i><b>And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them</b></i> â€” That is, the power to work miracles, and to preach unadulterated truth, say some; but as our Lord is not here praying for the <i>disciples</i>, but for <i>all those who should believe on him through</i> <i>their word</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span>, it is more natural to understand the passage thus. As Christ, according to his <i>human</i> nature, is termed the <i>Son of God</i>, he may be understood as saying: "I have communicated to all those who believe, or shall believe in me, the glorious privilege of becoming <i>sons of God</i>; that, being all adopted children of the same Father, they may abide in <i>peace,</i> <i>love</i>, and <i>unity</i>." For this reason it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span>, Christ is not ashamed to call them <i>brethren</i>. However, our Lord may here, as in several other places, be using the <i>past</i> for the <i>future</i>; and the words may therefore be understood of the glory which they were to share with him in <i>heaven</i>.</p>
