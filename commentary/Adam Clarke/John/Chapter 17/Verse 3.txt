<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>. <i><b>This is life eternal</b></i> — The salvation purchased by Christ, and given to them who believe, is called <i>life</i>:</p>
<p>1. Because the life of man was <i>forfeited</i> to Divine justice; and the sacrifice of Christ redeemed him from that <i>death</i> to which he was exposed.</p>
<p>2. Because the souls of men were <i>dead</i> in trespasses and sins; and Christ <i>quickens</i> them by his <i>word</i> and <i>Spirit</i>.</p>
<p>3. Because men who are not saved by the grace of Christ do not <i>live</i>, they only <i>exist</i>, no good purpose of life being answered by them. But when they receive this salvation they <i>live </i>- answer all the Divine purposes, are <i>happy</i> in themselves, <i>useful</i> to each other, and bring <i>glory</i> to God.</p>
<p>4. <i>It is called eternal life</i> to show that it reaches <i>beyond</i> the limits of time, and that it necessarily implies -</p>
<p>1. The <i>immortality</i> of the soul;</p>
<p>2. the <i>resurrection</i> of the body; and</p>
<p>3. that it is <i>never to end</i>, hence called αιωνιος ζωη, a <i>life ever</i> <i>living</i>; from αει, <i>always</i>, and ων, <i>being</i> or <i>existence</i>. And indeed no words can more forcibly convey the idea of <i>eternity</i> than these. It is called η αιωνιος ζωη, THAT <i>eternal life</i>, by way of eminence. There may be an <i>eternal existence</i> without <i>blessedness</i>; but this is that eternal life with which <i>infinite</i> <i>happiness</i> is inseparably connected.</p>
<p><i><b>The only true God</b></i> — The way to attain this eternal life is to acknowledge, worship, and obey, the one only true God, and to accept as teacher, sacrifice, and Saviour, the Lord Jesus, the one and only true Messiah. Bishop <i>Pearce's</i> remark here is well worthy the reader's attention: -</p>
<p>"What is said here of the <i>only true God</i> seems said in opposition to the gods whom the heathens worshipped; not in opposition to Jesus Christ himself, who is called <i>the true God</i> by John, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>."</p>
<p>The words in this verse have been variously translated:</p>
<p>1. That they might acknowledge thee, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent, to be the only true God.</p>
<p>2. That they might acknowledge thee, the only true God, and Jesus, whom thou hast sent, to be the <i>Christ</i> or <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
<p>3. That they might acknowledge thee to be the only true God, and Jesus Christ to be him whom thou hast sent. And all these translations the original will bear.</p>
<p>From all this we learn that the only way in which <i>eternal life</i> is to be attained is by acknowledging the true God, and the Divine mission of Jesus Christ, he being sent of God to redeem men by his blood, being the author of eternal salvation to all them that thus believe, and conscientiously keep his commandments.</p>
<p>A saying similar to this is found in the Institutes of Menu. <i>Brigoo</i>, the first emanated being who was produced from the mind of the supreme God, and who revealed the knowledge of his will to mankind, is represented as addressing the human race and saying: "Of all duties, the principal is to acquire from the <i>Upanishads</i> (their sacred writings) a <i>true knowledge</i> of <i>one supreme God</i>; that is the <i>most exalted</i> of sciences, because it ensures <i>eternal life</i>. For in the <i>knowledge</i> and <i>adoration</i> of <i>one God</i> all the <i>rules</i> of <i>good conduct</i> are fully comprised." See <i>Institutes of Menu</i>, chap. xii. Inst. 85, 87.</p>
