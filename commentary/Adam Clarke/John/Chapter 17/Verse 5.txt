Verse John 17:5. Before the world was. â€” That is, from eternity, before there was any creation-so the phrase, and others similar to it, are taken in the sacred writings; see John 17:24; Psalms 90:2; Ephesians 1:4. See John 1:1. Let the glory of my eternal divinity surround and penetrate my humanity, in its resurrection, ascension, and in the place which it is to occupy at thy right hand, far above all creatures, Philippians 2:6; Philippians 2:9.
