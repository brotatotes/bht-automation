<p>II. Our Lord's prayer for his disciples, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6-19">John 17:6-19</span>.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6">John 17:6</span>. <i><b>I have manifested thy name</b></i> — εφανερωσα, I have brought it into <i>light</i>, and caused it to <i>shine</i> in itself, and to <i>illuminate</i> others. A <i>little</i> of the Divine nature was known by the <i>works of</i> <i>creation</i>; a little <i>more</i> was known by the <i>Mosaic revelation</i>: but the full <i>manifestation</i> of God, his nature, and his attributes, came only through the revelation of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>The men which thou gavest me</b></i> — That is, the <i>apostles</i>, who, having received this knowledge from Christ, were, by their preaching and writings, to spread it through the whole world.</p>
<p><i><b>Out of the world</b></i> — From among the Jewish people; for in this sense is the word κοσμος to be understood in various parts of our Lord's last discourses.</p>
<p><i><b>Thine they were</b></i> — Objects of thy <i>choice; and thou gavest them to</i> <i>me</i> from among this very unbelieving people, that they might be my disciples and the heralds of my salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>And they have kept thy word.</b></i> — Though their countrymen have rejected it; and they have received me as thy well beloved Son in whom thou delightest.</p>
