II. Our Lord's prayer for his disciples, John 17:6-19.Verse John 17:6. I have manifested thy name — εφανερωσα, I have brought it into light, and caused it to shine in itself, and to illuminate others. A little of the Divine nature was known by the works of creation; a little more was known by the Mosaic revelation: but the full manifestation of God, his nature, and his attributes, came only through the revelation of Christ.The men which thou gavest me — That is, the apostles, who, having received this knowledge from Christ, were, by their preaching and writings, to spread it through the whole world.Out of the world — From among the Jewish people; for in this sense is the word κοσμος to be understood in various parts of our Lord's last discourses.Thine they were — Objects of thy choice; and thou gavest them to me from among this very unbelieving people, that they might be my disciples and the heralds of my salvation.And they have kept thy word. — Though their countrymen have rejected it; and they have received me as thy well beloved Son in whom thou delightest.
