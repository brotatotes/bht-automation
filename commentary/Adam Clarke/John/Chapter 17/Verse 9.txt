<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:9">John 17:9</span>. <i><b>I pray not for the world</b></i> â€” I am not yet come to that part of my intercession: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span>. I am now wholly employed for my disciples, that they may be properly qualified to preach my salvation to the ends of the earth. Jesus here imitates the high priest, the second part of whose prayer, on the day of expiation, was for the <i>priests</i>, the <i>sons of Aaron</i>: <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span></span>. These words may also be understood as applying to the rebellious Jews. God's wrath was about to descend upon them, and Christ prays that his own followers might be kept from the evil, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>. But he does not thus pray for the <i>world</i>, the rebellious Jews, because the cup of their iniquity was full, and their judgment slumbered not.</p>
