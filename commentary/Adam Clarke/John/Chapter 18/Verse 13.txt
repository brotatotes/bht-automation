<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>. <i><b>To Annas</b></i> — This man must have had great authority in his nation:</p>
<p>1. Because he had been a long time high priest;</p>
<p>2. Because he had no less than five sons who successively enjoyed the dignity of the high priesthood; and,</p>
<p>3. Because his son-in-law <i>Caiaphas</i> was at this time in possession of that office. It is likely that <i>Annas</i> was chief of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, and that it was to him in that office that Christ was <i>first</i> brought. Some think that <i>Annas</i> was still high priest, and that <i>Caiaphas</i> was only his <i>deputy</i>, though he did the principal part of the business, and that it as because of this that he is called high priest. But see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4">Matthew 2:4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That same year.</b></i> — The office was now no longer <i>during life</i> as formerly. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:49">John 11:49</span>.</p>
<p>What is related in the 24th verse, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24">John 18:24</span>, <i>Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas</i>, comes properly in after the 13th verse. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span> One of the Vienna MSS. adds this verse here; the later <i>Syriac</i> has it in the margin, and St. <i>Cyril</i> in the text.
