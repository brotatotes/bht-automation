Verse John 18:14. Caiaphas was he which gave counsel, &c.] Therefore he was an improper person to sit in judgment on Christ, whom he had prejudged and precondemned: see on John 11:50-52. But Christ must not be treated according to the rules of justice: if he had, he could not have been put to death.
