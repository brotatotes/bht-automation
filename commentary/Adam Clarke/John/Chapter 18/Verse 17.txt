Verse John 18:17. The damsel that kept the door — Caezarius, a writer quoted by Calmet, says this portress was named Ballila. It is worthy of remark that women, especially old women, were employed by the ancients as porters. In 2Sa 4:6, both the Septuagint and Vulgate make a woman porter to Ishbosheth. ARISTOPHANES, in Vespis,John 18:0v. 765, mentions them in the same office and calls them Σηκις, Sekis, which seems to signify a common maid-servant: -Ὁτι την θυραν ανεῳξεν ἡ Σηκις λαθρα.And EURIPIDES, Troad. brings in Hecuba, complaining that she, who was wont to sit upon a throne, is now reduced to the miserable necessity of becoming a porter, or a nurse, in order to get a morsel of bread. And PLAUTUS, Curcul. Act. i. sc. 1, mentions an old woman who was keeper of the gate: -Anus hic solet cubitare custos janitrix.Why they, in preference to men, should be pitched upon for this office, I cannot conceive; but we find the usage was common in all ancient nations. Matthew 26:69.
