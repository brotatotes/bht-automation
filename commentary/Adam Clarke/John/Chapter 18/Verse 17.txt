<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:17">John 18:17</span>. <i><b>The damsel that kept the door</b></i> — <i>Caezarius</i>, a writer quoted by Calmet, says this portress was named <i>Ballila</i>. It is worthy of remark that <i>women</i>, especially <i>old women</i>, were employed by the ancients as <i>porters</i>. In 2Sa 4:6, both the Septuagint and Vulgate make a <i>woman</i> porter to <i>Ishbosheth</i>. ARISTOPHANES, in <i>Vespis</i>,<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:0">John 18:0</span>v. 765, mentions them in the same office and calls them Σηκις, <i>Sekis</i>, which seems to signify a <i>common maid-servant</i>: -</p>
<p>Ὁτι την θυραν ανεῳξεν ἡ Σηκις λαθρα.</p>
<p>And EURIPIDES, <i>Troad</i>. brings in <i>Hecuba</i>, complaining that she, who was wont to sit upon a throne, is now reduced to the miserable necessity of becoming a <i>porter</i>, or a nurse, in order to get a morsel of bread. And PLAUTUS, <i>Curcul</i>. Act. i. sc. 1, mentions an old woman who was keeper of the gate: -</p>
<p><i>Anus hic solet cubitare custos janitrix</i>.</p>
<p>Why <i>they</i>, in preference to men, should be pitched upon for this office, I cannot conceive; but we find the usage was common in all ancient nations. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:69">Matthew 26:69</span>.</p>
