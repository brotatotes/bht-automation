<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:19">John 18:19</span>. <i><b>Asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</b></i> â€” He probably asked him by what authority, or in virtue of what right, he collected disciples, formed a different sect, preached a new doctrine, and set himself up for a public reformer? As religion was interested in these things, the high priest was considered as being the proper judge. But all this, with what follows, was transacted by <i>night</i>, and this was contrary to established laws. For the <i>Talmud</i> states, Sanhed. c. iv. s. 1, that - "Criminal processes can neither commence not terminate, but during the course of the <i>day</i>. If the person be acquitted, the sentence may be pronounced during that day; but, if he be condemned, the sentence cannot be pronounced till the next day. But no kind of judgment is to be executed, either on the eve of the Sabbath, or the eve of any festival." Nevertheless, to the lasting infamy of this people, Christ was judicially interrogated and condemned during the night; and on the night too of the passover, or, according to others, on the <i>eve</i> of that feast. Thus, as I have remarked before, all the forms of justice were insulted and outraged in the case of our Lord. In this his humiliation his judgment was taken away.
