<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:2">John 18:2</span>. <i><b>Judas - knew the place</b></i> â€” As many had come from different quarters to celebrate the passover at Jerusalem, it could not be an easy matter to find lodging in the city: Jesus therefore chose to pass the night in the garden with his disciples which, from this verse, and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:39">Luke 22:39</span>, we find was his frequent custom, though he often lodged in Bethany. But, as he had supped in the city this evening, Judas took it for granted that he had not gone to Bethany, and therefore was to be met with in the garden; and, having given this information to the priests, they gave him some soldiers and others that he might be the better enabled to seize and bring him away.</p>
