<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:20">John 18:20</span>. <i><b>I spake openly to the world</b></i> — To every person in the land indiscriminately-to the people at large: the τω κοσμω, here, is tantamount to the French <i>tout le monde</i>, all the world, i.e. every person within reach. This is another proof that St. John uses the term <i>world</i> to mean the Jewish people only; for it is certain our Lord did not preach to the Gentiles. The answer of our Lord, mentioned in this and the following verse, is such as became a person conscious of his own innocence, and confident in the righteousness of his cause. I have taught in the temple, in the synagogues, in all the principal cities, towns, and villages, and through all the country. I have had no secret school. You and your emissaries have watched me every where. No doctrine has ever proceeded from my lips, but what was agreeable to the righteousness of the law and the purity of God. My disciples, when they have taught, have taught in the same way, and had the same witnesses. Ask those who have attended our public ministrations, and hear whether they can prove that I or my disciples have preached any false doctrines, have ever troubled society, or disturbed the state. Attend to the ordinary course of justice, call witnesses, let them make their depositions, and then proceed to judge according to the evidence brought before you.</p>
