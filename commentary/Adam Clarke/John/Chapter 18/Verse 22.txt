<p>Verse 22. <i><b>One of the officers - struck Jesus</b></i> â€” This was an outrage to all justice: for a prisoner, before he is condemned, is ever considered to be under the especial protection of justice; nor has any one a right to touch him, but according to the direction of the law. But it has been observed before that, if <i>justice</i> had been done to Christ, he could neither have suffered nor died.</p>
