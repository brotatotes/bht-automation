<p>Verse 27. <i><b>And - the cock crew.</b></i> — Peter denied our Lord <i>three</i> times: -</p>
<p>Peter's <i>first</i> denial.</p>
<p>I. This took place, when he was <i>without</i>, or <i>beneath</i>, in the hall of Caiaphas's house. He was not in the <i>higher</i> part where Christ stood before the high priest; but <i>without</i> that division of the hall, and in the lower part with the servants and officers, at the fire kindled in the midst of the hall, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:16">John 18:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:18">John 18:18</span>; and the girl who kept the door had entered into the hall, where she charged Peter.</p>
<p>Peter's <i>second</i> denial.</p>
<p>II. This was in a short time after the first, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:58">Luke 22:58</span>. Having once denied his Master, he naturally retired from the place where his accuser was to the vestibule of the hall, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:71">Matthew 26:71</span>, and it was the time of the first cock-crowing, or soon after midnight. After remaining here a short time, perhaps an hour, another girl sees him, and says to them who were standing by in the vestibule, that <i>he was one of them</i>. Peter, to avoid this charge, withdraws into the hall, and warms himself. The girl, and those to whom she had spoken, follow him; the communication between the two places being immediate. Here a <i>man</i> enforces the charge of the <i>girl</i>, according to Luke; and <i>others</i> urge it, according to St. John; and Peter denies Jesus vehemently.</p>
<p>Peter's <i>third</i> denial.</p>
<p>III. He was now in the <i>hall</i>, and also within sight of Jesus, though at such a distance from him that Jesus could not know what passed, but in a supernatural way. And, about an hour after his second denial, those who stood by founded a <i>third</i> charge against him, on his being a <i>Galilean</i>, which St. Luke says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59">Luke 22:59</span>, one in particular strongly affirmed; and which, according to John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:26">John 18:26</span>, was supported by one of Malchus's relations. This occasioned a more vehement denial than before, and immediately the cock crew the second time, which is eminently called αλεκτοροφωνια. The first denial may have been between our twelve and one; and the second between our two and three.</p>
<p>At the time of the <i>third</i> denial, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span> proves that Jesus was in the same room with Peter. We must farther observe that Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:57">Matthew 26:57</span>, lays the scene of Peter's denials in the house of Caiaphas: whereas John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:15-23">John 18:15-23</span>, seems to intimate that these transactions took place in the house of Annas; but this difficulty arises from the injudicious insertion of the particle ουν, <i>therefore</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24">John 18:24</span>, which should be omitted, on the authority of ADES, Mt. BH, many others; besides some <i>versions</i>, and some of the primitive <i>fathers</i>. Griesbach has left it out of the text. See Bishop Newcome's Harm. notes, p. 48.</p>
<p>The time of Peter's denials happened during the space of the <i>third</i> Roman watch, or that division of the night, between twelve and three, which is called αλεκτοροφωνια, or <i>cock-crowing</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:35">Mark 13:35</span>. Concerning the nature and progress of Peter's denial, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:58">Matthew 26:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:69-75">Matthew 26:69-75</span>.</p>
