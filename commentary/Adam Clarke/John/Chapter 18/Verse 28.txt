<p>Verse 28. <i><b>The hall of judgment</b></i> — εις το πραιτωριος, <i>To the</i> <i>praetorium</i>. This was the house where Pilate lodged; hence called in our margin, <i>Pilate's house</i>. The praetorium is so called from being the dwelling-place of the <i>praetor</i>, or chief of the province. It was also the place where he held his court, and tried causes.</p>
<p>St. John has omitted all that passed in the house of Caiaphas - the accusations brought against Christ-the false witnesses - the insults which he received in the house of the high priest-and the assembling of the grand council, or Sanhedrin. These he found amply detailed by the other three evangelists; and for this reason it appears that he omitted them. John's is properly a supplementary Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest they should be defiled</b></i> — The Jews considered even the <i>touch</i> of a Gentile as a legal defilement; and therefore would not venture into the praetorium, for fear of contracting some impurity, which would have obliged them to separate themselves from all religious ordinances till the evening, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+15:10-11">Leviticus 15:10-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+15:19-20">Leviticus 15:19-20</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That they might eat the passover.</b></i> — Some maintain that το πασχα here does not mean the paschal lamb, but the other sacrifices which were offered during the paschal solemnity-for this had been eaten the evening before; and that our Lord was crucified the day after the passover. Others have maintained that the paschal lamb is here meant; that this was the proper day for sacrificing it; that it was on the very hour in which it was offered that Christ expired on the cross; and that therefore our Lord did not eat the Paschal lamb this year, or that he ate it some hours before the common time. Bishop <i>Pearce</i> supposes that it was lawful for the Jews to eat the paschal lamb any time between the evening of Thursday and that of Friday. He conjectures too that this permission was necessary on account of the immense number of lambs which were to be killed for that purpose. When <i>Cestius</i> desired to know the number of the Jews, he asked the priests how he might accomplish his wish? They informed him that this might be known by the number of the lambs slain at the passover, as never less than <i>ten</i> partook of one lamb, though <i>twenty</i> might feast on it. On this mode of computation he found the lambs to be 256,500; εικοσι πεντε μυριαδας ηριθμησαν, προς δε ἑξακισχιλια και πεντακοσια. See Josephus, War, b. vi. c. 9. s. 3.</p>
<p>That Jesus ate a passover this last year of his life is sufficiently evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17-19">Matthew 26:17-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:12-18">Mark 14:12-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:8-15">Luke 22:8-15</span>; and that he ate this passover some hours before the ordinary time, and was himself slain at that hour in which the paschal lamb was ordered by the law to be sacrificed, is highly probable, if not absolutely certain. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:20">Matthew 26:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:20">Matthew 26:20</span></span>, and at the conclusion of the chapter, where the subject, and the different opinions on it, are largely considered. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:20- :">Matthew 26:20- :</span></p>
