<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:3">John 18:3</span>. <i><b>A band</b></i> — την σπειραν, <i>The band</i> or <i>troop</i>. Some think that the <i>spira</i> was the same as the Roman <i>cohort</i>, and was the <i>tenth</i> part of a <i>legion</i>, which consisted sometimes of 4200, and sometimes of 5000 foot. But <i>Raphelius</i>, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27">Matthew 27:27</span>, has clearly proved, from <i>Polybius</i>, that the <i>spira</i> was no more than a <i>tenth</i> of the <i>fourth</i> part of a legion. And as the number of the legion was <i>uncertain</i>, and their divisions not at all <i>equal</i>, no person can tell how many the band or <i>spira</i> contained. See many curious particulars in <i>Raphelius</i> on this point, vol. i. p. 351, edit. 1747. This band was probably those <i>Roman soldiers</i> given by the governor for the defense of the temple; and the <i>officers</i> were those who belonged to the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p><i><b>With lanterns and torches</b></i> — With these they had intended to search the corners and caverns, provided Christ had hidden himself; for they could not have needed them for any other purpose, it being now the fourteenth day of the moon's age, in the month Nisan, and consequently she appeared <i>full</i> and <i>bright</i>. The <i>weapons</i> mentioned here were probably no other than <i>clubs,</i> <i>staves</i>, and instruments of that kind, as we may gather from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:55">Matthew 26:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:48">Mark 14:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:52">Luke 22:52</span>. The <i>swords</i> mentioned by the other evangelists were probably those of the <i>Roman soldiers</i>; the <i>clubs</i> and <i>staves</i> belonged to the chief priest's officers.</p>
