<p>Verse 36. <i><b>My kingdom is not of this world</b></i> â€” It is purely spiritual and Divine. If it had been of a <i>secular</i> nature, then my servants would have contended-they would have opposed force with force, as the kingdoms of this world do in their wars; but as my kingdom as not of this world, therefore no resistance has been made. <i>Eusebius</i> relates, <i>Hist. Eccles</i>. lib. iii. c. 20, that "The relatives of our Lord were brought before Domitian, and interrogated whether they were of the family of David; and what sort the kingdom of Christ was, and where it would appear? They answered, that this kingdom was <i>neither of this world</i>, nor <i>of an</i> <i>earthly nature</i>; that it was altogether <i>heavenly</i> and <i>angelical</i>; and that it would not take place till the end of the world."</p>
