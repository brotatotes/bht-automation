<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Thou sayest</b></i> â€” A common form of expression for, yes, it is so. I was born into the world that I might set up and maintain a spiritual government: but this government is established in and by truth. All that love truth, hear my voice and attend to the spiritual doctrines I preach. It is by <i>truth</i> alone that I influence the minds and govern the manners of my subjects.</p>
