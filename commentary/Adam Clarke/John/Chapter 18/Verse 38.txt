<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>. <i><b>What is truth</b></i> — Among the sages of that time there were many opinions concerning <i>truth</i>; and some had even supposed that it was a thing utterly out of the reach of men. Pilate perhaps might have asked the question in a mocking way; and his not staying to get an answer indicated that he either despaired of getting a satisfactory one, or that he was indifferent about it. This is the case with thousands: they appear desirous of knowing the truth, but have not patience to wait in a proper way to receive an answer to their question.</p>
<p><i><b>I find in him no fault</b></i> — Having asked the above question, and being convinced of our Lord's innocence, he went out to the Jews to testify his convictions and to deliver him, if possible, out of their hands.</p>
