Verse John 18:5. Jesus of Nazareth. â€” They did not say this till after Judas kissed Christ, which was the sign which he had agreed with the soldiers, &c., to give them, that they might know whom they were to seize: see Matthew 26:48. Though some harmonists place the kiss after what is spoken in the ninth verse.
