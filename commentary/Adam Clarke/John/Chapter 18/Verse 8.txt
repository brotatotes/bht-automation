<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:8">John 18:8</span>. <i><b>Let these go their way</b></i> â€” These words are rather words of <i>authority</i>, than words of <i>entreaty</i>. I <i>voluntarily</i> give myself up to you, but you must not molest one of these my disciples. At your peril injure them. Let them go about their business. I have already given you a sufficient proof of my power: I will not exert it in my own behalf, for I will lay down my life for the sheep; but I will not permit you to injure the least of <i>these</i>. It was certainly the supreme power of Christ that kept the soldiers and the mob from destroying all the disciples present, when Peter had given them such provocation, in cutting off the ear of Malchus. There were probably no other disciples with Christ than Peter, James, and John, at this time. see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:37">Matthew 26:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:33">Mark 13:33</span>.</p>
