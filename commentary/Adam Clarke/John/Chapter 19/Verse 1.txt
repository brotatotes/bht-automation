<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:1">John 19:1</span>. <i><b>Pilate took Jesus, and scourged</b></i> him.] That is, caused him to be scourged: for we cannot with <i>Bede</i> suppose that he scourged him with his own hand.</p>
<p>As our Lord was scourged by order of Pilate, it is probable he was scourged in the Roman manner, which was much more severe than that of the Jews. The latter never gave more than <i>thirty-nine</i> blows; for the law had absolutely forbidden a man to be <i>abused</i>, or his <i>flesh cut</i> in this chastisement, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+25:3">Deuteronomy 25:3</span>. The common method of whipping or flogging in some places, especially that of a <i>military</i> kind, is a disgrace to the nation where it is done, to the laws, and to humanity. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:26">Matthew 27:26</span>, and the note there. Though it was customary to scourge the person who was to be crucified, yet it appears that Pilate had another end in view by scourging our Lord. He hoped that this would have satisfied the Jews, and that he might then have dismissed Jesus. This appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:16">Luke 23:16</span>.</p>
