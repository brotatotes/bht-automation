<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:11">John 19:11</span>. <i><b>Hath the greater sin.</b></i> â€” It is a sin in thee to condemn me, while thou art convinced in thy conscience that I am <i>innocent</i>: but the <i>Jews</i> who delivered me to thee, and <i>Judas</i> who delivered me to the Jews, have the <i>greater</i> crime to answer for. Thy ignorance in some measure excuses <i>thee</i>; but the rage and malice of the Jews put <i>them</i> at present out of the reach of mercy.</p>
