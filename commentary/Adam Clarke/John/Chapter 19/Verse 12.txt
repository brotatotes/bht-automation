Verse John 19:12. Pilate sought to release him — Pilate made five several attempts to release our Lord; as we may learn from Luke 23:4; Luke 23:15; Luke 23:20; Luke 23:22; John 19:4; John 19:12-13.Thou art not Caesar's friend — Thou dost not act like a person who has the interest of the emperor at heart. Ambassadors, prefects, counsellors, c., were generally termed the friends of the emperor. This insinuation determined Pilate to make no longer resistance: he was afraid of being accused, and he knew Tiberius was one of the most jealous and distrustful princes in the world. During his reign, accusations of conspiracies were much in fashion they were founded on the silliest pretenses, and punished with excessive rigour. See Calmet, Tacit. An. l. i. c. 72, 73, 74. Sueton. in Tiber. c. 58.
