<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:13">John 19:13</span>. <i><b>The Pavement</b></i> — λιθοστρωτον, literally, <i>a stone</i> <i>pavement</i>: probably it was that place in the open court where the chair of justice was set, for the prefects of provinces always held their courts of justice in the open air, and which was paved with stones of <i>various colours</i>, like that of Ahasuerus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="es+1:6">Esther 1:6</span>, of <i>red, blue, white</i>, and <i>black</i> marble; what we still term <i>Mosaic</i> work, or something in imitation of it; such as the <i>Roman</i> pavements frequently dug up in this and other countries, where the Romans have had military stations.</p>
<p><i><b>Gabbatha.</b></i> — That is, <i>an elevated place</i>; from גבה <i>gabah, high,</i> <i>raised up</i>; and it is very likely that the judgment seat was considerably <i>elevated</i> in the court, and that the governor went up to it by steps; and perhaps these very steps were what was called <i>the Pavement</i>. John does not say that <i>Lithostroton</i>, or <i>the</i> <i>Pavement</i>, is the <i>meaning</i> of the word <i>Gabbatha</i>; but that the <i>place</i> was called so in the <i>Hebrew</i>. The place was probably called <i>Lithostroton</i>, or the <i>Pavement</i>: the seat of judgment, <i>Gabbatha</i>, the <i>raised</i> or <i>elevated</i> place.</p>
<p>In several MSS. and versions, the scribes not understanding the Hebrew word, wrote it variously, <i>Gabbatha, Gabatha, Kapphatha,</i> <i>Kappata, Gennetha, Gennaesa</i>, and <i>Gennesar</i>. Lightfoot conjectures that the pavement here means the room Gazith in the temple, in which the grand council, called the Sanhedrin, held their meetings.</p>
