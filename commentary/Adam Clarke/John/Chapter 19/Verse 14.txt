<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span>. <i><b>It was the preparation of the Passover</b></i> — That is, the time in which they were just preparing to kill the paschal lamb. Critics differ widely concerning the time of our Lord's crucifixion; and this verse is variously understood. Some think it signifies merely the preparation of the <i>Sabbath</i>; and that it is called the preparation of the <i>passover</i>, because the preparation of the Sabbath happened that year on the eve of the Passover. Others think that the preparation of the Sabbath is distinctly spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31">John 19:31</span>, and was different from what is here mentioned. Contending <i>nations</i> may be more easily <i>reconciled</i> than contending <i>critics</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The sixth hour</b></i> — Mark says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:25">Mark 15:25</span>, that it was the <i>third</i> hour. τριτη, the <i>third</i>, is the reading of DL, <i>four</i> others, the <i>Chron. Alex., Seuerus Antiochen., Ammonius</i>, with others mentioned by <i>Theophylact</i>. <i>Nonnus</i>, who wrote in the <i>fifth</i> century, reads τριτη, <i>the third</i>. As in ancient times all the numbers were written in the manuscripts not at <i>large</i> but in numeral <i>letters</i>, it was easy for γ <i>three</i>, to be mistaken for ς <i>six</i>. The <i>Codex Bezae</i> has generally numeral <i>letters</i> instead of words. <i>Bengel</i> observes that he has found the letter γ <i>gamma</i>, THREE, exceedingly like the ς <i>episemon</i>, SIX, in some MSS. Episemon = greek 'st' combined, similar appearance to final form sigma with a nearly flat top. Similar appearance to upper case gamma. The major part of the best critics think that τριτη, <i>the</i> <i>third</i>, is the genuine reading. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:25">Mark 15:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:25">Mark 15:25</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Behold your king!</b></i> — This was probably intended as an <i>irony</i>; and, by thus turning their pretended serious apprehensions into ridicule, he hoped still to release him.</p>
