Verse John 19:16. Then delivered he him â€” This was not till after he had washed his hands, Matthew 27:24, to show, by that symbolical action, that he was innocent of the death of Christ. John omits this circumstance, together with the insults which Christ received from the soldiers. See Matthew 27:26, c. Mark 15:16, &c.
