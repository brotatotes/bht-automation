<p>Verse 22. <i><b>What I have written, I have written.</b></i> â€” That is, I will not alter what I have written. The Roman laws forbad the sentence to be altered when once pronounced; and as this inscription was considered as the <i>sentence</i> pronounced against our Lord, therefore, it could not be changed: but this form of speech is common in the Jewish writings, and means simply, what is done shall continue. Pilate seems to speak <i>prophetically</i>. This is the king of the Jews: they shall have no other Messiah for ever.</p>
