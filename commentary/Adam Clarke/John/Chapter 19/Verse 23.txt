<p>Verse 23. <i><b>To every soldier a part</b></i> — So it appears there were <i>four</i> soldiers employed in nailing him to and rearing up the cross.</p>
<p><i><b>The coat was without seam</b></i> — Several have seriously doubted whether this can be literally understood, as they imagine that nothing with sleeves, c. can be woven without a seam. But <i>Baun,</i> <i>de Vest. Sacer. Heb</i>. l. 1, c. 16, has proved, not only that such things were done by the ancients, and are still done in the east, but himself got a <i>loom</i> made, on which these kinds of tunics, <i>vents, sleeves</i>, and all, were woven in <i>one piece</i>. See much on this subject in <i>Calmet</i>. The clothes of a <i>Hindoo</i> are always <i>without</i> a <i>seam</i> and the <i>Brahmins</i> would not wear clothes that were otherwise made. Besides, the Hindoos have no regular <i>tailors</i>.</p>
<p>Our Lord was now in the grand office of <i>high priest</i>, and was about to offer the <i>expiatory</i> victim for the sin of the world. And it is worthy of remark that the <i>very dress</i> he was in was similar to that of the Jewish high priest. The following is the description given of his dress by <i>Josephus</i>, Ant. b. iii. c. 7, s. 4: "Now this coat (χιτων) was not composed of <i>two pieces</i>, nor was it <i>sewed together</i> upon the shoulders and sides, but it was <i>one</i> long vestment, so <i>woven</i> as to have an opening for the neck; not an oblique one, but parted all along the back and breast; it was also parted where the hands were to come out." A little before, the same author says, that "the high priest had a <i>long robe</i> of a blue colour, which hung down to the <i>feet</i>, and was <i>put over all the</i> <i>rest</i>." It is likely that this was the same with that <i>upper</i> <i>garment</i> which the soldiers divided among them, it being probably of a costly stuff. I may just add here, that I knew a woman who <i>knit</i> all kinds of clothes, even to the sleeves and button holes, <i>without a seam</i>; and have seen some of the garments which she made; that the thing is possible I have the fullest proof. For an explanation of χιτων and ιματιον which we translate <i>cloak</i>, and <i>coat</i>, <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:29">Luke 6:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:29">Luke 6:29</span></span>.</p>
