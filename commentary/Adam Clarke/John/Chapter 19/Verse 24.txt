<p>Verse 24. <i><b>That the scripture might be fulfilled</b></i> â€” These words are found in the common printed text, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:35">Matthew 27:35</span>; but they are omitted by ABDEFGHKLMSU, Mt. BHV, 150 others; the principal <i>versions, Chrysostom, Titus Bost., Euthymius, Theophylact,</i> <i>Origen, Hilary, Augustin, Juven</i>. See <i>Griesbach's</i> second edition. But in the text of John they are not omitted by one MS., <i>version</i>, or <i>ancient commentator</i>.</p>
<p>The words are taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:18">Psalms 22:18</span>, where it appears they were spoken prophetically of this treatment which Jesus received, upwards of a thousand years before it took place!</p>
<p>But it should be remarked that this form of speech, which frequently occurs, often means no more than that the thing so fell out that such a portion of Scripture may be exactly applied to it.</p>
