<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Mary the</b></i><b> wife </b><i><b>of Cleophas</b></i> â€” She is said, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:56">Matthew 27:56</span>, (see the note there,) and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span>, to have been the mother of James the Less, and of Joses; and this James her son is said, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>, to have been the son of Alpheus; hence it seems that <i>Alpheus</i> and <i>Cleopas</i> were the same person. To which may be added, that <i>Hegesippus</i> is quoted by Eusebius, <i>Hist. Eccl</i>. l. iii. c. 11, as saying that Cleopas was the <i>brother</i> of Joseph, the husband of the virgin. <i>Theophylact</i> says that <i>Cleopas</i>, (brother of Joseph, the husband of the virgin,) having died childless, his brother Joseph married his widow, by whom he had four sons, called by the evangelists <i>the brothers of our Lord</i>, and two daughters, the one named <i>Salome</i>, the other <i>Mary, the daughter of Cleopas</i>, because she was his daughter according to law, though she was the daughter of Joseph according to nature. There are several conjectures equally well founded with this last to be met with in the ancient commentators; but, in many cases, it is very difficult to distinguish the different <i>Marys</i> mentioned by the evangelists.</p>
