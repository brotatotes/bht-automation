<p>Verse 29. <i><b>A vessel full of vinegar</b></i> — This was probably that <i>tart</i> small wine which we are assured was the common drink of the Roman soldiers. Our word <i>vinegar</i> comes from the French <i>vin aigre, sour</i> or <i>tart wine</i>; and, although it is probable that it was brought at this time for the use of the four Roman soldiers who were employed in the crucifixion of our Lord, yet it is as probable that it might have been furnished for the use of the persons crucified; who, in that lingering kind of death, must necessarily be grievously tormented with thirst. This vinegar must not be confounded with the <i>vinegar</i> and <i>gall</i> mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:23">Mark 15:23</span>. <i>That</i>, being a stupifying potion, intended to alleviate his pain, he refused to drink; but of this he took a little, and then expired, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And put</b></i><b> it </b><i><b>upon hyssop</b></i> — Or, according to others, <i>putting hyssop</i> <i>about it</i>. A great variety of conjectures have been produced to solve the difficulty in this text, which is occasioned by supposing that the sponge was put on a stalk of <i>hyssop</i>, and that this is the <i>reed</i> mentioned by Matthew and Mark. It is possible that the hyssop might grow to such a size in Judea as that a stalk of it might answer the end of a <i>reed</i> or <i>cane</i> in the case mentioned here; but still it appears to me more natural to suppose that the reed was a distinct thing and that the hyssop was used only to bind the sponge fast to the reed; unless we may suppose it was added for some mystical purpose, as we find it frequently used in the Old Testament in rites of <i>purification</i>. The various conjectures on this point may be seen in <i>Bowyer's</i> Conject. and in <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
