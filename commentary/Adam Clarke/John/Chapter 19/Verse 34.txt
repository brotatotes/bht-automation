<p>Verse 34. <i><b>With a spear pierced his side</b></i> — The soldier who pierced our Lord's side has been called by the Roman Catholic writers <i>Longinus</i>, which seems to be a corruption of λογχη, <i>lonche</i>, a <i>spear</i> or <i>dart</i>, the word in the text. They moreover tell us that this man was converted-that it was he who said, <i>Truly this was the</i> <i>Son of God</i>-that he travelled into <i>Cappadocia</i>, and there preached the Gospel of Christ, and received the crown of martyrdom. But this deserves the same credit as the other legends of the Popish Church.</p>
<p>Whether it was the <i>right</i> or the <i>left</i> side of Christ that was pierced has been a matter of serious discussion among divines and physicians; and on this subject they are not yet agreed. That it is of <i>no importance</i> we are sure, because the Holy Ghost has not revealed it. <i>Luke Cranache</i>, a famous painter, whose piece of the crucifixion is at Augsburg, has put no wound on either side: when he was asked the reason of this-<i>I will do it</i>, said he, <i>when I am</i> <i>informed WHICH side was pierced</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Blood and water.</b></i> — It may be naturally supposed that the spear went through the pericardium and pierced the heart; that the water proceeded from the former, and the blood from the latter. Ambrose, Augustin, and Chrysostom, make the <i>blood</i> an emblem of the <i>eucharist</i>, and the <i>water</i> an emblem of <i>baptism</i>. Others represent them as the emblems of the old and new covenants. Protestants have thought them the emblems of <i>justification</i>, which is through the <i>blood</i> of the Lamb, and <i>sanctification</i>, which is through the <i>washing</i> of regeneration; and it is in reference to the first notion that they mingle the wine with water in the sacrament of the Lord's supper. The piercing appears to have taken place because his legs were not broken; and, as the law in this case stated that the criminals were to continue on the cross <i>till they</i> <i>died</i>, the side of our Lord was pierced to secure the accomplishment of the law; and the issuing of the blood and water appears to be only a <i>natural</i> effect of the above cause, and probably nothing mystical or spiritual was intended by it. However, it affords the fullest proof that Jesus <i>died</i> for our sins. Dr. Lightfoot thinks that there is a reference here to the rock in the wilderness which Moses smote twice, and which, according to the Jews, <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, fol. 122, "poured out <i>blood</i> at the first stroke, and <i>water</i> at the second." Now St. Paul says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span>, That rock was Christ; and here the evangelist says, the soldier pierced his side, and there came out blood and water. St. John therefore, in what he asserts in the 35th and 36th verses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:35-36">John 19:35-36</span>, wishes to call the attention of the Jews to this point, in order to show them that this Jesus was the true Messiah, who was typified by the rock in the wilderness. <i>He</i> <i>knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe</i>.</p>
