<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Nicodemus</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:1">John 3:1</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Myrrh and aloes</b></i> — Which drugs were used to preserve bodies from putrefaction. <i>Calmet</i> says that the aloes mentioned here is a liquor which runs from an aromatic tree, and is widely different from that called <i>aloes</i> among us.</p>
<p>Some have objected that a hundred pounds' weight of myrrh and aloes was enough to embalm two hundred dead bodies and instead of εκατον, <i>a hundred</i>, some critics have proposed to read εκατερων - <i>a mixture of myrrh and aloes, of about a pound EACH</i>. See <i>Bowyer's</i> Conjectures. But it may be observed that <i>great quantities</i> of spices were used for embalming dead bodies, when they intended to show peculiar marks of respect to the deceased. A great quantity was used at the funeral of <i>Aristobulus</i>; and it is said that five hundred servants bearing aromatics attended the funeral of <i>Herod</i>: see <i>Josephus</i>, Ant. b. xv. c. 3, s. 4; and b. xvii. c. 8, s. 3: and <i>fourscore pounds</i> of spices were used at the funeral of R. <i>Gamaliel</i> the elder. See <i>Wetstein</i> in loc.</p>
