Verse John 19:5. And Pilate saith — The word Pilate, which we supply in our version, is added by one MS., the later Syriac, later Arabic, and the Coptic.Behold the man! — The man who, according to you, affects the government, and threatens to take away the empire from the Romans. Behold the man whom ye have brought unto me as an enemy to Caesar, and as a sower of the seeds of sedition in the land! In him I find no guilt; and from him ye have no occasion to fear any evil.
