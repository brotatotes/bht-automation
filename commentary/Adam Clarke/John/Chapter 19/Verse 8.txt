<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:8">John 19:8</span>. <i><b>He was the more afraid</b></i> â€” While Jesus was accused only as a disturber of the peace of the nation, which accusation Pilate knew to be <i>false</i>, he knew he could deliver him, because the judgment in that case belonged to himself; but when the Jews brought a charge against him of the most capital nature, from their <i>own laws</i>, he then saw that he had every thing to fear, if he did not deliver Jesus to their will. The Sanhedrin must not be offended-the populace must not be irritated: from the former a complaint might be sent against him to Caesar; the latter might revolt, or proceed to some acts of violence, the end of which could not be foreseen. Pilate was certainly to be pitied: he saw what was right, and he wished to do it; but he had not sufficient firmness of mind. He did not attend to that important maxim, <i>Fiat</i> <i>justitia: ruat caelum</i>. Let justice be done, though the heavens should be dissolved. He had a <i>vile</i> people to govern, and it was not an easy matter to keep them quiet. Some suppose that Pilate's fear arose from hearing that Jesus had said he was <i>the Son of God</i>; because Pilate, who was a polytheist, believed that it was possible for the offspring of the gods to visit mortals; and he was afraid to condemn Jesus, for fear of offending some of the supreme deities. Perhaps the question in the succeeding verse refers to this.</p>
