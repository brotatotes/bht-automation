<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:1">John 2:1</span>. <i><b>Cana of Galilee</b></i> — This was a small city in the tribe of Asher, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:28">Joshua 19:28</span>, and by saying this was Cana of <i>Galilee</i>, the evangelist distinguishes it from another Cana, which was in the tribe of <i>Ephraim</i>, in the Samaritan country.

<p>Some suppose that the <i>third day</i>, mentioned here, refers to the third day of the <i>marriage feast</i>: such feasts lasting among the Jews seven days.
