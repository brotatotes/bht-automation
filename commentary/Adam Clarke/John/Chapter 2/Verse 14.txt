<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:14">John 2:14</span>. <i><b>Found in the temple those that sold oxen</b></i>, c.] This is a <i>similar</i> fact to that mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:15">Mark 11:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:45">Luke 19:45</span>. See it explained on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>. If it be the <i>same</i> fact, then John anticipates <i>three</i> years of time in relating it here; as <i>that</i> cleansing of the temple mentioned by the other evangelists took place in the last week of our Lord's life. Mr. Mann, Dr. Priestley, and Bp. Pearce, contend that our Lord cleansed the temple only <i>once</i>; and that was at the last passover. Calvin, Mr. Mede, L'Enfant and Beausobre, Dr. Lardner, Bp. Hurd, and Bp. Newcome, contend that he purged the temple <i>twice</i>; and that this, mentioned by John, was the <i>first</i> cleansing, which none of the other evangelists have mentioned. Let the reader, says Bp. Newcome, observe the order of events.</p>
<p>"Jesus works his first miracle at Cana of Galilee, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>; then he passes a few days at Capernaum, which bring him on his way to Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:12">John 2:12</span>. The passover being near, he goes up to Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span>, and casts the traders out of the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:15-16">John 2:15-16</span>, At the passover he works many miracles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>. While he is in Jerusalem, which city he does not leave till, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>, Nicodemus comes to him by night, <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:1-2">John 3:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:3">2 John 1:3</span><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span></span> contains a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>. <i>After</i> these things, Jesus departs from Jerusalem, and dwells and baptizes in Judea, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>. And all these incidents take place <i>before</i> John was cast into prison, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:24">John 3:24</span>. But the <i>second</i> cleansing of the temple happens most clearly during the last week of our Lord's life, <i>after</i> the death of the Baptist, and at a time when it would be absurd to say that <i>afterwards</i> Jesus dwelt and baptized in Judea."</p>
<p>The vindication of God's house from profanation was the <i>first</i> and the <i>last</i> care of our Lord; and it is probable he <i>began</i> and <i>finished</i> his public ministry by this significant act.</p>
<p>It certainly appears that John directly asserts an early cleansing of the temple, by the series of his history; as the other three evangelists assert a later cleansing of it. And though the act mentioned here seems to be nearly the same with that mentioned by the other evangelists, yet there are some differences. St. John alone mentions the <i>scourge of rushes</i>, and the casting out of the <i>sheep and oxen</i>. Besides, there is a considerable difference in our Lord's <i>manner</i> of doing it: in the cleansing mentioned by the three evangelists, he assumes a vast deal of authority, and speaks more pointedly concerning himself, than he appears to do in this cleansing mentioned by St. John: the reason which has been given is, In the <i>first</i> cleansing he was just entering upon his public ministry, and therefore avoided (as much as was consistent with the accomplishment of his work) the giving any offence to the Jewish rulers; but, in the <i>last</i> cleansing, he was just concluding his ministry, being about to offer up his life for the salvation of the world, in consequence of which he speaks fully and without reserve. For answers to all the objections made against <i>two</i> cleansings of the temple, see the notes at the end of Bp. Newcome's Greek Harmony of the Gospels, pp. 7-9.</p>
