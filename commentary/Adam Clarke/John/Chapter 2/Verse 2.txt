Verse John 2:2. And both Jesus was called, and his disciples â€” There are several remarkable circumstances here.1. This was probably the first Christian wedding that was ever in the world.2. The great Author of the Christian religion, with his disciples, (probably then only four or five in number, see John 1:37, c.,) were invited to it.3. The first miracle Jesus Christ wrought was at it, and in honour of it.4. The mother of Christ, the most pure of all virgins, the most holy of all wives, and the first Christian mother, was also at it.5. The marriage was according to God, or these holy persons would not have attended it.6. The bride and bridegroom must have been a holy pair, otherwise they would have had nothing to do with such holy company.Marriage is ever honourable in itself but it is not at all times used honourably. Where Jesus is not invited to bless the union, no good can be expected; and where the disciples of sin and Satan are preferred to the disciples of Christ, on such occasions, it is a melancholy intimation that so bad a beginning will have a bad ending. I am afraid we may search long, before we find a marriage conducted on such principles as this appears to have been, even among those who make more than a common profession of the religion of Christ.
