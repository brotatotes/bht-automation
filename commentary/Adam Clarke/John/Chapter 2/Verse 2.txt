<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:2">John 2:2</span>. <i><b>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples</b></i> â€” There are several remarkable circumstances here.</p>
<p>1. This was probably the <i>first</i> Christian wedding that was ever in the world.</p>
<p>2. The great <i>Author</i> of the Christian religion, with his disciples, (probably then only four or five in number, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:37">John 1:37</span>, c.,) were invited to it.</p>
<p>3. The <i>first</i> miracle Jesus Christ wrought was at it, and in honour of it.</p>
<p>4. The mother of Christ, the most pure of all <i>virgins</i>, the most holy of all <i>wives</i>, and the <i>first</i> Christian <i>mother</i>, was also at it.</p>
<p>5. The marriage was according to God, or these holy persons would not have attended it.</p>
<p>6. The bride and bridegroom must have been a holy pair, otherwise they would have had nothing to do with such holy company.</p>
<p>Marriage is ever honourable in itself but it is not at all times used honourably. Where Jesus is not invited to bless the union, no good can be expected; and where the disciples of sin and Satan are preferred to the disciples of Christ, on such occasions, it is a melancholy intimation that so bad a beginning will have a bad ending. I am afraid we may search long, before we find a marriage conducted on such principles as this appears to have been, even among those who make more than a common profession of the religion of Christ.</p>
