<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:20">John 2:20</span>. <i><b>Forty and six years was this temple in building</b></i> â€” The temple of which the Jews spake was begun to be rebuilt by Herod the Great, in the 18th year of his reign: Jos. Ant. b. xv. c. 11, s. 1; and xx. c. 9, s. 5, 7. But though he finished the main work in <i>nine years and a half</i>, yet some additional buildings or repairs were constantly carried on for many years afterwards. Herod began the work <i>sixteen</i> years before the birth of our Lord: the transactions which are here related took place in the <i>thirtieth</i> year of our Lord, which make the term exactly <i>forty-six</i> years. <i>Rosenmuller</i>. Josephus, Ant. b. xx. c. 8, s. 5, 7, has told us that the whole of the buildings belonging to the temple were not finished till Nero's reign, when <i>Albinus</i>, the governor of Judea, was succeeded by <i>Gessius Florus</i>, which was eighty years after the eighteenth year of <i>Herod's</i> reign. See Bp. <i>Pearce</i>.</p>
