<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>. <i><b>He knew all</b></i><b> men</b>] Instead of παντας <i>all men</i>, EGH, and about <i>thirty</i> others, read παντα, <i>every</i> man, or <i>all things</i>; and this I am inclined to believe is the true reading. Jesus knew <i>all things</i>; and why? Because he <i>made</i> all things, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>, and because he was the all-wise God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; and he knew all men, because he alone searches the heart, and tries the reins. He knows who are sincere, and who are hypocritical: he knows those in whom he can confide, and those to whom he can neither trust himself nor his gifts. Reader, he also knows <i>thee</i>: thy cares, fears, perplexities, temptations, afflictions, desires, and hopes; thy helps and hinderances; the progress thou hast made in the Divine life, or thy declension from it. If he know thee to be hypocritical or iniquitous, he looks upon thee with abhorrence: if he know thee to be of a meek and broken spirit, he looks on thee with pity, complacency, and delight. Take courage-thou canst say, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I do love thee, and mourn because I love and serve thee so little: then expect him to come in unto thee, and make his abode with thee: while thy eye and heart are simple, he will love thee, and thy whole soul shall be full of light. To him be glory and dominion for ever!</p>
