<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>. <i><b>Woman, what have I to do with thee?</b></i> — τι εμοι και σοι γυναι: <i>O, woman, what is this to thee and me</i>? This is an abrupt denial, as if he had said: "WE are not employed to provide the necessaries for this feast: this matter belongs to others, who should have made a proper and sufficient provision for the persons they had invited." The words seem to convey a <i>reproof</i> to the virgin, for meddling with that which did not particularly concern her. The holiest persons are always liable to <i>errors of judgment</i>: and should ever conduct themselves with modesty and humility, especially in those things in which the providence of God is particularly concerned. But here indeed there appears to be no blame. It is very likely the bride or bridegroom's family were relatives of the blessed virgin; and she would naturally suppose that our Lord would feel interested for the honour and comfort of the family, and, knowing that he possessed extraordinary power, made this application to him to come forward to their assistance. Our Lord's answer to his mother, if properly translated, is far from being disrespectful. He addresses the virgin as he did the Syrophoenician woman, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:28">Matthew 15:28</span>; as he did the Samaritan woman, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:21">John 4:21</span>, as he addressed his disconsolate mother when he hung upon the cross, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:26">John 19:26</span>; as he did his most affectionate friend Mary Magdalene, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:15">John 20:15</span>, and as the angels had addressed her before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:13">John 20:13</span>; and as St. Paul does the believing Christian woman, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:16">1 Corinthians 7:16</span>; in all which places the same term, γυναι which occurs in this verse, is used; and where certainly no kind of disrespect is intended, but, on the contrary, complaisance, affability, tenderness, and concern and in this sense it is used in the best Greek writers.</p>
<p><i><b>Mine hour is not yet come.</b></i> — Or, my <i>time</i>, for in this sense the word ωρα is often taken. My time for working a miracle is not yet fully come. What I do, I do when necessary, and not before. Nature is unsteady-full of haste; and ever blundering, in consequence. It is the folly and sin of men that they are ever finding fault with the Divine providence. According to them, God never does any thing in <i>due</i> time-he is too <i>early</i> or too <i>late</i>: whereas it is utterly impossible for the Divine wisdom to <i>forestall</i> itself; or for the Divine goodness to delay what is necessary.</p>
