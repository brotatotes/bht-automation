<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:6">John 2:6</span>. <i><b>After the manner of the purifying of the Jews</b></i> — Or, <i>for</i> <i>the purpose of the purifying of the Jews</i>. The preposition κατα, which I have translated, <i>for the purpose</i>, often denotes in the best Greek writers the <i>final cause</i> of a thing. See several examples produced by <i>Raphelius</i>, from <i>Arrian</i> and <i>Herodotus</i>. These six vessels were set in a convenient place, for the purpose of the Jews washing their hands before they sat down to meat, and probably for other purposes of purification. See this custom referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:2">Matthew 15:2</span>. As to the number <i>six</i>, we need seek for no mystery in it; the number of pots was proportioned to the number of the guests.</p>
<p><i><b>Containing two or three firkins apiece.</b></i> — <i>Measures</i> or <i>metretes</i>, μετρητας. Bishop Cumberland supposes that the Syrian <i>metretes</i> is here meant, which he computes to have held <i>seven pints</i> and <i>one</i> <i>eighth of a pint</i>; and, if this computation be right, the whole six water pots might have contained about fourteen gallons and a quart. Others make each metretes to contain ten gallons and two pints: see <i>Arbuthnot</i>. But the contents of the measures of the ancients are so very uncertain that it is best, in this and numberless other cases, to attempt to determine nothing.</p>
