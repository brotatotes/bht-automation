<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:8">John 2:8</span>. <i><b>Governor of the feast.</b></i> — The original word, αρχιτρικλινος, signifies one who is <i>chief</i> or <i>head over three</i> <i>couches</i>, or <i>tables</i>. In the Asiatic countries, they take their meals sitting, or rather reclining, on small low couches. And when many people are present, so that they cannot all eat together, three of these low tables or couches are put together in form of a crescent, and some one of the guests is appointed to take charge of the persons who sit at these tables. Hence the appellation of <i>architriclinus</i>, the <i>chief</i> over <i>three couches</i> or <i>tables</i>, which in process of time became applied to the <i>governor</i> or <i>steward</i> of a feast, let the guests be many or few; and such person, having conducted the business well, had a <i>festive crown</i> put on his head by the guests, at the conclusion of the feast. See Ecclesiasticus, 32:1-3. It is very common for the <i>Hindoos</i> to appoint a person who is expert in conducting the ceremonies of a feast to manage as <i>governor</i>. This person is seldom the master of the house.</p>
<p><i><b>And they bare it.</b></i> — A question has been asked, "Did our Lord turn all the water into wine which the six measures contained?" To which I answer: There is no proof that he did; and I take it for granted that he did not. It may be asked, "How could a <i>part</i> be turned into wine, and not the <i>whole</i>?" To which I answer: The water, in all likelihood, was changed into wine <i>as it was drawn</i> <i>out</i>, and not otherwise. "But did not our Lord by this miracle minister to vice, by producing an excess of inebriating liquor?" No; for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. The company was a select and holy company, where no excess could be permitted. And,</p>
<p>2. Our Lord does not appear to have furnished any <i>extra</i> quantity, but only <i>what</i> was necessary. "But it is intimated in the text that the guests were <i>nearly intoxicated</i> before this miraculous addition to their wine took place; for the evangelist says, οτανμεθυσθωσι, <i>when they have become intoxicated</i>." I answer:</p>
<p>1. It is not intimated, even in the most indirect manner, that <i>these</i> guests were at all intoxicated.</p>
<p>2. The words are not spoken of the persons at <i>that</i> wedding at all: the governor of the feast only states that such was the <i>common custom</i> at feasts of this nature; without intimating that any such custom prevailed there.</p>
<p>3. The original word bears a widely different meaning from that which the objection forces upon it. The verbs μεθυσκω and μεθυω, from μεθυ, <i>wine</i>, which, from μετα θυειν, to drink after sacrificing, signify not only to <i>inebriate</i>, but to <i>take wine</i>, to <i>drink wine</i>, to <i>drink enough</i>: and in this sense the verb is evidently used in the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+43:34">Genesis 43:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="so+5:1">Song of Solomon 5:1</span>; 1 Macc. 16:16; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hag+1:6">Haggai 1:6</span>; Ecclus. 1:16. And the Prophet Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:11">Isaiah 58:11</span>, speaking of the abundant blessings of the godly, compares them to a <i>watered garden</i>, which the Septuagint translate, ως κηπος μεθυων, by which is certainly understood, not a <i>garden drowned with water</i>, but one <i>sufficiently</i> <i>saturated</i> with it, not having one drop too much, nor too little.</p>
