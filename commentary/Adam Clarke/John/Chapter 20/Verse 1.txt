<p>All that John relates concerning the resurrection of our Lord he has collected partly from the account given by Mary Magdalene, and partly from his own observations. From Mary he derived the information given, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1-2">John 20:1-2</span>, and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span>. From his own actual knowledge, what he relates, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3-10">John 3:3-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19-29">John 3:19-29</span>, and the whole of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:1-25">John 21:1-25</span>. It is supposed that he details the account given by Mary, without altering any circumstance, and without either addition or retrenchment. See <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1">John 20:1</span>. <i><b>The first day of the week</b></i> â€” On what we call <i>Sunday</i> morning, the morning after the Jewish Sabbath. As Christ had been buried in haste, these holy women had bought aromatics, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>, to embalm him afresh, and in a more complete manner than it could have been done by Joseph and Nicodemus. John only mentions Mary of Magdala, because he appears to wish to give a more detailed history of <i>her</i> conduct than of any of the rest; but the other evangelists speak of <i>three</i> persons who went together to the tomb, viz. <i>Mary</i> of <i>Magdala</i>, <i>Mary</i> the mother of James, and <i>Salome</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span>.</p>
