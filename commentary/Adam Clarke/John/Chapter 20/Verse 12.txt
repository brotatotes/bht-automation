Verse John 20:12. Seeth two angels — John 20:6. She knew these to be angels by their white and glistening robes. Matthew and Mark mention but one angel-probably that one only that spoke, John 20:13.One at the head, and the other at the feet — So were the cherubim placed at each end of the mercy-seat: Exodus 25:18-19. Lightfoot.
