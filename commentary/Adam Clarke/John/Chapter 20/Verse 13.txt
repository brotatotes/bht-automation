<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:13">John 20:13</span>. <i><b>They have taken away my Lord</b></i> â€” It was conjectured, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:42">John 19:42</span>, that the body of our Lord was only put here for the time being, that, after the Sabbath, they might carry it to a more proper place. Mary seems to refer to this: <i>They have taken away my</i> <i>Lord, and I know not where they have laid him</i>. This removal she probably attributed to some of our Lord's disciples, or to some of his friends.</p>
