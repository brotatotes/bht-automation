<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:15">John 20:15</span>. <i><b>Supposing him to be the gardener</b></i> — κηπουρος, the inspector or overseer of the garden, from κηπος, <i>a garden</i>, and ουρος, <i>an inspector</i>-the person who had the charge of the workmen, and the care of the produce of the garden; and who rendered account to the owner.</p>
<p><i><b>And I will take him away</b></i> — How true is the proverb, <i>Love feels no</i> <i>load</i>! Jesus was in the prime of life when he was crucified, and had a hundred pounds weight of spices added to his body; and yet Mary thinks of nothing less than carrying him away with her, if she can but find where he is laid!</p>
