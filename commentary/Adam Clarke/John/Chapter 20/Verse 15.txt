Verse John 20:15. Supposing him to be the gardener — κηπουρος, the inspector or overseer of the garden, from κηπος, a garden, and ουρος, an inspector-the person who had the charge of the workmen, and the care of the produce of the garden; and who rendered account to the owner.And I will take him away — How true is the proverb, Love feels no load! Jesus was in the prime of life when he was crucified, and had a hundred pounds weight of spices added to his body; and yet Mary thinks of nothing less than carrying him away with her, if she can but find where he is laid!
