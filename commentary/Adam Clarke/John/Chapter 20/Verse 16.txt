<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:16">John 20:16</span>. <i><b>Mary.</b></i> — This word was no doubt spoken with uncommon emphasis; and the usual sound of Christ's voice accompanied it, so as immediately to prove that it must be Jesus. What transports of joy must have filled this woman's heart! Let it be remarked that Mary Magdalene sought Jesus more fervently, and continued more affectionately attached to him than any of the rest: therefore to her <i>first</i>, Jesus is pleased to show himself, and she is made the first herald of the <i>Gospel</i> of a <i>risen Saviour</i>.</p>
<p>After Mary's exclamation of <i>Rabboni</i>, and its interpretation by the evangelist, one MS., the later <i>Syriac, Syriac Hieros</i>., and <i>three</i> copies of the <i>Itala</i>, add και προσεδραμεν ἁψασθαι αυτου, <i>And she ran to embrace</i>, or <i>cling to him</i>. Then our Lord's words come in with the reason for them.</p>
