<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>. <i><b>Touch me not</b></i> — μη μου απτου, <i>Cling not to me</i>. απτομαι has this sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+31:7">Job 31:7</span>, where the Septuagint use it for the Hebrew דבק <i>dabak</i>, which signifies to <i>cleave, cling,</i> <i>stick</i>, or <i>be glued to</i>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span>, it appears that some of the women <i>held him by the feet and worshipped him</i>. This probably Mary did; and our Lord seems to have spoken to her to this effect: "Spend no longer time with me now: I am not going immediately to heaven - you will have several opportunities of seeing me again: but go and tell my disciples, that I am, by and by, to ascend to <i>my</i> <i>Father and God</i>, who is <i>your Father and God</i> also. Therefore, let them take courage."</p>
