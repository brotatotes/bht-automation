<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span>. <i><b>The doors were shut - for fear of the Jews</b></i> — We do not find that the Jews designed to molest the disciples: that word of authority which Christ spoke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:8">John 18:8</span>, <i>Let these go away </i>- had prevented the Jews from offering them any injury; but, as they had proceeded so far as to put Christ to death, the faith of the disciples not being very strong, they were led to think that <i>they</i> should be the next victims if found. Some think, therefore, that they had the doors not only <i>shut</i>, but <i>barricadoed</i>: nevertheless Jesus came in, <i>the doors being shut</i>, i.e. while they continued shut. But how? By his almighty power: and farther we know not. Yet it is quite possible that no miraculous influence is here intended. The doors might be shut for fear of the Jews; and Jesus might open them, and enter in the ordinary way. Where there is no need for a miracle, a miracle is never wrought. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30">John 20:30</span>.</p>
<p>The evangelist has omitted the appearing of our Lord to the other women who came from the tomb, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span>, and that to the two disciples who were going to <i>Emmaus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13">Luke 24:13</span>, &amp;c., which all happened in the course of this same day.</p>
