Verse John 20:19. The doors were shut - for fear of the Jews — We do not find that the Jews designed to molest the disciples: that word of authority which Christ spoke, John 18:8, Let these go away - had prevented the Jews from offering them any injury; but, as they had proceeded so far as to put Christ to death, the faith of the disciples not being very strong, they were led to think that they should be the next victims if found. Some think, therefore, that they had the doors not only shut, but barricadoed: nevertheless Jesus came in, the doors being shut, i.e. while they continued shut. But how? By his almighty power: and farther we know not. Yet it is quite possible that no miraculous influence is here intended. The doors might be shut for fear of the Jews; and Jesus might open them, and enter in the ordinary way. Where there is no need for a miracle, a miracle is never wrought. John 20:30.The evangelist has omitted the appearing of our Lord to the other women who came from the tomb, Matthew 28:9, and that to the two disciples who were going to Emmaus, Luke 24:13, &c., which all happened in the course of this same day.Peace be unto you. — His usual salutation and benediction. May every blessing of heaven and earth which you need be granted unto you!
