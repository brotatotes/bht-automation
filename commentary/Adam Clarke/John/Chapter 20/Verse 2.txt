<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2">John 20:2</span>. <i><b>Then she runneth</b></i> — This was after the women had seen the angels, who said he was risen from the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span>. She told, not only Peter and John, but the other apostles also, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:8">Matthew 28:8</span>; but only the two disciples above mentioned went to the tomb to see whether what she had said was true.</p>
<p><i><b>They have taken away the Lord</b></i> — She mentions nothing of what the angels had said, in her hurry and confusion; she speaks things only by halves; and probably the vision of angels might have appeared to her only as an illusion of her own fancy, and not to be any farther regarded.</p>
