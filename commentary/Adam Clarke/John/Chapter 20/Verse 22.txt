<p>Verse 22. <i><b>He breathed on</b></i><b> them</b>] Intimating, by this, that they were to be made <i>new</i> men, in order to be properly qualified for the work to which he had called them; for in this breathing he evidently alluded to the first <i>creation of man</i>, when God breathed into him the breath of lives, and he became a living soul: the breath or Spirit of God (רוח אלהים <i>ruach Elohim</i>) being the grand principle and cause of his spiritual and Divine life.</p>
<p><i><b>Receive ye the Holy Ghost</b></i> — From this act of our Lord, the influences of the Holy Spirit on the souls of men have been termed his <i>inspiration</i>; from <i>in</i>, into, and <i>spiro</i>, I breathe. Every word of Christ which is received in the heart by faith comes accompanied by this Divine <i>breathing</i>; and, without this, there is neither <i>light</i> nor <i>life</i>. Just as Adam was before God breathed the quickening spirit into him, so is every human soul till it receives this <i>inspiration</i>. Nothing is <i>seen, known, discerned</i>, or <i>felt</i> of God, but through this. To every private Christian this is essentially requisite; and no man ever did or ever can preach the Gospel of God, so as to convince and convert sinners, without it. "There are many (says pious Quesnel) who extol the dignity of the apostolic mission, and compare that of bishops and pastors with that of Christ; but with what shame and fear ought they to be filled, if they do but compare the <i>life</i> and <i>deportment</i> of Christ with the <i>lives</i> and <i>conversation</i> of those who glory in being made partakers of his mission. They may depend on it that, if sent at all, they are only sent on the same conditions, and for the same end, namely-to preach the truth, and to establish the kingdom of God, by opposing the corruption of the world; and by acting and suffering to the end, for the advancement of the glory of God. That person is no other than a monster in the Church who, by his sacred office, should be a dispenser of the Spirit, and who, by the corruption of his own heart, and by a disorderly, worldly, voluptuous, and scandalous life, is, at the same time, a member and instrument of the devil."</p>
