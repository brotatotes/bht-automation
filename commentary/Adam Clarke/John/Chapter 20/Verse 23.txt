<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Whose soever sins ye remit</b></i> â€” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span>. It is certain God alone can forgive sins; and it would not only be blasphemous, but grossly absurd, to say that any <i>creature</i> could remit the guilt of a transgression which had been committed against the <i>Creator</i>. The apostles received from the Lord the doctrine of <i>reconciliation,</i> and the doctrine of <i>condemnation</i>. They who believed on the Son of God, in consequence of their preaching, had their sins remitted; and they who would not believe were declared to lie under condemnation. The reader is desired to consult the note referred to above, where the custom to which our Lord alludes is particularly considered. Dr. Lightfoot supposes that the power of life and death, and the power of delivering over to Satan, which was granted to the apostles, is here referred to. This was a power which the primitive apostles exclusively possessed.</p>
