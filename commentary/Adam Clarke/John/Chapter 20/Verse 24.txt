<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Thomas - called Didymus</b></i> — See this name explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:16">John 11:16</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Was not with them</b></i> — And, by absenting himself from the company of the disciples, he lost this precious opportunity of seeing and hearing Christ; and of receiving (at this time) the inestimable blessing of the Holy Ghost. Where two or three are assembled in the name of Christ, he is in the midst of them. Christ had said this before: Thomas should have remembered it, and not have forsaken the company of the disciples. What is the consequence? -</p>
<p>His unbelief becomes</p>
<p>1st. Utterly <i>unreasonable</i>. <i>Ten</i> of his brethren witnessed that they had seen Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:25">John 20:25</span>; but he rejected their testimony.</p>
<p>2dly. His unbelief became <i>obstinate</i>: he was determined not to believe on any evidence that it might please God to give him: he would believe according to his own <i>prejudices</i>, or not at all.</p>
<p>3dly. His unbelief became <i>presumptuous</i> and <i>insolent</i>: a view of the person of Christ will not suffice: he will not believe that it is he, unless he can <i>put</i> <i>his finger into the holes</i> made by the <i>nails in his Lord's hand</i>, and <i>thrust has hand into the wound</i> made by the spear <i>in his side</i>.</p>
<p>Thomas had <i>lost</i> much <i>good</i>, and <i>gained</i> much <i>evil</i>, and yet was insensible of his state. Behold the consequences of forsaking the assemblies of God's people! Jesus comes to the meeting-a disciple is found out of his place, who might have been there; and he is not only not blessed, but his heart becomes <i>hardened</i> and <i>darkened</i> through the deceitfulness of sin. It was through God's mere mercy that ever Thomas had another opportunity of being convinced of his error. Reader! take warning.</p>
