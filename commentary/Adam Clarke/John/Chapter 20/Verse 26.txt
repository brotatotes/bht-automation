<p>Verse 26. <i><b>After eight days</b></i> â€” It seems likely that this was precisely on that day <i>se'nnight</i>, on which Christ had appeared to them before; and from this we may learn that this was the <i>weekly</i> <i>meeting</i> of the apostles; and, though Thomas was not found at the <i>former</i> meeting, he was determined not to be absent from <i>this</i>. According to his custom, Jesus came again; for he cannot forget his promise-two or three are assembled in his name; and he has engaged to be among them.</p>
