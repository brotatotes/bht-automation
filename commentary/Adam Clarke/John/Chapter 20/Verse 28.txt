<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Thomas answered</b></i>, c.] Those who deny the Godhead of Christ would have us to believe that these words are an <i>exclamation</i> of Thomas, made through surprise, and that they were addressed to the <i>Father</i> and not to <i>Christ</i>. <i>Theodore</i> of <i>Mopsuestia</i> was the first, I believe, who gave the words this turn and the fifth OEcumenic council, held at Constantinople, anathematized him for it. This was not according to the spirit of the Gospel of God. However, a man must do violence to every rule of construction who can apply the address here to any but Christ. The text is plain: Jesus comes in - sees Thomas, and addresses him; desiring him to come to him, and put his finger into the print of the nails, c. Thomas, perfectly satisfied of the reality of our Lord's resurrection, <i>says unto him</i>,-MY LORD! <i>and</i> MY GOD! i.e. Thou art indeed the very same person,-<i>my Lord</i> whose disciple I have so long been and thou art <i>my God</i>, henceforth the object of my religious adoration. Thomas was the first who gave the title of <i>God</i> to Jesus; and, by this glorious confession, made some amends for his former obstinate incredulity. It is worthy of remark, that from this time forward the whole of the disciples treated our Lord with the most supreme respect, never using that familiarity towards him which they had often used before. The resurrection from the dead gave them the fullest proof of the divinity of Christ. And this, indeed, is the use which St. John makes of this manifestation of Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30-31">John 20:30-31</span>. Bishop Pearce says here: "Observe that Thomas calls Jesus his <i>God</i>, and that Jesus does not reprove him for it, though probably it was the first time he was called so." And, I would ask, could Jesus be jealous of the honour of the true God-could he be a prophet-could he be even an honest man, to permit his disciple to indulge in a mistake so monstrous and destructive, if it had been one?</p>
