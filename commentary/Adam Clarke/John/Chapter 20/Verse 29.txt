<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:29">John 20:29</span>. <i><b>Thomas</b></i> â€” This word is omitted by almost every MS., version, and ancient commentator of importance.</p>
<p><i><b>Blessed</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>they</b></i><b>, c.</b>] Thou hast seen, and therefore thou hast believed, and now thou art blessed thou art now happy - fully convinced of my resurrection; yet no less blessed shall all those be who believe in my resurrection, without the evidence thou hast had. From this we learn that to believe in Jesus, on the testimony of his apostles, will put a man into the possession of the very same blessedness which they themselves enjoyed. And so has God constituted the whole economy of grace that a believer, at eighteen hundred years' distance from the time of the resurrection, suffers <i>no loss</i> because he has not seen Christ in the flesh. The importance and excellence of implicit faith in the testimony of God is thus stated by Rab. Tanchum: "Rab. Simeon ben Lachesh saith, The <i>proselyte</i> is more <i>beloved</i> by the holy blessed God than that whole crowd that stood before Mount Sinai; for unless they had <i>heard</i> the thundering, and <i>seen</i> the flames and lightning, the hills trembling, and the trumpets sounding, <i>they</i> <i>had not received the law</i>. But the <i>proselyte</i> hath seen <i>nothing of</i> <i>all this</i>, and yet he hath come in, devoting himself to the holy blessed God, and hath taken upon him (the yoke of) the kingdom of heaven."</p>
<p>Reader! Christ died for <i>thee</i>!-believe, and thou shalt be saved, and become as blessed and as happy as an <i>apostle</i>.</p>
