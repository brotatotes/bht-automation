Verse John 20:30. Many other signs truly did Jesus, c.] That is, besides the two mentioned here. John 20:19 John 20:26, viz. Christ's entering into the house in a miraculous manner twice, notwithstanding the doors were fast shut: see on John 20:19. The other miracles which our Lord did, and which are not related here, were such as were necessary to the disciples only, and therefore not revealed to mankind at large. There is nothing in the whole revelation of God but what is for some important purpose, and there is nothing left out that could have been of any real use.
