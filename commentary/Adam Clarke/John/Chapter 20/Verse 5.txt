<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:5">John 20:5</span>. <i><b>Went he not in.</b></i> â€” Why? Because he was fully satisfied that the body was not there. But why did he not seize upon the linen clothes, and keep them as a most precious <i>relic</i>? Because he had too much religion and too much sense; and the time of superstition and nonsense was not yet arrived, in which <i>bits</i> of <i>rotten wood, rags</i> of <i>rotten cloth, decayed bones</i> (to whom originally belonging no one knows) and <i>bramble</i> bushes, should become objects of religious adoration.</p>
