<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:7">John 20:7</span>. <i><b>Wrapped together in a place by itself.</b></i> â€” The providence of God ordered these very little matters, so that they became the fullest proofs against the <i>lie</i> of the chief priests, that the body had been stolen away by the disciples. If the body had been stolen away, those who took it would not have stopped to <i>strip</i> the clothes from it, and to <i>wrap</i> them up, and lay them by in <i>separate</i> places.</p>
