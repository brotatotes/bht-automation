<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:9">John 20:9</span>. <i><b>They knew not the scripture</b></i> — Viz. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:9-10">Psalms 16:9-10</span>: <i>Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell </i>- כי לא תעזב נפשי לשאול ki lo <i>taazob naphshi l'sheol - For thou wilt not abandon my life to the</i> <i>grave, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption</i>. It was certainly a reproach to the disciples that they had not understood this prophecy, when our Lord had given them often the most direct information concerning it. Christ had referred to the history of Jonah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:40">Matthew 12:40</span>, which was at once the <i>type</i> and the proof of his own resurrection. However, this ingenuous confession of John, in a matter so dishonourable to himself, is a full proof of his sincerity, and of the truth of his narration.</p>
