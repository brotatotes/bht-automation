Verse John 21:12. Come and dine. — δευτε αριστησατε. Though this is the literal translation of the word, yet it must be observed that it was not dinner time, being as yet early in the morning, John 21:4; but Kypke has largely shown that the original word is used by Homer, Xenophon, and Plutarch, to signify breakfast, or any early meal, as well as what we term dinner. It might perhaps appear singular, otherwise it would be as agreeable to the use of the Greek word, to have translated it, come and breakfast.Durst ask him — Ever since the confession of Thomas, a proper awe of the Deity of Christ had possessed their minds.
