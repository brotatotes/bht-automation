<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:12">John 21:12</span>. <i><b>Come and dine.</b></i> — δευτε αριστησατε. Though this is the <i>literal</i> translation of the word, yet it must be observed that it was not dinner time, being as yet early in the morning, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:4">John 21:4</span>; but Kypke has largely shown that the original word is used by <i>Homer, Xenophon</i>, and <i>Plutarch</i>, to signify <i>breakfast</i>, or any early meal, as well as what we term <i>dinner</i>. It might perhaps appear singular, otherwise it would be as agreeable to the use of the Greek word, to have translated it, <i>come and breakfast</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Durst ask him</b></i> — Ever since the confession of Thomas, a proper awe of the Deity of Christ had possessed their minds.</p>
