Verse John 21:14. This is now the third time â€” That is, this was the third time he appeared unto the apostles, when all or most of them were together. He appeared to ten of them, John 20:19; again to eleven of them, John 20:26; and at this time to seven of them, John 21:2. But, when the other evangelists are collated, we shall find that this was the seventh time in which he had manifested himself after he arose from the dead.1st. He appeared to Mary of Magdala, Mark 16:9; John 20:15-16.2ndly, To the holy women who came from the tomb. Matthew 28:9.3dly, To the two disciples who went to Emmaus, Luke 24:13, c.4thly, To St. Peter alone, Luke 24:34.5thly, To the ten, in the absence of Thomas, John 20:19.6thly, Eight days after to the eleven, Thomas being present John 20:26.7thly, To the seven, mentioned in John 21:2; which was between the eighth and fortieth day after his resurrection. Besides these seven appearances, he showed himself,8thly, To the disciples on a certain mountain in Galilee, Matthew 28:16.If the appearance mentioned by St. Paul, 1 Corinthians 15:6, to upwards of 500 brethren at once - if this be not the same with his appearance on a mountain in Galilee, it must be considered the ninth. According to the same apostle, he was seen of James, 1 Corinthians 15:7, which may have been the tenth appearance. And, after this, to all the apostles, when, at Bethany, he ascended to heaven in their presence. See Mark 16:19-20; Luke 24:50-53; Acts 1:3-12; 1 Corinthians 15:7. This appears to have been the eleventh time in which he distinctly manifested himself after his resurrection. But there might have been many other manifestations, which the evangelists have not thought proper to enumerate, as not being connected with any thing of singular weight or importance.
