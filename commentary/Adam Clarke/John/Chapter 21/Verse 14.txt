<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:14">John 21:14</span>. <i><b>This is now the third time</b></i> â€” That is, this was the <i>third</i> time he appeared unto the apostles, when <i>all</i> or <i>most</i> of them were together. He appeared to <i>ten</i> of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span>; again to <i>eleven</i> of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:26">John 20:26</span>; and at this time to <i>seven</i> of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>. But, when the other evangelists are collated, we shall find that this was the <i>seventh</i> time in which he had manifested himself after he arose from the dead.</p>
<p>1st. He appeared to Mary of Magdala, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:9">Mark 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:15-16">John 20:15-16</span>.</p>
<p>2ndly, To the holy women who came from the tomb. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span>.</p>
<p>3dly, To the two disciples who went to Emmaus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13">Luke 24:13</span>, c.</p>
<p>4thly, To St. Peter alone, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:34">Luke 24:34</span>.</p>
<p>5thly, To the <i>ten</i>, in the absence of Thomas, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span>.</p>
<p>6thly, Eight days after to the <i>eleven</i>, Thomas being present <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:26">John 20:26</span>.</p>
<p>7thly, To the <i>seven</i>, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>; which was between the <i>eighth</i> and <i>fortieth</i> day after his resurrection. Besides these <i>seven</i> appearances, he showed himself,</p>
<p>8thly, To the disciples on a certain mountain in Galilee, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16">Matthew 28:16</span>.</p>
<p>If the appearance mentioned by St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>, to upwards of 500 brethren at once - if this be not the same with his appearance on a mountain in Galilee, it must be considered the <i>ninth</i>. According to the same apostle, he was seen of James, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:7">1 Corinthians 15:7</span>, which may have been the <i>tenth</i> appearance. And, after this, to all the apostles, when, at Bethany, he ascended to heaven in their presence. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19-20">Mark 16:19-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50-53">Luke 24:50-53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3-12">Acts 1:3-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:7">1 Corinthians 15:7</span>. This appears to have been the <i>eleventh</i> time in which he distinctly manifested himself after his resurrection. But there might have been many other manifestations, which the evangelists have not thought proper to enumerate, as not being connected with any thing of singular weight or importance.</p>
