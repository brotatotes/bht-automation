<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15">John 21:15</span>. <i><b>Simon lovest thou me</b></i> — Peter had <i>thrice</i> denied his Lord, and now Christ gives him an opportunity in some measure to repair his fault by a <i>triple</i> confession.</p>
<p><i><b>More than these?</b></i> — This was a kind of reproach to Peter: he had professed a more affectionate attachment to Christ than the rest; he had been more forward in making professions of friendship and love than any of the others; and no one (Judas excepted) had treated his Lord so basely. As he had before intimated that his attachment to his Master was <i>more</i> than that of the <i>rest</i>, our Lord now puts the question to him, <i>Dost thou love me more than these</i>? To which Peter made the most modest reply - <i>Thou knowest I love</i> <i>thee</i>, but no longer dwells on the <i>strength</i> of his love, nor <i>compares</i> himself with even the meanest of his brethren. He had before cast the very unkind reflection on his brethren, <i>Though all</i> <i>be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:33">Matthew 26:33</span>. But he had now learned, by dreadful experience, that he who trusteth his own heart is a fool; and that a man's sufficiency for good is of the Lord alone.</p>
<p>The words, <i>more than these</i>, Bishop Pearce thinks refer to the <i>provisions</i> they were eating, or to their <i>secular employments</i>; for says he, "It does not seem probable that Jesus should put a question to Peter which he could not possibly answer; because he could only know his own degree of love for Jesus, not that of the other disciples." But it appears to me that our Lord refers to the profession made by Peter, which I have quoted above.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that in these three questions our Lord uses the verb αγαπαω, which signifies to <i>love affectionately, ardently,</i> <i>supremely, perfectly </i>- <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:37">Matthew 21:37</span>; and that Peter always replies, using the verb φιλεω, which signifies to <i>love</i>, to <i>like</i>, to <i>regard</i>, to <i>feel friendship</i> for another. As if our Lord had said, "Peter, dost thou love me ardently and supremely?" To which he answers, "Lord, I feel an affection for thee-I do esteem thee-but dare, at present, say no more."</p>
<p>There is another remarkable change of terms in this place. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15">John 21:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:17">John 21:17</span>, our Lord uses the verb βοσκδω, <i>to feed</i>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:16">John 21:16</span> he uses the word ποιμαινω, which signifies to <i>tend a flock</i>, not only to <i>feed</i>, but to <i>take care of, guide, govern, defend</i>, c., by which he seems to intimate that it is not sufficient merely to <i>offer</i> the bread of life to the congregation of the Lord, but he must take care that the sheep be properly <i>collected, attended to, regulated, guided</i>, c. and it appears that Peter perfectly comprehended our Lord's meaning, and saw that it was a direction given not only to <i>him</i>, and to the rest of the <i>disciples</i>, but to all their <i>successors</i> in the Christian ministry for himself says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:2">1 John 5:2</span>: <i>Feed the flock of God</i> (ποιμανατε το ποιμνιον του Θεου) <i>which is</i> <i>among you, taking the oversight</i> (επισκοπουντες, acting as <i>superintendents</i> and <i>guardians</i>,) <i>not by constraint, but</i> <i>willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind</i>. Every spiritual shepherd of Christ has a flock, composed of LAMBS-<i>young</i> <i>converts</i>, and SHEEP-<i>experienced Christians</i>, to <i>feed, guide,</i> <i>regulate</i>, and <i>govern</i>. To be properly qualified for this, his wisdom and holiness should always exceed those of his flock. Who is sufficient for these things? The man who lives in God, and God in him.</p>
<p>To the answer of Christ, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:16">John 21:16</span>, the later <i>Syriac</i> adds, <i>If thou lovest me and esteemest me</i>, feed my sheep.</p>
