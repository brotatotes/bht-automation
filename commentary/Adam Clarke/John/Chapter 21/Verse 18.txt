<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span>. <i><b>Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands</b></i> â€” Wetstein observes that it was a custom at Rome to put the necks of those who were to be crucified into a yoke, and to <i>stretch out their hands</i> and fasten them to the end of it; and having thus led them through the city they were carried out to be crucified. See his note on this place. Thus then Peter was girded, chained, and carried <i>whither he</i> <i>would not </i>- not that he was unwilling to die for Christ; but he was a <i>man </i>- he did not <i>love death</i>; but he loved his <i>life less</i> than he loved his <i>God</i>.</p>
