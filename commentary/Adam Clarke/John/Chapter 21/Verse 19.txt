<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span>. <i><b>Should glorify God.</b></i> — Ancient writers state that, about thirty-four years after this, Peter was crucified; and that he deemed it so <i>glorious</i> a thing to die for Christ that he begged to be crucified with his <i>head downwards</i>, not considering himself worthy to die in the same posture in which his Lord did. So <i>Eusebius, Prudentius, Chrysostom</i>, and <i>Augustin</i>. See <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Follow me.</b></i> — Whether our Lord meant by these words that Peter was to walk with him a little way for a private interview, or whether he meant that he was to imitate his example, or be conformed to him in the manner of his death, is very uncertain.</p>
