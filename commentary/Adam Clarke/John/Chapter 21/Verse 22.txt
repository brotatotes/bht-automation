<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:22">John 21:22</span>. <i><b>If I will that he tarry till I come</b></i> â€” There are several opinions concerning this: the following are the principal.</p>
<p>1. Some have concluded from these words that John should <i>never die</i>. Many eminent men, <i>ancients</i> and <i>moderns</i>, have been and are of this opinion.</p>
<p>2. Others thought that our Lord intimated that John should live till Christ came to judge and destroy Jerusalem. On this opinion it is observed that Peter, who was the <i>oldest</i> of the apostles, died in the year 67, which, says Calmet, was six years before the destruction of Jerusalem; and that John survived the ruin of that city about thirty years, he being the only one of the <i>twelve</i> who was alive when the above desolation took place.</p>
<p>3. St. <i>Augustin, Bede</i>, and others, understood the passage thus: If I will that he remain till I come and take him away by a <i>natural</i> <i>death</i>, what is that to thee? follow thou me to thy <i>crucifixion</i>. On this it may be observed, that all antiquity agrees that John, if he did die, was the only disciple who was taken away by a <i>natural</i> <i>death</i>.</p>
<p>4. Others imagine that our Lord was only now taking Peter <i>aside</i> to speak something to him in private, and that Peter, seeing John following, wished to know whether he should come along with them; and that our Lord's answer stated that John should remain <i>in that place</i> till Christ and Peter returned to him; and to this meaning of the passage many eminent critics incline. For neatly eighteen hundred years, the greatest men in the world have been puzzled with this passage. It mould appear intolerable in me to attempt to <i>decide</i>, where so many eminent doctors have disagreed, and do still disagree. I rather lean to the fourth opinion. See the conclusion of the Preface to this Gospel.</p>
