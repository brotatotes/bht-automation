<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:25">John 21:25</span>. <i><b>Many other things</b></i> — <i>Before his disciples</i>, is added by <i>two</i> MSS. The Scholia in several MSS. intimate that this verse is an <i>addition</i>; but it is found in every ancient version, and in <i>Origen, Cyril</i>, and <i>Chrysostom</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Could not contain</b></i>, c.] <i>Origen's</i> signification of the word χωρειν is to <i>admit of</i>, or <i>receive favourably</i>. As if he had said, the miracles of Christ are so many, and so astonishing, that if the whole were to be detailed, the world would not receive the account with proper faith but enough is recorded that men may believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and that in believing they may have life through his name: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31">John 20:31</span>.</p>
<p>We have already seen that this apostle often uses the term <i>world</i> to designate the <i>Jewish people</i> only; and if it have this sense here, which is possible, it will at once vindicate the above exposition of the word χωρειν. As if he had said, Were I to detail all the signs and miracles which Jesus did among his disciples, and in the private families where he sojourned, the Jewish people themselves would not receive nor credit these accounts; but enough is written to prove that this Christ was the promised Messiah.</p>
<p>Bishop Pearce has a very judicious note here, of which what follows is an abstract, with a few additions.</p>
<p><i>Even the world itself</i>, c. This is a very strong eastern expression, to represent the number of miracles which Jesus wrought. But, however strong and strange this expression may seem to us of the western world, we find sacred and other authors using hyperboles of the like kind and signification. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+13:33">Numbers 13:33</span>, the spies who returned from the search of the land of Canaan say that they saw <i>giants</i> there of such a prodigious size that they were <i>in</i> <i>their own sight as grasshoppers</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+4:11">Daniel 4:11</span>, mention is made of a tree, whereof <i>the height reached unto the heaven and the sight</i> <i>thereof unto the end of all the earth</i>. And the author of Ecclesiasticus, in 47:15, speaking of Solomon's wisdom, says, <i>Thy</i> <i>soul covered the whole earth, and thou filledst it with parables</i>: so here, by one degree more of hyperbole, it is said that the world would not contain all the books which should be written concerning Jesus's miracles, if the particular account of every one of them were given. In Josephus, Antiq. lib. xix. c. 20, God is mentioned as promising to Jacob that he would give the land of Canaan to him and his seed; and then it is added, οἱ πληρουσι πασαν, ὁσην ἡλιος ὁρᾳ, και γην και θαλασσαν. <i>They shall fill all,</i> <i>whatsoever the sun illuminates, whether earth or sea</i>. Philo in his tract <i>De Ebriet</i>, T. i. p. 362, 10, is observed to speak after the same manner, ουδε γαρ των δωρεων ἱκανος ουδεις χωρησαι το αφθονον πληθος, ισως δ' ουδ' ὁ κοσμος. Neither is any one <i>able to contain</i> the vast abundance of gifts; nor is the <i>world capable of it</i>. And in his tract De Posterit. Caini, T. i. p. 253, l. 38, he says, speaking of the fulness of God, Ουδε γαρ εις (ει) πλουτον επιδεικνυσθαι βουληθειη τον ἑαυτου, χωρησαι αν, ηπειρωθεισης και θαλαττης, ἡ συμπασα γη. And should he will to draw out his fulness, the whole compass of sea and land <i>could not contain it</i>."</p>
<p>Homer, who, if not born in Asia Minor, had undoubtedly lived there, has sometimes followed the hyperbolic manner of speaking which prevailed so much in the east, as in Iliad, b. xx. he makes AEneas say to Achilles: - </p>
<p>We may define <i>hyperbole</i> thus: it is a figure of speech where more seems to be said than is intended; and it is well known that the Asiatic nations abound in these. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:28">Deuteronomy 1:28</span>, cities with <i>high walls</i> round about them are said to be <i>walled up to heaven</i>. Now, what is the meaning of this hyperbole? Why, that the cities had <i>very high walls</i>: then, is the hyperbole a <i>truth</i>? Yes, for we should attach no <i>other idea</i> to these expressions than the authors intended to convey by them. Now, the author of this expression never designed to intimate that the cities had walls <i>which reached</i> <i>to heaven</i>; nor did one of his countrymen understand it in this sense - they affixed no other idea to it, (for the words, in common use, conveyed no other,) than that these cities had <i>very high</i> <i>walls</i>. When John, therefore, wrote, <i>the world itself could not</i> <i>contain the books</i>, c., what would every Jew understand by it! Why, that if <i>every</i> thing which Christ had <i>done</i> and <i>said</i> were to be written, the books would be more in number than <i>had ever been</i> <i>written concerning any one person</i> or <i>subject</i>: i.e. there would be an <i>immense number of books</i>. And so there would be for it is not possible that the ten thousandth part of the <i>words</i> and <i>actions</i> of such a life as our Lord's was could be contained in the compass of <i>one</i> or <i>all</i> of these Gospels.</p>
<p>There is a hyperbole very like this, taken from the Jewish writers, and inserted by BASNAGE, <i>Hist. des Juifs, liv</i>. iii. c. 1, s. 9. "Jochanan succeeded Simeon - he attained the age of Moses - he employed forty years in commerce, and in pleading before the Sanhedrin. <i>He composed such a great number of precepts and</i> <i>lessons, that if the heavens were paper, and all the trees of the</i> <i>forest so many pens, and all the children of men so many scribes,</i> <i>they would not suffice to write all his lessons</i>!" Now, what meaning did the author of this hyperbole intend to convey? Why, that Jochanan had given more lessons than all his <i>contemporaries</i> or <i>predecessors</i>. Nor does any Jew in the universe understand the words in any <i>other</i> sense. It is worthy of remark that this Jochanan lived in the time of St. John; for he was in Jerusalem when it was besieged by Vespasian. See <i>Basnage</i>, as above.</p>
<p>There is another quoted by the same author, ibid. c. v. s. 7, where, speaking of Eliezar, one of the presidents of the Sanhedrin, it is said: "Although the <i>firmament were vellum, and</i> <i>the waters of the ocean were chanced into ink, it would not be</i> <i>sufficient to describe all the knowledge of Eliezar</i>; for he made not less than three hundred constitutions concerning the manner of cultivating cucumbers." Now, what did the rabbin mean by <i>this</i> hyperbole? Why, no more than that Eliezar was the greatest <i>naturalist</i> in his time; and had written and spoken more on that subject and others than any of his contemporaries. This Eliezar flourished about seventy-three years after Christ. It is farther worthy of remark that this man also is stated to have lived in the time of St. John. John is supposed to have died A. D. 99.</p>
<p>Hyperboles of this kind, common to the east and to the west, to the north and to the south, may be found every where; and no soul is puzzled with them but the <i>critics</i>. The above examples, I trust, are sufficient to vindicate and explain the words in the text. It is scarcely necessary to add that the common French expression, <i>tout le monde</i>, which literally means <i>the whole world</i>, is used in a million of instances to signify the <i>people</i> present at <i>one</i> <i>meeting</i>, or the <i>majority</i> of them, and often the members of <i>one</i> <i>particular family</i>. And yet no man who understands the language ever imagines that <i>any</i> besides the <i>congregation</i> in the one case, or the <i>family</i> in the other, is intended.</p>
<p><i><b>Amen.</b></i> — This word is omitted by ABCD, several others; <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, and both the <i>Persic</i>; the <i>Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Syriac</i> Hieros., <i>Vulgate</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i> but <i>three</i>.</p>
<p>The word <i>amen</i>, which has passed unaltered into almost all the languages of the world in which the sacred writings are extant, is pure Hebrew; and signifies to be <i>steady, constant,</i> <i>firm, established</i>, or <i>confirmed</i>. It is used as a particle of <i>affirmation</i> and <i>adjuration</i>. When a person was sworn to the truth of any fact, the oath was recited to him, and he bound himself by simply saying, אמן אמן <i>amen, amen</i>. See an instance of this, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+5:22">Numbers 5:22</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+27:15-26">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</span>, it is to be understood in the same sense; the persons who use it binding themselves, under the curse there pronounced, should they do any of the things there prohibited. It is often used as a particle of affirmation, approbation, and consent, examples of which frequently occur in the Old Testament. When any person commenced a discourse or testimony with this word, it was considered in the light of an <i>oath</i>; as if he had said, I pledge my truth, my honour, and my life to the certainty of what I now state.</p>
<p>Our Lord begins many of his discourses with this word, either singly, <i>Amen, I say unto you</i>; or doubled, <i>Amen, amen, I say unto</i> <i>you</i>; which we translate <i>verily</i>: as Christ uses it, we may ever understand it as expressing an <i>absolute</i> and <i>incontrovertible</i> <i>truth</i>. Instances of the use of the <i>single</i> term frequently occur: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:18">Matthew 5:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:26">Matthew 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5">Matthew 6:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:16">Matthew 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:10">Matthew 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:15">Matthew 10:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:42">Matthew 10:42</span>, c., c. but it is remarkable that it is <i>doubled</i> by St. John, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11">John 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24-25">John 5:24-25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:32">John 6:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:47">John 6:47</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:53">John 6:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:34">John 8:34</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:51">John 8:51</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:24">John 12:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:16">John 13:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:20">John 13:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:21">John 13:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:38">John 13:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:20">John 16:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span>; and is never found iterated by any of the other evangelists. Some have supposed that the word אמן is <i>contracted</i>, and contains the <i>initials</i> of אדני מלך נעמן <i>Adonai</i> <i>Malec Neeman, my Lord the faithful King</i>; to whom the person who uses it is always understood to make his appeal. Christ is himself called the Amen, ὁ Αμην, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>; because of the eternity of his nature and the unchangeableness of his truth. In later ages, it was placed at the end of all the books in the New Testament, except the <i>Acts</i>, the Epistle of <i>James</i>, and the third Epistle of <i>John</i>, merely as the transcriber's <i>attestation</i> to their truth; and, perhaps, it is sometimes to be understood as vouching to the fidelity of his own transcript.</p>
<p>The subscriptions to this Gospel, as well as to the preceding Gospels, are various in the different versions and manuscripts. The following are those which appear most worthy of being noticed.</p>
<p>"The most holy Gospel of the preaching of John the evangelist, which he spake and proclaimed in the Greek language at Ephesus, is finished." - SYRIAC in <i>Bib. Polyglott</i>.</p>
<p>"With the assistance of the supreme God, the Gospel of St. John the son of Zebedee, the beloved of the Lord, and the preacher of eternal life, is completed. And it is the conclusion of the four most holy and vivifying Gospels, by the blessing of God. Amen." - ARABIC in <i>Bib. Polyglott</i>.</p>
<p>"The four glorious Gospels, of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are completed."-PERSIC in <i>Bib. Polyglott</i>.</p>
<p>Other subscriptions are as follow:-</p>
<p>"The end of the holy Gospel of John - delivered thirty years - thirty-two years after the ascension of Christ - in the Isle of Patmos - in the Greek tongue at Ephesus - under the reign of Domitian - written by John when he was an exile in Patmos - under the Emperor Trajan - and delivered in Ephesus by Gaius the host of the apostles. <i>John, having returned from his exile in Patmos, composed</i> <i>his Gospel, being 100 years of age and lived to the age of</i> <i>120</i>." - SUIDAS.</p>
<p>In an AEthiopic MS. in the royal library in Paris, at the conclusion of this evangelist are these words: - "Now the sum of all the clauses of the four Gospels is 9700. - By the grace of the Lord, here are ended the four Gospels. The sections of the four Gospels are 217. The clauses of the holy Gospel, even from its beginning to its end, namely, the writing of St. John, are completed."</p>
<p>It may be just necessary to inform the reader that the most ancient MSS. have scarcely any subscription at all, and that there is no dependence to be placed on any thing of this kind found in the others; most of the transcribers making conclusions according to their different fancies. See the concluding note of the preceding chapter; and see the <i>preface</i> to this Gospel, where other subjects relative to it are discussed.</p>
