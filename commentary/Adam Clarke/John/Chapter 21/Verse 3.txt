<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:3">John 21:3</span>. <i><b>Peter saith - I go a fishing.</b></i> — Previously to the crucifixion of our Lord, the temporal necessities of himself and his disciples appear to have been supplied by the charity of individuals: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>. As it is probable that the scandal of the cross had now shut up this source of support, the disciples, not fully knowing <i>how</i> they were to be employed, purposed to return to their former occupation of fishing, in order to gain a livelihood; and therefore the <i>seven</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>, embarked on the sea of Tiberias, otherwise called the sea of Galilee.</p>
<p><i><b>That night they caught nothing.</b></i> — God had so ordered it, that they might be the more struck with the miracle which he afterwards wrought.</p>
