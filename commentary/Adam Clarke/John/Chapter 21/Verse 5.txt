<p><i><b>Any meat</b></i> — προσφαγιον from προς, <i>besides</i>, and φαγω, <i>I</i> <i>eat</i>; any thing that is <i>eaten with bread</i>, or such like solid substances, to make the deglutition the more easy: here it evidently means any kind of <i>fish</i>; and our Lord seems to have appeared at first in the character of a person who wished to purchase a part of what they had caught: <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:9">John 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:9">John 6:9</span></span>.</p>
