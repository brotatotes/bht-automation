<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:7">John 21:7</span>. His <i><b>fisher's coat</b></i> — Or, his <i>upper coat</i>. επενδυτην, from επι, <i>upon</i>, and ενδυω, <i>I clothe</i>; something analagous to what we term a <i>great coat</i> or <i>surtout</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He was naked</b></i> — He was only in his <i>vest</i>. γυμνος, <i>naked</i>, is often used to signify the <i>absence</i> of this <i>upper garment only</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+19:24">1 Samuel 19:24</span>, when Saul had put off his ιματια, <i>upper garments</i>, he is said to have been γυμνος, <i>naked</i>; and David, when <i>girded</i> only with a <i>linen ephod</i>, is said to have been <i>uncovered</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+6:14">2 Samuel 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+6:20">2 Samuel 6:20</span>. To which may be added what we read in the <i>Sept</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+22:6">Job 22:6</span>, <i>Thou hast taken away the covering of the naked</i>; αμφιασιν γυμνων, the <i>plaid</i> or <i>blanket</i> in which they wrapped themselves, and besides which they had none other. In this sense it is that Virgil says, Geor. i. 299: <i>Nudus ara, sere nudus</i>, i.e. strip off your <i>upper</i> <i>garments</i>, and work till you <i>sweat</i>. See more examples in Bp. Pearce.</p>
<p><i><b>Cast himself into the sea.</b></i> — It is likely that they were in very shallow water; and, as they were only two hundred cubits from the land, (about one hundred and thirty-two English yards,) it is possible that Peter only stepped into the water that he might assist them to draw the boat to land, which was now heavily laden. It is not likely that he went into the water in order to swim ashore; had he intended this, it is not to be supposed that he would have put his <i>great coat on</i>, which must have been an essential hinderance to him in getting to shore.</p>
