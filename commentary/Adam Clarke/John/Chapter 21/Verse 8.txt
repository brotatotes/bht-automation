<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:8">John 21:8</span>. <i><b>Dragging the net</b></i> â€” It is probable that this was that species of fishing in which the net was stretched from the shore out into the sea; the persons who were in the boat, and who shot the net, fetched a compass, and bringing in a hawser, which was attached to the other end of the net, those who were on shore helped them to drag it in. As the net was <i>sunk</i> with <i>weights</i> to the bottom, and the top <i>floated</i> on the water by <i>corks</i>, or <i>pieces</i> of <i>light wood</i>, all the fish that happened to come within the compass of the net were of course dragged to shore. The sovereign power of Christ had in this case miraculously collected the fish to that part where he ordered the disciples to cast the net.</p>
