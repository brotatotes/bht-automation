Verse John 21:9. They saw a fire, c.] This appears to have been a new miracle. It could not have been a fire which the disciples had there, for it is remarked as something new besides, they had caught no fish, John 21:5, and here was a small fish upon the coals, and a loaf of bread provided to eat with it. The whole appears to have been miraculously prepared by Christ.
