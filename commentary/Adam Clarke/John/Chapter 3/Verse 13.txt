<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>. <i><b>No man hath ascended</b></i> — This seems a figurative expression for, <i>No man hath known the mysteries of the kingdom of</i> <i>God</i>; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+30:12">Deuteronomy 30:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+73:17">Psalms 73:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:4">Proverbs 30:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:34">Romans 11:34</span>. And the expression is founded upon this generally received maxim: That to be perfectly acquainted with the concerns of a place, it is necessary for a person to be on the spot. But our Lord probably spoke to correct a false notion among the Jews, viz. that Moses had ascended to heaven, in order to get the law. It is not Moses who is to be heard now, but <i>Jesus</i>: Moses did not ascend to heaven; but the Son of man is come down from heaven to reveal the Divine will.</p>
<p><i><b>That came down</b></i> — The incarnation of Christ is represented under the notion of his <i>coming down</i> from heaven, to dwell upon earth.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is in heaven.</b></i> — Lest a wrong meaning should be taken from the foregoing expression, and it should be imagined that, in order to manifest himself upon earth he must necessarily leave heaven; our blessed Lord qualifies it by adding, <i>the Son of man who is in</i> <i>heaven</i>; pointing out, by this, the <i>ubiquity</i> or <i>omnipresence</i> of his nature: a character essentially belonging to God; for no being can possibly exist in more places than <i>one</i> at a time, but HE who <i>fills the heavens and the earth</i>.</p>
