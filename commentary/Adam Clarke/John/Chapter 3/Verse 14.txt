<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span>. <i><b>As Moses lifted up</b></i> â€” He shows the reason why he descended from heaven, that he might be <i>lifted up</i>, i.e. crucified, for the salvation of man. kind, and be, by the appointment of God, as certain a remedy for sinful souls as the brazen serpent elevated on a pole, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:9">Numbers 21:9</span>, was for the bodies of the Israelites, which had been bitten by the fiery serpents in the wilderness. It does not appear to me that the brazen serpent was ever intended to be considered as a <i>type</i> of Christ. It is possible to draw likenesses and resemblances out of any thing; but, in such matters as these, we should take heed that we go no farther than we can say, <i>Thus it is written</i>. Among the Jews, the brazen serpent was considered a type of the resurrection-through it the dying lived; and so, by the voice of God, they that were dead shall be raised to life. As the serpent was raised up, so shall Christ be lifted up: as they who were stung by the fiery serpents were restored by looking up to the brazen serpent, so those who are infected with and dying through sin are healed and saved, by looking up to and believing in Christ crucified. These are all the analogies which we can legitimately trace between the lifting up of the brazen serpent, and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The lifting up of the Son of man may refer to his mediatorial office at the right hand of God. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:9">Numbers 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:9">Numbers 21:9</span></span>.</p>
