<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:15">John 3:15</span>. <i><b>That whosoever believeth</b></i> — Bp. Pearce supposes that this verse is only the conclusion of the 16th, and that it has been inserted in this place by mistake. The words contain the <i>reason</i> of the subject in the following verse, and seem to break in upon our Lord's argument before he had fully stated it. The words, μη αποληται αλλα, <i>may not perish but</i>, are omitted by some very ancient MSS. and versions.</p>
