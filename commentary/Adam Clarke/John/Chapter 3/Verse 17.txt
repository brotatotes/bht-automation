<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>. <i><b>For God sent not</b></i>, c.] It was the opinion of the Jews that the Gentiles, whom they often term <i>the world</i>, עלמה olmah, and <i>omoth haolam, </i><i>אומות העולם </i><i>nations of the world</i>, were to be destroyed in the days of the Messiah. Christ corrects this false opinion and teaches here a contrary doctrine. God, by giving his Son, and publishing his design in giving him, shows that he purposes the salvation, not the destruction, of the world-the Gentile people: nevertheless, those who will not receive the salvation he had provided for them, whether <i>Jews</i> or <i>Gentiles</i>, must necessarily perish; for this plain reason, There is but <i>one</i> remedy, and they <i>refuse</i> to apply it.</p>
