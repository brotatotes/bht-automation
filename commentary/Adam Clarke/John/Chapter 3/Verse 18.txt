<p><i><b>Is not condemned</b></i> — For past sin, that being forgiven on his believing in Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>But he that believeth not</b></i> — When the Gospel is preached to him, and the way of salvation made plain.</p>
<p><i><b>Is condemned already</b></i> — Continues under the condemnation which Divine justice has passed upon all sinners; and has this superadded, <i>He hath not believed on the name of the only begotten</i> <i>Son of God</i>, and therefore is guilty of the grossest insult to the Divine majesty, in neglecting, slighting, and despising the salvation which the infinite mercy of God had provided for him.</p>
