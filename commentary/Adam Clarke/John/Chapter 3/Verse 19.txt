<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>. <i><b>This is the condemnation</b></i> — That is, this is the reason why any shall be found finally to perish, not that they came into the world with a perverted and corrupt nature, which is true; nor that they lived many years in the practice of sin, which is also true; but because they refused to receive the salvation which God sent to them.</p>
<p><i><b>Light is come</b></i> — That is, Jesus, the Sun of righteousness, the fountain of light and life; diffusing his benign influences every where, and favouring men with a clear and full revelation of the Divine will.</p>
<p><i><b>Men loved darkness</b></i> — Have preferred sin to holiness, Belial to Christ, and hell to heaven. חשך <i>chashac, darkness</i>, is frequently used by the Jewish writers for the <i>angel of death</i>, and for the <i>devil</i>. See many examples in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Because their deeds were evil.</b></i> — An allusion to robbers and cut-throats, who practise their abominations in the <i>night</i> season, for fear of being detected. The sun is a common blessing to the human race-it shines to all, envies none, and calls all to necessary labour. If any one choose rather to sleep by day, that he may rob and murder in the night season, he does this to his own peril, and has no excuse:-his punishment is the necessary consequence of his own unconstrained actions. So will the punishment of ungodly men be. There was <i>light </i>- they refused to walk in it. They chose to walk in the darkness, that they might do the works of darkness-they broke the Divine law, refused the mercy offered to them, are arrested by Divine justice, convicted, condemned, and punished. Whence, then, does their damnation proceed? From THEMSELVES.</p>
