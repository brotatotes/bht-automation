<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>. <i><b>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light</b></i> — He who doth vile or abominable things: alluding to the subject mentioned in the preceding verse.</p>
<p>The word φαυλος, <i>evil</i> or <i>vile</i>, is supposed by some to come from the Hebrew פלס <i>phalas</i>, to <i>roll</i>, and so <i>cover oneself in</i> <i>dust</i> or <i>ashes</i>, which was practised in token of <i>humiliation</i> and <i>grief</i>, not only by the more eastern nations, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+42:6">Job 42:6</span>, but also by the Greeks and Trojans, as appears from <i>Homer</i>, Iliad xviii. l. 26; xxii. l. 414; xxiv. l. 640; compare <i>Virgil</i>, AEn. x. l. 844; and <i>Ovid</i>, Metam. lib. viii. l. 528. From the above Hebrew word, it is likely that the Saxon <i>ful</i>, the English <i>foul</i>, the Latin <i>vilis</i>, and the English <i>vile</i>, are derived. See <i>Parkhurst</i> under φαυλος.</p>
<p><i><b>Lest his deeds should be reproved.</b></i> — Or <i>discovered</i>. To <i>manifest</i> or <i>discover</i>, is one sense of the original word, ελεγχω, in the best Greek writers; and it is evidently its meaning in this place.</p>
