<p>Verse 23. <i><b>In AEnon</b></i> — This place was eight miles southward from Scythopolis, between Salim and Jordan.</p>
<p><i><b>There was much water</b></i> — And this was equally necessary, where such multitudes were baptized, whether the ceremony were performed either by <i>dipping</i> or <i>sprinkling</i>. But as the Jewish custom required the persons to stand in the water, and, having been instructed, and entered into a covenant to renounce all idolatry, and take the God of Israel for their God, then <i>plunge themselves under the</i> <i>water</i>, it is probable that the rite was thus performed at AEnon. The consideration that <i>they dipped themselves</i>, tends to remove the difficulty expressed in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span><i>"</i>. See the observations at the end of Mark.</p>
