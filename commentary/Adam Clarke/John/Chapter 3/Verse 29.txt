Verse 29. He that hath the bride — The congregation of believers.Is the bridegroom — The Lord Jesus - the Head of the Church. See Matthew 22:2, &c., where the parable of the marriage feast is explained.The friend of the bridegroom — The person whom the Greeks called the paranymph - there were two at each wedding: one waited on the bride, the other on the bridegroom: their business was to serve them, to inspect the concerns of the bridechamber, and afterwards to reconcile differences between husband and wife, when any took place. John considers himself as standing in this relation to the Lord Jesus, while espousing human nature, and converting souls to himself: this is the meaning of standeth by, i.e. ready to serve. See the observations at the end of the chapter. John 3:36.
