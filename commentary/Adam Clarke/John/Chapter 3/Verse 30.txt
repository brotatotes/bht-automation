<p>Verse 30. <i><b>He must increase</b></i> â€” His present success is but the beginning of a most glorious and universal spread of righteousness, peace, truth, and good will among men.</p>
<p><i><b>I</b></i> must <i>decrease.</i>] My baptism and teaching, as pointing out the coming Messiah, must <i>cease</i>; because the Messiah is now come, and has entered publicly on the work of his glorious ministry.</p>
