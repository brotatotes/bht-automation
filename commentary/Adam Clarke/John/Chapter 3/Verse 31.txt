<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Is above all</b></i> — This blessed bridegroom, who has descended from heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>, is above all, superior to Moses, the prophets, and me.</p>
<p><i><b>He that is of the earth</b></i> — John himself, who was born in the common way of man.</p>
<p><i><b>Speaketh of the earth</b></i> — Cannot speak of heavenly things as Christ can do; and only represents Divine matters by these <i>earthly</i> <i>ordinances</i>; for the <i>spirit</i> and <i>meaning</i> of which, you must all go to the Messiah himself.</p>
