<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Hath set to his seal</b></i> â€” That is hath hereby confirmed the truth of the testimony which he has borne; as a testator sets his seal to an instrument in order to <i>confirm</i> it, and such instrument is considered as fully confirmed by having the testator's seal affixed to it, so I, by taking up this testimony of Christ, and proclaiming it to the Jews, have fully confirmed it, as I know it to be a truth; which knowledge I have from the immediate inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
