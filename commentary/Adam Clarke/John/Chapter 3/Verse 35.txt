Verse John 3:35. All things into his hand. â€” Matthew 11:27. A principal design of John is, to show that Christ was infinitely above every teacher, prophet, and Divine messenger that had ever yet appeared. The prophets had various gifts: some had visions, others dreams; some had the gift of teaching, others of comforting, c. but none possessed all these gifts: Christ alone possessed their plenitude, and is all things in all.
