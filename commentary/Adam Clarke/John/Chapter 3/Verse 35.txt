<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:35">John 3:35</span>. <i><b>All things into his hand.</b></i> â€” <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>. A principal design of John is, to show that Christ was infinitely above every teacher, prophet, and Divine messenger that had ever yet appeared. The prophets had various gifts: some had visions, others dreams; some had the gift of <i>teaching</i>, others of comforting, c. but none possessed all these gifts: Christ alone possessed their plenitude, and is all things in all.</p>
