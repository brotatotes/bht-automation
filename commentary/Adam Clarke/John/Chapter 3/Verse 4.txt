<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span>. <i><b>How can a man be born when he is old?</b></i> â€” It is probable that Nicodemus was pretty far advanced in age at this time; and from his answer we may plainly perceive that, like the rest of the Jews, and like multitudes of Christians, he rested in the <i>letter</i>, without paying proper attention to the <i>spirit</i>: the <i>shadow</i>, without the <i>thing signified</i>, had hitherto satisfied him. Our Lord knew him to be in this state, and this was the cause of his pointed address to him.</p>
