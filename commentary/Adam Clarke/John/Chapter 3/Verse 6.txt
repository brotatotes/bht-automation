<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:6">John 3:6</span>. <i><b>That which is born of the flesh is flesh</b></i> â€” This is the answer to the objection made by Nicodemus in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span>. <i>Can a man enter the second time into his mother's womb and be</i> <i>born</i>? Our Lord here intimates that, were even this possible, it would not answer the end; for the <i>plant</i> will ever be of the nature of the <i>seed</i> that produces it-<i>like</i> will beget its <i>like</i>. The kingdom of God is spiritual and holy; and that which is born of the Spirit resembles the Spirit; for as he is who begat, so is he who is begotten of him. Therefore, the spiritual regeneration is essentially necessary, to prepare the soul for a holy and spiritual kingdom.</p>
