<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:9">John 3:9</span>. <i><b>How can these things be?</b></i> â€” Our Lord had very plainly told him how these things could be, and illustrated the new birth by one of the most proper similes that could be chosen; but so intent was this great man an making every thing submit to the testimony of his senses that he appears unwilling to believe any thing, unless he can <i>comprehend</i> it. This is the case with many-they profess to believe because they comprehend; but they are impostors who speak thus: there is not a man in the universe that can fully comprehend <i>one</i> operation, either of <i>God</i> or his instrument <i>nature</i>; and yet they must believe, and do believe, though they never did nor ever can fully comprehend, or account for, the objects of their faith.</p>
