<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:10">John 4:10</span>. <i><b>If thou knewest the gift of God</b></i> — δωρεαν signifies a <i>free</i> gift. A <i>gift</i> is any thing that is <i>given</i>, for which no equivalent has been or is to be returned: a <i>free gift</i> is that which has been given without asking or entreaty. Such a <i>gift</i> of kindness was Jesus Christ to the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; and through him comes the gift of the Spirit, which those who believe on his name were to receive. Christ was not an <i>object of desire</i> to the world-no man asked for him; and God, moved thereto by his own eternal mercy, <i>freely gave</i> him. Through this great gift comes the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, and all other gifts which are necessary to the salvation of a lost world.</p>
<p><i><b>Living water.</b></i> — By this expression, which was common to the inhabitants both of the east and of the west, is always meant <i>spring water</i>, in opposition to <i>dead, stagnant water</i> contained in ponds, pools, tanks, or cisterns; and what our Lord means by it is evidently the Holy Spirit, as may be seen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38-39">John 7:38-39</span>.</p>
<p>As water <i>quenches</i> the <i>thirst, refreshes</i> and <i>invigorates</i> the <i>body, purifies</i> things <i>defiled</i>, and renders the <i>earth fruitful</i>, so it is an apt emblem of the gift of the Holy Ghost, which so <i>satisfies</i> the souls that receive it that they <i>thirst no more</i> for <i>earthly</i> good: it <i>purifies</i> also from all spiritual <i>defilement</i>, on which account it is emphatically styled the <i>Holy Spirit</i>; and it makes those who receive it <i>fruitful</i> in every good word and work.</p>
