<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:11">John 4:11</span>. <i><b>Thou hast nothing to draw with</b></i> — ουτε αντλημα εχεις, <i>Thou hast no bucket</i>. Good water is not plentiful in the east; and travellers are often obliged to carry leathern <i>bottles</i> or <i>buckets</i> with them, and a <i>line</i> also, to let them down into the deep wells, in order to draw up water. If the well was in our Lord's time, as it was found by Mr. Maundrell, thirty-five yards deep, it would require a considerable <i>line</i> to reach it; and with such it is not likely that even the disciples of our Lord were provided. The woman might well say, <i>The well is deep</i>, and <i>thou</i> <i>hast nothing to draw with; whence then hast thou that living</i> <i>water</i>?</p>
