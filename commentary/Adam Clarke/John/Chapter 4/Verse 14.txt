<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>. <i><b>Springing up into everlasting life.</b></i> â€” On this account he can never thirst:-for how can he lack water who has in himself a living, eternal spring? By this water our Lord means also his doctrine, explaining and promising the gifts and graces of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, which proceed from Jesus Christ their fountain, dwelling in a believing heart. There is no eternal life without the Spirit; no Spirit without Christ; and no Christ to give the Spirit, without dwelling in the heart: this his whole doctrine proclaims.</p>
