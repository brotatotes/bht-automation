<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:16">John 4:16</span>. <i><b>Call thy husband</b></i> â€” Our Lord appears to have spoken these words for two purposes:</p>
<p>1. To make the woman consider her own state.</p>
<p>2. To show her that he knew her heart, and the secret actions of her life; and was therefore well qualified to teach her heavenly truths.</p>
