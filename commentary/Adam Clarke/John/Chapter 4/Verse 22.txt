<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Ye worship ye know not what</b></i> — The Samaritans believed in the same God with the Jews; but, as they rejected all the prophetical writings, they had but an imperfect knowledge of the Deity: besides, as they incorporated the worship of idols with his worship, they might be justly said to worship him whom they did not properly know. See the account of their motley worship, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:26-34">2 Kings 17:26-34</span>. But after Sanballat had built the temple on Mount Gerizim, the idolatrous worship of the Cutheans and Sepharvites, c., was entirely laid aside the same religious service being performed in the Samaritan temple which was performed in that at Jerusalem.</p>
<p><i><b>We know what we worship</b></i> — We Jews acknowledge all the attributes of his nature, and offer to him <i>only</i> the sacrifices prescribed in the law.</p>
<p><i><b>Salvation is of the Jews.</b></i> — Εκ των Ιουδαιων εστιν, <i>Salvation is</i> <i>from the Jews</i>. <i>Salvation</i> seems here to mean the <i>Saviour</i>, the <i>Messiah</i>, as it does <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:30">Luke 2:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:12">Acts 4:12</span>: and so the woman appears to have understood it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:25">John 4:25</span>. The Messiah was to spring from the Jews-from them, the preaching of the Gospel, and the knowledge of the truth, were to go to all the nations of the world. It was to the Jews that the promises were made; and it was in their prophetic Scriptures, which the Samaritans rejected, that Jesus Christ was proclaimed and described.
