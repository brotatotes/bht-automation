<p>Verse 23. <i><b>The true worshippers shall worship - in spirit</b></i> â€” The worship of the Samaritans was a <i>defective</i> worship - they did not receive the prophetical writings: that of the Jews was a carnal worship, dealing only in the <i>letter</i>, and referring to the spirit and design, which were at a distance, by types and ceremonies. The Gospel of Christ showed the meaning of all these carnal ordinances, and the legal sacrifices, which had all their consummation in his offering of himself: thus a <i>spiritual</i> dispensation took the place of the <i>carnal</i> one which prefigured it. 2. The preaching of the Gospel discovered the true nature of God, of salvation, of the human soul, of earthly and of heavenly things; and, because of this, it is put in opposition to the <i>defective</i> Samaritan worship.</p>
