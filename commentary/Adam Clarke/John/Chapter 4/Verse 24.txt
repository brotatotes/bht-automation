<p>Verse 24. <i><b>God</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>a Spirit</b></i> â€” This is one of the first, the greatest, the most sublime, and necessary truths in the compass of nature! There is a God, the cause of all things - the fountain of all perfection - without parts or dimensions, for he is ETERNAL - <i>filling</i> the heavens and the earth - <i>pervading, governing</i>, and <i>upholding</i> all things: for he is an <i>infinite</i> SPIRIT! This God can be pleased only with that which resembles himself: therefore he must hate <i>sin</i> and <i>sinfulness</i>; and can delight in those only who are made partakers of his own Divine nature. As all creatures were made by him, so all owe him obedience and reverence; but, to be acceptable to this infinite Spirit, the worship must be of a <i>spiritual</i> nature - must spring from the <i>heart</i>, through the influence of the Holy Ghost: and it must be in TRUTH, not only in <i>sincerity</i>, but performed according to that Divine <i>revelation</i> which he has given men of himself. A man worships God in <i>spirit</i>, when, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, he brings all his affections, appetites, and desires to the throne of God; and he worships him in <i>truth</i>, when every purpose and passion of his heart, and when every act of his religious worship, is guided and regulated by the word of God. "The enlightened part of mankind," says Abu'l Fazel, "knows that <i>true righteousness</i> is an upright <i>heart</i>; and believe that God can only be worshipped in <i>holiness</i> of SPIRIT." Ayeen Akbery, vol. iii. p. 254.</p>
<p>"Of all worshippers," says Creeshna, "I respect him as the most devout, who hath faith in me, and who serveth me with a soul possessed of my spirit." Geeta, p. 68.</p>
