<p>Verse 25. <i><b>I know that Messias cometh</b></i> — Instead of οιδα <i>I know</i>, several excellent MSS. and versions read, οιδαμεν, <i>we know</i>; as if she had said that all the Samaritans expected the advent of the Messiah. Though they did not receive the prophetic writings, yet the tradition of the advent of the <i>Messiah</i>, which was common among the <i>Jews</i>, and founded on promises contained even in the books of Moses, was generally received among the Samaritans also.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is called Christ</b></i> — This appears to be the evangelist's explanation of the Hebrew word, according to his custom; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41-42">John 1:41-42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:7">John 9:7</span>, c. for we cannot suppose that the woman understood Greek, so as to translate the Hebrew word to our word; or that she should suppose that a person who was a <i>Jew</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:9">John 4:9</span>, and a <i>prophet</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:19">John 4:19</span>, could stand in need of this interpretation.</p>
<p><i><b>He will tell us all things.</b></i> — Relative to the nature of <i>God</i>, the nature of his worship, and the proper <i>place</i> to adore him in. In a word, he will settle the great national question between <i>Gerizim</i> and <i>Ebal</i>; and we shall then know certainly <i>where</i> we ought to worship.</p>
