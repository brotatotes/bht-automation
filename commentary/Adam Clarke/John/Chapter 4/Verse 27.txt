<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Came his disciples</b></i> — From the town, whither they went to buy food, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:8">John 4:8</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Marvelled that he talked with the woman</b></i> — Because it was contrary to the custom of the eastern countries; and there are many canons, among the rabbins, against it. To the present time, if a man meet even his own wife in the street, he does not speak to her; and this is done to keep up the <i>appearance</i> of a chastity and temperance of which the eastern world knows nothing. They might wonder how a Samaritan, in whom they could expect no <i>spirituality</i>, could listen to the conversation of their Master, who never spake but about heavenly things.</p>
<p><i><b>Yet no man said</b></i>, c.] They were awed by his majesty, and knew that he must have sufficient reasons to induce him to act a part to which he was not at all accustomed. A great man has said, "Converse sparingly, if at all, with women and never alone." Every minister of the Gospel will do well to attend to this advice.</p>
