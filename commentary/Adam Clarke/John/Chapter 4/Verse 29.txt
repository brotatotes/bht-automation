This they believed was predicted, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:2-3">Isaiah 11:2-3</span>.</p>
<p>When the famous impostor <i>Barchochab</i>, who rose up under the empire of Adrian, about a hundred years after the incarnation, professed himself to be the Messiah, after having been deceived by him for two years, they at last thought of putting his divinity to proof on this ground: they brought before him persons whom he did not know, some of whom were very vicious, and others of a different character; they desired him to point out who were the righteous, and who were the wicked; which when he could not do, they rose up and put him to death. <i>La Bible de Martin</i>.</p>
