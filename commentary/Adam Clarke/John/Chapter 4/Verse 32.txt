<p>Verse 32. <i><b>I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</b></i> â€” Our blessed Lord seizes every opportunity to raise the minds of his apostles to heavenly things, through the medium of earthly matters. Nor does he <i>force</i> these things into such service. Properly understood, earthly <i>substances</i> are the types, representatives, and shadows of heavenly things.</p>
