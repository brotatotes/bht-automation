<p>Verse 35. <i><b>There are yet four months, and</b></i><b> then </b><i><b>cometh harvest?</b></i> — In Palestine, the harvest did not begin till after the passover, which was fixed on the 14th of the month Nisan, which answers to our <i>March</i>, and sometimes extends into <i>April</i>. The <i>barley</i> harvest was the first; after that the <i>wheat</i>; and both were finished by <i>Pentecost</i>. For, in the feast of Pentecost, the first fruits of all the harvest were carried to the temple, and waved before the Lord. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:11">Leviticus 23:11</span>. The <i>four months</i>, of which our Lord speaks here, must be computed, according to M. Toynard, from <i>Shebat</i>, which was the eleventh month of the sacred year, and which commenced that year on the 13th of January: from that, till the beginning of the wheat harvest, which began about a month after the passover, there were exactly four months. The passover was that year on the 15th of Nisan, or March 28; and Pentecost took place on the 17th of May. We may therefore suppose that it was about the 13th of January, or beginning of the month Shebat, that John the Baptist was cast into prison, and that Christ retired into Galilee. The fixing of this epoch is of considerable importance. See Calmet's Com. on this place.</p>
<p>The following method of dividing the seasons among the Jews is thus stated in <i>Bava Metsia</i>, fol. 106. "Half <i>Tisri</i>, all <i>Marheshvan</i>, and half <i>Cisleu</i>, is זרע <i>zera</i>. SEED-TIME. Half <i>Cisleu</i>, whole <i>Tebeth</i>, and half <i>Shebat</i>, is חורף <i>choreph</i>, WINTER. Half <i>Shebat</i>, whole <i>Adar</i>, and half <i>Nisan</i>, is קור <i>kor</i>, the WINTER SOLSTICE. Half <i>Nisan</i>, all <i>Ijar</i>, and half <i>Sivan</i>, is קציר <i>katsir</i>, HARVEST. Half <i>Sivan</i>, all <i>Tammuz</i>, and half <i>Ab</i>, is קייץ <i>kyits</i>, SUMMER. Half <i>Ab</i>, all <i>Elul</i>, and half <i>Tisri</i>, is חום <i>chum</i>, the great HEAT." The Jews sowed <i>wheat</i> and <i>spelt</i> in <i>Tisri</i> and <i>Marheshvan</i>; and <i>barley</i> in <i>Shebat</i> and <i>Adar</i>. Now let us reckon τετραμηνον, the <i>four months</i>, backwards, from the beginning of the <i>barley harvest</i>, or the middle of the month <i>Nisan</i>, and we shall go back to the middle of the month <i>Cisleu</i>, which will fall in with the beginning of our <i>December</i>, whence it will be easy to conjecture what <i>feast</i> that was, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>, viz. the passover. See <i>Lightfoot</i>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>.</p>
<p>After all that learned men have said on this passage, it does not appear that our Lord meant any thing by it more than an illustration of his present subject. Though there were ordinarily four months from seed-time to harvest, and that a man, after he had sowed his seed, must wait patiently till the regular and natural harvest came, yet it was not the case now: the seed of life which he had sown but a few hours ago had already brought forth much fruit; therefore he says, <i>Lift up your eyes, and look</i> <i>on the fields</i>, over which it is likely the Samaritans were then coming in troops, guided by the woman who had already received the light of the Gospel of peace.</p>
<p><i><b>The fields - are white already to harvest.</b></i> — Multitudes of Samaritans are coming to believe on me, and to be saved unto eternal life. Probably they had a kind of <i>white</i> raiment.</p>
