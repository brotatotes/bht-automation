<p>Verse 36. <i><b>And he that reapeth receiveth wages</b></i> — Or, And <i>already</i> <i>the reaper receiveth wages</i>. By making the word ηδη, <i>already</i>, the beginning of this verse, on the authority of some excellent MSS. and versions, a more consistent sense is obtained than from the common arrangement, where ηδη terminates the preceding verse.</p>
<p><i>Already</i> the heavenly <i>sower</i>, Jesus Christ, becomes the <i>reaper</i> of the produce of the seed which he had so lately sown; and receives the <i>wages</i> which he desired, the high gratification of saving immortal souls; and <i>gathers in his fruit unto eternal life</i>. So the <i>sower</i> and the <i>reaper</i>, who are here <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i> <i>person, rejoiced together</i>, having seen the seed time and the harvest take place on the same day. The sower had not time to leave the field which he had sown, till it was full time to gather in the <i>harvest</i>!</p>
