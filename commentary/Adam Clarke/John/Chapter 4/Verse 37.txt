<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another</b></i><b> </b><i><b>reapeth.</b></i> — Or, <i>One is the sower, and another is the reaper</i>. In what respects <i>you</i>, of this business, this proverb is true-<i>One is the</i> <i>sower</i>, c., for I have sent you to reap, to preach my Gospel, and gain converts, where ye have not laboured-have not sown the first seeds of eternal life. Others have laboured-the <i>patriarchs</i> and <i>prophets</i>, and ye are entered into the fruits of their labours. They announced the Messiah who was to come, and the expectation of the people was excited, and they longed for his appearance but they were gathered to their fathers before they could see the fruit of their labour. You are come to tell the people that the kingdom of God is among them, and that God has visited his people.</p>
<p>The proverb which our Lord mentions above was taken from what ordinarily happens in the course of the Divine providence, where one takes a great deal of pains to procure that of which another reaps the benefit. See instances of this proverb, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+26:16">Leviticus 26:16</span>: <i>Ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+6:15">Micah 6:15</span>: <i>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the</i> <i>olives, but not anoint thee with the oil</i>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+7:9">Hosea 7:9</span>. The Greeks had the same proverb: Αλλοι μεν σπερουσι, αλλοι δ'αν αμησονται. So had the Latins: <i>Aliis leporem excitasti</i>. <i>You have</i> <i>beat the bush, and another has found the hare</i>. See the famous verses of Virgil beginning with, <i>Sic vos non vobis</i>, in which the <i>fowls</i>, the <i>sheep</i>, the <i>bees</i>, and the <i>oxen</i>, are elegantly brought in as illustrations of the propriety of the proverb. </p>

<p>Bishop Pearce gives this text a remarkable turn. The verse he translates thus: <i>I sent you away, that ye might reap that whereon</i> <i>ye bestowed no labour</i>; i.e. I did not send you to the city (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:8">John 4:8</span>) for this purpose only, that ye might buy meat; but I sent you away chiefly with this intent, that there might be a harvest for you to reap upon your return; though you sowed no seed, and bestowed no labour for that purpose. While you were gone, I sowed spiritual seed in the heart of a Samaritan woman; and she is gone, and is about to return with many of her city, whom she has brought to believe, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:39-42">John 4:39-42</span>.) These, and the many more which will believe upon hearing my doctrine, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:41">John 4:41</span>,) will all be a <i>harvest</i> arising out of the seed which I sowed in your absence, and on which, therefore, ye <i>bestowed no labour</i>. He farther adds, that the Greek θεριζειν, stands for του θεριζειν, and such expressions are often used to signify, not the <i>end</i> and <i>design</i>, but the <i>event</i> only. <i>Pearce's</i> Comment.</p>
