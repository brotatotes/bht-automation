<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Many of the Samaritans - believed on him for the saying</b></i><b> </b><i><b>of the woman</b></i> â€” This woman was the first apostle of Christ in Samaria! She went and told her fellow citizens that the Messiah was come; and gave for proof, that he had told her the most secret things she had ever done: see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:29">John 4:29</span>. This word, which is twice repeated, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:29">John 4:29</span> and here, strongly intimates that a more particular conversation had taken place, between our Lord and the Samaritan woman, than what is here related.</p>
