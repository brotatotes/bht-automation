<p>Verse 42. <i><b>We have heard</b></i> him <i>ourselves</i>] On seeing and hearing our Lord, the faith of those who had already believed on the woman's testimony was abundantly confirmed; and, besides those, may others believed who had not heard the woman speak.</p>
<p><i><b>This is indeed the Christ</b></i> — The promised Messiah.</p>
<p><i><b>The Saviour of the world.</b></i> — Not of the <i>Jews</i> only, but of the <i>Samaritans</i>, and of the whole <i>Gentile</i> world.</p>
