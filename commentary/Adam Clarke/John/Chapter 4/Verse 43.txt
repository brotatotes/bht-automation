<p>Verse 43. <i><b>Went into Galilee.</b></i> â€” Bishop Pearce thinks that some words have been lost from the end of this verse, which may be supplied thus: Went into Galilee, but not to Nazareth; for Jesus himself had declared, c. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:57">Matthew 13:57</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:4">Mark 6:4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:24">Luke 4:24</span>, which are the only texts where Jesus is said to have declared this, he always spake of Nazareth only, and not of Galilee in general, a country where he lived for the most part, and wrought the greatest number of his miracles, and made the most converts.</p>
