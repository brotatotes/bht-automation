<p>Verse 46. <i><b>Where he made the water wine.</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:1">John 2:1</span>, c. Cana was on the road from Nazareth to Capernaum and the Sea of Tiberias.</p>
<p><i><b>A certain nobleman</b></i> — An officer of the king's court: for this is the meaning of the original word, βασιλικος, which the Vulgate translates <i>regulus</i>, a little king. This officer belonged to Herod Antipas, who was then tetrarch of Galilee. Jerome calls him <i>Palatinus</i>, and says he was an officer of the king's palace. Others think it was <i>Chuza</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span> and others think it was <i>Manaen</i>, spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>. One of these opinions may be true, but all solid proof is wanting. This officer, whoever he was, appears to have had his ordinary abode at Capernaum, and hearing that Christ was at Cana, he came express from Capernaum thither, to entreat him to heal his child.</p>
