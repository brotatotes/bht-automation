<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Except ye see signs and wonders</b></i>, c.] Our Lord does not tell this man that he had no faith, but that he had not <i>enough</i>. If he had had <i>none</i>, he would not have come from Capernaum to Cana, to beg him to heal his son. If he had had <i>enough</i>, he would have been contented with recommending his son to our Lord, without entreating him to go to Capernaum to heal him which intimates that he did not believe our Lord could do it at a distance. But the words are not addressed to the nobleman alone, but to all the Galilean Jews in general; for our Lord uses the <i>plural</i> number, which he never does when addressing an <i>individual</i>. These people differed widely from the people of Sychar: they had neither a love of the truth, nor simplicity of heart; and would not believe any thing from heaven, unless forced on their minds by the most striking miracles. They were favoured with the ministry of John Baptist; but, as that was not accompanied with miracles, it was not generally credited. They require the miracles of Christ, in order that they may credit the advent of the Messiah. There are many like these Galileans still in the world: they deny that God can have any influence among men; and as to the <i>operations of the Holy Spirit</i>, they, in the genuine Galilean spirit, boldly assert that they will not credit any man who professes to be made a partaker of them, unless he work a miracle in proof of his pretensions! These persons should know that the grace of working miracles was very different from that by which a man is saved; and that the former might exist, even in the most astonishing measure, where the latter did not.
