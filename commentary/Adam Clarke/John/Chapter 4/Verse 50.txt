<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:50">John 4:50</span>. <i><b>Go thy way; thy son liveth.</b></i> — Had our Lord gone with him, as he wished, his unbelief could not have been fully removed; as he would have still thought that our Lord's power could not reach from Cana to Capernaum: in order to destroy his unbelief at once, and bring him into the fulness of the faith of his supreme power, he cures him, being apparently absent, by that energy through which he fills both the heavens and the earth. Here it may be observed, our blessed Lord did what this man requested him to do, but not in the way in which he wished it to be done. God will save all to the uttermost who call upon him, but not <i>in the way</i> in which they may desire. Eternal life is the free gift of God, and he has a right to give it <i>as</i> he pleases; and he always gives his gifts in that way in which his glory is best promoted, and our eternal interest secured.</p>
<p><i><b>The man believed the word</b></i> — And yet it appears that he had suspended his faith upon a certain condition: "If I find on my return that my son is healed, I will believe that Jesus is the Messiah."</p>
