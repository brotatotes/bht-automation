<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:52">John 4:52</span>. <i><b>Then inquired he of them the hour</b></i> — The servants, overjoyed to find their master's son so suddenly restored, set off to meet him, that they might impart to him tidings which they knew would be so very agreeable; and he, intent on having his faith settled, began immediately to inquire what time it was when the fever left him, to see whether his cure was the effect of some natural cause, or whether it was done by the power of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Yesterday at the seventh hour</b></i> — At the time we would call <i>one</i> <i>o'clock</i>. Dr. Macknight thinks the Roman hour is intended; i.e. seven o'clock in the evening; and this he thinks is the reason why our Lord did not accompany the nobleman: for, as Cana was a day's journey from Capernaum, had our Lord gone at that hour he must have travelled in the <i>night</i>, from which it might have been inferred that he could not cure the child without being personally present. <i>Harmony</i>, vol. i. p. 52.</p>
