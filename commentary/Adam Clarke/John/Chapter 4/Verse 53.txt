<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:53">John 4:53</span>. <i><b>So the father knew</b></i> — He had the fullest proof that his son's cure was supernatural, and that it was wrought by the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>Himself believed, and his whole house.</b></i> — He and his whole family became true converts to the doctrine of the manifested Messiah. The whole family, impressed with the great kindness of God in sending health to the child, were the more easily led to believe in the Lord Jesus. The sickness of the child became the mean of salvation to all the household. They, no doubt, thought at first that God was dealing hardly with them, when threatening to remove the child; but now they see that in very faithfulness God had afflicted them. Let us learn never to murmur against God, or think that he does not act kindly towards us. His wisdom cannot permit him to err; his goodness will not suffer him to do any thing to his creatures but what may be subservient to their best interests. By providential occurrences, apparently the most adverse, he may be securing our eternal salvation.</p>
<p>There is an account in <i>Beracoth</i>, fol. 34, very similar to this of the evangelist, and very possibly stolen from this holy source. "When the son of Rab. Gamaliel fell sick, he sent two of his disciples to R. Chanina, that he would pray to God for him. When he had seen them, he went on the roof of his house and prayed for him. He then came down and said to them, His fever has departed from him. They said unto him, Art thou a prophet? He answered, I am neither a prophet, nor the son of a prophet; but when I can recite my prayers readily, I know I shall be heard. They then wrote down the hour; and, when they returned to R. Gamaliel, he said to them, Ye have fulfilled your ministry-in respect to my son, all is complete. In that hour the fever (חמה <i>chomah</i>, ο πυρετος) left him, and he desired water to drink." <i>Schoettgen</i> very properly remarks, <i>Ovum ovo non magis simile est, atque haec fabula</i> <i>narrationi evangelicae</i>. "One egg is not more like to another, than this fable to the evangelical narration."</p>
