<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:6">John 4:6</span>. <i><b>Jacob's well was there.</b></i> — Of this well Mr. Maundrell gives the following account. "About one-third of an hour from Naplosa, the ancient Sychar and Sychem, stood Jacob's well. If it be inquired, whether this be the very place, seeing it may be suspected to stand too remote from Sychar for the women to come and draw water, we may answer-that, in all probability, the city extended farther in former times than it does now, as may be conjectured from some pieces of a very thick wall, the remains perhaps of the ancient <i>Sychem</i>, still to be seen not far from hence. Over it stood formerly a large church, erected by the Empress <i>Irene</i>; but of this the voracity of time, assisted by the hands of the <i>Turks</i>, has left nothing but a few foundations remaining. The well is covered at present with an old stone vault, into which you are let down by a very strait hole; and then, removing a broad flat stone, you discover the well itself. It is dug in a firm rock, is about three yards in diameter, and thirty-five in depth, five of which we found full of water. This confutes a story frequently told to travellers, 'That it is dry all the year round, except on the anniversary of that day on which our blessed Saviour sat upon it; but then bubbles up with abundance of water.' At this well the narrow valley of Sychem ends, opening itself into a wide field, which probably is part of the ground given by Jacob to his son Joseph. It is watered by a fresh stream, running between it and Sychem, which makes it exceedingly verdant and fruitful." See Maundrell's Travels, 5th edit. p. 62.</p>
<p><i>Cutting pools</i>, or making <i>wells</i> for <i>public use</i>, renders a man <i>famous</i> among the <i>Hindoos</i>. So this well had the name of <i>Jacob</i>, because he had digged it, and it was for public use.</p>
<p><i><b>Sat thus</b></i> — Chrysostom inquires what the particle <i>thus</i>, ουτως, means here? and answers, that it simply signifies, he sat not upon a throne, seat, or cushion; but (as the circumstances of the case required) upon the ground. This is a sense which is given to the word in the ancient Greek writers. See <i>Raphelius, Wetstein</i>, and <i>Pearce</i>. It is probably a mere expletive, and is often so used by Josephus. See several examples in <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The sixth hour.</b></i> — About twelve o'clock: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:31">John 1:31</span>. The <i>time</i> is noted here:</p>
<p>1. To account for Christ's <i>fatigue</i>-he had already travelled several hours.</p>
<p>2. To account for his <i>thirst</i>-the sun had at this time waxed <i>hot</i>.</p>
<p>3. To account for the disciples going to <i>buy food</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:8">John 4:8</span>, because this was the ordinary time of <i>dinner</i> among the Jews. See the note referred to above. Dr. Macknight thinks the <i>sixth hour</i> to be the Roman six o'clock in the afternoon. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>.</p>
