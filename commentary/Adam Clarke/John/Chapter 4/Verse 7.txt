<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:7">John 4:7</span>. <i><b>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water</b></i> â€” That this was the employment of the females, we see in different parts of the Sacred Writings. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:11">Genesis 24:11</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:16">Exodus 2:16</span>, and the note at the end of that chapter. The Jews say that those who wished to get wives went to the wells where young women were accustomed to come and draw water; and it is supposed that women of ill fame frequented such places also. See several proofs in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
