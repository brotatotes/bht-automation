<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:9">John 4:9</span>. <i><b>That thou, being a Jew</b></i> — Probably the inhabitants of Judea distinguished themselves from those of Samaria by some peculiar mode of dress; and by this the Samaritan woman might have known Christ: but it is likely that our Lord spoke the Galilean dialect, by which we find, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:70">Mark 14:70</span>, a Jew of that district might easily be known.</p>
<p><i><b>The Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</b></i> — Perhaps better, <i>Jews have no communion with Samaritans</i>. These words appear to be added by the evangelist himself, in explanation of the woman's question. The original word, συγχρωνται, has been variously translated and understood. It comes from συν, <i>together</i>, and χραομαι, <i>I use</i>, or <i>borrow</i>: hence it has been understood to mean, the Jews will be <i>under no</i> kind of <i>obligation</i> to the Samaritans-will <i>borrow</i> nothing from them-will not <i>drink</i> out of the same <i>cup</i> or <i>well</i> with them-will not <i>sit down</i> to <i>meals</i> with them, nor eat out of the <i>same vessel</i>-will have no <i>religious</i> <i>connection</i>, no <i>commercial dealings</i> with them. The word <i>communion</i>, I think, fully expresses the sense of the original; and, being as extensive in its meaning as our word <i>dealings</i>, is capable of as general an interpretation. The deadly hatred that subsisted between these two nations is known to all. The Jews cursed them, and believed them to be accursed. Their most merciful wish to the Samaritans was, that they might have no part in the resurrection; or, in other words, that they might be <i>annihilated</i>.</p>
