<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>. <i><b>A feast</b></i> — This is generally supposed, by the best critics, to have been the feast of the <i>passover</i>, which was the most eminent feast among the Jews. In several excellent MSS. the article is added, η εορτη, THE <i>feast</i>, the grand, the principal festival. <i>Petavius</i> supposes that the feast of <i>Purim</i>, or <i>lots</i>, is here meant; and one MS. reads η σκηνοπηγια, the feast of <i>Tabernacles</i>. Several of the primitive fathers believe <i>Pentecost</i> to be intended; and they are followed by many of the moderns, because, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:2">John 7:2</span>, mention is made of the feast of <i>Tabernacles</i>, which followed <i>Pentecost</i>, and was about the latter end of our <i>September</i>; and, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:22">John 10:22</span>, mention is made of the feast of <i>Dedication</i>, which was held about the latter end of November. See Bp. <i>Pearce</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:22">John 10:22</span>.</p>
<p><i>Calmet</i>, however, argues that there is no other feast with which all the circumstances marked here so well agree as with the passover; and Bp. Newcome, who is of Calmet's opinion, thinks Bp. Pearce's argument concerning the <i>succession</i> of the feasts to be inconclusive; because it is <i>assumed</i>, not <i>proved</i>, that the three feasts which he mentions above must have happened in the same year. See much on the same subject in Bp. Newcome's notes to his Harmony, p. 15, c.</p>
<p>Lightfoot has observed, that the other evangelists speak very sparingly of our Lord's acts in Judea. They mention nothing of the passovers, from our Lord's baptism till his death, excepting the very last: but John points at them all. The <i>first</i> he speaks of, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span> the <i>third</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>; the <i>fourth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>; and the <i>second</i> in this place: for although he does not call it the <i>passover</i>, but a <i>feast</i> in general, yet the circumstances agree best with this feast; and our Lord's words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>, seem to cast light on this subject. See the note there.</p>
