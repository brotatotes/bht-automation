<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:13">John 5:13</span>. <i><b>Jesus had conveyed himself away</b></i> â€” Or, <i>had withdrawn</i> <i>himself</i>. And this he might easily do, as there was a <i>crowd in the</i> <i>place</i>. Some think the words indicate, that Jesus withdrew on seeing a multitude in the place, i.e. <i>raising a tumult</i>, because of the man's carrying his bed. See the <i>margin</i>. He had not yet finished his work, and would not expose himself to the envy and malice of the Jewish rulers.</p>
