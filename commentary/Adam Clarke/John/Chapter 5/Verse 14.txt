Verse John 5:14. Jesus findeth him in the temple — The man being conscious that it was through the mercy of God that he was restored, (though he did not as yet know distinctly who Christ was,) went to the temple to return thanks to God for his cure. Whether this was on the same day, or some other, does not distinctly appear: it was probably the same day, after he had carried home his couch. How many, when they are made well, forget the hand that has healed them, and, instead of gratitude and obedience to God, use their renewed health and strength in the service of sin! Those who make this use of God's mercies may consider their restoration as a respite only from perdition.Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. — Our Lord, intending to discover to this man who he was, gave him two proofs of the perfection of his knowledge.1. He showed him that he knew the secret of the past-sin no more: thereby intimating that his former sins were the cause of his long affliction.2. He showed him that he knew the future-lest a worse thing come unto thee: if thy iniquity be repeated, thy punishment will be increased.
