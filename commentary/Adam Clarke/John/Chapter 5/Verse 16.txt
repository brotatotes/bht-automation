<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>. <i><b>And sought to slay him</b></i> â€” This clause is omitted by BCDL, some others, and several ancient <i>versions</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text; and Professor <i>White</i> says, <i>certissime</i> <i>delenda</i>: but it does not appear to me that it should be omitted. However, it was true of the Jews, whether the words were originally in the evangelist or not. For what cause did these persons seek to destroy our Lord? Because he had healed a poor man, who had been diseased thirty-eight years, and ordered him to carry home the couch on which he lay! How implacable must their malice have been! The spirit of religious persecution has always been the most <i>fell</i> and dangerous of all on this side perdition. Every other disposition appears to have its <i>moderator</i>; but this is wholly abandoned to the guidance of Satan, and has for its objects the men who know the truth, and who live to the glory of their God, and for the benefit of mankind. How strange that such should ever be objects of malice and hatred! But the Satanic nature in fallen man is ever opposed to whatever comes from God.</p>
