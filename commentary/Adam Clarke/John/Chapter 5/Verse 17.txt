<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span>. <i><b>My Father worked hitherto, and I work.</b></i> — Or, As <i>my</i> <i>Father worketh until now</i>, c., καθως being understood. God created the world in <i>six days</i>: on the <i>seventh</i> he rested from all <i>creating</i> acts, and set it apart to be an everlasting memorial of his work. But, though he rested from creating, he never ceased from <i>preserving</i> and <i>governing</i> that which he had formed: in this respect he can keep no <i>sabbaths</i> for nothing can continue to exist, or answer the end proposed by the Divine wisdom and goodness, without the continual <i>energy</i> of God. So <i>I work </i>- I am constantly employed in the same way, governing and supporting all things, comforting the wretched, and saving the lost; and to me, in this respect, there is no <i>sabbath</i>.</p>
