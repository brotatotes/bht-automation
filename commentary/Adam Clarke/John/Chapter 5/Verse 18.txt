<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>. <i><b>Making himself equal with God.</b></i> — This the Jews understood from the preceding verse: nor did they take a wrong meaning out of our Lord's words; for he plainly stated that, whatever was the Father's work, his was the same; thus showing that He and the Father were ONE. They had now found out two pretenses to take away his life: one was that he had broken the Sabbath - ελυε, <i>dissolved</i>, as they pretended, the obligation of keeping it holy. The other was that he was guilty of blasphemy, in making himself <i>equal to God</i>: for both which crimes, a man, according to the law, must suffer death.
