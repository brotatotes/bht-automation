<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>. <i><b>The Son can do nothing of himself</b></i> — Because of his inseparable union with the Father: nor can the Father do any thing of <i>himself</i>, because of his infinite unity with the Son.</p>
<p><i><b>What things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son</b></i> — God does nothing but what Christ does. What God does is the work of God, and proper to no creature-Jesus does whatsoever God does, and therefore is no created being. The Son can do nothing but what he sees the Father do: now, any intelligent creature may do what God cannot do: he may <i>err </i>- he may <i>sin</i>. If Jesus can do <i>nothing</i> but what God does, then he is no creature - he can neither <i>sin</i> nor <i>err</i>, nor act <i>imperfectly</i>. The conclusion from our Lord's argument is: If I have broken the Sabbath, so has God also; for I can do nothing but what I see him doing. He is ever <i>governing</i> and <i>preserving</i>; I am ever employed in <i>saving</i>.</p>
