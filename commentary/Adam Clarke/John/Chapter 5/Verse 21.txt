<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>. <i><b>As the Father raised up the dead</b></i> — This he did in the case of the widow's son at Sarepta, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:22">1 Kings 17:22</span>, by the ministry of the Prophet Elijah. And again, in the case of the Shunamite's son, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:32-35">2 Kings 4:32-35</span>, by the ministry of the Prophet Elisha.</p>
<p><i><b>The Son quickeneth whom he will.</b></i> — He raiseth from death to life whomsoever he pleases. So he did, for he raised the ruler's daughter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:35-42">Mark 5:35-42</span>; the widow's son at Nain, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:11-15">Luke 7:11-15</span>; and Lazarus, at Bethany, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:14-44">John 11:14-44</span>.</p>
<p><i>Whom he will</i>. Here our Lord points out his sovereign power and independence; he gives life according to <i>his own will </i>- not being obliged to supplicate for the power by which it was done, as the <i>prophets</i> did; his own will being absolute and sufficient in every case.</p>
