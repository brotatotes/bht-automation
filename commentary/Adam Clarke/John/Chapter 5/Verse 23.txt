<p>Verse 23. <i><b>That all</b></i><b> men </b><i><b>should honour the Son</b></i><b>, c.</b>] If then the Son is to be honoured, EVEN AS the Father is honoured, then the Son must be God, as receiving that worship which belongs to God alone. To worship any creature is idolatry: Christ is to be honoured even as the Father is honoured therefore Christ is not a creature; and, if not a <i>creature</i>, consequently the <i>Creator</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>He that honoureth not the Son</b></i> â€” God will not receive that man's adoration who refuses to honour Jesus, <i>even as</i> he honours him. The Jews expected the Messiah as a great and powerful Prince; but they never thought of a person coming in that character enrobed with all the attributes of Godhead. To lead them off from this error, our Lord spoke the words recorded in these verses.</p>
