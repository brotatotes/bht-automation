<p>Verse 24. <i><b>He that heareth my word</b></i> — My doctrine-<i>and believeth on</i> <i>him that sent me</i>-he who credits my Divine mission, that I am come to give <i>light</i> and <i>life</i> to the world by my <i>doctrine</i> and <i>death-hath eternal life</i>-the seed of this life is sown in his heart the moment he believes - <i>and shall not come into condemnation</i>, εις κρισιν, <i>into judgment</i>-that which will speedily come on this unbelieving race; and that which shall overwhelm the wicked in the great day.</p>
<p><i><b>But is passed from death unto life.</b></i> — μεταβεβηκεν, Has <i>changed</i> <i>his country</i>, or <i>place of abode</i>. Death is the country where every Christless soul lives. The man who knows not God lives a dying life, or a living death; but he who believes in the Son of God <i>passes over</i> from the empire of death, to the empire of life. Reader! thou wast born in death: hast thou yet changed the place of thy natural residence? Remember that to live in sin is to live in death; and those who live and die thus shall die eternally.</p>
