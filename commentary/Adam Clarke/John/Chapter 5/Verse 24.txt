Verse 24. He that heareth my word — My doctrine-and believeth on him that sent me-he who credits my Divine mission, that I am come to give light and life to the world by my doctrine and death-hath eternal life-the seed of this life is sown in his heart the moment he believes - and shall not come into condemnation, εις κρισιν, into judgment-that which will speedily come on this unbelieving race; and that which shall overwhelm the wicked in the great day.But is passed from death unto life. — μεταβεβηκεν, Has changed his country, or place of abode. Death is the country where every Christless soul lives. The man who knows not God lives a dying life, or a living death; but he who believes in the Son of God passes over from the empire of death, to the empire of life. Reader! thou wast born in death: hast thou yet changed the place of thy natural residence? Remember that to live in sin is to live in death; and those who live and die thus shall die eternally.
