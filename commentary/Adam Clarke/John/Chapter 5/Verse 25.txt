<p>Verse 25. <i><b>The dead shall hear the voice</b></i> â€” Three kinds of death are mentioned in the Scriptures: <i>natural, spiritual</i>, and <i>eternal</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> consists in the separation of the body and soul. The <i>second</i> in the separation of God and the soul. The <i>third</i> in the separation of body and soul from God in the other world. Answerable to these three kinds of death, there is a <i>threefold</i> <i>life: Natural</i> life, which consists in the union of the soul and body. <i>Spiritual life</i>, which consists in the union of God and the soul, by faith and love. <i>Eternal</i> life, which consist in the communion of the body and soul with God, by holiness, in the realms of bliss.</p>
<p>Of the <i>dead</i>, our Lord says, <i>the hour is coming, and now is, when</i> <i>they shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and live</i>. The hour is <i>coming</i>, when all that sleep in the dust shall awake at the voice of the Son of man, and come to judgment: for he giveth life to the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28-29">John 5:28-29</span>. Again, the hour is <i>coming</i>, when some of those who have died a <i>natural</i> death shall hear the voice of the Son of God and live again here. It is likely that our Lord had not as yet raised any from the dead; and he refers to those whom he intended to raise: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>. Lastly, the hour <i>now is</i>, when many who are dead in trespasses and sins, shall hear the voice (the word) of the Son of God, believe, and receive spiritual <i>life</i> through him.</p>
