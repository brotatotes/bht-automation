<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Marvel not at this</b></i> â€” I think it quite necessary to follow here, as noted above, the punctuation of <i>both</i> the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Armenian, Chrysostom, Damascenus, Theophylact, Euthymius</i>, and others; which is found also in some very good MSS. <i>Theophylact</i> says that the common method of reading this, which he highly objects to, was the invention of <i>Paul</i> of <i>Samosata</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26-27">John 5:26-27</span>, our Lord, speaking of himself as envoy of God, said, the Father had <i>given him to have life in himself</i>, so that, like any of the ancient prophets, he could vivify others; and that he had given him <i>authority to execute judgment</i>, probably referring to that judgment which he was shortly to execute on this unbelieving nation, and apparently in direct reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>, <i>Behold one like the Son of man came with the clouds</i>, c., a place which the Jews expound of the promised Messiah. In this verse he anticipates an objection, as if they had said: "This cannot be: thou art a man-thou wast born among us." Our Lord answers: <i>Don't</i> <i>marvel at this, BECAUSE I am a man</i>-for greater things than these shall be done by me: he who now addresses you, though disguised under the <i>form of a man</i>, shall appear in the great day to be the Judge of quick and dead: by his almighty power, he shall raise all the dead and, by his unerring wisdom and justice, shall adjudge the wicked to hell, and the righteous to heaven. The first sense, however, of this passage, appears to some the most probable; though they both amount nearly to the same meaning.</p>
