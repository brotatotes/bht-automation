<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:3">John 5:3</span>. <i><b>Blind, halt, withered</b></i> — To these the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, three copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and both the <i>Persic</i>, add παραλυτικων, <i>paralytic</i>; but they are probably included among the withered.</p>
<p><i><b>Waiting for the moving of the water.</b></i> — This clause, with the whole of the fourth verse, is wanting in some MSS. and versions; but I think there is no <i>sufficient</i> evidence against their authenticity. Griesbach seems to be of the same opinion; for though he has marked the whole passage with the notes of doubtfulness, yet he has left it in the text. Some have imagined that the sanative virtue was communicated to the waters by washing in them the entrails of the beasts which were offered in sacrifice; and that the angel meant no more than merely a man sent to stir up from the bottom this corrupt sediment, which, being distributed through the water, the pores of the person who bathed in it were penetrated by this matter, and his disorder repelled! But this is a miserable shift to get rid of the power and goodness of God, built on the merest conjectures, self-contradictory, and every way as unlikely as it is insupportable. It has never yet been satisfactorily proved that the sacrifices were ever washed; and, could even this be proved, who can show that they were washed in the pool of <i>Bethesda</i>? These waters healed a man in a <i>moment</i> of <i>whatsoever disease</i> he had. Now, there is no <i>one</i> cause under heaven that can do this. Had only <i>one kind</i> of disorders been cured here, there might have been some countenance for this deistical conjecture-but this is not the case; and we are obliged to believe the relation just as it stands, and thus acknowledge the sovereign power and mercy of God, or take the desperate flight of an infidel, and thus get rid of the passage altogether.</p>
