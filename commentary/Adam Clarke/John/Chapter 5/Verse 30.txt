<p>Verse 30. <i><b>I can of mine own self do nothing</b></i> — Because of my intimate union with God. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>I seek not mine own will</b></i> — I do not, I cannot attempt to do any thing <i>without</i> God. This, that is, the Son of man, the human nature which is the temple of my Divinity, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>, is perfectly subject to the Deity that dwells in it. In this respect our blessed Lord is the perfect pattern of all his followers. In every thing their wills should submit to the will of their heavenly Father. Nothing is more common than to hear people say, <i>I will do</i> <i>it because I choose</i>. He who has no better reason to give for his conduct than his <i>own will</i> shall in the end have the same reason to give for his eternal destruction. "I followed <i>my own will</i>, in opposition to the <i>will of God</i>, and now I am plunged in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone."</p>
<p>Reader, God hath sent <i>thee</i> also to do his will: his will is that thou shouldst abandon thy sins, and believe in the Lord Jesus. Hast thou yet <i>done</i> it?</p>
