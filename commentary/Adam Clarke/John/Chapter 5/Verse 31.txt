<p>Verse 31. <i><b>If I bear witness</b></i> â€” If I had no proof to bring of my being the Messiah, and equal to God, common sense would direct you to reject my testimony; but the mighty power of God, by which I work my miracles, sufficiently attests that my pretensions are well founded.</p>
<p>Bishop Pearce gives a different turn to this verse, by translating it interrogatively, thus: "<i>If I</i> only <i>bear witness of</i> <i>myself, is not my witness true</i>? i.e. is it, on that account, not true? In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span>, he says, <i>Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true</i>. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:18">John 8:18</span>, he says, <i>I am one that bear witness of myself</i>."</p>
