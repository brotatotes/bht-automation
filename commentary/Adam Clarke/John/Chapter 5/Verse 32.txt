<p>Verse 32. <i><b>There is another</b></i> — God the Father, who, by his Spirit in your prophets, described my person, office, and miracles. You read these scriptures, and you cannot help seeing that they testify of me:- no person ever did answer the description there given, but myself; and I answer to that description in the fullest sense of the word. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And I know</b></i> — Instead of οιδα, <i>I know</i>, οιδατε, <i>ye know</i>, is the reading of the <i>Codex Bezae, Armenian</i>, and two of the <i>Itala</i>. Ye believe the Scriptures to be of God, and that he cannot lie; and yet ye will not believe in me, though these Scriptures have so clearly foretold and described me! It is not one of the least evils attending unbelief, that it acts not only in <i>opposition</i> to God, but it also acts <i>inconsistently</i> with itself. It receives the Scriptures in <i>bulk</i>, and acknowledges them to have come through Divine inspiration; and yet believes no <i>part separately</i>. With it the <i>whole</i> is true, but no <i>part</i> is true! The very <i>unreasonableness</i> of this conduct shows the principle to have come from beneath, were there no other evidences against it.</p>
