<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Ye sent unto John</b></i> â€” I am not without human testimony of the most respectable kind:-Ye sent to John, and he bare witness. There are several circumstances in John's character which render his testimony unexceptionable.</p>
<p>1. He is consulted by the very enemies of Christ, as a very holy and extraordinary man.</p>
<p>2. He is perfectly free from all self-interest, having declined making the least advantage by his own reputation.</p>
<p>3. He is sincere, undaunted, and so averse from all kinds of flattery that he reproves Herod at the hazard of his liberty and life.</p>
<p>4. He was so far from being solicited by Christ to give his testimony that he had not even seen him when he gave it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19-28">John 1:19-28</span>.</p>
