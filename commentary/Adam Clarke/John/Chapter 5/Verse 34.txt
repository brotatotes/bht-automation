<p>Verse 34. <i><b>But I receive not testimony from man</b></i> [only.] I have no need of John's testimony: the works that I do bear sufficient testimony to me, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>But these things I say</b></i>, c.] You believed John to be a prophet - a prophet cannot lie: he bore testimony that I am the Lamb of God, that beareth away the sin of the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span> therefore, that ye may be saved by believing in me as such, I have appealed to John's testimony.</p>
