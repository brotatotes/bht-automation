<p>Verse 35. <i><b>He was a burning and a shining light</b></i> — Ην ὁ λυχνος ὁ καιομενος και φαινων, should be translated, <i>He was a burning and a</i> <i>shining LAMP</i>. He was not το φως του κοσμου, <i>the light of the</i> <i>world</i>, i.e. the <i>sun</i>; but he was ο λυχνος, <i>a lamp</i>, to give a clear and steady light till the sun should arise. It is supposed that John had been cast into prison about four months before this time. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>. As his light continued no longer to shine, our Lord says <i>he WAS</i>.</p>
<p>The expression of <i>lamp</i> our Lord took from the ordinary custom of the Jews, who termed their eminent doctors <i>the lamps of Israel</i>. A lighted candle is a proper <i>emblem</i> of a minister of God; and, <i>Alteri serviens consumor </i>- "In serving others, I myself destroy:" - a proper <i>motto</i>. There are few who preach the Gospel faithfully that do not lose their lives by it. <i>Burning</i> may refer to the <i>zeal</i> with which John executed his message; and <i>shining</i> may refer to the <i>clearness</i> of the testimony which he bore concerning Christ. Only to <i>shine</i> is but vanity; and to <i>burn</i> without <i>shining</i> will never edify the Church of God. Some <i>shine</i>, and some <i>burn</i>, but few both <i>shine</i> and <i>burn</i>; and many there are who are denominated pastors, who neither <i>shine</i> nor <i>burn</i>. He who wishes to save souls must both <i>burn</i> and <i>shine</i>: the <i>clear light</i> of the <i>knowledge</i> of the <i>sacred records</i> must fill his <i>understanding</i>; and the <i>holy</i> <i>flame</i> of loving <i>zeal</i> must occupy his <i>heart</i>. <i>Zeal</i> without <i>knowledge</i> is continually <i>blundering</i>; and <i>knowledge</i> without <i>zeal</i> makes <i>no converts</i> to Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>For a season</b></i> — The time between his beginning to preach and his being cast into prison.</p>
<p><i><b>To rejoice</b></i> — αγαλλιασθηναι, To <i>jump for joy</i>, as we would express it. They were exceedingly rejoiced to hear that the Messiah was come, because they expected him to deliver them out of the hands of the Romans; but when a <i>spiritual deliverance</i>, of infinitely greater moment was preached to them, they rejected both it and the light which made it manifest.</p>
