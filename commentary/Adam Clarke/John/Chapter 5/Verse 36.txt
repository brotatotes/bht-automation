<p>Verse 36. <i><b>But I have greater witness</b></i> â€” However decisive the judgment of such a man as John may be, who was <i>the lamp of Israel</i>, a miracle of grace, filled with the spirit of Elijah, and more than any prophet, because he pointed out, not the Messiah who <i>was</i> <i>to come</i>, but the Messiah who was already come: nevertheless, I am not obliged to depend on his testimony alone; for I have a greater one, that of Him whom you acknowledge to be your God. And how do I prove that this God bears testimony to me? By my <i>works</i>: these miracles, which attest my mission, and prove by themselves that nothing less than unlimited power and boundless love could ever produce them. By my <i>word only</i>, I have perfectly and <i>instantly</i> healed a man who was diseased thirty and eight years. Ye see the miracle-the man is before you whole and sound. Why then do ye not believe in my mission, that ye may embrace my doctrine, and be saved?</p>
