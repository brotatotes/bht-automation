<p>Verse 37. <i><b>The Father himself - hath borne witness</b></i> — That is, by his prophets.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye have neither heard his voice</b></i> — I make these words, with Bp. Pearce, a parenthesis: the sense is-"Not that my Father ever appeared visibly or spake audibly to any of you; but he did it by the mouths of his prophets." Lately, however, he had added to their testimony his own voice from heaven, on the day of Christ's baptism. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>.</p>
