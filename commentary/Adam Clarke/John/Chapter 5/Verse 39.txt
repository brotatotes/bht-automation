<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Search the Scriptures</b></i> — ερευνατε τας γραφας. This should be translated, not in the <i>imperative</i>, but in the <i>indicative</i> mood-thus, <i>Ye search the Scriptures diligently</i>. That these words are commonly read in the <i>imperative</i> mood is sufficiently known; but this reading can never accord well with the following verse, nor can the force and energy of the words be perceived by this version.</p>
<p>The rabbins strongly recommend the study of the Scriptures. The <i>Talmud, Tract. Shabbath</i>, fol. 30, brings in God thus addressing David: "I am better pleased with one day in which thou sittest and studiest the law, than I shall be with a thousand sacrifices which thy son Solomon shall offer upon my altar."</p>
<p>Perhaps the Scriptures were never more diligently searched than at that very time: first, because they were in expectation of the immediate appearing of the <i>Messiah</i>; secondly, because they wished to find out <i>allegories</i> in them; (see <i>Philo</i>;) and, thirdly, because they found these scriptures to contain the promise of an <i>eternal</i> <i>life</i>. <i>He</i>, said they, <i>who studies daily in the law, is worthy to</i> <i>have a portion in the world to come</i>, Sohar. Genes. fol. 31. Hence we may infer: 1st. That the Jews had the knowledge of a <i>future</i> <i>state</i> before the coming of Christ; and 2ndly. That they got that knowledge from the Old Testament Scriptures.</p>
<p>The word ερευνατε, which might be translated, <i>Ye search</i> <i>diligently</i>, is very expressive. Homer, IL. xviii. l. 321, applies it to a <i>lion</i> deprived of his whelps, who "scours the plains, and <i>traces</i> the <i>footsteps</i> of the man." And in ODYSS. xix. l. 436, to <i>dogs tracing</i> their game by the <i>scent</i> of the <i>foot</i>.</p>
<p>In the Septuagint, the verb ερευναω answers to the Hebrew חפש <i>chapash</i>, to <i>search</i> by <i>uncovering</i>; to חקר <i>chakar</i>, to search <i>minutely</i>, to <i>explore</i>; to חשף <i>chashaph</i>, to <i>strip</i>, make <i>bare</i>; and to משש <i>mashash</i>, to <i>feel, search</i> by <i>feeling</i>. It is compounded of ερεω, <i>I seek</i>, and ευνη, <i>a</i> <i>bed</i>; "and is, "says St. Chrysostom, "a metaphor taken from those who dig deep, and search for metals in the bowels of the earth. They <i>look</i> for the <i>bed</i> where the metal lies, and break every clod, and sift and examine the whole, in order to discover the ore." Those who read the verse in the <i>imperative</i> mood consider it an exhortation to the diligent study of the Sacred Writings. <i>Search</i>; that is, <i>shake</i> and <i>sift</i> them, as the word also signifies: search narrowly, till the true force and meaning of every <i>sentence</i>, yea, of every <i>word</i> and <i>syllable</i>, nay, of every <i>letter</i> and <i>yod</i> therein, be known and understood. Confer <i>place</i> with <i>place</i>; the <i>scope</i> of <i>one place</i> with that of <i>another</i>; things <i>going before</i> with things <i>coming after</i>: compare <i>word</i> with <i>word,</i> <i>letter</i> with <i>letter</i>, and search the whole thoroughly. See <i>Parkhurst,</i> <i>Mintert</i>, and <i>Leigh</i>.</p>
<p>Leaving every translation of the present passage out of the question, this is the proper method of reading and examining the Scriptures, so as to become wise unto salvation through them.</p>
