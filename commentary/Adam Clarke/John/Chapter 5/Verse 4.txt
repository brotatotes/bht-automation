<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:4">John 5:4</span>. <i><b>Angel</b></i> — "Of the Lord," is added by AKL, about 20 others, the <i>AEthiopic, Armenian, Slavonic, Vulgate, Anglo-Saxon</i>, and six copies of the <i>Itala</i>: <i>Cyril</i> and <i>Ambrose</i> have also this reading. If this reading be genuine, and the authorities which support it are both <i>ancient</i> and <i>respectable</i>, it destroys Dr. Hammond's conjecture, that, by the <i>angel</i>, a messenger only, sent from the Sanhedrin, is meant, and that these cures were all performed in a <i>natural</i> way.</p>
<p>Those who feel little or none of the work of God in their <i>own</i> hearts are not willing to allow that he works in <i>others</i>. Many deny the influences of God's Spirit, merely because they never felt them. This is to make any man's experience the rule by which the whole word of God is to be interpreted; and consequently to leave no more divinity in the Bible than is found in the heart of him who professes to explain it.</p>
<p><i><b>Went down</b></i> — κατεβαινεν, <i>descended</i>. The word seems to imply that the angel <i>had ceased</i> to descend when John wrote. In the second verse, he spoke of the pool as being <i>still</i> in existence; and in this verse he intimates that the Divine influence ceased from these waters. When it <i>began</i>, we know not; but it is likely that it continued no longer than till the crucifixion of our Lord. Some think that this never took place before nor after this time. Neither <i>Josephus, Philo</i>, nor any of the Jewish authors mention this pool; so that it is very likely that it had not been long celebrated for its healing virtue, and that nothing of it remained when those authors wrote.</p>
<p><i><b>Certain season</b></i> — This probably refers to the time of the feast, during which only this miraculous virtue lasted. It is not likely that the angel <i>appeared</i> to the people-his descent might be only known by the ebullition caused in the waters. Was not the whole a type of Christ? See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:1">Zechariah 13:1</span>. He is the true <i>Bethesda</i>, or <i>house of mercy, the fountain opened to the house of</i> <i>David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for</i> <i>uncleanness</i>; unto which all the diseased may come, and find health and life eternal.</p>
