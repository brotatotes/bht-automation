<p>Verse 40. <i><b>And ye will not come to me</b></i> â€” Though ye thus search the Scriptures, in hopes of finding the <i>Messiah</i> and <i>eternal life</i> in them, yet <i>ye will not come unto me</i>, believe in me, and be my disciples, though so clearly pointed out by them, that ye may have that eternal life which can only come through me.</p>
