<p>Verse 42. <i><b>But I know you, that ye have not</b></i>, c.] Don't say that you oppose me through zeal for God's honour, and love for his name, because I make myself equal to him: no, this is not the case. I know the dispositions of your souls and I know ye have neither <i>love</i> for his name, nor <i>zeal</i> for his glory. Incorrigible ignorance, and malicious jealousy, actuate your hearts. Ye read the Scriptures, but ye do not enter into their meaning. Had you been as diligent to find out the <i>truth</i>, as you have been to find out <i>allegories, false glosses</i>, and something to countenance you in your crimes, you would have known that the Messiah, who is equal with God, must be the Son of man also, and the inheritor of David's throne; and that the very works which I do are those which the prophets have foretold the Messiah should perform.
