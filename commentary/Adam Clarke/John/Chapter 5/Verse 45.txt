<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:45">John 5:45</span>. <i><b>Do not think that I will accuse you</b></i> â€” You have accused me with a breach of the Sabbath, which accusation I have demonstrated to be false: I could, in return, accuse <i>you</i>, and substantiate the accusation, with the breach of the whole law; but this I need not do, for <i>Moses, in whom ye trust</i>, accuses you. You read his law, acknowledge you should obey it, and yet break it both in the letter and in the spirit. This law, therefore, accuses and condemns you. It was a maxim among the Jews that none could accuse them but Moses: the spirit of which seems to be, that only so pure and enlightened a legislator could find fault with such a noble and excellent people! For, notwithstanding their abominations, they supposed themselves the most excellent of mankind!</p>
