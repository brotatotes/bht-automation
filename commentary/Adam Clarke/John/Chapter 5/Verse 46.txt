<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:46">John 5:46</span>. <i><b>He wrote of me.</b></i> â€” For instance, in reciting the prophecy of Jacob, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>. <i>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from</i> <i>between his feet, until SHILOH come; and unto him shall the</i> <i>gathering of the people be</i>. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:18">Deuteronomy 18:18</span>: <i>I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren like</i> <i>unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth</i>, c. Confer this with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22">Acts 3:22</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:37">Acts 7:37</span>. Besides, Moses pointed out the Messiah in a multitude of <i>symbols</i> and <i>figures</i>, which are found in the history of the patriarchs, the ceremonial laws, and especially in the whole <i>sacrificial</i> system. All these were well-defined, though shadowy representations of the birth, life, sufferings, death, and resurrection of the Saviour of the world. Add to this, Moses has given you certain marks to distinguish the <i>false</i> from the <i>true</i> prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+13:1-3">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:22">Deuteronomy 18:22</span>, which, if you apply to me, you will find that I am not a false but a true prophet of the Most High God.</p>
