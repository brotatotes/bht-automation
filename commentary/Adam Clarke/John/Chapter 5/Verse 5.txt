<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:5">John 5:5</span>. <i><b>Had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</b></i> â€” St. Chrysostom conjectured that <i>blindness</i> was the infirmity of this person: what it was, the inspired writer does not say - probably it was a <i>palsy</i>: his case was deplorable - he was not able to go into the pool himself, and he had no one to help him; so that poverty and disease were here connected. The length of the time he had been afflicted makes the miracle of his cure the greater. There could have been no collusion in this case: as his affliction had lasted thirty-eight years, it must have been known to multitudes; therefore he could not be a person prepared for the occasion. All Christ's miracles have been wrought in such a <i>way</i>, and on such <i>persons</i> and <i>occasions</i>, as absolutely to preclude all possibility of the suspicion of imposture.</p>
