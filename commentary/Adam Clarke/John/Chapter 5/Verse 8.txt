<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:8">John 5:8</span>. <i><b>Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</b></i> â€” Jesus speaks here as God. He speaks in no name but his own, and with an authority which belongs to God alone. And what is the consequence? The man became whole immediately; and this sudden restoration to health and strength was an incontestable proof of the omnipotence of Christ. It has been remarked, that our Lord, after having performed a miracle, was accustomed to connect some circumstance with it, which attested its truth. After the miracle of the five loaves, he ordered the fragments to be collected, which were more in quantity than the loaves themselves, though several thousands had been fed. When he changed the water into wine, he ordered some to be taken first to the steward of the feast, that he might taste and bear testimony to its genuineness and excellency. When he cured the lepers, he commanded them to show themselves to the priests, whose business it was to judge of the cure. So here, he judged it necessary, after having cured this infirm man, to order him not only to <i>arise</i>, but to <i>take up his bed</i>, and <i>walk</i>, which sufficiently attested the miracle which he had wrought. God's work is ever known by its excellence and good effects.</p>
<p>The <i>bed</i> of a poor <i>Hindoo</i> is seldom any thing besides a single <i>mat</i>, or a cloth as thick as a <i>bed-quilt</i>. Men carrying such beds may be seen daily on the highways.</p>
