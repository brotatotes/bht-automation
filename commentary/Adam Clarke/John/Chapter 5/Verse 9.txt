Verse John 5:9. The same day was the sabbath. â€” Mr. Toynard supposes that this miracle was wrought on the 11th of Nisan, the sabbath before the passover, which was celebrated the 14th of Nisan, or 28th of March. But why did our Lord command this man to carry his bed on the sabbath, as the law prohibited all servile work, and especially the carrying of burthens? See Exodus 20:8; Jeremiah 17:21; Nehemiah 13:15. To this it may be answered,1. The man was a poor man, and if he had left his bed he might have lost it; and he could not have conveniently watched it till the next morning.2. Christ showed by this that he was Lord of the sabbath: see Matthew 12:8.3. This was not contrary to the spirit of the law: the sabbath was made to honour God in, and this was a public monument of his power and goodness.4. It was consistent with the wisdom of Christ to do his miracles so that they might be seen and known by a multitude of people, and especially in Jerusalem, which was the capital of the country, and the centre of the Jewish religion; and this very circumstance of the healed man carrying his bed on the sabbath day must call the attention of many to this matter, and cause the miracle to be more generally known.
