<p><i><b>Jesus went over the sea of Galilee</b></i> — Or, as some translate the words, <i>by the side of the sea of Galilee</i>. From Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span>, we learn that this was a desert place in the vicinity of Bethsaida. The sea of <i>Galilee, Genesaret</i>, and <i>Tiberias</i>, are the same in the New Testament with the sea of <i>Cinnereth</i> in the Old. <i>Tiberias</i> was a city in Galilee, situated on the western side of the lake. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+6:22">Job 6:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+6:22">Job 6:22</span></span>.</p>
