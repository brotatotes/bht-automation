Verse John 6:1. After these things — This is a sort of indefinite expression, from which me can gather nothing relative to the time in which these things happened. It refers no doubt to transactions in the preceding year.Jesus went over the sea of Galilee — Or, as some translate the words, by the side of the sea of Galilee. From Luke, Luke 9:10, we learn that this was a desert place in the vicinity of Bethsaida. The sea of Galilee, Genesaret, and Tiberias, are the same in the New Testament with the sea of Cinnereth in the Old. Tiberias was a city in Galilee, situated on the western side of the lake. Job 6:22; Job 6:22.
