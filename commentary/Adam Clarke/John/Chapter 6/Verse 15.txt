<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>. <i><b>Take him by force, to make him a king</b></i> — The Jews had often suffered by famine in those times in which their enemies were permitted to prevail over them; but, finding that Jesus had such power as to multiply a few loaves to feed thousands, they took it for granted that while he was at their head no evil could possibly happen to them, and therefore were determined immediately to proclaim him king, and rid themselves at once of <i>Herod</i> and the <i>Romans</i>. Our Lord perceiving this, either by some words which they had dropped, or by his penetration of their hearts, retired before the project had been fully formed, or could be put into execution. It was not till a considerable time afterwards that even the <i>disciples</i> fully understood that his kingdom was not of this world.</p>
<p><i><b>Into a mountain</b></i> — That on which he was with his disciples previously to his working this miracle: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:3">John 6:3</span>.</p>
<p>St. Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:22-23">Matthew 14:22-23</span>, and Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45-46">Mark 6:45-46</span>, say that, before this, Jesus constrained his disciples to embark in the vessel, and go along the sea coast towards Capernaum, or Bethsaida-see here <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:17">John 6:17</span>, and the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>; and that, after they were gone, he dismissed the multitudes, having, no doubt, given them such advices as the nature of the case required; after which he went into the mountain <i>to pray</i>.</p>
<p>Worldly wisdom would have said, "Declare thyself king: yield to the desires of the people: this will be the readiest way of converting the Jews." No. Jesus must die for the sin of the world. - No man's heart can be turned to God by outward <i>pomp</i> or <i>splendour</i>-no saving change can be brought about by any <i>might</i> or any <i>power</i>, but <i>by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:6">Zechariah 4:6</span>.</p>
