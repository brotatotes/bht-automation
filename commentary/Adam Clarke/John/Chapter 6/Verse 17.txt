<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:17">John 6:17</span>. <i><b>Toward Capernaum.</b></i> â€” St. Mark says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>, that our Lord commanded them to go along to Bethsaida; and in the course of the history we find they got neither to Bethsaida nor Capernaum, but landed in the country of <i>Genesaret</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:34">Matthew 14:34</span>. Our Lord seems to have desired them to go <i>either</i> to Bethsaida or Capernaum, which were only a very few miles distant, and on the same side of the sea. The reason why they could reach neither was the storm which the evangelists say rose at the time, and the wind being contrary: the storm being probably excited by the prince of the power of the air. Capernaum lay at the northern part of this sea, and they went along the Galilean or western coast, probably expecting Christ to come to them, on which account they might keep in close by the land. But there are great difficulties in fixing the places mentioned by the evangelists. By some writers Bethsaida and Capernaum are placed on opposite sides of this lake: by others on the same side. Sometimes when our translation speaks of <i>passing</i> <i>over</i> the sea, &amp;c., a <i>coasting voyage</i> only is meant, as we find the disciples landing on the same side from which they had departed: <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:22">John 6:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:22">John 6:22</span></span>.</p>
