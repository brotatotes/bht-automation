Verse 22. The people which stood on the other side — ἙϚηκως περαν της θαλασσης, Standing by the sea side. The people were not on the other side, i.e. in Perea, as our version states, but on that side where Bethsaida lay: see the notes on Matthew 14:25; Matthew 14:34, and on Mark 6:45. The Greek word, περαν, says Bishop Pearce, seems to signify in Scripture sometimes on the side of, and sometimes on this side of: see Joshua 5:1. and 1 Macc. 9:34. The Hebrew word אבר abar, signifies by the side: Exodus 28:26, and is translated on this side in Deuteronomy 4:29. It has the same meaning in the Septuagint, Deuteronomy 1:5; Deuteronomy 3:8; Deuteronomy 4:46. περαν, says Vorstius, is the same with παρα, near to. This is evidently the meaning of the word in Matthew 4:15; as it appears, from what is said of the land of Zabulon and Nepthali, that by περαν is not meant beyond, but by the side of; because those two tribes inhabited the western side of Jordan, which was the side lying nearest to Judea and Galilee: Matthew 19:1; Matthew 19:1.
