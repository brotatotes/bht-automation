<p>Verse 22. <i><b>The people which stood on the other side</b></i> — ἙϚηκως περαν της θαλασσης, <i>Standing by the sea side</i>. The people were not on the <i>other</i> side, i.e. in <i>Perea</i>, as our version states, but on that side where Bethsaida lay: see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:25">Matthew 14:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:34">Matthew 14:34</span>, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>. The Greek word, περαν, says Bishop <i>Pearce</i>, seems to signify in Scripture sometimes <i>on the side of</i>, and sometimes <i>on this side of</i>: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+5:1">Joshua 5:1</span>. and 1 Macc. 9:34. The Hebrew word אבר <i>abar</i>, signifies <i>by the side</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:26">Exodus 28:26</span>, and is translated <i>on this side</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+4:29">Deuteronomy 4:29</span>. It has the same meaning in the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:5">Deuteronomy 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+3:8">Deuteronomy 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+4:46">Deuteronomy 4:46</span>. περαν, says <i>Vorstius</i>, is the same with παρα, <i>near to</i>. This is evidently the meaning of the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:15">Matthew 4:15</span>; as it appears, from what is said of the <i>land of Zabulon and Nepthali</i>, that by περαν is not meant <i>beyond</i>, but <i>by the side of</i>; because those two tribes inhabited the western side of Jordan, which was the side lying nearest to Judea and Galilee: <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span></span>.</p>
