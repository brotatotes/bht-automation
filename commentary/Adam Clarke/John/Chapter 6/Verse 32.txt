Verse 32. Moses gave you not that bread from heaven â€” Our Lord refutes the argument of the Jews, by proving:1. That it was not Moses, but God, who gave the manna.2. That this bread was not the true bread, but was merely a type of it.3. That God had given them now a bread infinitely more excellent.4. That himself is that heavenly nourishment of which he spake, and who was typified by the manna in the desert.To show that himself was the true bread from heaven, he proves two things:1. That his doctrine was the true nourishment of the soul, and that those who were to be put in possession of the blessings promised in it must come to God by faith.2. That he would give his body for the life of the world: that as bread is the staff that supports the natural life of man, so the salvation procured by his death should be that by which the bodies and souls of believers should be preserved unto life eternal.
