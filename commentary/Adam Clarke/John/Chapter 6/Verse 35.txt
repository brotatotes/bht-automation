<p>Verse 35. <i><b>I am the bread of life</b></i> — That is, the bread which gives <i>life</i>, and preserves from <i>death</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He that cometh to me</b></i> — The person who receives my doctrine, and believes in me as the great atoning sacrifice, shall be perfectly satisfied, and never more feel misery of mind. All the guilt of his sins shall be blotted out, and his soul shall be purified unto God; and, being enabled to love him with all his heart, he shall rest, fully, supremely, and finally happy, in his God.</p>
