<p>Verse 37. <i><b>All that the Father giveth me</b></i> — The neuter gender, παν, is probably used here for the masculine, πας.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall come to me</b></i> — All that are <i>drawn</i> by the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>, i.e. all those who are <i>influenced</i> by his Spirit, and <i>yield</i> to those influences: for as many as are LED (not <i>driven</i> or <i>dragged</i>) by the Spirit of God, they are the children of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span>. God sent his prophets to proclaim his salvation to this people; and he accompanied their preaching with the influence of his Spirit. Those who yielded were saved: those who did not yield to these drawings were lost. This Spirit still continued to work and to allure; but the people being uncircumcised both in heart and ears, they always resisted the Holy Ghost; as their fathers did, so did they; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51">Acts 7:51</span>. And though Christ <i>would</i> have gathered them together, as a hen would her chickens under her wings, <i>yet they would not</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span>. Those who come at the call of God, he is represented here as <i>giving to Christ</i>, because it is through his blood alone that they can be saved. God, by his Spirit, convinces of sin, righteousness, and judgment; those who acknowledge their iniquity, and their need of salvation, he gives to Christ, i.e. points out unto them the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. Our Lord may here also refer to the <i>calling</i> of the <i>Gentiles</i>; for these, according to the ancient promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:8">Psalms 2:8</span>, were given to Christ: and they, on the preaching of the Gospel, gladly came unto him. See ample proofs of this in the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>I will in no wise cast out.</b></i> — The words are exceedingly emphatical - ου μη εκβαλω εξω, <i>I will by no means thrust out of</i> <i>doors</i>; excellently rendered by Matthew of Erberg in his Italian Bible-<i>Io non cacciaro fuori</i>, I will not chase him out of the house. Our blessed Lord alludes to the case of a person in deep distress and poverty, who comes to a nobleman's house, in order to get relief: the person appears; and the owner, far from treating the poor man with asperity, welcomes, receives him kindly, and supplies his wants. So does Jesus. Newer did he reject the suit of a penitent, however grievous his crimes might have been. He is come to the <i>house of mercy</i>; he is lying at the threshold: the servants bid him come in-he obeys, and stands trembling, waiting for the appearing of the Master, doubtful whether he is to be received or rejected: the Master appears, and not only grants his suit, but receives him into the number of his <i>family</i>: he alleges his unfitness, his unworthiness, his guilt, his crimes, his ingratitude: no matter, all shall be blotted out through the blood of the Lamb, and he be put among the children, and <i>on none of</i> <i>these accounts shall he be put out of the house</i>. The Gentiles shall be as welcome as the Jews; and the invitation to them be as free, as full, and as hearty: they shall become his adopted children, and never be <i>cast out</i>, as the Jews have been. O thou God of love! how <i>able</i> and WILLING art thou to save the vilest of the vile, who come unto thee! Thou art not the God of the Jews only, thou art also the God of the Gentiles. <i>Rejoice</i>, therefore, <i>ye</i> <i>Gentiles, with his people</i>.</p>
