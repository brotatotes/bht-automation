<p>Verse 39. <i><b>I should lose nothing</b></i> — It is the will of God that every soul who believes should continue in the faith, and have a resurrection unto life eternal. But he <i>wills</i> this <i>continuance</i> in salvation, without purposing to <i>force</i> the persons so to <i>continue</i>. God may <i>will</i> a thing <i>to be</i>, without <i>willing</i> that it <i>shall be</i>. Judas was given to Christ by the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>. The Father willed that this Judas should continue in the faith, and have a resurrection unto life eternal: but Judas sinned and perished. Now it is evident that God <i>willed</i> that Judas <i>might be</i> saved, without <i>willing</i> that he <i>must</i> be saved infallibly and unconditionally. When a man is a worker together with the grace of God, he is saved; when he receives that grace of God in vain, he is lost-not through a lack of <i>will</i> or <i>mercy</i> in God, but through lack of his <i>co-operation</i> with Divine grace. God saves no man as a <i>stock</i> or a <i>stone</i>, but as a reasonable being and free agent. "That which thou hast heard, thou mayest hold fast, and persevere in, if thou wilt," Says St. Augustin. <i>In eo quod audieras, et tenueras,</i> <i>perseverares, si velles</i>. De Correct. Grat. c. 7. See <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Raise it up again at the last day</b></i> — The Jews believed that the wicked should have no resurrection and that the principle that led to the resurrection of the body, in the righteous, was the indwelling Spirit of God. This is positively asserted in the <i>Shir</i> <i>Hashirim Rabba</i>. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
