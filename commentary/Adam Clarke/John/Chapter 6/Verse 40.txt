<p>Verse 40. <i><b>This is the will of him that sent me</b></i> â€” Lest they should take a wrong meaning out of his words, as many have done since, he tells them that, far from any person being excluded from his mercy, it was the will of God that every one who saw him might believe and be saved. The <i>power</i>, without which they could not believe, he freely gave them; but the <i>use</i> of that power was their own. God gives the grace of repentance and faith to every man; but he neither repents nor believes for any man. Each must repent for his own sins, and believe in the Lord Jesus, through the grace given, or perish.</p>
