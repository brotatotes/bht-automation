<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Except the Father - draw him</b></i> â€” But how is a man drawn? St. <i>Augustin</i> answers from the poet, <i>Trahit sua quemque voluptas</i>; a man is attracted by that which he delights in. Show green herbage to a sheep, he is drawn by it: show nuts to a child, and he is drawn by them. They run wherever the person runs who shows these things: they run after him, but they are not forced to follow; they run, through the desire they feel to get the things they delight in. So God draws man: he shows him his wants - he shows the Saviour whom he has provided for him: the man feels himself a lost sinner; and, through the desire which he finds to escape hell, and get to heaven, he comes unto Christ, that he may be justified by his blood. Unless God thus draw, no man will ever come to Christ; because none could, without this drawing, ever feel the need of a Saviour. See <i>August. Tract</i>. 26, <i>in Joan</i>. and <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
<p><i>Drawing</i>, or <i>alluring</i>, not <i>dragging</i> is here to be understood. "He," say the rabbins, "who desires to cleave to the holy and blessed God, God lays hold of him, and will not cast him off." <i>Synops. Sohar</i>. p. 87. The best Greek writers use the verb in the same sense of <i>alluring, inciting</i>, &amp;c.</p>
