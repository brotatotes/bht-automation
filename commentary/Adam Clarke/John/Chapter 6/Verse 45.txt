<p>Verse 45. <i><b>It is written in the prophets</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:13">Isaiah 54:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:34">Jeremiah 31:34</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>They shall be all taught of God.</b></i> — This explains the preceding verse. God teaches a man to know himself, that, finding his need of salvation, he may flee to lay hold on the hope which his heavenly Father has set before him in the Gospel. God draws men by his <i>love</i>, and by showing them what his love has done for them. <i>Fear</i> repels, but <i>love</i> attracts. He who is ever preaching the terrors of the law, and representing God as a vindictive judge, will never bring sinners to him. They are <i>afraid</i> of this terrible God: but they <i>love</i> him, <i>who so loved the world</i> that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him might not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
