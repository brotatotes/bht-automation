Verse 46. Not that any man hath seen the Father — He does not teach men by appearing personally before them, or by any other outward voice than that of his word and messengers; but he teaches by his Spirit. This teaching from God implies:1. That they shall have proper instruction.2. That they shall comprehend it; for, when God teaches, there is no delay in learning. And,3. That this teaching should be by the influence of the Holy Ghost upon their minds.He which is of God — That is, Christ alone: neither Moses nor any of the prophets had ever seen God: Jesus, who lay in the bosom of the Father, HE saw and revealed him, John 1:18.
