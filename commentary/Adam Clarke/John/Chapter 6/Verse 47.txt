<p>Verse 47. <i><b>Hath everlasting life.</b></i> â€” He is entitled to this, on his believing me to be the Messiah, and trusting in me alone for salvation. Our blessed Lord recapitulates here what he had said in the preceding discourse. The person who is saved is,</p>
<p>1. drawn by the Father;</p>
<p>2. hears his instructions;</p>
<p>3. accepts the salvation offered;</p>
<p>4. is given to Christ Jesus, that he may be justified by faith;</p>
<p>5. is nourished by the bread of life;</p>
<p>6. perseveres in the faith;</p>
<p>7. is not lost, but is raised up at the last day; and</p>
<p>8. is made a partaker of eternal life.</p>
