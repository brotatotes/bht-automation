<p>Verse 51. <i><b>Is my flesh, which I will give</b></i>, c.] Our Lord explains his meaning more fully, in these words, than he had done before. Having spoken so much of the <i>bread</i> which <i>feeds</i> and <i>nourishes</i> the <i>soul</i>, and preserves from <i>death</i>, the attention of his hearers was fixed upon his words, which to them appeared inexplicable and they desired to know what their meaning was. He then told them that the <i>bread</i> meant his <i>flesh</i>, (his <i>life</i>,) which he was about to give up; to save the life of the world. Here our Lord plainly declares that his death was to be a <i>vicarious sacrifice</i> and <i>atonement</i> for the sin of the world; and that, as no human life could be preserved unless there was <i>bread</i> (proper nourishment) received, so no soul could be saved but by the merit of his death. Reader, remember this: it is one of the weightiest, and one of the truest and most important sayings in the book of God.</p>
