<p>Verse 53. <i><b>Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man</b></i> â€” Unless ye be made partakers of the blessings about to be purchased by my blood, passion, and violent death, ye cannot be saved. As a man must eat bread and flesh, in order to be nourished by them, so a man must receive the grace and Spirit of Christ, in order to his salvation. As <i>food</i> in a rich man's store does not nourish the poor man that needs it, unless it be given him, and he receive it into his stomach, so the whole fountain of mercy existing in the bosom of God, and uncommunicated, does not save a soul: he who is saved by it must be made a <i>partaker</i> of it. Our Lord's meaning appears to be, that, unless they were made partakers of the grace of that atonement which he was about to make by his death, they could not possibly be saved. Bishop Pearce justly observes that the ideas of <i>eating</i> and <i>drinking</i> are here borrowed to express <i>partaking</i> of, and <i>sharing</i> in. Thus spiritual happiness on earth, and even in heaven, is expressed by <i>eating</i> and <i>drinking</i>; instances of which may be seen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:11">Matthew 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:15">Luke 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>. Those who were made partakers of the Holy Spirit are said by St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>, to be <i>made to drink into</i> (or <i>of</i>) <i>one Spirit</i>. This, indeed, was a very common mode of expression among the Jews.</p>
