Verse 54. Hath eternal life â€” This can never be understood of the sacrament of the Lord's supper.1. Because this was not instituted till a year after; at the last Passover.2. It cannot be said that those who do not receive that sacrament must perish everlastingly.3. Nor can it be supposed that all those who do receive it are necessarily and eternally saved.On the contrary, St. Paul intimates that many who received it at Corinth perished, because they received it unworthily, not discerning the Lord's body: not distinguishing between it and a common meal; and not properly considering that sacrifice for sin, of which the sacrament of the Lord's super was a type: see 1 Corinthians 11:30.
