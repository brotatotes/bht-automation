<p>Verse 54. <i><b>Hath eternal life</b></i> â€” This can never be understood of the sacrament of the Lord's supper.</p>
<p>1. Because this was not instituted till a year after; at the last Passover.</p>
<p>2. It cannot be said that those who do not receive that sacrament must perish everlastingly.</p>
<p>3. Nor can it be supposed that all those who do receive it are necessarily and eternally saved.</p>
<p>On the contrary, St. Paul intimates that many who received it at Corinth perished, because they received it unworthily, not discerning the Lord's body: not distinguishing between it and a common meal; and not properly considering that sacrifice for sin, of which the sacrament of the Lord's super was a type: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span>.</p>
