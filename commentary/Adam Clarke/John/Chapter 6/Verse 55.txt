<p>Verse 55. <i><b>My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink</b></i><b> </b><i><b>indeed.</b></i> — Or, rather, <i>My flesh is the true meat</i>, c. In both clauses of this verse, instead of αληθως, the <i>adverb</i>, I read αληθης, the <i>adjective</i>, agreeing with βρωσις. This reading is supported by BCKLT, and twenty-one others both the <i>Arabic,</i> <i>Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian</i>, two copies of the <i>Itala, Clement,</i> <i>Origen, Cyril, Chrysostom</i>, and <i>Damascenus</i>. Our Lord terms his flesh, the <i>true meat</i>, and his blood the <i>true drink</i>, because those who received the grace merited by his death would be really nourished and supported thereby unto eternal life. He calls himself the <i>true vine</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1">John 15:1</span>, in exactly the same sense in which he calls himself the <i>true bread</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:32">John 6:32</span>, and the <i>true meat</i> and <i>drink</i> in this verse.</p>
