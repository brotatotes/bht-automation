<p>Verse 56. <i><b>Dwelleth in me, and I in him.</b></i> â€” Of all connections and unions, none is so intimate and complete as that which is effected by the digestion of aliments, because they are changed into the <i>very substance</i> of him who eats them; and this our Lord makes the model of that union which subsists between himself and genuine believers. He lives in them, and they in him; for they are made partakers of the Divine nature: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>. To this verse the following addition is made in the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, three copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and <i>Victorinus</i>. After these words-<i>dwelleth in me, and I in</i> <i>him</i>, they add, <i>as the Father in me, and I in the Father. Verily,</i> <i>verily, I say unto you, that unless ye receive the body of the Son</i> <i>of man as the bread of life, ye have not life in him</i>. This is a very remarkable addition, and is between thirteen and fourteen hundred years old.</p>
