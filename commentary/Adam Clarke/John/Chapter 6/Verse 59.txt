<p>Verse 59. <i><b>In the synagogue - in Capernaum.</b></i> â€” From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span>, to this verse, the evangelist gives us the discourse which our Lord preached in the synagogue, in which he was repeatedly interrupted by the Jews; but this gave him the fuller opportunity to proclaim the whole truth relative to his passion and death, to edify the disciples, and confute these gainsayers.</p>
