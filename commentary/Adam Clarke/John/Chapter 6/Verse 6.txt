<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:6">John 6:6</span>. <i><b>This he said to prove him</b></i> â€” To try his faith, and to see whether he and the other apostles had paid proper attention to the miracles which they had already seen him work; and to draw their attention more particularly to that which he was now about to perform. This is an observation of the evangelist himself, who often interweaves his own judgment with the facts he relates, which St. Matthew rarely ever does. The other evangelists say that, previously to this miracle, he continued to instruct and heal the multitudes till it was near the close of the day. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:14-15">Matthew 14:14-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:34-35">Mark 6:34-35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:11-12">Luke 9:11-12</span>.</p>
