<p>Verse 60. <i><b>Many therefore of his disciples</b></i> — So it appears that he had <i>many more</i> than the twelve, who constantly accompanied him.</p>
<p><i><b>This is a hard saying; who can hear it?</b></i> — Who can digest such doctrine as this? It is intolerable: it is impracticable. There is a similar saving in <i>Euripides</i>, to the σκληρος λογος of the evangelist. Ποτερα θελεις σοι μαλθακα ψευδη λεγω, η σκληρ' αληθη, φραζε; <i>Tell me whether thou wouldst that I should speak unto thee,</i> <i>a SOFT LIE, or the HARSH TRUTH</i>? The wicked word of a lying world is in general better received than the holy word of the God of truth!</p>
