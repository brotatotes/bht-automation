<p>Verse 62. <i><b>If ye shall see the Son of man ascend</b></i> â€” Ye need not be stumbled at what I say concerning eating my flesh and drinking my blood, for ye shall soon have the fullest proof that this is <i>figuratively</i> spoken, for I shall ascend with the same body with which I shall arise from the dead; therefore my flesh and blood, far from being <i>eaten</i> by men, shall not even be found among them.</p>
