<p>Verse 63. <i><b>It is the spirit that quickeneth</b></i> — It is the spiritual sense only of my words that is to be attended to, and through which life is to be attained, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>. Such only as <i>eat</i> and <i>drink</i> what I have mentioned, in a <i>spiritual</i> sense, are to expect eternal life.</p>
<p><i><b>The flesh profiteth nothing</b></i> — If ye could even eat my flesh and drink my blood, this would not avail for your salvation. These words contain a caution that the hearers should not understand his words in the strict <i>literal</i> sense, as if his body were really BREAD, and as if his flesh and blood were really to be <i>eaten</i> and <i>drank</i>.</p>
<p>The words that I speak Or, <i>I have spoken</i>. Instead of λαλω, <i>I</i> <i>speak</i>, I read λελαληκα, <i>I have spoken</i>, on the authority of BCDKLT, thirteen others; the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, all the <i>Persic, Coptic, AEthiopic, Gothic, Slavonic, Vulgate</i>, all the <i>Itala; Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius, Basil, Cyril, Chrysostom,</i> <i>Tertullian, Ambrosias, Augustin, Gaudentius</i>, and <i>Vigilius Taps</i>. This is an important reading, and plainly shows that our Lord's words <i>here</i> do not refer to any <i>new point</i> of doctrine which he was then inculcating, but to what he <i>had</i> spoken concerning his being the living bread, and concerning the <i>eating of his flesh, and</i> <i>drinking of his blood</i>, in the preceding verses.</p>
<p><i><b>Are spirit, and they are life.</b></i> — As my words are to be spiritually understood, so the life they promise is of a <i>spiritual</i> nature: see Bishop <i>Pearce</i>.</p>
