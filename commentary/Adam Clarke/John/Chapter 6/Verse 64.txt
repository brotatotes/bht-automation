<p>Verse 64. <i><b>But there are some of you that believe not.</b></i> — This is addressed to Judas, and to those disciples who left him: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:66">John 6:66</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And who should betray him</b></i> — Or, <i>who would deliver him up</i>. Because he knew all things; he knew from the <i>first</i>, from Judas's call to the apostleship, and from eternity, (if the reader pleases,) who it was who <i>would</i> (not <i>should</i>) deliver him up into the hands of the Jews. <i>Should</i>, in the apprehension of most, implies <i>necessity</i> and <i>compulsion; would</i> implies that he was under the influence of his <i>own free will</i>, without necessity or constraint. The former takes away his guilt: for what a man is <i>irresistibly</i> compelled to do, by the supreme authority of God, he cannot avoid; and therefore to him no blame can attach: but Judas having acted through his <i>own</i> <i>free will</i>, abusing his power, and the grace he had received, he was guilty of the murder of an innocent man, and deserved the perdition to which he went.</p>
