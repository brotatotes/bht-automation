<p>Verse 65. <i><b>Therefore said I unto you</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>. see the note there.</p>
<p><i><b>Except it were given unto him</b></i> — None can come at <i>first</i>, unless he be drawn by the Father; and none can <i>continue</i>, unless he continue under those sacred influences which God <i>gives</i> only to those who do not receive his first graces in vain. St. Augustin himself grants that it was the sole fault of these disciples that they did not believe, and were saved. <i>Quare non POTERANT credere, si a me</i> <i>quaeratur, cito respondeo, quia NOLEBANT</i>. If I be asked why these <i>could not</i> believe, I immediately answer, because they WOULD NOT. <i>Aug. Tract</i>. 53, <i>in Joan</i>.</p>
