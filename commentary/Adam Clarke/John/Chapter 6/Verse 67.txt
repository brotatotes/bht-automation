Verse 67. Will ye also go alway? â€” Or, Do YE also desire, c. These words are very emphatical. Will YOU abandon me? - you, whom I have distinguished with innumerable marks of my affection - you, whom I have chosen out of the world to be my companions, - you, to whom I have revealed the secrets of the eternal world - you, who have been witnesses of all my miracles - you, whom I intend to seat with me on my throne in glory will YOU go away? Reader, in what state art thou? Hast thou gone back from Christ, or art thou going back? Wilt thou go? Thou, whom he has redeemed by his blood -thou, whom he has upheld by his power, and fed by his providence - thou, into whose wounded soul he has poured the balm of pardoning mercy - thou, whom he has adopted into the heavenly family - thou, whom he has comforted in so many tribulations and adversities - thou, whose multiplied offences he has freely and fully pardoned; wilt thou go away?
