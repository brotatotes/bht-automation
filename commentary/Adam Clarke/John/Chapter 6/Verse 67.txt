<p>Verse 67. <i><b>Will ye also go alway?</b></i> â€” Or, <i>Do YE also desire</i>, c. These words are very emphatical. Will YOU abandon me? - <i>you</i>, whom I have distinguished with innumerable marks of my affection - <i>you</i>, whom I have chosen out of the world to be my companions, - <i>you</i>, to whom I have revealed the secrets of the eternal world - <i>you</i>, who have been witnesses of all my miracles - <i>you</i>, whom I intend to seat with me on my throne in glory will YOU go away? Reader, in what state art <i>thou</i>? Hast <i>thou gone back</i> from Christ, or art thou <i>going</i> back? Wilt <i>thou</i> go? <i>Thou</i>, whom he has redeemed by his blood -<i>thou</i>, whom he has upheld by his power, and fed by his providence - <i>thou</i>, into whose wounded soul he has poured the balm of pardoning mercy - <i>thou</i>, whom he has adopted into the heavenly family - <i>thou</i>, whom he has comforted in so many tribulations and adversities - <i>thou</i>, whose multiplied offences he has freely and fully pardoned; wilt <i>thou</i> go away?</p>
