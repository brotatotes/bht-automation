<p>Verse 68. <i><b>Simon Peter answered</b></i> â€” With his usual zeal and readiness, speaking in behalf of the whole, <i>To whom shall we go</i>? Where shall we find a more gracious master-a more powerful Redeemer - a more suitable Saviour? <i>Thou</i> alone <i>hast the words of</i> <i>eternal life</i>. None can teach the <i>doctrine</i> of salvation but thyself; and none can confer the gift of eternal life but thou alone. Reader, let me ask, whither art <i>thou</i> going? Has the world-the devil-the flesh - <i>the words of eternal life</i>? Art thou turning thy back upon God and Christ? For thy zealous services, what has Satan to give thee? Death! hell! and eternal misery! O stop! Cleave to Jesus; he will give thee that happiness which, in vain, thou seekest in the pleasures of sin.</p>
