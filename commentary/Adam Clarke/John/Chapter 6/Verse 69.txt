Verse 69. We believe — On the authority of thy word; and are sure-have known, εγνωκαμεν, by the evidence of thy miracles, that thou art the Christ, the promised Messiah. [-Anglo-Saxon-] And we belyfath and witen that thu eart Crist Godes Son. Anglo-Saxon. How near is the mother to the daughter tongue!Instead of Christ the Son of the living God, some excellent MSS., BCDL, and others, read ὁ αγιος του Θεου, the holy one of God; and this reading Griesbach has received into the text, leaving out του ζωντος, the living. χριστος, and αγιος convey nearly the same meaning; but the AEthiopic, as usual, retains both. του ζωντες is omitted by BCDL, H, the Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, later Persic, Vulgate, all the Itala but one, and by the Anglo-Saxon; which last Griesbach has not noticed.
