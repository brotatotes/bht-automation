<p>Verse 69. <i><b>We believe</b></i> — On the authority of thy word; <i>and are</i> <i>sure-have known</i>, εγνωκαμεν, by the evidence of thy miracles, <i>that</i> <i>thou art the Christ</i>, the promised Messiah. [-Anglo-Saxon-] <i>And we</i> <i>belyfath and witen that thu eart Crist Godes Son. Anglo-Saxon</i>. How near is the <i>mother</i> to the <i>daughter</i> tongue!</p>
<p>Instead of <i>Christ the Son of the living God</i>, some excellent MSS., BCDL, and others, read ὁ αγιος του Θεου, <i>the holy one of</i> <i>God</i>; and this reading <i>Griesbach</i> has received into the text, leaving out του ζωντος, <i>the living</i>. χριστος, and αγιος convey nearly the same meaning; but the AEthiopic, as usual, retains both. του ζωντες is omitted by BCDL, H, the <i>Coptic,</i> <i>Sahidic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Persic, Vulgate</i>, all the <i>Itala</i> but one, and by the <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>; which last <i>Griesbach</i> has not noticed.</p>
