<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:9">John 6:9</span>. <i><b>There is a lad here</b></i> — παιδαριον, a <i>little boy</i>, or <i>servant</i>, probably one who carried the apostles' provisions, or who came on purpose to sell his bread and fish.</p>
<p><i><b>Five barley loaves</b></i> — Barley scarcely bore one-third of the value of wheat in the east: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:6">Revelation 6:6</span>. That it was a very <i>mean</i> fare appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+13:19">Ezekiel 13:19</span>, where the false prophetesses are said <i>to pollute the</i> name of God <i>for handfuls of barley</i>, i.e. for the meanest reward. And <i>Plutarch</i>, in <i>Apoph</i>. p. 174, speaking concerning the flight of <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>, says he was reduced to such distress as to be obliged to <i>eat barley bread</i>. See <i>Kypke</i>. From this and other circumstances we may plainly perceive that the self-denying doctrine preached by Christ and his apostles was fully exemplified in their own manner of living.</p>
<p><i><b>Two small fishes</b></i> — δυο οψαρια. The word of οψαριον signifies <i>whatever is eaten with bread</i>, to perfect the meal, or to make it easy of deglutition, or to help the digestion. There is no word in the English language for it, which is a great defect. The inhabitants of Scotland, and of the north and north-west of Ireland, use the word <i>kytshen</i>, by which they express what ever is eaten with bread or potatoes, as <i>flesh, fish, butter, milk, eggs</i>, c., no satisfactory etymology of which word I am able to offer. In the parallel places in the other three evangelists, instead of οψαριαι, χθυας is used so that the word evidently means <i>fish</i> in the text of St. John: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:5">John 21:5</span>.</p>
