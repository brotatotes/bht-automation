<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1">John 7:1</span>. <i><b>After these things</b></i> — St. John passes from the preceding discourse of our Lord, which he delivered a little before the <i>passover</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>, to the <i>Feast</i> of <i>Tabernacles</i>, which happened six months after, and thus omits many things mentioned by the other evangelists, which our blessed Lord said and did during that time. He had already gone over Galilee four or five times; and he continued there, because he found that the hatred of the Jews was such that they would kill him if they could meet with him in Judea; and his time to suffer was not yet come.</p>
<p><i><b>For he would not walk in Jewry</b></i> — Instead of this, some MSS., versions, and fathers read, ουγαρ ειχεν εξουσιαν, <i>he had not</i> <i>authority</i>, or <i>liberty to walk</i>, &amp;c. That is, he was no longer tolerated, and could not preach publicly in Judea, but at the risk of his life. He found greater scope for the exercise of his important ministry in Galilee than in Judea, as the chief priests, &amp;c., were continually plotting his death.</p>
