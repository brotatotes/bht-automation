<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:12">John 7:12</span>. <i><b>Some said, He is a good man</b></i> â€” The multitude were divided in their opinions concerning him: those who knew him best said, <i>He is a good man</i>. Those who spoke according to the character given him by the priests, c., said, <i>Nay but he deceiveth the</i> <i>people</i>. Those who spoke evil of him spoke <i>out</i>, because they had the <i>rulers</i> on <i>their side</i>; but those who spoke <i>good</i> of him were obliged to do it in <i>private</i>, because they feared these rulers. Calumny and slander are among the privileged orders; they stalk abroad with their thousand brazen mouths, and blast the reputation of the followers of God. Benevolence and candour are only on sufferance; and a <i>whisper</i> in <i>secret</i> is the most they are permitted to give in behalf of Christ and his followers, whose laws and maxims condemn a vicious world, and goad it to revenge.</p>
