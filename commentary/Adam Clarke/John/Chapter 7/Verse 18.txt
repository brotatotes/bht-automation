<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:18">John 7:18</span>. <i><b>He that speaketh of himself</b></i>, c.] I will give you another rule, whereby you shall know whether I am from God or not: If I speak so as to procure my own glory, to gratify vanity, or to secure and promote my secular interests, then reject me as a deceiver and as a false prophet. But if I act only to promote the glory of God, to induce all men to love and obey <i>him</i> if I propose nothing but what leads to the perfection of his law, and the accomplishment of its ordinances, you cannot help acknowledging me at least for a <i>true</i> prophet; and, if you add to this the proofs which I have given of my mission and power, you must acknowledge me as the mighty power of God, and the promised Messiah.</p>
