<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:19">John 7:19</span>. <i><b>Did not Moses give you the law</b></i>, c.] The scribes and Pharisees announced our Lord to the multitude as a deceiver and they grounded their calumny on this, that he was not an exact observer of the law, for he had healed a man on the Sabbath day, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:9-10">John 5:9-10</span>; and consequently must be a false prophet. Now they insinuated, that the interests of religion required him to be put to death:</p>
<p>1. As a violator of the law; and,</p>
<p>2. as a false prophet and deceiver of the people.</p>
<p>To destroy this evil reasoning, our Lord speaks in this wise: If I deserve death for curing a man on the Sabbath, and desiring him to carry home his bed, which you consider a violation of the law, you are more culpable than I am, for you circumcise a child on the Sabbath, which requires much more bustle, and is of so much less use than what I have done to the infirm man. But, if you think you do not violate the law by circumcising a child on the Sabbath, how can you condemn me for having cured one of yourselves, who has been afflicted thirty and eight years? If you consider my conduct with the same eye with which you view your own, far from finding any thing criminal in it, you will see much reason to give glory to God. Why, therefore, go ye about to kill <i>me</i>, as a transgressor of the law, when not one of <i>yourselves</i> keeps it?</p>
