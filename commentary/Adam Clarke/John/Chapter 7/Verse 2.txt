<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:2">John 7:2</span>. <i><b>Feast of tabernacles</b></i> â€” This feast was celebrated on the fifteenth day of the month <i>Tisri</i>, answering to the last half of our September, and the first half of October. This month was the <i>seventh</i> of the <i>ecclesiastical</i>, and <i>first</i> of the <i>civil</i>, year. The feast took its name from the <i>tents</i> which were erected about the temple, in public places, in courts, and on the flat roofs of their houses, and in gardens; in which the Jews dwelt for <i>eight</i> days, in commemoration of the <i>forty</i> years during which their fathers dwelt in the wilderness. It was one of the <i>three</i> solemn annual feasts in which all the males were obliged, by the law, to appear at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>This feast was celebrated in the following manner. All the people cut down branches of palm trees, willows, and myrtles, (and tied them together with gold and silver cords, or with ribbons,) which they carried with them all day, took them into their synagogues, and kept them by them while at prayers. On the other days of the feast they carried them with them into the temple and walked round the altar with them in their hands, singing, Hosanna! i.e. <i>Save, we beseech thee</i>!-the trumpets sounding on all sides. To this feast St. John seems to refer, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9-10">Revelation 7:9-10</span>, where he represents the saints standing before the throne, <i>with palm</i> <i>branches in their hands</i>, singing, <i>Salvation to God</i>, c. On the seventh day of the feast, they went seven times round the altar, and this was called <i>Hosanna rabba</i>, the <i>great Hosanna</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span></span>. But the ceremony at which the Jews testified most joy was that of <i>pouring out the water</i>, which was done on the <i>eighth</i> day of the feast. A priest drew some water out of the pool <i>Siloam</i>, in a golden vessel, and brought it into the temple and at the time of the morning sacrifice, while the members of the sacrifice were on the altar, he went up and poured this water mingled with wine upon it, the people all the while singing, with transports of joy, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:0">Isaiah 12:0</span>, especially <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:6">Isaiah 12:6</span>: <i>With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation</i>. To this part of the ceremony, our Lord appears to allude in ver. 37, of this chapter. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span></span>.</p>
<p>During this feast many <i>sacrifices</i> were offered. On the first day, besides the ordinary sacrifices, they offered, as a burnt-offering, <i>thirteen</i> calves, <i>two</i> rams, and <i>fourteen</i> lambs with the offerings of flour and the libations of wine that were to accompany them. They offered also a goat for a sin-offering. On all the succeeding days they offered the same sacrifices, only abating <i>one</i> of the calves <i>each</i> day, so that when the <i>seventh</i> day came, they had but <i>seven</i> calves to offer. On the <i>eighth</i> day, which was kept with greater solemnity than the rest, they offered but <i>one</i> calf, <i>one</i> ram, and <i>seven</i> lambs, for a burnt-offering, and <i>one</i> goat for a sin-offering, with the usual offerings and libations. On this day, they also offered in the temple the <i>first</i> <i>fruits</i> of their latter crops, or of those things which come latest to maturity.
