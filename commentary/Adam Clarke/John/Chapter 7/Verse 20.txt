<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:20">John 7:20</span>. <i><b>Thou hast a devil</b></i> — The crowd, who made this answer, were not in the secret of the chief priests. They could not suppose that any person desired to put him to death for healing a diseased man; and therefore, in their brutish manner, they say, <i>Thou hast a demon</i>-thou art beside thyself, and slanderest the people, for none of them desires to put thee to death. The <i>Codex</i> <i>Cyprius</i> (K,) four others, and the margin of the later <i>Syriac</i>, attribute this answer <i>to the Jews</i>, i.e. those who were seeking his life. If the reading, therefore, of οι Ιουδαιοι, <i>the Jews</i>, be received instead of ο οχλος, <i>the multitude</i>, it serves to show the malice of his enemies in a still stronger light: for, fearing lest their wish to put him to death might not be gratified, and that his teaching should prevail among the common people; to ruin his credit, and prevent his usefulness, they give out that he <i>was</i> <i>possessed by a demon</i>; and that, though he might be <i>pitied</i> as a miserable man, yet he must not be <i>attended</i> to as a teacher of righteousness. Malice and envy are ever active and indefatigable, leaving no stone unturned, no mean unused, that they may win the object of their resentment. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:26">John 7:26</span>.</p>
