<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:21">John 7:21</span>. <i><b>I have done one work</b></i> — That of curing the impotent man, already referred to. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:9">John 5:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And ye all marvel.</b></i> — or, <i>ye all marvel because of this</i>. Some have δια τουτο, in connection with θαυμαζετε, which the common pointing makes the beginning of the next verse, and which, in our common version, is translated <i>therefore</i>; but this word conveys no meaning at all, in the connection in which it is thus placed. Proof of this construction <i>Kypke</i> gives from <i>Themistius, Strabo</i>, and <i>AElian</i>. All the eminent critics are on the side of this arrangement of the words.</p>
