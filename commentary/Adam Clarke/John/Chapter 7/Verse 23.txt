<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Every whit whole</b></i> — The law of circumcision required the removal of a small <i>portion</i> of flesh, which was considered a <i>blot</i> and <i>reproach</i> among the Hebrews, because it confounded them with the nations who were not in covenant with God. Christ, to this, opposes the <i>complete</i> cure of the infirm man, who was diseased throughout his whole body: if the one was permitted on the Sabbath day, for the reason already alleged, surely the other had stronger reasons to recommend it.</p>
<p>Some think that the original words, ολον ανθρπον, should be translated, <i>the whole man</i>; and that the meaning is, that the blessed Saviour made him whole both in <i>body</i> and <i>soul</i>. This makes the miracle the greater, and shows still more forcibly the necessity of doing it without <i>delay</i>.</p>
<p><i>Battier</i> ap. <i>Wets</i>. supposes that, instead of ολον, χωλον should be read - <i>I have made a MAIMED man whole</i>; but there is no countenance for this reading in any of the MSS., versions, or fathers.</p>
