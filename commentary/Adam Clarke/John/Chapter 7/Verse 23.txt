Verse 23. Every whit whole — The law of circumcision required the removal of a small portion of flesh, which was considered a blot and reproach among the Hebrews, because it confounded them with the nations who were not in covenant with God. Christ, to this, opposes the complete cure of the infirm man, who was diseased throughout his whole body: if the one was permitted on the Sabbath day, for the reason already alleged, surely the other had stronger reasons to recommend it.Some think that the original words, ολον ανθρπον, should be translated, the whole man; and that the meaning is, that the blessed Saviour made him whole both in body and soul. This makes the miracle the greater, and shows still more forcibly the necessity of doing it without delay.Battier ap. Wets. supposes that, instead of ολον, χωλον should be read - I have made a MAIMED man whole; but there is no countenance for this reading in any of the MSS., versions, or fathers.
