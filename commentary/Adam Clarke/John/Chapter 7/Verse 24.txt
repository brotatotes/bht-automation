<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Judge not according to the appearance</b></i> â€” Attend to the law, not merely in the <i>letter</i>, but in its <i>spirit</i> and <i>design</i>. Learn that the law which commands men to rest on the Sabbath day is subordinate to the law of mercy and love, which requires them to be ever active to promote God's glory in the comfort and salvation of their fellow creatures; and endeavour to judge of the merit or demerit of an action, not from the first impression it may make upon your prejudices but from its <i>tendency</i>, and the motives of the person, as far as it is possible for you to acquaint yourselves with them; still believing the <i>best</i>, where you have no certain proof to the contrary.</p>
