<p>Verse 26. <i><b>That this is the very Christ?</b></i> — In most of the common printed editions αληθως is found, the VERY Christ; but the word is wanting in BDKLTX, twenty-two others, several editions; all the <i>Arabic</i>, Wheelock's <i>Persic</i>, the <i>Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian,</i> <i>Slavonic, Vulgate</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i> but one, <i>Origen, Epiphanius,</i> <i>Cyril, Isidore, Pelusian</i>, and <i>Nonnus</i>. <i>Grotius, Mill, Bengel</i>, and <i>Griesbach</i>, decide against it. Bishop <i>Pearce</i> says, I am of opinion that this second αληθως, in this verse, should be omitted, it seeming quite unnecessary, if not inaccurate, when the words αληθως εγνωσαν, had just preceded it.</p>
<p><i>Calmet</i> observes that the multitude which heard our Lord at this time was composed of three different classes of persons:</p>
<p>1. The rulers, priests, and Pharisees, declared enemies of Christ.</p>
<p>2. The inhabitants of Jerusalem, who knew the sentiments of their rulers concerning him.</p>
<p>3. The strangers, who from different quarters had come up to Jerusalem to the feast, and who heard Christ attentively, being ignorant of the designs of the rulers, &amp;c., against him.</p>
<p>Our Lord addresses himself in this discourse principally to his enemies. The strange Jews were those who were <i>astonished</i> when Christ said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:20">John 7:20</span>, <i>that they sought to kill him</i>, having no such design themselves, and not knowing that others had. And the Jews of Jerusalem were those who, knowing the disposition of the rulers, and seeing Christ speak <i>openly</i>, no man attempting to seize him, addressed each other in the foregoing words, <i>Do the rulers know indeed that</i> <i>this is the Christ</i>? imagining that the chief priests, &amp;c., had at last been convinced that Jesus was the MESSIAH.</p>
