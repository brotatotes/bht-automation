<p>Verse 27. <i><b>No man knoweth whence he is.</b></i> â€” The generality of the people knew very well that the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem, in the city, and of the family, of David; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:42">John 7:42</span>. But, from Isaiah <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:8">Isaiah 53:8</span>, <i>Who shall declare his generation</i>? they probably thought that there should be something so peculiarly mysterious in his birth, or in the manner of his appearing, that no person could fully understand. Had they considered his miraculous conception, they would have felt their minds relieved on this point. The Jews thought that the Messiah, after his birth, would hide himself for some considerable time; and that when he began to preach no man should know where he had been hidden, and whence he had come. The rabbins have the following proverb: Three things come <i>unexpectedly</i>:</p>
<p>1. A thing found by <i>chance</i>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>sting</i> of a scorpion: and,</p>
<p>3. The <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
<p>It was probably in reference to the above that the people said, <i>No man knoweth whence he is</i>. However, they might have spoken this of his <i>parents</i>. We know that the Messiah is to be born in <i>Bethlehem</i>, of the <i>family</i> of <i>David</i>; but no man can know his <i>parents</i>: therefore they rejected him: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:42">John 6:42</span>, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose <i>father</i> and <i>mother</i> we <i>know</i>?</p>
