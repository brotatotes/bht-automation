<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am</b></i> â€” Perhaps they should be read interrogatively: <i>Do ye both know me, and know</i> <i>whence I am</i>? Our Lord takes them up on their own profession, and argues from it. Since you have got so much information concerning me, add this to it, to make it complete; viz. that <i>I am not come</i> <i>of myself</i>; am no self-created or self-authorized prophet; I came from God:- the testimony of John the Baptist, the descent of the Holy Ghost, the voice from heaven, the purity and excellence of my doctrine, and the multitude of my miracles, sufficiently attest this. Now, God is <i>true</i> who has borne testimony to me; but <i>ye know</i> <i>him not</i>, therefore it is that this testimony is disregarded.</p>
