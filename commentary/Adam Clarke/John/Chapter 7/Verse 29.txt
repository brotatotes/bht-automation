<p>Verse 29. <i><b>But I know him: for I am from him</b></i> — Instead of ειμ, <i>I</i> <i>am</i>, some editions, the <i>Syriac</i> Hieros. read ειμι, <i>I came</i>, according to the Attics. <i>Nonnus</i> confirms this reading by paraphrasing the word by εληλυθα, <i>I came</i>. As the difference between the two words lies only in the <i>accents</i>, and as these are not found in ancient MSS., it is uncertain which way the word was understood by them: nor is the matter of much moment; both words amount nearly to the same meaning and ειμι, <i>I came</i>, seems too refined.</p>
