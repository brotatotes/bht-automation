<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:3">John 7:3</span>. <i><b>His brethren - said</b></i> — It is generally supposed that these were the children of the <i>sisters</i> of his mother Mary; but some of the ancients have stated that Joseph had several children by a former wife. See the account of the evangelist prefixed to this Gospel. No solid proof can be alleged against this; nor can we pretend to say that these were not the children of Joseph and Mary. Our blessed Lord, it is true, was her <i>first born</i>, while she was yet a <i>virgin</i>; but no man can prove that he was her <i>last</i>. It is an article of faith, in the Popish Church, to believe in the <i>perpetual virginity</i> of Mary; and in this respect, without any reason, several <i>Protestants</i> seem to be <i>Papists</i>. However this may be, it is certain that the Hebrews gave the name of brethren to all the <i>relatives</i> of a particular family.

<p><i><b>That thy disciples also may see</b></i> — That is, the disciples which he had made two years and six months before, at the Passover: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>.</p>
