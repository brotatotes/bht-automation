<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Will he do more miracles</b></i> â€” It was the belief of the Jews, and they founded it upon <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:5">Isaiah 35:5</span>, that, when the Messiah came, he would do all kinds of miracles; and, in order that they might have the fullest proof of the Divine mission of Christ, it had pleased God to cause miracles to cease for between <i>four</i> and <i>five</i> hundred years, and that John the Baptist himself had not wrought any. His miracles, therefore, were a full proof of his Divine mission.</p>
