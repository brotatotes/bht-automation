<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me</b></i> — When the Roman armies come against you, you will vainly seek for a deliverer. But ye shall be cut off in your sins, because ye did not believe in me; and <i>where I am</i>-in the kingdom of glory, <i>ye</i> <i>cannot come</i>; for nothing that is unholy shall enter into the new Jerusalem. In this, and the thirty-sixth verse, ειμ, <i>I am</i>, is read by several ειμι, <i>I came</i>, as in the twenty-ninth verse; and in these two last places the <i>AEthiopic, Arabic</i>, three copies of the <i>Itala, Nonnus</i>, and <i>Theophylact</i>, agree. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:29">John 7:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:29">John 7:29</span></span>.</p>
