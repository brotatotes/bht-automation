Verse 34. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me — When the Roman armies come against you, you will vainly seek for a deliverer. But ye shall be cut off in your sins, because ye did not believe in me; and where I am-in the kingdom of glory, ye cannot come; for nothing that is unholy shall enter into the new Jerusalem. In this, and the thirty-sixth verse, ειμ, I am, is read by several ειμι, I came, as in the twenty-ninth verse; and in these two last places the AEthiopic, Arabic, three copies of the Itala, Nonnus, and Theophylact, agree. John 7:29; John 7:29.
