<p>Verse 35. <i><b>The dispersed among the Gentiles</b></i> â€” Or <i>Greeks</i>. By the <i>dispersed</i>, are meant here the <i>Jews</i> who were scattered through various parts of that empire which Alexander the Great had founded, in Greece, Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor, where the Greek language was used, and where the Jewish Scriptures in the Greek version of the Septuagint were read. Others suppose that the <i>Gentiles</i> themselves are meant-others, that the <i>ten</i> tribes which had been long lost are here intended.</p>
