<p>Verse 37. <i><b>In the last day, that great</b></i><b> day </b><i><b>of the feast</b></i> â€” This was the <i>eighth</i> day, and was called the <i>great day</i>, because of certain <i>traditional</i> observances, and not on account of any excellence which it derived from the original institution. On the seven days they professed to offer sacrifices for the seventy nations of the earth, but on the <i>eighth</i> day they offered sacrifices for Israel; therefore the <i>eighth</i> day was more highly esteemed than any of the others. It is probably to this that the evangelist refers when he calls the last day the <i>great</i> day of the feast. See the account of the feast of <i>tabernacles</i>, in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:2">John 7:2</span>. It was probably when they went to draw water from the pool <i>Siloam</i>, and while they were pouring it out at the foot of the altar, that our Lord spoke these words; for, as that ceremony pointed out the gracious influences of the Holy Spirit, our Lord, who was the fountain whence it was to proceed, called the people to <i>himself</i>, that, by believing on him, they might be made partakers of that inestimable benefit.</p>
