Verse 40. Of a truth this is the Prophet. â€” The great prophet, or teacher, spoken of by Moses, Deuteronomy 18:15, which they improperly distinguished from the Messiah, John 7:41. Some no doubt knew that by the prophet, the Messiah was meant; but others seem to have thought that one of the ancient prophets should be raised from the dead, and precede the appearing of the Messiah.
