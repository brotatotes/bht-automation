<p>Verse 40. <i><b>Of a truth this is the Prophet.</b></i> â€” The great <i>prophet</i>, or <i>teacher</i>, spoken of by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>, which they improperly distinguished from the <i>Messiah</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:41">John 7:41</span>. Some no doubt knew that by the prophet, the Messiah was meant; but others seem to have thought that one of the ancient prophets should be raised from the dead, and precede the appearing of the Messiah.</p>
