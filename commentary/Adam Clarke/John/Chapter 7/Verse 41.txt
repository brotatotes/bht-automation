<p>Verse 41. <i><b>Shalt Christ come out of Galilee?</b></i> â€” As the prophets had declared that the Messiah was to come from the <i>tribe of Judah</i>, and from the <i>family of David</i>, and should be born in the <i>city of</i> <i>Bethlehem</i>, these Jews, imagining that Christ had been born in <i>Galilee</i>, concluded that he could not be the Messiah. Had they examined the matter a little farther, they would have found that he had his birth exactly as the prophets had foretold; but, for want of this necessary examination, they continued in unbelief, and rejected the Lord that bought them. Many still lose their souls nearly in the same way. They suffer themselves to be led away by <i>common report</i>, and become prejudiced against the truth, refuse to give it a fair hearing, or to examine for themselves. It is on this ground that deign and irreligion have established themselves, and still maintain their posts.</p>
