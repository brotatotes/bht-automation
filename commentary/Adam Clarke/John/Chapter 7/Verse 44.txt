<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Would have taken him</b></i> â€” Or, <i>they wished to seize him</i>. And this they would have done, and destroyed him too at that time, had they been <i>unanimous</i>; but their being <i>divided</i> in opinion, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:43">John 7:43</span>, was the cause, under God, why his life was at that time preserved. How true are the words of the prophet: <i>The wrath</i> <i>of man shall praise thee; and the remainder thereof thou wilt</i> <i>restrain</i>! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+76:10">Psalms 76:10</span>.</p>
