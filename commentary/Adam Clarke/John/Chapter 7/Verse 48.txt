<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Have any of the rulers - believed on him?</b></i> â€” Very few. But is this a proof that he is not of God? No, truly. If he were of the <i>world</i>, the world would <i>love</i> its own. The religion of Christ has been in general rejected by the rulers of this world. A life of mortification, self-denial, and humility, does not comport with the views of those who <i>will</i> have their portion in this life. It has ever been a mark of the truth of God that the great, the mighty, and the wise have in general rejected it. They are too much occupied with <i>this</i> world to attend to the concerns of the <i>next</i>.</p>
