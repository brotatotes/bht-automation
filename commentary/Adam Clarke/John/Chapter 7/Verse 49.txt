<p>Verse 49. <i><b>This people</b></i> — Ὁ οχλος, <i>This rabble</i>. The common people were treated by the Pharisees with the most sovereign contempt: they were termed עם הארץ <i>am ha-arets, people of the</i> <i>earth</i>; and were not thought worthy to have a resurrection to eternal life. <i>Wagenseil</i> and <i>Schoettgen</i> have given many proofs of the contempt in which the common people were held by the Pharisees. Those who were disciples of any of the rabbins were considered as being in a much better state. When they <i>paid</i> well, they purchased their masters' good opinion.</p>
