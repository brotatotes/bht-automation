<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:5">John 7:5</span>. <i><b>Neither did his brethren believe in him.</b></i> â€” They did not receive him as the promised <i>Messiah</i>; but, having seen so many of his miracles, they could not but consider him as an eminent prophet. They supposed that, if he were the Messiah, he would wish to manifest himself as such to the world; and, because he did not do so, they did not believe that he was the salvation of Israel.</p>
