<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:52">John 7:52</span>. <i><b>Art thou also of Galilee?</b></i> — They knew very well that he was not; but they spoke this by way of reproach. As if they had said, thou art no better than he is, as thou takest his part. Many of the Galileans had believed on him, Which the Jews considered to be a reproach. Art thou his disciple, as the Galileans are?</p>
<p><i><b>Search, and look</b></i> — Examine the Scriptures, search the public registers, and thou wilt see that out of Galilee there ariseth no prophet. Neither the <i>Messiah</i>, nor any other <i>prophet</i>, has ever proceeded from Galilee, nor ever can. This conclusion, says Calmet, was false and impertinent: false, because <i>Jonah</i> was of <i>Gathheper</i>, in Galilee: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+14:25">2 Kings 14:25</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:13">Joshua 19:13</span>. The Prophet <i>Nahum</i> was also a <i>Galilean</i>, for he was of the tribe of <i>Simeon</i>; and some suppose that <i>Malachi</i> was of the same place. The conclusion was false, because there not having been a prophet from any particular place was no argument that there never could be one, as the place had not been proscribed.</p>
