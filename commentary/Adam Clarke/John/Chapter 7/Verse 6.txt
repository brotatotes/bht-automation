<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:6">John 7:6</span>. <i><b>My time is not yet come</b></i> â€” It is probable our Lord meant no more than this, that <i>he</i> had some business to transact before he could go to Jerusalem; but his brethren, having nothing to hinder <i>them</i> might set off immediately. Others think he speaks of his passion: My time of suffering is not yet come: as <i>ye</i> are still in friendship with the world, ye need not be under any apprehension of danger: ye may go when ye please. The first sense I think is the best.</p>
