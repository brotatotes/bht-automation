<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:7">John 7:7</span>. <i><b>The world cannot hate you</b></i> — The Jews will not persecute you, because ye are in their sentiments and interests. Ye also expect a <i>worldly</i> Messiah.</p>
<p><i><b>But me it hateth</b></i> — Because I condemn its injustice, its pride, its ambition, and its maxims, by my life and doctrine. It is very likely that the term <i>world</i> means here the <i>Jewish</i> people only: this is an acceptation in which υκοσμος frequently occurs in this Gospel.
