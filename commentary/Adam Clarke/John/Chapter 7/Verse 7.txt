Verse John 7:7. The world cannot hate you — The Jews will not persecute you, because ye are in their sentiments and interests. Ye also expect a worldly Messiah.But me it hateth — Because I condemn its injustice, its pride, its ambition, and its maxims, by my life and doctrine. It is very likely that the term world means here the Jewish people only: this is an acceptation in which υκοσμος frequently occurs in this Gospel. See on John 17:0. John 17:1-26.
