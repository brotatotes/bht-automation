<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:8">John 7:8</span>. <i><b>I go not up yet unto this feast</b></i> — Porphyry accuses our blessed Lord of falsehood, because he said here, I will not go to this feast, and yet afterwards he went; and some interpreters have made more ado than was necessary, in order to reconcile this seeming contradiction. To me the whole seems very simple and plain. Our Lord did not say, <i>I will not go to this feast</i>; but merely, <i>I go not yet</i>, ουπω, or am not <i>going</i>, i.e. at present; because, as he said <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:6">John 7:6</span>, and repeats here, <i>his time was not yet come</i>-he had other business to transact before he could go. And it is very likely that his business detained him in Galilee till the feast was half over: for we do not find him at Jerusalem till the middle of the feast, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:14">John 7:14</span>, i.e. till the feast had been begun four days. He might also be unwilling to go at that time, there being such a great concourse of people on the road to Jerusalem, and his enemies might say that he had availed himself of this time and multitude in order to excite sedition.</p>
