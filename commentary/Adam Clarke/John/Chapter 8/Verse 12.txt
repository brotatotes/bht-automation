<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>. <i><b>Then spake Jesus again unto them</b></i> — Allowing the story about the woman taken in adultery to be authentic, and to stand here in its proper place, we may consider that our Lord, having begun to teach the people in the temple, was interrupted by the introduction of this woman by the scribes and Pharisees; and now, having dismissed them and the woman also, he resumes his discourse.</p>
<p><i><b>I am the light of the world</b></i> — The fountain whence an intellectual light and spiritual understanding proceed: without me all is darkness, misery, and death. The Divine Being was, by the rabbins denominated, <i>The light of the world</i>. So in <i>Bamidbar Rabba</i>: "The Israelites said to God, O Lord of the universe, thou commandest us to light lamps to thee, yet thou art THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD: and with thee the light dwelleth." Our Lord, therefore, assumes here a well known character of the Supreme Being; and with this we find the Jews were greatly offended.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall not walk in darkness</b></i> — He shall be saved from ignorance, infidelity, and sin. If he follow me, become my disciple, and believe on my name, he shall have my Spirit to bear witness with his, that he is a child of God. He shall have the light of life-such a <i>light</i> as brings and supports <i>life</i>. The <i>sun</i>, the fountain of <i>light</i>, is also the fountain of <i>life</i>: by his vivifying influences, all things live-neither animal nor vegetative life could exist, were it not for his influence. Jesus, the Sun of righteousness, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>, is the fountain of all spiritual and eternal LIFE. <i>His light</i> brings <i>life</i> with it, and they who walk in his <i>light</i> live in his <i>life</i>. This sentiment is beautifully expressed and illustrated in the following inimitable verse (all <i>monosyllables</i> except one word) of that second Spenser, <i>Phineas</i> <i>Fletcher</i>. Speaking of the conversion of a soul to God, he says:- </p>
<p>As the Messiah was frequently spoken of by the prophets under the emblem of <i>light</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span>, the Pharisees must at once perceive that he intended to recommend himself to the people as the Messiah, when he said, <i>I am the light of the world</i>.</p>
<p>The rabbins think that the Messiah is intended in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:8">Genesis 1:8</span>, <i>And God said, Let there be light, and there was light</i>. "From this we may learn that the holy and blessed God saw the light of the Messiah and his works before the world was created; and reserved it for the Messiah, and his generation, under the throne of his glory. Satan said to the holy and blessed God, For whom dost thou reserve that light which is under the throne of thy glory? God answered: For him who shall subdue thee, and overwhelm thee with confusion. Satan rejoined, Lord of the universe, show that person to me! God said, Come and see him. When he saw him, he was greatly agitated, and fell upon his face, saying, Truly this is the Messiah, who shall cast me and idolaters into hell." <i>Yalcut</i> <i>Rubeni</i>, fol. 6. This is a very remarkable saying; and, as it might have existed in the time of our Lord, to it he might have alluded in the verse before us. The thing itself is true: the Messiah is the light of the world, and by him Satan's empire of idolatry is destroyed in the world, and the kingdom of light and life established. See several similar testimonies in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
