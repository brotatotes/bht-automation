<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:15">John 8:15</span>. <i><b>Ye judge after the flesh</b></i> â€” Because I appear in the form of <i>man</i>, judging from this appearance, ye think I am but a <i>mere</i> <i>man</i>-pay attention to my <i>teaching</i> and <i>miracles</i>, and ye shall then see that nothing less than infinite wisdom and unlimited power could teach and do what I have taught and performed. Our Lord speaks here exactly in the character of an ambassador. Such a person does not bring a <i>second</i> with him to vouch his truth; his <i>credentials</i> from his king ascertain his character: he represents the king's person. So our Lord represents the Father as bearing witness with him. The <i>miracles</i> which he wrought were the proof from heaven that he was the promised Messiah: these were the great seal of all his pretensions.</p>
