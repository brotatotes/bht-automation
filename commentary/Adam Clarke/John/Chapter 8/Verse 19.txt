<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:19">John 8:19</span>. <i><b>Ye neither know me</b></i>, c.] Ye know neither the Messiah, nor the God that sent him.</p>
<p><i><b>If ye had known me</b></i> â€” If ye had received my teaching, ye would have got such an acquaintance with the nature and attributes of God as ye never could have had, and never can have any other way. That is a true saying, <i>No man hath seen God at any time: the only</i> <i>begotten Son, who lay an the bosom of the Father. he hath DECLARED</i> <i>him</i>. The nature and perfections of God never can be properly known, but in the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is worthy of remark that, in all this discourse, our blessed Lord ever speaks of the Father and himself as two distinct persons. Therefore, the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, as some persons vainly imagine though it is plain enough that the completest unity and equality subsists between them.</p>
