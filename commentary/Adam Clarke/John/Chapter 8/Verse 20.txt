<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span>. <i><b>The treasury</b></i> — Lightfoot observes, from the rabbins, that the treasury was in what was called the <i>court of the</i> <i>women</i>-that there were thirteen chests in it; in the <i>thirteenth</i> only the women were permitted to put their offerings. Probably the other <i>twelve</i> were placed there in reference to the <i>twelve</i> tribes; each perhaps inscribed with the name of one of Jacob's <i>twelve</i> sons.</p>
<p>It seems that our Lord sometimes sat in this court to teach the people. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>His hour was not yet come.</b></i> — The time was not arrived, in which he had determined to give himself up into the hands of his crucifiers.</p>
