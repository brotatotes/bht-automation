Verse John 8:20. The treasury — Lightfoot observes, from the rabbins, that the treasury was in what was called the court of the women-that there were thirteen chests in it; in the thirteenth only the women were permitted to put their offerings. Probably the other twelve were placed there in reference to the twelve tribes; each perhaps inscribed with the name of one of Jacob's twelve sons.It seems that our Lord sometimes sat in this court to teach the people. See Mark 12:41, &c.His hour was not yet come. — The time was not arrived, in which he had determined to give himself up into the hands of his crucifiers.
