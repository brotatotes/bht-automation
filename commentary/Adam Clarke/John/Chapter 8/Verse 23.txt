<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Ye are from beneath</b></i> â€” Ye are capable of murder, and of self-murder too, because ye have nothing of God in you. Ye are altogether <i>earthly, sensual</i>, and <i>devilish</i>. They verified this character in murdering the Lord Jesus; and many of them afterwards, to escape famine, &amp;c., <i>put an end</i> to their own lives.</p>
