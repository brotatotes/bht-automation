<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Who art thou?</b></i> — This marks the indignation of the Pharisees-as if they had said: Who art thou that takest upon thee to deal out threatenings in this manner against us?</p>
<p><i><b>Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from</b></i> <i>the beginning.</i>] Rather, <i>Just what I have already told you</i>, i.e. that <i>I am the light of the world </i>- the Christ-the Saviour of mankind. There are a variety of renderings for this verse among the critics. Some consider την αρχην (which makes the principal difficulty in the text) as the answer of our Lord. <i>Who art thou</i>? I am την αρχην, <i>the chief, the supreme</i>; and have therefore a right to judge, and to execute judgment. But if our Lord had intended to convey this meaning, he would doubtless have said η αρχη, or ο αρχων, and not την αρχην, in the accusative case. This mode of reading appears to have been followed by the <i>Vulgate</i>, some copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and some of the <i>fathers</i>; but this construction can never be reconciled to the Greek text. Others take την αρχην as an <i>adverb</i>, in which sense it is repeatedly used by the best Greek writers; and, connecting the 25th with the 26th verse, they translate thus: <i>I have indeed, as I ASSURE ye, many things to say</i> <i>of you, and to condemn in you</i>. See <i>Wakefield</i>. <i>Raphelius</i> takes up the words nearly in the same way, and defends his mode of exposition with much critical learning; and to him I refer the reader. I have given it that meaning which I thought the most simple and plain, should any departure from our own version be thought necessary: both convey a good and consistent sense.</p>
