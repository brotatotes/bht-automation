<p>Verse 28. <i><b>When ye have lifted up</b></i> â€” When ye have crucified me, and thus filled up the measure of your iniquities, ye shall know that I am the <i>Christ</i>, by the signs that shall follow; and ye shall know that what I spoke is true, by the judgments that shall follow. <i>To</i> <i>be lifted up</i>, is a common mode of expression, among the Jewish writers, for <i>to die</i>, or <i>to be killed</i>.</p>
