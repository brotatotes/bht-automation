<p>Verse 29. <i><b>The Father hath not left me alone</b></i> â€” Though ye shalt have power to put me to death, yet this shall not be because he hath abandoned me. No-he is ever with me, because I do that which pleaseth him; and it is his pleasure that I should lay down my life for the salvation of the world. Does not our Lord allude to the following scriptures?-Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; my ears hast thou opened: (or, a body hast thou prepared me: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>:) then said I, Lo, I come: this is written in the volume of the book concerning me. I delight to do thy will, O my God! Thy law is in my heart. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6-8">Psalms 40:6-8</span>.</p>
