<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:3">John 8:3</span>. <i><b>A woman taken in adultery</b></i> â€” Some of the popish writers say that her name was <i>Susanna</i>; that she was espoused to an old decrepid man, named <i>Manasseh</i>; that she died a saint in Spain, whither she had followed St. <i>James</i>. These accounts the judicious Calmet properly terms <i>fables</i>.</p>
<p>It is allowed that adultery was exceedingly common at this time, so common that they had ceased to put the law in force against it. The waters of jealousy were no longer drunk, the culprits or those suspected of this crime, being so very numerous; and the men who were guilty themselves dared not try their suspected wives, as it was believed the waters would have no evil effect upon the wife, if the husband himself had been criminal. See the whole of the process on the waters of jealousy in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+5:14">Numbers 5:14</span>, c. and see at the <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+5:31">Numbers 5:31</span>. 18.</p>
