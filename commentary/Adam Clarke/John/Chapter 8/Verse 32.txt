<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Ye shall know the truth</b></i> — Shall have a constant <i>experimental knowledge</i> of its power and efficacy.</p>
<p><i><b>And the truth shall make you free.</b></i> — It was a maxim of the Jews, "That no man was free, but he who exercised himself in the meditation of the law." No man is truly free, but he in whose heart the power of sin is destroyed, and who has received the Spirit of adoption, through which he cries, Abba! Father! See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>. The <i>bondage</i> of <i>sin</i> is the most grievous bondage; and <i>freedom</i> from its guilt and influence is the greatest <i>liberty</i>.</p>
