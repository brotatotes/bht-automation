<p>Verse 33. <i><b>They answered</b></i> — That is, the other Jews who had not believed-the carping, cavilling Pharisees already mentioned; for the words cannot be spoken of the simple people who had already believed. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:30">John 8:30</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Were never in bondage to any man</b></i> — This assertion was not only false, but it was ridiculous in the extreme; seeing their whole history, sacred and profane, is full of recitals of their servitude in <i>Egypt</i>, in <i>Chaldea</i>, under the <i>Persians</i>, under the <i>Macedonians</i>, and under the <i>Romans</i>. But those who are not under the influence of the truth of God will speak and act according to the influence of the spirit of falsehood and error. If the words are to be restrained to themselves alone, they may be understood thus: We are Abraham's seed: and <i>we</i> were never in bondage. Both these propositions had a faint shadow of <i>truth</i>.</p>
