<p>Verse 35. <i><b>And the servant abideth not in the house</b></i> â€” Or, rather, <i>Now the slave abided not in the family</i>. As if Jesus had said: And now that I am speaking of a <i>slave</i>, I will add one thing more, viz. a slave has no <i>right</i> to any part of the <i>inheritance</i> in the family to which he belongs; but the <i>son</i>, the <i>legitimate</i> son, has a right. He can make any servant of the family free, though no slave can. He can divide or bestow the inheritance as he pleases. Our Lord seems here to refer to the sending away of Ishmael, mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:10-14">Genesis 21:10-14</span>. Only those who are genuine children can inherit the estate. If <i>sons</i>, then <i>heirs</i>: heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:21-31">Galatians 4:21-31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; and see Bishop Pearce's Paraphrase.</p>
