<p>Verse 37. <i><b>My word hath no place in you.</b></i> â€” Or, <i>this doctrine of</i> <i>mine hath no place to you</i>. Ye <i>hear</i> the truths of God, but ye do not <i>heed</i> them: the word of life has no influence over you; and how can it, when you seek to kill me because I proclaim this truth to you?</p>
<p>It is a dismal omen when a person is <i>regardless</i> of the truth of God: it is more so to be <i>provoked</i> against it: but to <i>persecute</i> and endeavour to <i>destroy</i> those who preach it is the last degree of perverseness and obduracy. The word of God requires a heart which is <i>empty</i>. A heart filled with earthly projects, carnal interests ambition, thoughts of raising a fortune, and with the love of the superfluities and pleasures of life, is not fit to receive the seed of the kingdom. When a man shuts his heart against it by his passions, he at the same time opens it to all sorts of crimes. QUESNEL.</p>
