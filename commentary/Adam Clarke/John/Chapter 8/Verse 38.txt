<p>Verse 38. <i><b>I speak that which I have seen</b></i> — I speak nothing but that unchangeable, eternal truth which I have received from the bosom of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye do that which ye have seen</b></i> — Instead of εωρακατε, <i>ye have</i> <i>seen</i>, I think we should read ηκουσατε, <i>ye have heard</i>, on the authority of BCKL, <i>fifteen</i> others; <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, <i>Gothic</i>, one copy of the <i>Itala; Origen,</i> <i>Cyril</i>, and <i>Chrysostom</i>. This reading, says Bishop Pearce, (who has adopted it,) seems preferable to the other, because it could not be said, with the same propriety, that the Jews had <i>seen</i> any thing with their father the devil, as it could that Jesus had <i>seen</i> with his.</p>
<p>Jesus <i>saw</i> the Father, for he was the WORD that was with God from eternity. The Jews did not <i>see</i>, they only <i>felt</i> and <i>heard</i>, their father the devil. It is the interest of Satan to keep himself out of sight, and to work in the dark.</p>
