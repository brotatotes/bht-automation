<p>Verse 39. <i><b>If ye were Abraham's children</b></i> — <i>Griesbach</i> reads εστε, <i>ye are</i>, instead of ητε, <i>ye were</i>, on the authority of BDL, <i>Vulgate, four</i> copies of the <i>Itala; Origen</i> and <i>Augustin</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye would do the works of Abraham.</b></i> — As the son has the nature of his father in him, and naturally imitates him, so, if ye were the children of Abraham, ye would imitate him in his faith, obedience, and uprightness; but this ye do not, for ye seek to kill me-ye are watching for an opportunity to destroy me, merely because I tell you the truth: Abraham never did any thing like this; therefore, you have no spiritual relationship to <i>him</i>.</p>
