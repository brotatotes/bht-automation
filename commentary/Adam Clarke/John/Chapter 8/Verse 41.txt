<p>Verse 41. <i><b>Ye do the deeds of your father.</b></i> — You have certainly another father than Abraham-one who has instilled his own malignant nature into you; and, as ye seek to murder me for telling you the truth, ye must be the offspring of him who was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>We be not born of fornication</b></i> — We are not a mixed, spurious breed-our tribes and families have been kept distinct-we are descended from Abraham by his legal wife Sarah; and we are no <i>idolaters</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>We have one Father</b></i>, even <i>God.</i>] In the spiritual sense of <i>father</i> and <i>son</i>, we are not a spurious, that is, an <i>idolatrous</i> race; because we acknowledge none as our spiritual father, and worship none as such, but the true God. See Bishop <i>Pearce</i>.</p>
