<p>Verse 43. <i><b>Why do ye not understand my speech?</b></i> — την λαλιαν την εμην, <i>This my mode of speaking </i>- when illustrating spiritual by natural things: λαλια refers to the manner of speaking; λογος, to the matter or subject on which he spoke. For λαλιαν, the <i>Codex</i> <i>Bezae</i> had originally αληθειαν: <i>why do ye not acknowledge this</i> <i>TRUTH of mine</i>? A few other MSS. agree in this reading.</p>
<p><i><b>Because ye cannot hear my word.</b></i> — That is, ye cannot bear my doctrine: it comes too close to you; it searches your hearts, detects your hypocrisy, and exposes your iniquitous intentions and designs; and as ye are determined not to leave your sins, so ye are purposed not to hear my doctrine.</p>
