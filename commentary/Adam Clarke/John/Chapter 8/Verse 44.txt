<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Ye are of your father the devil</b></i> — Ye are the seed of the old serpent. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37">John 8:37</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The lusts of your father</b></i> — Like father like son. What Satan desires, ye desire; because ye are filled with his nature. Awful state of unregenerate men! They have the nearest alliance to Satan; they partake of his nature and have in them the same principles and propensities which characterize the very nature and essence of the devil! Reader, canst thou rest in this state? Apply to God, through Christ, that thou mayest be born again.</p>
<p><i><b>He was a murderer from the beginning</b></i> — It was through him that Adam transgressed; in consequence of which <i>death</i> entered into the world, and slew him and all his posterity. This was the sentiment of the Jews themselves. In <i>Sohar Kadash</i>, the wicked are called, "The children of the old serpent, who slew Adam and all his descendants." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Abode not in the truth</b></i> — <i>He stood not in the truth</i>-was once in a state of glorious felicity, but fell from it; and, being deprived of all good himself, he could not endure that others should enjoy any; therefore by his lies he deceived Eve, and brought her, her husband, and, through them, their posterity, into his own condemnation.</p>
<p><i><b>He speaketh of his own</b></i> — εκ των ιδιων λαλει, <i>He speaketh of his</i> <i>own offspring</i>, or, <i>from his own disposition</i>, for he is the father and fountain of all error and falsity; and all who are deceived by him, and partake of his disposition, <i>falsity</i> and <i>cruelty</i>, are his offspring, <i>for he is a liar, and the father of it</i>-καιοπατηρ αυτου-literally, <i>his father also</i>. There is considerable difficulty in this verse. The <i>Cainites</i>, and the <i>Archontites</i>, mentioned by Epiphanius, read it thus: "Ye are the children of your father the devil, because he is a liar, and <i>his father was a liar</i>. He was a man-slayer, and he did not remain in the truth. When he speaketh, he speaketh a lie of his own, (<i>progenitors</i> understood,) because his father also was a liar." The consequences which the above heretics drew from this verse were the following. They said that the father of the Jews was a demon; that he also had a demon for his father; and that he had a demon for his father, c. The Archontites maintained that Cain had a demon for his father, the spirit which our Lord speaks of here and that the Jews proceeded from the race of Cain.</p>
<p>Grotius, supposing that the devil who tempted Eve was not the <i>prince</i> of devils, but rather a <i>subordinate</i> one, seems to think he may be understood here, <i>he is a liar, and his father also</i>, which is the literal translation of the latter clause of the text, ωςκαιοπατηραυτου, as it has been read by many of the primitive fathers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wakefield, by changing το, before ψευδος, into τις, gives the text the following translation:- "The devil is your father, and ye willingly perform the lusts of your father. He was a man-slayer from the first, and continued not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When ANY ONE speaketh a lie, he speaketh according to his own kindred: for his father also is a liar." Our own translation, that refers πατηρ αυτου to ψευδος, a <i>lie</i>, and not to ψευστης, a <i>liar</i>, is probably the most correct.</p>
