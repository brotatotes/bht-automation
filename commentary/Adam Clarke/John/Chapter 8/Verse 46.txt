<p>Verse 46. <i><b>Which of you convinceth me of sin?</b></i> — Do you pretend to reject the truths which I announce, because my life does not correspond to the doctrines I have taught? But can any of you prove me guilty of any fault? You have maliciously watched all my steps; have you seen the smallest matter to reprove, in any part of my conduct?</p>
<p>But it is probable that αμαρτια, <i>sin</i>, is put here in opposition to αληθεια, <i>truth</i>, in the same verse, and then it should be rendered <i>falsehood</i>. The very best Greek writers use the word in the same sense: this, KYPKE proves by quotations from <i>Polybius,</i> <i>Lucian, Dionysius Halicarnassensis, Plutarch, Thucydides</i>, and <i>Hippocrates</i>. RAPHELIUS adds a pertinent quotation from <i>Herodotus</i>, and shows that the purest Latin writers have used the word <i>peccatum</i>, sin, in the sense of <i>error</i> or <i>falsehood</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:13">Genesis 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:13">Genesis 13:13</span></span>.</p>
