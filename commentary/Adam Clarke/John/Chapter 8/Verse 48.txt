Verse 48. Thou art a Samaritan — This was the same, among them, as heretic, or schismatic, among us. This is the only time in which the Jews gave our Lord this title of reproach; and they probably grounded it on his having preached among them, and lodged in their villages. See the account in John 4:39-40; but Samaritan, among them, meant a person unworthy of any credit.Hast a devil? — Art possessed by an evil spirit; and art, in consequence, deranged.
