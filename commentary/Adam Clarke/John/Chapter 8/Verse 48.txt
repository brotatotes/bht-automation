<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Thou art a Samaritan</b></i> — This was the same, among them, as <i>heretic</i>, or <i>schismatic</i>, among us. This is the only time in which the Jews gave our Lord this title of reproach; and they probably grounded it on his having preached among them, and lodged in their villages. See the account in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:39-40">John 4:39-40</span>; but Samaritan, among them, meant a person unworthy of any credit.</p>
<p><i><b>Hast a devil?</b></i> — Art possessed by an evil spirit; and art, in consequence, deranged.</p>
