<p>Verse 49. <i><b>I have not a devil</b></i> â€” The first part of the charge was too futile: if taken literally, it was both absurd and impossible; they did not believe it themselves, and therefore our Lord does not stop a moment to refute it; but he answers to the second with the utmost meekness and conclusiveness: <i>I honour God</i>. This is what no demon can do, nor any man who is under such influence.</p>
