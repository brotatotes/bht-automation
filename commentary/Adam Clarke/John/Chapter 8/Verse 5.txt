<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:5">John 8:5</span>. <i><b>That such should be stoned</b></i> â€” It is not strictly true that Moses ordered adultery in general to be punished by <i>stoning</i>. The law simply says that <i>the adulterer and the adulteress shall be</i> <i>put to death</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+20:10">Leviticus 20:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+22:22">Deuteronomy 22:22</span>. The rabbins say they were <i>strangled</i>. This they affirm was the ordinary mode of punishment, where the species of death was not marked in the law, If the person guilty of an act of this kind had been <i>betrothed</i>, but not married, she was to be <i>stoned</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23">Deuteronomy 22:23</span>. But if she was the daughter of a priest, she was to be <i>burned alive</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+16:9">Leviticus 16:9</span>. It appears, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:38">Ezekiel 16:38</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:40">Ezekiel 16:40</span>, that adulteresses in the time of that prophet were stoned, and pierced with a sword.</p>
<p><i>Selden</i> and <i>Fagius</i> suppose that this woman's case was the same with that mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23">Deuteronomy 22:23</span>. <i>If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto a husband, and a</i> <i>man find her in the city, and lie with her; then ye shall stone</i> <i>them with stones that they die, the damsel because she cried not,</i> <i>and the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife</i>. As the Pharisees spoke of stoning the woman, it is possible this was her case; and some suppose that the apparent indulgence with which our Lord treated her insinuates that she had suffered some sort of violence, though not entirely innocent. Therefore he said, <i>I do</i> <i>not condemn thee</i>, i.e. to <i>death</i>, because <i>violence</i> had been used. <i>Sin no more</i>. Nevertheless thou art in certain respects <i>guilty</i>; thou mightest have made more <i>resistance</i>.</p>
