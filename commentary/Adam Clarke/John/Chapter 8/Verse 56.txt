<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>. <i><b>Abraham rejoiced to see my day</b></i> — Or, <i>he earnestly</i> <i>desired to see my day</i>; ηγαλλιασατο, from αγαν, <i>very much</i>, and αλλομαι, <i>I leap </i>- his soul leaped forward in earnest hope and strong expectation that he might see the incarnation of Jesus Christ. The metaphor appears to be taken from a person who, desiring to see a long-expected friend who is <i>coming, runs</i> <i>forward</i>, now and then <i>jumping up</i> to see if he can discover him. There is a saying very like this in <i>Sohar Numer</i> fol. 61: "Abraham rejoiced because he could know, and perceive, and cleave to the <i>Divine</i> NAME." The Divine name is יהוה <i>Yehovah</i>; and by this they simply mean God himself.</p>
<p><i><b>And he saw it</b></i> — Not only in the first promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, for the other patriarchs saw this as well as he; and not only in that promise which was made particularly to himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:7">Genesis 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:18">Genesis 22:18</span>, (compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>,) that the Messiah should spring from his family; but he saw this day especially when Jehovah appeared to him in a <i>human form</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:2">Genesis 18:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:17">Genesis 18:17</span>, which many suppose to have been a manifestation of the Lord Jesus.</p>
