<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:57">John 8:57</span>. <i><b>Thou art not yet fifty years old</b></i> â€” Some MSS. read <i>forty</i>. The age of our blessed Lord has never been properly determined. Some of the primitive fathers believed that he was <i>fifty</i> years old when he was crucified; but their foundation, which is no other than these words of the Jews, is but a very uncertain one. Calmet thinks that our Lord was at this time about <i>thirty-four years</i> and <i>ten months</i> old, and that he was crucified about the middle of his <i>thirty-sixth</i> year; and asserts that the vulgar era is <i>three years</i> too late. On the other hand, some allow him to have been but <i>thirty-one</i> years old, and that his ministry had lasted but <i>one</i> year. Many opinions on this subject, which are scarcely worthy of being copied, may be found in Calmet.</p>
