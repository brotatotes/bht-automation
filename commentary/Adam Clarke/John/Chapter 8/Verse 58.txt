<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>. <i><b>Before Abraham was, I am.</b></i> — The following is a literal translation of Calmet's note on this passage:-"I am from all eternity. I have existed before all ages. You consider in me only the person who speaks to you, and who has appeared to you within a particular time. But besides this human nature, which ye think ye know, there is in me a Divine and eternal nature. Both, united, subsist together in my person. Abraham knew how to distinguish them. He adored me as his God; and desired me as his Saviour. He has seen me in my eternity, and he predicted my coming into the world."</p>
<p>On the same verse Bishop <i>Pearce</i> speaks as follows:- "What Jesus here says relates (I think) to his existence antecedent to Abraham's days, and not to his having been <i>the Christ</i> appointed and foretold before that time; for, if Jesus had meant this, the answer I apprehend would not have been a pertinent one. He might have been appointed and foretold for <i>the Christ</i>; but if he had not had an existence <i>before</i> Abraham's days, neither could he have <i>seen</i> <i>Abraham</i>, (as, according to our English translation, the Jews suppose him to have said,) nor could Abraham have <i>seen him</i>, as I suppose the Jews understood him to have said in the preceding verse, to which words of the Jews the words of Jesus here are intended as an answer."</p>
