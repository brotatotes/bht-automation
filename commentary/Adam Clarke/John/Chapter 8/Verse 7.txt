<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:7">John 8:7</span>. <i><b>He that is without sin</b></i> — αναμαρτητος, meaning the same kind of sin, adultery, fornication, c. Kypke has largely proved that the verb αμαρτανειν is used in this sense by the best Greek writers.</p>
<p><i><b>Let him first cast a stone at her.</b></i> — Or, <i>upon her</i>, επ αυτη. The Jewish method of stoning, according to the rabbins, was as follows: The culprit, half naked, the hands tied behind the back, was placed on a scaffold, ten or twelve feet high the witnesses, who stood with her, pushed her off with great force: if she was killed by the fall there was nothing farther done; but, if she was not, one of the witnesses took up a very large stone, and dashed it upon her breast, which generally was the <i>coup de grace</i>, or finishing stroke. This mode of punishment seems referred to, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>. However, this procedure does not appear to have been always attended to. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+24:16">Leviticus 24:16</span>, and ver. 59 of this chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span></p>
