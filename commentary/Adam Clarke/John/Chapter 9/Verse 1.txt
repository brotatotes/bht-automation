Verse John 9:1. And as Jesus passed by — This chapter is a continuation of the preceding, and therefore the word Jesus is not in the Greek text: it begins simply thus - And passing along, και παραγων, &c. Having left the temple, where the Jews were going to stone him, (John 8:59,) it is probable our Lord went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives. The next day, which was the Sabbath, John 9:14, he met a man who had been born blind, sitting in some public place, and asking alms from those who passed by, John 9:8.
