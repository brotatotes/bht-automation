<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:11">John 9:11</span>. <i><b>A man that is called Jesus</b></i> â€” The whole of this relation is simple and artless in the highest degree. The blind man had never <i>seen</i> Jesus, but he had <i>heard</i> of his name - he <i>felt</i> that he had put something on his eyes, which he afterwards found to be <i>clay </i> - but how this was made he could not tell, because he could <i>not see</i> Jesus when he did it; therefore he does not say, <i>he made</i> <i>clay of spittle </i>- but simply, <i>he made clay, and spread it upon my</i> <i>eyes</i>. Where a multitude of incidents must necessarily come into review, <i>imposture</i> and <i>falsehood</i> generally <i>commit themselves</i>, as it is termed; but, however numerous the <i>circumstances</i> may be in a relation of fact, simple <i>truth</i> is never embarrassed.</p>
