<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:17">John 9:17</span>. <i><b>He is a prophet.</b></i> â€” They had intended to lay snares for the poor man, that, getting him to acknowledge Christ for the Messiah, they might put him out of the synagogue, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:22">John 9:22</span>, or put him to death, that such a witness to the Divine power of Christ might not appear against them. But, as the <i>mercy</i> of God had given him his <i>sight</i>, so the <i>wisdom</i> of God taught him how to escape the snares laid for his ruin. <i>On all thy glory there shall be a</i> <i>defense</i>, says the prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:5">Isaiah 4:5</span>. When God gives any particular mercy or grace, he sends <i>power</i> to <i>preserve</i> it, and <i>wisdom</i> to <i>improve</i> it. The man said, <i>He is a prophet</i>. Now, according to a Jewish maxim, <i>a prophet might dispense with the observation of the</i> <i>Sabbath</i>. See <i>Grotius</i>. If they allow that Jesus was a <i>prophet</i>, then, even in their sense, he might break the law of the Sabbath, and be guiltless: or, if they did not allow him to be a prophet, they must account for the miracle some other way than by the power of God; as from Satan or his agents no good can proceed - to do this it was impossible. So the wisdom of God taught the poor man to give them such an answer as put them into a complete dilemma, from which they could not possibly extricate themselves.</p>
