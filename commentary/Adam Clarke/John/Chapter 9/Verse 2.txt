<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:2">John 9:2</span>. <i><b>Who did sin, this man, or his parents</b></i> â€” The doctrine of the transmigration of souls appears to have been an article in the creed of the Pharisees, and it was pretty general both among the Greeks and the Asiatics. The <i>Pythagoreans</i> believed the souls of men were sent into other bodies for the punishment of some sin which they had committed in a <i>pre-existent</i> state. This seems to have been the foundation of the disciples question to our Lord. Did this man sin in a <i>pre-existent state</i>, that he is punished in this body with blindness? Or, did his parents commit some sin, for which they are thus plagued in their offspring?</p>
<p>Most of the <i>Asiatic</i> nations have believed in the doctrine of transmigration. The <i>Hindoos</i> still hold it; and profess to tell precisely the <i>sin</i> which the person committed in another body, by the <i>afflictions</i> which he endures in this: they profess also to tell the cures for these. For instance, they say the <i>headache</i> is a punishment for having, in a former state, spoken <i>irrevently</i> to <i>father</i> or <i>mother</i>. <i>Madness</i> is a punishment for having been <i>disobedient</i> to father or mother, or to one's spiritual guide. The <i>epilepsy</i> is a punishment for having, in a former state, administered <i>poison</i> to any one at the command of his master. <i>Pain</i> in the <i>eyes</i> is a punishment for having, in another body, <i>coveted</i> another <i>man's wife</i>. <i>Blindness</i> is a punishment for having <i>killed</i> his <i>mother</i>: but this person they say, before his <i>new birth</i>, will suffer many years' torment in hell. See many curious particulars relative to this in the AYEEN AKBERY, vol. iii. p. 168-175; and in the Institutes of Menu, chap. xi. Inst. 48-53.</p>
<p>The Jewish rabbins have had the same belief from the very remotest antiquity. <i>Origen</i> cites an apocryphal book of the Hebrews, in which the patriarch Jacob is made to speak thus: <i>I am</i> <i>an angel of God; one of the first order of spirits. Men call me</i> <i>Jacob, but my true name, which God has given me, is Israel</i>: <i>Orat.</i> <i>Joseph</i>. apud ORIG. Many of the Jewish doctors have believed that the souls of <i>Adam, Abraham</i>, and <i>Phineas</i>, have successively animated the great men of their nation. <i>Philo</i> says <i>that the air is</i> <i>full of spirits</i>, and <i>that some, through their natural propensity,</i> <i>join themselves to bodies</i>; and <i>that others have an aversion from</i> <i>such a union</i>. See several other things relative to this point in his treatises, <i>De Plant. Noe-De Gigantibus-De Confus. Ling.-De</i> <i>Somniis</i>, c. and see <i>Calmet</i>, where he is pretty largely quoted.</p>
<p>The Hindoos believe that the most of their misfortunes arise out of the sins of a <i>former birth</i>; and, in moments of grief not unfrequently break out into exclamations like the following:-"Ah! in a former birth how many sins must I have committed, that I am thus afflicted!" "I am now suffering for the sins of a former birth; and the sins that I am now committing are to fill me with misery in a following birth. There is no end to my sufferings!"</p>
<p>Josephus, Ant. b. xvii. c. 1, s. 3, and War, b. ii. c. 8, s. 14, gives an account of the doctrine of the Pharisees on this subject. He intimates that the souls of those only who were <i>pious</i> were permitted to reanimate human bodies, and this was rather by way of <i>reward</i> than <i>punishment</i>; and that the souls of the vicious are put into eternal prisons, where they are continually tormented, and out of which they can never escape. But it is very likely that Josephus has not told the <i>whole truth</i> here; and that the doctrine of the Pharisees on this subject was nearly the same with that of the Papists on <i>purgatory</i>. Those who are very wicked go irrecoverably to hell; but those who are not so have the privilege of expiating their venial sins in purgatory. Thus, probably, is the Pharisean doctrine of the transmigration to be understood. Those who were comparatively pious went into other bodies, for the expiation of any remaining guilt which had not been removed previously to a <i>sudden</i> or <i>premature</i> death, after which they were fully prepared for paradise; but others who had been incorrigibly wicked were sent at once into hell, without ever being offered the privilege of <i>amendment</i>, or <i>escape</i>. For the reasons which may be collected above, much as I reverence Bishop Pearce, I cannot agree with his note on this passage, where he says that the words of the disciples should be thus understood:-Who did sin? This man, that he <i>is</i> blind? or his parents, that he <i>was born</i> so? He thinks it probable that the disciples did <i>not know</i> that the man was born blind: if he was, then it was for some sin of his <i>parents</i>-if he was not <i>born</i> so, then this blindness <i>came</i> unto him as a punishment for some crime of <i>his own</i>. It may be just necessary to say, that some of the rabbins believed <i>that it was possible for an infant to</i> <i>sin in the womb, and to be punished with some bodily infirmity in</i> <i>consequence</i>. See several examples in <i>Lightfoot</i> on this place.</p>
