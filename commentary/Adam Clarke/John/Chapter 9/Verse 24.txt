<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Give God the praise</b></i> â€” Having called the man a <i>second</i> time, they proceeded to deal with him in the most solemn manner; and therefore they put him to his <i>oath</i>; for the words above were the form of an oath, proposed by the chief magistrate to those who were to give evidence to any particular fact, or to attest any thing, as produced by or belonging to the Lord. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+7:19">Joshua 7:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+6:5">1 Samuel 6:5</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:18">Luke 17:18</span>. But, while they solemnly put him to his oath, they endeavoured to put their own words in his mouth, viz. <i>he is a sinner</i>-a pretender to the prophetic character, and a transgressor of the law of God:- assert this, or you will not please us.</p>
