<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Then they reviled him</b></i> — ελοιδορησαν. <i>Eustathius</i> derives λοιδορια from λογος, <i>a word</i>, and δορυ, <i>a</i> <i>spear</i>:- they spoke <i>cutting, piercing</i> words. Solomon talks of some who <i>spoke like the piercings of a sword</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+12:18">Proverbs 12:18</span>. And the psalmist speaks of <i>words that are like drawn swords</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:21">Psalms 55:21</span>, words which show that the person who speaks them has his heart full of murderous intentions; and that, if he had the same power with a sword as he has with his tongue, he would destroy him whom he thus reproaches.</p>
<p><i><b>We are Moses' disciples.</b></i> — By this they meant that they were genuine <i>Pharisees</i>; for they did not allow the <i>Sadducees</i> to be disciples of Moses.</p>
