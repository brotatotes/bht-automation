Verse 28. Then they reviled him — ελοιδορησαν. Eustathius derives λοιδορια from λογος, a word, and δορυ, a spear:- they spoke cutting, piercing words. Solomon talks of some who spoke like the piercings of a sword, Proverbs 12:18. And the psalmist speaks of words that are like drawn swords, Psalms 55:21, words which show that the person who speaks them has his heart full of murderous intentions; and that, if he had the same power with a sword as he has with his tongue, he would destroy him whom he thus reproaches.We are Moses' disciples. — By this they meant that they were genuine Pharisees; for they did not allow the Sadducees to be disciples of Moses.
