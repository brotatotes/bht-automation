<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:3">John 9:3</span>. <i><b>Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents</b></i> â€” That is, the blindness of this person is not occasioned by any sin of his own, nor of his parents, but has happened in the ordinary course of Divine providence, and shall now become the instrument of salvation to <i>his</i> soul, edification to <i>others</i>, and glory to GOD. Many of the Jews thought that marks on the body were proofs of sin in the soul. From a like persuasion, probably arose that proverb among our northern neighbours - <i>Mark him whom God marks</i>.</p>
