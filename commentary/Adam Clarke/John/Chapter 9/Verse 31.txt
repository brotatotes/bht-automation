<p>Verse 31. <i><b>God heareth not sinners</b></i> — I believe the word αμαρτωλων signifies <i>heathens</i>, or persons not proselyted to the Jewish religion; and therefore it is put in opposition to θεοσεβης, <i>a</i> <i>worshipper of the true God</i>. See the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37">Luke 7:37</span>. But in what sense may it be said, following our common version, that <i>God</i> <i>heareth not sinners</i>? When they regard iniquity in their heart-when they wish to be saved, and yet abide in their sins-when they will not separate themselves from the workers and works of iniquity. In all these cases, <i>God heareth not sinners</i>.</p>
