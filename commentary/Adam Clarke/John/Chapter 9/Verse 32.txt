<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Since the world began</b></i> — εκ του αιωνος, <i>From the</i> <i>age </i>- probably meaning from the commencement of time. Neither Moses nor the prophets have ever opened the eyes of a man who was born blind: if this person then were not the best of beings, would God grant him a privilege which he has hitherto denied to his choicest favourites?</p>
<p><i><b>Opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</b></i> — It will readily appear that our Lord performed no surgical operation in this cure: the man was born blind, and he was restored to sight by the power of God; the simple means used could have had no effect in the cure; the miracle is therefore complete. That there are cases, in which a person who was born blind may be restored to sight by <i>surgical means</i>, we know: but no such means were used by Christ: and it is worthy of remark that, from the foundation of the world, no person <i>born blind</i> has been restored to sight, even by surgical operation, till about the year of our Lord, 1728; when the celebrated Dr. Cheselden, by couching the eyes of a young man, 14 years of age, who had been born blind, restored him to perfect soundness. This was the effect of well directed surgery: that performed by Christ was a miracle.</p>
