<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Thou wast altogether born in sins</b></i> — Thou hast not only been a vile wretch in some other pre-existent state, but thy parents also have been grossly iniquitous; therefore thou and they are punished by this blindness: Thou wast altogether born in sins-thou art no other than a sinful lump of deformity, and utterly unfit to have any connection with those who worship God.</p>
<p><i><b>And they cast him out.</b></i> — They immediately <i>excommunicated</i> him, as the <i>margin</i> properly reads-drove him from their assembly with disdain, and forbade his farther appearing in the worship of God. Thus a simple man, guided by the Spirit of truth, and continuing steady in his testimony, utterly confounded the most eminent Jewish doctors. When they had no longer either reason or argument to oppose to him, as a proof of their discomfiture and a monument of their reproach and shame, they had recourse to the <i>secular arm</i>, and thus silenced by political power a person whom they had neither <i>reason</i> nor <i>religion</i> to withstand. They have had since many followers in their crimes. A false religion, supported by the state, has, by <i>fire</i> and <i>sword</i> silenced those whose <i>truth</i> in the end annihilated the system of their opponents.</p>
