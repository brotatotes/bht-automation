<p>Verse 39. <i><b>For judgment I am come</b></i> â€” I am come to manifest and execute the just judgment of God:</p>
<p>1. By giving <i>sight</i> to the <i>blind</i>, and <i>light</i> to the <i>Gentiles</i> who sit in darkness.</p>
<p>2. By removing the true light from those who, pretending to make a proper use of it, only abuse the mercy of God.</p>
<p>In a word, <i>salvation</i> shall be taken away from the <i>Jews</i>, because they <i>reject</i> it; and the <i>kingdom of God</i> shall be given to the <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
