Verse 39. For judgment I am come â€” I am come to manifest and execute the just judgment of God:1. By giving sight to the blind, and light to the Gentiles who sit in darkness.2. By removing the true light from those who, pretending to make a proper use of it, only abuse the mercy of God.In a word, salvation shall be taken away from the Jews, because they reject it; and the kingdom of God shall be given to the Gentiles.
