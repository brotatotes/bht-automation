<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span>. <i><b>While it is day</b></i> â€” Though I plainly perceive that the cure of this man will draw down upon me the malice of the Jewish rulers, yet I must accomplish the work for which I came into the world whole it is day-while the term of this life of mine shall last.

By this we are taught that no opportunity for doing good should be omitted - DAY representing the <i>opportunity</i>: NIGHT, the loss of that <i>opportunity</i>.</p>
