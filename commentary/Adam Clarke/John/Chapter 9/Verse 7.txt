<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:7">John 9:7</span>. <i><b>Siloam</b></i> — Called also <i>Shiloah, Silos</i>, or <i>Siloa</i>, was a fountain under the walls of Jerusalem, towards the east, between the city and the brook <i>Kidron</i>. <i>Calmet</i> thinks that this was the same with <i>En-rogel</i>, or the <i>fuller's fountain</i>, which is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:7">Joshua 15:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+18:16">Joshua 18:16</span>; in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+17:17">2 Samuel 17:17</span>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+1:9">1 Kings 1:9</span>. Its waters were collected in a great reservoir for the use of the city; and a stream from it supplied the pool of Bethesda.</p>
<p><i><b>By interpretation, SENT.</b></i> — From the Hebrew שלח <i>shalach, he sent</i>: either because it was looked upon as a gift <i>sent</i> from God, for the use of the city; or because its waters were <i>directed</i> or <i>sent</i> by canals or pipes, into different quarters, for the same purpose. Some think there is an allusion here to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>; that this fountain was a <i>type</i> of <i>Shiloh</i>, the Christ, the SENT <i>of God</i>; and that it was to direct the man's mind to the accomplishment of the above prophecy that our Lord sent him to this fountain. This supposition does not appear very solid. The Turks have this fountain still in great veneration, and think the waters of it are good for diseases of the eyes. Lightfoot says that the spring of Siloam discharged itself by a double stream into a twofold pool-the upper was called שילוח <i>shiloach </i>- the lower, שלח <i>shelach</i>; the one signifying απεσταλμενος, <i>sent</i>, the latter, κωδιων <i>fleeces</i>; and that our Lord marked this point so particularly, to inform the blind man that it was not to Shelach, but to Shiloach, that he must go to wash his eyes. These two pools seem to be referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:23">Isaiah 7:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+22:9">Isaiah 22:9</span>.</p>
