<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:8">John 9:8</span>. <i><b>That he was blind</b></i> — Ὁτι τυφλος ην: but, instead of this, προσαιτης, <i>when he begged</i>, or <i>was a beggar</i>, is the reading of ABC*DKL, <i>seven</i> others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, both the <i>Arabic</i>, later <i>Persic, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Sahidic, Gothic,</i> <i>Slavonic, Vulgate</i>, eight copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and some of the primitive fathers. This is in all probability the true reading, and is received by <i>Griesbach</i> into the text.</p>
<p>Beggars in all countries have a language peculiar to themselves. The language of the Jewish beggars was the following: זבי כי <i>Deserve something by me </i>- Give me something that God may reward you. רכי ני זכי גר מך <i>O ye tender-hearted, do yourselves good by</i> <i>me</i>. Another form, which seems to have been used by such as had formerly been in better circumstances, was this: סכי כי מה הוינא אסתכל בי מה אנא <i>Look back and see what I have</i> <i>been; look upon me</i> <i>now, and see what I am</i>. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
