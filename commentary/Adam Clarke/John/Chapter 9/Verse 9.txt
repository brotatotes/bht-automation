<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:9">John 9:9</span>. <i><b>Some said, This is he</b></i> — This miracle was not wrought in <i>private</i>-nor before a <i>few</i> persons - nor was it <i>lightly</i> credited. Those who knew him before were divided in their opinion concerning him: not whether the man who sat there begging was blind <i>before </i>- for this was known to all; nor, whether the person now before them saw clearly - for this was now notorious; but whether <i>this was the person</i> who was born blind, and who used in a particular place to sit begging.</p>
<p><i><b>Others</b></i><b> said, </b><i><b>He is like him</b></i> — This was very natural: for certainly the restoration of his sight must have given him a very different appearance to what he had before.</p>
