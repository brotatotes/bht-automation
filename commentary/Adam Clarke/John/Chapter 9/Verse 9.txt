Verse John 9:9. Some said, This is he — This miracle was not wrought in private-nor before a few persons - nor was it lightly credited. Those who knew him before were divided in their opinion concerning him: not whether the man who sat there begging was blind before - for this was known to all; nor, whether the person now before them saw clearly - for this was now notorious; but whether this was the person who was born blind, and who used in a particular place to sit begging.Others said, He is like him — This was very natural: for certainly the restoration of his sight must have given him a very different appearance to what he had before.
