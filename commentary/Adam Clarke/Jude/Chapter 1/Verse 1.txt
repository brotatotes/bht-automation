<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:1">Jude 1:1</span>. <i><b>Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ</b></i> — Probably Jude the apostle, who was surnamed <i>Thaddeus</i> and <i>Lebbeus</i>, was son to <i>Alpheus</i>, and brother to <i>James the less, Joses</i>, and <i>Simon</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>, and collate with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16">Luke 6:16</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span>. See the <i>preface</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Brother of James</b></i> — Supposed to be <i>James the less</i>, bishop of Jerusalem, mentioned here, because he was an eminent person in the Church. See the preface to St. James.</p>
<p><i><b>To them that are sanctified by God</b></i> — Instead of ηγιασμενοις, <i>to</i> <i>the sanctified</i>, AB, several others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic, Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, AEthiopic</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>, with several of the <i>fathers</i>, have ηγαπημενοις, <i>to them that are</i> <i>beloved</i>; and before εν τω θεω, <i>in God</i>, some MSS., with the <i>Syriac</i> and <i>Armenian</i>, have εθνεσιν, <i>to the Gentiles, in God the</i> <i>Father</i>: but although the first is only a <i>probable</i> reading, this is much less so. St. Jude writes to <i>all believers</i> everywhere, and not to any particular Church; hence this epistle has been called a <i>general</i> epistle.</p>
<p><i>Sanctified</i> signifies here <i>consecrated to God</i> through faith in Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Preserved in</b></i><b> (or </b><i><b>by</b></i><b>) </b><i><b>Jesus Christ</b></i> — Signifies those who continued unshaken in the Christian faith; and implies also, that none can be preserved in the faith that do not continue in union with Christ, by whose grace alone they can be <i>preserved</i> and <i>called</i>. This should be read consecutively with the other epithets, and should be rather, in a translation, read first than last, <i>to the saints in God the Father, called and preserved by</i> <i>Christ Jesus</i>. <i>Saints</i> is the same as <i>Christians</i>; to become such they were <i>called</i> to believe in Christ by the preaching of the Gospel, and having believed, were <i>preserved</i> by the grace of Christ in the life and practice of piety.</p>
