<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:10">Jude 1:10</span>. <i><b>Speak evil of those things which they know not</b></i> — They do not understand the origin and utility of civil government; they revile that which ever protects their own persons and their property. This is true in most insurrections and seditions.</p>
<p><i><b>But what they know naturally</b></i> — They are destitute of reflection; their minds are uncultivated; they follow <i>mere natural</i> <i>instinct</i>, and are slaves to their animal propensities.</p>
<p><i><b>As brute beasts</b></i> — Ὡς τα αλογα ζωα· Like the irrational animals; but, in the indulgence of their animal propensities, <i>they</i> <i>corrupt themselves</i>, beyond the example of the brute beasts. A fearful description; and true of many in the present day.</p>
