<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:11">Jude 1:11</span>. <i><b>They have gone in the way of Cain</b></i> — They are <i>haters</i> <i>of their brethren</i>, and they that are such are <i>murderers</i>; and by their false doctrine they corrupt and destroy the souls of the people.</p>
<p><i><b>The error of Balaam</b></i> — For the sake of gain they corrupt the word of God and refine away its meaning, and let it down so as to suit the <i>passions</i> of the profligate. This was literally true of the <i>Nicolaitans</i>, who taught most impure doctrines, and followed the most lascivious practices.</p>
<p><i><b>Gainsaying of Core.</b></i> — See the account of the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and their company, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:0">Numbers 22:0</span>. It appears that these persons <i>opposed the authority of the apostles</i> of our Lord, as Korah and his associates did that of <i>Moses and</i> <i>Aaron</i>; and St. Jude predicts them a similar punishment. In this verse he accuses them of murder, covetousness, and rebellion against the authority of God.</p>
