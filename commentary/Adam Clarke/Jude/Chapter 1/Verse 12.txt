<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:12">Jude 1:12</span>. <i><b>Spots in your feasts of charity</b></i> — It appears that these persons, unholy and impure as they were, still continued to have outward fellowship with the Church! This is strange: but it is very likely that their power and influence in that place had swallowed up, or set aside, the power and authority of the real ministers of Christ; a very common case when worldly, time-serving men get into the Church.</p>
<p>The <i>feasts of charity</i>, the αγαπαι or <i>love feasts</i>, of which the apostle speaks, were in use in the primitive Church till the middle of the <i>fourth</i> century, when, by the council of Laodicea, they were prohibited to be held in the Churches; and, having been abused, fell into disuse. In later days they have been revived, in all the purity and simplicity of the primitive institution, among the <i>Moravians</i> or <i>Unitas Fratrum</i>, and the people called <i>Methodists</i>.</p>
<p>Among the ancients, the richer members of the Church made an occasional general feast, at which all the members attended, and the poor and the rich ate together. The fatherless, the widows, and the strangers were invited to these feasts, and their eating together was a proof of their love to each other; whence such entertainments were called <i>love feasts</i>. The love feasts were at first celebrated <i>before</i> the Lord's Supper; in process of time they appear to have been celebrated <i>after</i> it. But they were never considered as the Lord's Supper, nor any substitute for it. See, for farther information, <i>Suicer</i>, in his <i>Thesaurus</i>, under the word αγαπη.</p>
<p><i><b>Feeding themselves without fear</b></i> — Eating, not to suffice nature, but to pamper appetite. It seems the provision was abundant, and they ate to gluttony and riot. It was this which brought the love feasts into disrepute in the Church, and was the means of their being at last wholly laid aside. This abuse is never likely to take place among the Methodists, as they only use <i>bread</i> and <i>water</i>; and of this the provision is not sufficient to afford the tenth part of a meal.</p>
<p>Instead of αγαπαις, <i>love feasts</i>, απαταις, <i>deceits</i>, is the reading of the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, and the <i>Codex Ephrem</i>, two MSS. of the highest antiquity; as also of those MSS. collated by <i>Laurentius Valla</i>, and of some of those in the <i>Medicean</i> library. This reading appears to have been introduced in order to avoid the conclusion that some might be led to draw concerning the state of the Church; it must be very corrupt, to have in its communion such corrupt men.</p>
<p><i><b>Clouds - without water</b></i> — The <i>doctrine</i> of God is compared to the <i>rain</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:2">Deuteronomy 32:2</span>, and <i>clouds</i> are the instruments by which the rain is distilled upon the earth. In arid or parched countries the very appearance of a cloud is delightful, because it is a token of refreshing showers; but when sudden winds arise, and disperse these clouds, the hope of the husbandman and shepherd is cut off. These false teachers are represented as <i>clouds</i>; they have the <i>form</i> and <i>office</i> of the teachers of righteousness, and from such <i>appearances</i> pure doctrine may be naturally expected: but these are <i>clouds without water</i>-they distil no refreshing showers, because they have none; they are <i>carried away</i> and <i>about</i> by their <i>passions</i>, as those <i>light fleecy</i> <i>clouds</i> are carried by the winds.

<p><i><b>Trees whose fruit withereth</b></i> — δενδρα φθινοπωρινα. <i>Galled</i> or <i>diseased trees</i>; for φθινοπωρον is, according to <i>Phavorinus</i>, νοσος φθινουσα οπωρας, <i>a disease</i> (in trees) <i>which causes their</i> <i>fruit to wither</i>; for although there are <i>blossoms</i>, and the <i>fruit</i> <i>shapes</i> or is <i>set</i>, the galls in the trees prevent the proper circulation of the sap, and therefore the fruit never comes to perfection. Hence the apostle immediately adds, <i>without fruit</i>; i.e. the fruit never comes to maturity. This metaphor expresses the same thing as the preceding. They have the appearance of ministers of the Gospel, but they have no fruit.</p>
<p><i><b>Twice dead</b></i> — <i>First, naturally</i> and <i>practically dead in sin</i>, from which they had been revived by the preaching and grace of the Gospel. <i>Secondly</i>, dead by <i>backsliding</i> or <i>apostasy</i> from the true faith, by which they lost the grace they had before received; and now likely to continue in that death, because <i>plucked up from the</i> <i>roots</i>, their roots of faith and love being no longer fixed in Christ Jesus. Perhaps the <i>aorist</i> is taken here for the <i>future</i>: <i>They</i> SHALL BE <i>plucked up from the roots</i>-God will exterminate them from the earth.</p>
