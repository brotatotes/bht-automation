<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:13">Jude 1:13</span>. <i><b>Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own</b></i> <i>shame</i>] The same metaphor as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:20">Isaiah 57:20</span>: <i>The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose</i> <i>waters cast up mire and dirt</i>. These are like the sea in a storm, where the <i>swells</i> are like mountains; the <i>breakers</i> lash the shore, and sound like thunder; and the great deep, stirred up from its very bottom, rolls its muddy, putrid sediment, and deposits it upon the <i>beach</i>. Such were those proud and arrogant boasters, those headstrong, unruly, and ferocious men, who swept into their own vortex the souls of the simple, and left nothing behind them that was not indicative of their folly, their turbulence, and their impurity.</p>
<p><i><b>Wandering stars</b></i> — αστερες πλανηται. Not what we call <i>planets</i>; for although these differ from what are called the <i>fixed stars</i>, which never change their place, while the <i>planets</i> have their revolution round the sun; yet, properly speaking, there is no <i>irregularity</i> in their motions: for their appearance of <i>advancing,</i> <i>stationary</i>, and <i>retrograde</i>, are only in reference to an observer on the earth, viewing them in different parts of their orbits; for as to themselves, they ever continue a steady course through all their revolutions. But these are uncertain, anomalous meteors, <i>ignes fatui, wills-o'-the-wisp</i>; dancing about in the <i>darkness</i> which themselves have formed, and leading simple souls astray, who have ceased to walk in the <i>light</i>, and have no other guides but those oscillating and devious meteors which, if you run <i>after</i> them, will flee before you, and if you run <i>from</i> them will follow you.</p>
<p><i><b>The blackness of darkness</b></i> — They are such as are going headlong into that <i>outer</i> darkness where there is wailing, and weeping, and gnashing of teeth. The whole of this description appears to have been borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:0">2 Peter 2:0</span>, where the reader is requested to see the notes.</p>
