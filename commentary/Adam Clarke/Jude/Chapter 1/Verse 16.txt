Verse Jude 1:16. These are murmurers — Grudging and grumbling at all men, and at all things; complainers, μεμψιμοιροι, complainers of their fate or destiny-finding fault with God and all his providential dispensations, making and governing worlds in their own way; persons whom neither God nor man can please.Walking after their own lusts — Taking their wild, disorderly, and impure passions for the rule of their conduct, and not the writings of the prophets and apostles.Great swelling words — υπερογκα. See the explanation of this term in 2 Peter 2:18.Having men's persons in admiration — Time-servers and flatterers; persons who pretend to be astonished at the greatness, goodness, sagacity, learning, wisdom; c., of rich and great men, hoping thereby to acquire money, influence, power, friends, and the like.Because of advantage. — ωφελειας χαριν. For the sake of lucre. All the flatterers of the rich are of this kind and especially those who profess to be ministers of the Gospel, and who, for the sake of a more advantageous settlement or living, will soothe the rich even in their sins. With such persons a rich man is every thing; and if he have but a grain of grace, his piety is extolled to the skies! I have known several ministers of this character, and wish them all to read the sixteenth verse of Jude.
