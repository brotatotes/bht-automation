<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:16">Jude 1:16</span>. <i><b>These are murmurers</b></i> — Grudging and grumbling at all men, and at all things; <i>complainers</i>, μεμψιμοιροι, <i>complainers of</i> <i>their fate</i> or <i>destiny</i>-finding fault with God and all his providential dispensations, making and governing worlds in their own way; persons whom neither God nor man can please.</p>
<p><i><b>Walking after their own lusts</b></i> — Taking their wild, disorderly, and impure passions for the rule of their conduct, and not the writings of the prophets and apostles.</p>
<p><i><b>Great swelling words</b></i> — υπερογκα. See the explanation of this term in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:18">2 Peter 2:18</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Having men's persons in admiration</b></i> — Time-servers and flatterers; persons who pretend to be <i>astonished</i> at the <i>greatness,</i> <i>goodness, sagacity, learning, wisdom</i>; c., of <i>rich</i> and <i>great</i> men, hoping thereby to acquire money, influence, power, friends, and the like.</p>
<p><i><b>Because of advantage.</b></i> — ωφελειας χαριν. <i>For the sake of lucre</i>. All the flatterers of the rich are of this kind and especially those who profess to be <i>ministers</i> of the Gospel, and who, for the sake of a more advantageous <i>settlement</i> or <i>living</i>, will soothe the rich even in their sins. With such persons a <i>rich man</i> is <i>every</i> <i>thing</i>; and if he have but a <i>grain</i> of grace, his <i>piety</i> is extolled to the skies! I have known several ministers of this character, and wish them all to read the <i>sixteenth verse of Jude</i>.</p>
