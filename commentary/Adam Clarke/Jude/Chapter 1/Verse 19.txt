Verse Jude 1:19. Who separate themselves — From the true Church, which they leave from an affectation of superior wisdom.Sensual — ψυχικοι. Animal-living as brute beasts, guided simply by their own lusts and passions, their Bible being the manifold devices and covetousness of their own hearts; for they have not the Spirit-they are not spiritually minded; and have no Holy Ghost, no inspiration from God.
