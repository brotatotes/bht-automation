<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:19">Jude 1:19</span>. <i><b>Who separate themselves</b></i> — From the true Church, which they leave from an affectation of <i>superior wisdom</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Sensual</b></i> — ψυχικοι. <i>Animal</i>-living as brute beasts, guided simply by their <i>own lusts</i> and <i>passions</i>, their Bible being the manifold devices and covetousness of their own hearts; for they <i>have not the Spirit</i>-they are not spiritually minded; and have no Holy Ghost, no inspiration from God.</p>
