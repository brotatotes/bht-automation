<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:21">Jude 1:21</span>. <i><b>Keep yourselves in the love of God</b></i> — By building up yourselves on your most holy faith, and praying in the Holy Ghost; for without this we shall soon lose the love of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Looking for the mercy of our Lord</b></i> — For although they were to build <i>themselves</i> up, and to <i>pray</i> in the Holy Ghost, and keep <i>themselves</i> in the love of God, yet this <i>building, praying</i>, and <i>keeping</i>, cannot <i>merit</i> heaven; for, after all their diligence, earnestness, self-denial, watching, obedience, &amp;c., they must look for the MERCY <i>of the Lord Jesus Christ, to bring them to</i> ETERNAL LIFE.</p>
