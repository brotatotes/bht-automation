Verse Jude 1:21. Keep yourselves in the love of God — By building up yourselves on your most holy faith, and praying in the Holy Ghost; for without this we shall soon lose the love of God.Looking for the mercy of our Lord — For although they were to build themselves up, and to pray in the Holy Ghost, and keep themselves in the love of God, yet this building, praying, and keeping, cannot merit heaven; for, after all their diligence, earnestness, self-denial, watching, obedience, &c., they must look for the MERCY of the Lord Jesus Christ, to bring them to ETERNAL LIFE.
