<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:22">Jude 1:22</span>. <i><b>And of some have compassion, making a difference</b></i> — The general meaning of this exhortation is supposed to be, "Ye are not to deal alike with all those who have been seduced by false teachers; ye are to make a difference between those who have been led away by weakness and imprudence, and those who, in the pride and arrogance of their hearts, and their unwillingness to submit to wholesome <i>discipline</i>, have separated themselves from the Church, and become its inveterate enemies."</p>
<p>Instead of Και οὑς μεν ελεειτε διακρινομενοι, <i>and of some have</i> <i>compassion, making a difference</i>, many MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers</i> have και οὑς μεν ελεγχετε διακρινομενους, <i>and some rebuke, after</i> <i>having judged them</i>; or, <i>rebuke those that differ</i>; or, <i>some that</i> <i>are wavering convince</i>; or whatever else the reader pleases: for this and the following verse are all confusion, both in the MSS. and versions; and it is extremely difficult to know what was the original text. Our own is as likely as any.</p>
