<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:23">Jude 1:23</span>. <i><b>And others save with fear</b></i> — "Some of them snatch from the fire: but when they repent, have mercy upon them in fear."-<i>Syriac</i>. "And some of them rebuke for their sins; and on others have mercy when they are convicted; and others save from the fire and deliver them."-Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>. Mr. Wesley's note has probably hit the sense. "Meantime watch over <i>others</i> as well as <i>yourselves</i>; and give them such help as their various needs require. For instance, 1. <i>Some that are wavering</i> in judgment, staggered by others' or by their own evil reasoning, endeavour more deeply to <i>convince</i> of the truth as it is in Jesus. 2. <i>Some</i> <i>snatch</i> with a swift and strong hand <i>out of the fire</i> of sin and temptation. 3. <i>On others</i> show <i>compassion</i>, in a milder and gentler way; though still <i>with</i> a jealous <i>fear</i>, lest you yourselves be infected with the disease you endeavour to cure. See therefore that, while ye love the sinners, ye retain the utmost abhorrence of their sins, and of any, the least degree of or approach to them."</p>
<p><i><b>Having even the garment spotted by the flesh.</b></i> — Fleeing from all <i>appearance of evil</i>. <i>Dictum sumptum, ut apparet, a mulieribus</i> <i>sanguine menstruo pollutis, quarum vestes etiam pollutae</i> <i>censebantur</i>: or there may be an allusion to a case of <i>leprosy</i>, for that infected the garments of the afflicted person, and these garments were capable of conveying the contagion to others.</p>
