<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:24">Jude 1:24</span>. <i><b>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling</b></i> — Who alone can preserve you from the contagion of sin, and preserve you from falling into any kind of error that might be prejudicial to the interests of your souls; and thus to <i>present you faultless</i>, or, as many others read, ασπιλους, <i>without spot</i>, alluding to the <i>spotted garment</i> mentioned above.</p>
<p><i><b>Before the presence of his glory</b></i> — Where nothing can stand that does not resemble himself, <i>with exceeding great joy</i>, in finding yourselves eternally out of the reach of the possibility of falling, and for having now arrived at an eternity of happiness.</p>
