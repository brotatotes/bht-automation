<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:25">Jude 1:25</span>. <i><b>To the only wise God</b></i> — Who alone can <i>teach</i>, who alone has declared the <i>truth</i>; that truth in which ye now stand. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Our Saviour</b></i> — Who has by his blood washed us from our sins, and made us kings and priests unto God the Father.</p>
<p><i><b>Be glory</b></i> — Be ascribed all light, excellence, and splendour.</p>
<p><i><b>Majesty</b></i> — All power, authority, and pre-eminence.</p>
<p><i><b>Dominion</b></i> — All rule and government in the world and in the Church, in earth and in heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>And power</b></i> — All energy and operation to every thing that is wise, great, good, holy, and excellent.</p>
<p><i><b>Both now</b></i> — In the present state of life and things.</p>
<p><i><b>And ever.</b></i> — Εις παντας τους αιωνας· To the end of all states, places, dispensations, and worlds; and to a state which knows no <i>termination</i>, being that ETERNITY in which this <i>glory, majesty,</i> <i>dominion</i>, and <i>power</i> ineffably and incomprehensibly dwell.</p>
<p><i><b>Amen.</b></i> — So let it be, so ought it to be, and so it shall be.</p>
<p>After <i>to the only wise God our Saviour</i>, many excellent MSS. <i>versions</i>, c., add δια Ιησου Χριστου του Κυριου ἡμων, <i>by Jesus</i> <i>Christ our Lord</i> and after <i>dominion and power</i> they add προ παντος του αιωνος, <i>before all time</i>; and both these readings Griesbach has received into the text. The text, therefore, may be read thus: <i>To</i> <i>the only wise God our Saviour, by Christ Jesus our Lord, be glory</i> <i>and majesty, dominion and power, before all time; and now, and</i> <i>through all futurity. Amen</i>. Let the whole creation join in one chorus, issuing in one eternal <i>Amen</i>!</p>

<p>Of how little authority such subscriptions are, we have already had occasion to observe in various cases. Very few of them are ancient; and none of them coeval with the works to which they are appended. They are, in general, the opinions of the scribes who wrote the copies; or of the Churches for whose use they were written. No stress therefore should be laid on them, as if proceeding from Divine authority.</p>
<p>With the Epistle of Jude end all the apostolical epistles, and with it the canon of the New Testament, as to <i>gospels</i> and <i>epistles</i>; for the <i>Apocalypse</i> is a work <i>sui generis</i>, and can rank with neither. It is in general a collection of symbolic prophecies, which do not appear to be yet fully understood by the Christian world, and which can only be known when they are fulfilled.</p>
