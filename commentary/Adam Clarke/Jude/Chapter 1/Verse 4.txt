<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>. <i><b>For there are certain men crept in unawares</b></i> — παρεισεδυσαν. They had got into the Church under <i>specious</i> <i>pretences</i>; and, when in, began to sow their bad seed.</p>
<p><i><b>Before of old ordained</b></i> — Οἱ παλαι προγεγραμμενοι Such as were <i>long ago proscribed, and condemned in the most public manner</i>; this is the import of the word προγραφειν in this place, and there are many examples of this use of it in the Greek writers. See <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To this condemnation</b></i> — To a similar punishment to that immediately about to be mentioned.</p>
<p>In the sacred writings all such persons, false doctrines, and impure practices, have been <i>most openly proscribed</i> and <i>condemned</i>; and the apostle immediately produces several examples, viz., the disobedient <i>Israelites</i>, the unfaithful <i>angels</i>, and the impure inhabitants of <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrha</i>. This is most obviously the apostle's meaning, and it is as ridiculous as it is absurd to look into such words for a decree of eternal reprobation, c., such a doctrine being as far from the apostle's mind as from that of <i>Him</i> in whose name he wrote.</p>
<p><i><b>Turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness</b></i> — Making the grace and mercy of God a covering for crimes intimating that men might sin safely who believe the Gospel, because in that Gospel <i>grace abounds</i>. But perhaps the <i>goodness</i> of God is here meant, for I cannot see how they could believe the Gospel in any way who denied the Lord Jesus Christ; unless, which is likely, their denial refers to this, that while they acknowledged Jesus as the promised Messiah, they denied him to be the only Lord, Sovereign, and Ruler of the Church and of the world. There are many in the present day who hold the same opinion.</p>
<p><i><b>The only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</b></i> — Μονον Δεσποτην Θεον και Κυριον ἡμων Ιησουν Χριστον αρυουμενοι. These words may be translated, Denying the only sovereign God, even our Lord Jesus Christ. But θεον GOD, is omitted by ABC, sixteen others, with Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>, and by many of the <i>fathers</i>. It is very likely that it was originally inserted as a gloss, to ascertain to whom the title of τονμονον δεσποτην, <i>the only Sovereign</i>, belonged; and thus make <i>two</i> persons where only <i>one</i> seems to be intended. The passage I believe belongs solely to Jesus Christ, and may be read thus: <i>Denying the</i> <i>only sovereign Ruler, even our Lord Jesus Christ</i>. The text is differently arranged in the <i>Complutensian</i> Polyglot, which contains the <i>first edition</i> of the Greek Testament: Και τον μονον Θεον και Δεσποτην, τον Κυριον ἡμων Ιησουν Χριστον αρνουμενοι· <i>Denying the</i> <i>only God and Sovereign, our Lord Jesus Christ</i>. This is a very remarkable position of the words, and doubtless existed in some of the MSS. from which these editors copied. The <i>Simonians,</i> <i>Nicolaitans</i>, and <i>Gnostics</i>, denied God to be the creator of the world; and Simon is said to have proclaimed <i>himself</i> as FATHER to the <i>Samaritans</i>, as SON to the <i>Jews</i>, and as the HOLY GHOST to all other <i>nations</i>. All such most obviously denied both <i>Father, Son</i>, and <i>Spirit</i>.</p>
