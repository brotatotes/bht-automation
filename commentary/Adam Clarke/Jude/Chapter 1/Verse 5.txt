<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:5">Jude 1:5</span>. <i><b>I will therefore put you in remembrance</b></i> — That is, how such persons were <i>proscribed</i>, and <i>condemned</i> to bear the punishment due to such crimes.</p>
<p><i><b>Though ye once knew this</b></i> — The word απαξ, here translated <i>once</i>, has greatly puzzled many interpreters. It has <i>two</i> meanings in the sacred writings, and indeed in the Greek writers also. 1. It signifies <i>once, one time</i>, as opposed to <i>twice</i>, or <i>several times</i>. 2. <i>Altogether, entirely, perfectly</i>, interpreted by Suidas αντι τον διολου, ολοσχερως. and of this meaning he produces a proof from Josephus; This appears to be the sense of the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span>: τους απαξ φωτισθεντας. <i>those who were</i> FULLY <i>enlightened</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:2">Hebrews 10:2</span>: απαξ κεκαθαρμενους. THOROUGHLY <i>cleansed</i>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:3">Hebrews 10:3</span> of this epistle. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+62:11">Psalms 62:11</span>: απαξ ελαλησεν ο θεος. <i>God spoke</i> FULLY, <i>completely</i>, on the subject. St. Jude is to be understood as saying, <i>I will therefore</i> <i>put you in remembrance, though ye are</i> THOROUGHLY <i>instructed in</i> <i>this</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Saved the people</b></i> — Delivered them from the Egyptian bondage.</p>
<p><i><b>Afterward destroyed them</b></i> — Because they neither believed his word, nor were obedient to his commands. This is the first example of what was mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>.</p>
