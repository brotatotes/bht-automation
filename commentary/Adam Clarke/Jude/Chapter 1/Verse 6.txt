Verse Jude 1:6. The angels which kept not their first estate — την εαυτωναρχην Their own principality. The words may be understood of their having invaded the office or dignity of some others, or of their having by some means forfeited their own. This is spoken of those generally termed the fallen angels; but from what they fell, or from what cause or for what crime, we know not. It is generally thought to have been pride; but this is mere conjecture. One thing is certain; the angels who fell must have been in a state of probation, capable of either standing or falling, as Adam was in paradise. They did not continue faithful, though they knew the law on which they stood; they are therefore produced as the second example.But left their own habitation — This seems to intimate that they had invaded the office and prerogatives of others, and attempted to seize on their place of residence and felicity.He hath reserved in everlasting chains — That is, in a state of confinement from which they cannot escape.Under darkness — Alluding probably to those dungeons or dark cells in prisons where the most flagitious culprits were confined.The judgment of the great day, — The final judgment, when both angels and men shall receive their eternal doom. See note on 2 Peter 2:4. In Sohar Exod., fol. 8, c. 32: "Rabbi Isaac asked: Suppose God should punish any of his heavenly family, how would he act? R. Abba answered: He would send them into the flaming river, take away their dominion, and put others in their place." Some suppose that the saints are to occupy the places from which these angels, by transgression, fell.
