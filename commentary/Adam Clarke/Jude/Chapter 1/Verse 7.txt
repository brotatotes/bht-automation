<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:7">Jude 1:7</span>. <i><b>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha</b></i> — What their sin and punishment were may be seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:0">Genesis 19:0</span>, and the notes there. This is the <i>third</i> example to illustrate what is laid down <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Are set forth for an example</b></i> — Both of what God will do to such transgressors, and of the position laid down in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>, viz., that God has in the most <i>open and positive manner declared</i> that such and such sinners shall meet with the punishment due to their crimes.</p>
<p><i><b>Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</b></i> — Subjected to such a punishment as an endless fire can inflict. Some apply this to the utter subversion of these cities, so that by the action of that fire which descended from heaven they were <i>totally</i> and <i>eternally</i> <i>destroyed</i>; for as to their being <i>rebuilt</i>, that is impossible, seeing the very <i>ground</i> on which they stood is burned up, and the whole <i>plain</i> is now the immense <i>lake Asphaltites</i>. See my notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:0">Genesis 19:0</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> sense applies to the <i>inhabitants</i> of those wicked cities; the <i>second</i>, to the cities themselves: in either case the word πυραιωνιον signifies an <i>eternally destructive fire</i>; it has no end in the punishment of the wicked Sodomites, c. it has no end in the destruction of the cities; they were totally burnt up, and never were and never can be rebuilt. ln either of these senses the word αιωνιος, <i>eternal</i>, has its grammatical and proper meaning.</p>
