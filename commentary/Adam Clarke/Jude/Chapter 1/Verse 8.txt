<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:8">Jude 1:8</span>. <i><b>Likewise also these</b></i><b> filthy </b><i><b>dreamers</b></i> — He means to say that these false teachers and their followers were as <i>unbelieving</i> and <i>disobedient</i> as the <i>Israelites</i> in the wilderness, as <i>rebellious</i> against the authority of God as the <i>fallen angels</i>, and as <i>impure</i> and <i>unholy</i> as the <i>Sodomites</i>; and that consequently they must expect <i>similar punishment</i>.</p>
<p>Our translators, by rendering ενυπνιαζομενοι <i>filthy dreamers</i>, seem to have understood St. Jude to mean <i>les pollutions nocturnes</i> <i>et voluntaires de ces hommes impurs, qui se livrent sans scrupule</i> <i>a toutes sortes des pensees; et salissant leur imagination pas la</i> <i>vue de toutes sortes d' objets, tombent ensuite dans les</i> <i>corsuptions honteuses et criminelles</i>. See <i>Calmet</i>. In plain English, self-pollution, with all its train of curses and cursed effects on body, soul, and spirit. The <i>idea</i> of our translators seems to be confirmed by the words σαρκαμενμιαινουσι, <i>they</i> <i>indeed pollute the flesh</i>. See what is said at the conclusion of the thirty-eighth chapter of Genesis.</p>
<p><i><b>Despise dominion</b></i> — κυριοτητα δε αθετουσι. <i>They set all</i> <i>government at nought</i>-they will come under no restraints; they despise all law, and wish to live as they list.</p>
<p><i><b>Speak evil of dignities.</b></i> — δοξας δε βλασφημουσιν. <i>They</i> <i>blaspheme or speak injuriously of supreme authority</i>. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10-11">2 Peter 2:10-11</span>.) They treat <i>governors</i> and <i>government</i> with contempt, and calumniate and misrepresent all Divine and civil institutions.</p>
