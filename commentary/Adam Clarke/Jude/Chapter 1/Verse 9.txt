<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>. <i><b>Yet Michael the archangel</b></i> — Of this personage many things are spoken in the Jewish writings "Rabbi Judah Hakkodesh says: Wherever <i>Michael</i> is said to appear, the glory of the Divine Majesty is always to be understood." <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sec. ii., fol. 104, 3. So that it seems as if they considered Michael in some sort as we do the Messiah manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Let it be observed that the word <i>archangel</i> is never found in the <i>plural</i> number in the sacred writings. There can be properly only one <i>archangel</i>, one chief or head of all the angelic host. Nor is the word <i>devil</i>, as applied to the great enemy of mankind, ever found in the <i>plural</i>; there can be but one monarch of all fallen spirits. <i>Michael</i> is this <i>archangel</i>, and head of all the <i>angelic orders</i>; the <i>devil, great dragon</i>, or <i>Satan</i>, is head of all the <i>diabolic</i> orders. When these two hosts are opposed to each other they are said to act under these two chiefs, as leaders; hence in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7">Revelation 12:7</span>, it is said: MICHAEL <i>and his angels fought against the</i> DRAGON <i>and his angels</i>. The word <i>Michael</i> מיכאל, seems to be compounded of מי <i>mi</i>, who, כ <i>ke</i>, like, and אל <i>El</i>, God; <i>he who is like God</i>; hence by this personage, in the Apocalypse, many understand the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>Disputed about the body of Moses</b></i> — What this means I cannot tell; or from what source St. Jude drew it, unless from some tradition among his countrymen. There is something very like it in <i>Debarim Rabba</i>, sec. ii., fol. 263, 1: "Samael, that wicked one, the prince of the satans, carefully kept the soul of Moses, saying: When the time comes in which Michael shall lament, I shall have my mouth filled with laughter. Michael said to him: Wretch, I weep, and thou laughest. <i>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy,</i> <i>because I have fallen; for I shall rise again: when I sit in</i> <i>darkness, the Lord is my light</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+7:8">Micah 7:8</span>. By the words, <i>because I have fallen</i>, we must understand the <i>death</i> of Moses; by the words, <i>I shall rise again</i>, the government of Joshua, c." See the <i>preface</i>.</p>
<p>Another <i>contention</i> of Michael with Satan is mentioned in <i>Yalcut</i> <i>Rubeni</i>, fol. 43, 3: "At the time in which Isaac was bound there was a contention between Michael and Satan. Michael brought a ram, that Isaac might be liberated but Satan endeavoured to carry off the ram, that Isaac might be slain."</p>
<p>The <i>contention</i> mentioned by Jude is not about the sacrifice of Isaac, nor the <i>soul</i> of Moses, but about the BODY of Moses; but why or wherefore we know not. Some think the devil wished to show the Israelites <i>where</i> Moses was buried, knowing that they would then <i>adore</i> his <i>body</i>; and that Michael was sent to resist this discovery.</p>
<p><i><b>Durst not bring against him a railing accusation</b></i> — It was a Jewish maxim, as may be seen in <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, page 92, note 6: "It is not lawful for man to prefer ignominious reproaches, even against wicked spirits." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>Dr. Macknight says: "In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+10:13">Daniel 10:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+10:21">Daniel 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>, Michael is spoken of as one of the chief angels who took care of the Israelites as a nation; he may therefore have been <i>the angel of the Lord</i> before whom Joshua the high priest is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:1">Zechariah 3:1</span>, to have stood, <i>Satan being at his right hand to resist him</i>, namely, in his design of restoring the <i>Jewish Church</i> and <i>state</i>, called by Jude the <i>body</i> <i>of Moses</i>, just as the Christian Church is called by Paul <i>the body</i> <i>of Christ</i>. Zechariah adds, <i>And the Lord</i>, that is, <i>the angel of</i> <i>the Lord</i>, as is plain from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:1-2">Zechariah 3:1-2</span>, <i>said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan! even the Lord that</i> <i>hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee</i>!" This is the most likely interpretation which I have seen; and it will appear the more probable when it is considered that, among the Hebrews, גוף <i>guph</i>, BODY, is often used for <i>a thing itself</i>. So, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>, σωματης αμαρτιας, <i>the body of sin</i>, signifies <i>sin</i> itself; so the <i>body of</i> <i>Moses</i>, גוף של משה guph shel Mosheh, may signify Moses himself; or that in which he was particularly concerned, viz., his institutes, religion, c.</p>
<p>It may be added, that the Jews consider <i>Michael</i> and <i>Samael</i>, one as the <i>friend</i>, the other as the <i>enemy</i>, of Israel. Samael is their <i>accuser</i>, Michael their <i>advocate</i>. "Michael and Samael stand before the Lord Satan accuses, but Michael shows the merits of Israel. Satan endeavours to speak, but Michael silences him: Hold thy tongue, says he, and let us hear what the Judge determines; for it is written, <i>He will speak peace to his people, and to his saints</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+85:8">Psalms 85:8</span>." <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sec. xviii. fol. 117, 3.</p>
