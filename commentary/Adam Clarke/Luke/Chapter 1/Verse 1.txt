<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>. <i><b>Many have taken in hand</b></i> — Great and remarkable characters have always many biographers. So it appears it was with our Lord: but as most of these accounts were inaccurate, recording as <i>facts</i> things which had not happened; and through <i>ignorance</i> or <i>design mistaking</i> others, especially in the <i>place</i> where St. Luke wrote; it seemed good to the Holy Spirit to inspire this holy man with the most correct knowledge of the whole history of our Lord's birth, preaching, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension, that the sincere, upright followers of God might have a sure foundation, on which they might safely build their faith. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Most surely believed among us</b></i> — Facts confirmed by the fullest evidence - των πεπληροφορημενων πραγματων. Every thing that had been done or said by Jesus Christ was so <i>public</i>, so <i>plain</i>, and so <i>accredited</i> by thousands of witnesses, who could have had no interest in supporting an imposture, as to carry the <i>fullest</i> <i>conviction</i>, to the hearts of those who heard and saw him, of the <i>divinity</i> of his <i>doctrine</i>, and the <i>truth</i> of his <i>miracles</i>.</p>
