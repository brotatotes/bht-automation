<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:10">Luke 1:10</span>. <i><b>The whole multitude - were praying</b></i> â€” The incense was itself an emblem of the prayers and praises of the people of God: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+141:2">Psalms 141:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1">Revelation 8:1</span>. While, therefore, the <i>rite</i> is performing by the priest, the people are employed in the thing signified. Happy the people who attend to the <i>spirit</i> as well as the <i>letter</i> of every divine institution! Incense was burnt twice a day in the temple, in the morning and in the evening, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:7-8">Exodus 30:7-8</span>; but the evangelist does not specify the time of the day in which this transaction took place. It was probably in the morning.</p>
