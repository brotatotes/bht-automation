<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:11">Luke 1:11</span>. <i><b>There appeared - an angel of the Lord</b></i> â€” There had been neither prophecy nor angelic ministry vouchsafed to this people for about 400 years. But now, as the Sun of righteousness is about to arise upon them, the day-spring from on high visits them, that they may be prepared for that kingdom of God which was at hand. Every circumstance here is worthy of remark:</p>
<p>1. That an angel should <i>now</i> appear, as such a favour had not been granted for 400 years.</p>
<p>2. The <i>person</i> to whom this angel was sent-one of the <i>priests</i>. The sacerdotal office itself pointed out the Son of God till he came: by him it was to be completed, and in him it was to be eternally established: - <i>Thou art a priest for ever</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>.</p>
<p>3. The <i>place</i> in which the angel appeared - <i>Jerusalem</i>; out of which the <i>word of the Lord should go forth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:3">Isaiah 2:3</span>, and not at <i>Hebron</i>, in the hill country of Judea, where Zacharias lived, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:39">Luke 1:39</span>, which was the ordinary residence of the priests, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+21:11">Joshua 21:11</span>, where there could have been few witnesses of this interposition of God, and the effects produced by it.</p>
<p>4. The <i>place</i> where he was when the angel appeared to him - in the <i>temple</i>, which was the place where God was to be sought; the place of his residence, and a type of the <i>human nature</i> of the blessed Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:21">John 2:21</span>.</p>
<p>5. The <i>time</i> in which this was done - the solemn hour of <i>public prayer</i>. God has always promised to be present with those who <i>call</i> upon him. When the people and the priest go hand in hand, and heart with heart, to the house of God, the angel of his presence shall surely accompany them, and God shall appear among them.</p>
<p>6. The <i>employment</i> of Zacharias when the angel appeared - he was <i>burning</i> <i>incense</i>, one of the most sacred and mysterious functions of the Levitical priesthood, and which typified the intercession of Christ: confer <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>.</p>
<p>7. The <i>long</i> continued and <i>publicly</i> known <i>dumbness</i> of the priest, who <i>doubted</i> the word thus miraculously sent to him from the Lord: a solemn intimation of what God would do to all those who would not believe in the Lord Jesus. <i>Every mouth shall be stopped</i>.</p>
