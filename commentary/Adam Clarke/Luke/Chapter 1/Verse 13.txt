Verse Luke 1:13. Thy prayer is heard — This probably refers,1st, to the frequent prayers which he had offered to God for a son; and2dly, to those which he had offered for the deliverance and consolation of Israel.They are all heard-thou shalt have a son, and Israel shall be saved. If fervent faithful prayers be not immediately answered, they should not be considered as lost; all such are heard by the Lord, are registered in heaven, and shall be answered in the most effectual way, and in the best time. Answers to prayer are to be received by faith; but faith should not only accompany prayer while offered on earth, but follow it all its way to the throne of grace, and stay with it before the throne till dismissed with its answer to the waiting soul.Thou shalt call his name John. — For the proper exposition of this name, Mark 1:4.
