<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:15">Luke 1:15</span>. <i><b>He shall be great in the sight of the Lord</b></i> — That is, before Jesus Christ, whose forerunner he shall be; or he shall be a <i>truly great person</i>, for so this form of speech may imply.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither wine nor strong drink</b></i> — σικερα, i.e. all fermented liquors which have the property of intoxicating, or producing drunkenness. The original word σικερα, <i>sikera</i>, comes from the Hebrew, שכר <i>shakar, to inebriate</i>. "Any inebriating liquor," says St. Jerome, (Epis. ad Nepot.)" is called <i>sicera</i>, whether made of <i>corn, apples, honey, dates</i>, or any other fruits." One of the four prohibited liquors among the East Indian <i>Moslimans</i> is called <i>sikkir</i>. "<i>Sikkir</i> is made by steeping fresh dates in water till they take effect in sweetening it: this liquor is abominable and unlawful." HEDAYA, vol. iv. p. 158. Probably this is the very liquor referred to in the text. In the Institutes of Menu it is said, "Inebriating liquor may be considered as of three principal sorts: that extracted from <i>dregs of sugar</i>, that extracted from <i>bruised rice</i>, and that extracted from the <i>flowers of the </i> <i>madhuca</i>: as one, so are all; they shall not be tasted by the <i>chief</i> of the <i>twice-born</i>." Chap. xi. Inst. 95. <i>Twice-born</i> is used by the Brahmins in the same sense as being <i>born again</i> is used by Christians. It signifies a <i>spiritual regeneration</i>. From this word comes our English term <i>cyder</i>, or <i>sider</i>, a beverage made of the fermented juice of apples. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+10:9">Leviticus 10:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall be filled with the Holy Ghost</b></i> — Shall be Divinely designated to this particular office, and qualified for it, <i>from</i> <i>his mother's womb</i>-from the instant of his birth. One MS., two <i>versions</i>, and four of the primitive <i>fathers</i> read εν τη κοιλια, IN <i>the womb of has mother </i>- intimating that even before he should be born into the world the Holy Spirit should be communicated to him. Did not this take place on the salutation of the Virgin Mary? - and is not this what is intended, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:44">Luke 1:44</span>? To be filled with the Holy Ghost, implies having the soul influenced in all its powers, with the illuminating, strengthening, and sanctifying energy of the Spirit.</p>
