<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:18">Luke 1:18</span>. <i><b>Whereby shall I know this?</b></i> â€” All things are possible to God: no natural impediment can have any power when God has declared he will accomplish his purpose. He has a right to be believed on his own word alone; and it is impious, when we are convinced that it is his word, to demand a sign or pledge for its fulfilment.</p>
