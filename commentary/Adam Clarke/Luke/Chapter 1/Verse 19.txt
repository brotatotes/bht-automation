<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:19">Luke 1:19</span>. <i><b>I am Gabriel</b></i> — This angel is mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+8:16">Daniel 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:21">Daniel 9:21</span>. The original גבריאל is exceedingly expressive: it is compounded of גבורה <i>geburah</i>, and אל <i>el, the might of the strong God</i>. An angel with such a name was exceedingly proper for the occasion; as it pointed out that <i>all-prevalent power</i> by which the <i>strong God</i> could accomplish every purpose, and <i>subdue</i> all things to himself.</p>
<p><i><b>That stand in the presence of God</b></i> — This is in allusion to the case of the prime minister of an eastern monarch, who <i>alone</i> has access to his master at all times; and is therefore said, in the eastern phrase, <i>to see the presence</i>, or <i>to be in the presence</i>. From the allusion we may conceive the angel Gabriel to be in a state of high favour and trust before God.</p>
