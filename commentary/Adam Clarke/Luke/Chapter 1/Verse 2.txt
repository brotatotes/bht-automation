<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span>. <i><b>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>beginning were eye-witnesses</b></i> — Probably this alludes to the Gospels of <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark</i>, which it is likely were written before St. Luke wrote his, and on the <i>models</i> of which he professes to write his own; and απ αρχης, <i>from the beginning</i>, must mean, from the time that Christ first began to proclaim the glad tidings of the kingdom; and αυτοπται, <i>eye-witnesses</i>, must necessarily signify, those who had been with him from the beginning, and consequently had the best opportunities of knowing the truth of every fact.</p>
<p><i><b>Ministers of the word</b></i> — του λογου. Some suppose that our blessed <i>Lord</i> is meant by this phrase; as ὁ Λογος, the <i>Word</i> or <i>Logos</i>, is his essential character in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>, c. but it does not appear that any of the inspired penmen ever use the word in this sense except John himself; for here it certainly means the <i>doctrine of Christ</i>; and in this sense λογος is frequently used both by the evangelists and apostles.</p>
