<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:20">Luke 1:20</span>. <i><b>Thou shalt be dumb</b></i> — σιωπων <i>silent</i>; this translation is literal; the angel immediately explains it, <i>thou shalt not be</i> <i>able to speak</i>. <i>Dumbness</i> ordinarily proceeds from a natural <i>imperfection</i> or <i>debility</i> of the organs of speech; in this case there was no natural weakness or unfitness in those organs; but, for his rash and unbelieving speech, <i>silence</i> is imposed upon him by the Lord, and he shall not be able to break it, till the power that has silenced him gives him again the permission to speak! Let those who are intemperate in the use of their <i>tongues</i> behold here the severity and mercy of the Lord; <i>nine</i> months' <i>silence</i> for <i>one</i> intemperate speech! Many, by giving way to the language of <i>unbelief</i>, have lost the language of <i>praise</i> and <i>thanksgiving</i> for months, if not years!</p>
