<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:21">Luke 1:21</span>. <i><b>The people waited</b></i> â€” The time spent in burning the incense was probably about <i>half an hour</i>, during which there was a profound <i>silence</i>, as the people stood without engaged in mental prayer. To this there is an allusion in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1-5">Revelation 8:1-5</span>. Zacharias had spent not only the time necessary for burning the incense, but also that which the discourse between him and the angel took up.</p>
