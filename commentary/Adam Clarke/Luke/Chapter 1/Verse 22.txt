<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:22">Luke 1:22</span>. <i><b>They perceived that he had seen a vision</b></i> — As the sanctuary was separated from the court by a great veil, the people could not see what passed, but they understood this from Zacharias himself, who, ην διανευων, <i>made signs</i>, or <i>nodded</i> unto them to that purpose. <i>Signs</i> are the only means by which a dumb man can convey his ideas to others.</p>
