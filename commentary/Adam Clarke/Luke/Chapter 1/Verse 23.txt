<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:23">Luke 1:23</span>. <i><b>As soon as the days of his ministration were</b></i><b> </b><i><b>accomplished</b></i> â€” Each family of the priesthood officiated one whole week, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+11:17">2 Kings 11:17</span>.</p>
<p>There is something very instructive in the conduct of this priest; had he not loved the service he was engaged in, he might have made the loss of his speech a pretext for immediately quitting it. But as he was not thereby <i>disabled</i> from fulfilling the sacerdotal function, so he saw he was bound to continue till his ministry was ended; or till God had given him a positive dismission. Preachers who give up their labour in the vineyard because of some trifling bodily disorder by which they are afflicted, or through some inconvenience in outward circumstances, which the follower of a <i>cross-bearing, crucified</i> Lord should not mention, show that they either <i>never had</i> a proper concern for the honour of their Master or for the salvation of men, or else that they have <i>lost</i> the spirit of their Master, and the spirit of their work. Again, Zacharias did not hasten to his house to tell his wife the good news that he had received from heaven, in which she was certainly very much interested: the angel had promised that <i>all his words should be fulfilled in their season</i>, and for this season he patiently waited in the path of duty. He had engaged in the work of the Lord, and must pay no attention to any thing that was likely to mar or interrupt his religious service. Preachers who profess to be <i>called of God</i> to labour in the word and doctrine, and who abandon their work for <i>filthy lucre's</i> sake, are the most contemptible of mortals, and traitors to their God.</p>
