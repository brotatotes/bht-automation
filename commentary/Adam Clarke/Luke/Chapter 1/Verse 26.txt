<p>Verse 26. <i><b>A city of Galilee</b></i> â€” As Joseph and Mary were both of the family of David, the patrimonial estate of which lay in Bethlehem, it seems as if the family residence should have been in that city, and not in Nazareth; for we find that, even after the return from the captivity, the several families went to reside in those cities to which they originally belonged.

See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:39">Luke 2:39</span>. Thus, by keeping out of the way, they avoided the <i>effects</i> of his jealousy.</p>
