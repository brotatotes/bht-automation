<p>Verse 27. <i><b>To a virgin espoused</b></i>, c.] See Clarke on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:23">Matthew 1:23</span>. The reflections of pious father <i>Quesnel</i> on this subject are worthy of serious regard. At length the moment is come which is to give a <i>son</i> to a <i>virgin</i>, a <i>saviour</i> to the <i>world</i>, a <i>pattern</i> to <i>mankind</i>, a <i>sacrifice</i> to <i>sinners</i>, a <i>temple</i> to the <i>Divinity</i>, and a <i>new</i> principle to the <i>new</i> world. This angel is sent from God, not to the palaces of the <i>great</i>, but to a <i>poor maid</i>, the wife of a <i>carpenter</i>. The Son of God comes to humble the proud, and to honour <i>poverty, weakness</i>, and <i>contempt</i>. He chooses an <i>obscure</i> place for the mystery which is most glorious to his humanity, its union with the Divinity, and for that which is most <i>degrading</i> (his sufferings and death) he will choose the greatest city! How far are men from such a conduct as this!</p>
