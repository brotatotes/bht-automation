<p>Verse 28. <i><b>And the angel came in unto her</b></i> — Some think that all this business was transacted in a vision; and that there was no <i>personal</i> appearance of the angel. When Divine visions were given, they are announced as such, in the sacred writings; nor can we with safety attribute any thing to a vision, where a Divine communication is made, unless it be specified as such in the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Hail</b></i> — Analogous to, <i>Peace be to thee </i>- May thou enjoy all possible blessings!</p>
<p><i><b>Highly favoured</b></i> — As being chosen in preference to all the women upon earth, to be the mother of the Messiah. Not the <i>mother of</i> <i>God</i>, for that is <i>blasphemy</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>with thee</b></i> — Thou art about to receive the most convincing proofs of God's peculiar favour towards thee.</p>
<p><i><b>Blessed</b></i><b> art </b><i><b>thou among women.</b></i> — That is, thou art favoured beyond all others.</p>
