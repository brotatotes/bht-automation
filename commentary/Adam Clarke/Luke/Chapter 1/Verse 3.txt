<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>. <i><b>Having had perfect understanding</b></i> — παρηκολουθηκοτι ανωθεν, <i>Having accurately traced up</i>-entered into the very spirit of the work, and examined every thing to the bottom; in consequence of which investigation, I am completely convinced of the truth of the whole. Though God gives his Holy Spirit to all them who ask him, yet this gift was never designed to set aside the use of those faculties with which he has already endued the soul, and which are as truly his <i>gifts</i> as the Holy Spirit itself is. The nature of inspiration, in the case of St. Luke, we at once discover: he set himself, by impartial inquiry and diligent investigation, to find the whole truth, and to relate nothing but the truth; and the Spirit of God presided over and directed his inquiries, so that he discovered the whole truth, and was preserved from every particle of error.</p>
<p><i><b>From the very first</b></i> — ανωθεν, <i>from their origin</i>. Some think ανωθεν should, in this place, be translated <i>from above</i>; and that it refers to the <i>inspiration</i> by which St. Luke wrote. I prefer our translation, or, <i>from the origin</i>, which several good critics contend for, and which meaning it has in some of the best Greek writers. See <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Theophilus</b></i> — As the literal import of this word is <i>friend of God</i>, Θεου φιλος, some have supposed that under this name Luke comprised all the followers of Christ, to whom, as <i>friends of God</i>, he dedicated this faithful history of the life, doctrine, death, and resurrection of our Lord. But this interpretation appears to have little solidity in it; for, if all the followers of Christ are addressed, why is the <i>singular</i> number used? and what good end could there be accomplished by using a <i>feigned</i> name? Besides, κρατιστε, <i>most excellent</i>, could never be applied in this way, for it evidently designates a particular person, and one probably distinguished by his situation in life; though this does not necessarily follow from the title, which was often given in the way of <i>friendship. Theophilus</i> appears to have been some very reputable Greek or Roman, who was one of St. Luke's disciples. The first four verses seem a private <i>epistle</i>, sent by the evangelist with this history, which, having been carefully preserved by Theophilus, was afterwards found and published with this Gospel.</p>
