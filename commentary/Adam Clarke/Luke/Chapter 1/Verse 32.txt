<p>Verse 32. <i><b>He shall be great</b></i> â€” Behold the greatness of the <i>man</i> Christ Jesus:</p>
<p>1st. Because that human nature that should be born of the virgin was to be united with the Divine nature.</p>
<p>2dly. In consequence of this, that human nature should be called in a peculiar sense <i>the SON of the most high God</i>; because God would produce it in her womb without the intervention of man.</p>
<p>3dly. He shall be the everlasting Head and Sovereign of his Church.</p>
<p>4thly. His government and kingdom shall be <i>eternal</i>. Revolutions may destroy the kingdoms of the <i>earth</i>, but the powers and gates of hell and death shall never be able to destroy or injure the kingdom of Christ. <i>His</i> is the only dominion that shall never have an <i>end</i>. The angel seems here to refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+16:5">Isaiah 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:5">Jeremiah 23:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+2:44">Daniel 2:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14">Daniel 7:14</span>. All which prophecies speak of the glory, extent, and perpetuity of the evangelical kingdom. The kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory form the endless government of Christ.</p>
