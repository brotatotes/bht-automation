<p>Verse 35. <i><b>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee</b></i> — This conception shall take place <i>suddenly</i>, and the Holy Spirit himself shall be the grand operator. <i>The power</i>, δυναμις, the miracle-working power, <i>of the Most High shall overshadow thee</i>, to accomplish this purpose, and to <i>protect</i> thee from danger. As there is a plain allusion to the Spirit of God brooding over the face of the waters, to render them <i>prolific</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:2">Genesis 1:2</span>, I am the more firmly established in the opinion advanced on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>, that the rudiments of the human nature of Christ was a <i>real creation</i> in the womb of the virgin, by the energy of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Therefore also that holy thing</b></i> (or person) - <i>shall be called the</i> <i>Son of God.</i>] We may plainly perceive here, that the angel does not give the appellation of <i>Son of God</i> to the <i>Divine nature</i> of Christ; but to that <i>holy person</i> or <i>thing</i>, τοαγιον, which was to be born of the virgin, by the energy of the Holy Spirit. The Divine nature <i>could not</i> be born of the virgin; the human nature <i>was</i> born of her. The Divine nature had <i>no beginning</i>; it was God manifested in the flesh, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>; it was that Word which being in the beginning (from eternity) with God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:2">John 1:2</span>, was afterwards <i>made flesh</i>, (became manifest in human nature,) and <i>tabernacled</i> <i>among us</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. Of this Divine nature the angel does not particularly speak here, but of the <i>tabernacle</i> or <i>shrine</i> which God was now preparing for it, viz. the <i>holy thing</i> that was to be <i>born</i> <i>of the virgin</i>. Two natures must ever be distinguished in Christ: the human nature, in reference to which he is the <i>Son of God</i> and <i>inferior</i> to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:32">Mark 13:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:28">John 14:28</span>, and the <i>Divine nature</i> which was from <i>eternity</i>, and <i>equal</i> to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:30">John 10:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16-18">Colossians 1:16-18</span>. It is true, that to Jesus the Christ, as he appeared among men, every characteristic of the Divine nature is sometimes attributed, without appearing to make any distinction between the Divine and human natures; but is there any part of the Scriptures in which it is <i>plainly</i> said that the Divine nature of Jesus was <i>the Son of God</i>? Here, I trust, I may be permitted to say, with all due respect for those who differ from me, that the doctrine of the <i>eternal Sonship</i> of Christ is, in my opinion, anti-scriptural, and highly dangerous. This doctrine I reject for the following reasons: -</p>
<p>1st. I have not been able to find any <i>express</i> declaration in the Scriptures concerning it.</p>
<p>2dly. If Christ be the Son of God as to his <i>Divine</i> nature, then he cannot be <i>eternal</i>; for <i>son</i> implies a <i>father</i>; and father implies, in reference to <i>son, precedency</i> in <i>time</i>, if not in <i>nature</i> too. <i>Father</i> and <i>son</i> imply the idea of <i>generation</i>; and <i>generation</i> implies a <i>time</i> in which it <i>was</i> effected, and <i>time</i> also <i>antecedent</i> to such generation.</p>
<p>3dly. If Christ be the <i>Son</i> of God, as to his <i>Divine</i> nature, then the <i>Father</i> is of necessity prior, consequently <i>superior</i> to him.</p>
<p>4thly. Again, if this <i>Divine nature</i> were <i>begotten</i> of the <i>Father</i>, then it must be in <i>time</i>; i.e. there was a period in which it <i>did</i> <i>not</i> exist, and a period when it <i>began</i> to exist. This destroys the <i>eternity</i> of our blessed Lord, and robs him at once of his Godhead.</p>
<p>5thly. To say that he was <i>begotten</i> from all <i>eternity</i>, is, in my opinion, absurd; and the phrase <i>eternal Son</i> is a positive self-contradiction. ETERNITY is that which has had no <i>beginning</i>, nor stands in any reference to TIME. SON supposes <i>time,</i> <i>generation</i>, and <i>father</i>; and time also <i>antecedent</i> to such generation. Therefore the conjunction of these two terms, <i>Son</i> and <i>eternity</i> is absolutely impossible, as they imply essentially different and <i>opposite</i> ideas.</p>
<p>The enemies of Christ's Divinity have, in all ages, availed themselves of this incautious method of treating this subject, and on <i>this ground</i>, have ever had the advantage of the defenders of the Godhead of Christ. This doctrine of the <i>eternal Sonship</i> destroys the <i>deity</i> of Christ; now, if his deity be taken away, the whole Gospel scheme of redemption is ruined. On this ground, the atonement of Christ cannot have been of <i>infinite</i> merit, and consequently could not purchase pardon for the offences of mankind, nor give any right to, or possession of, an <i>eternal</i> glory. The very use of this phrase is both absurd and dangerous; therefore let all those who value <i>Jesus</i> and their <i>salvation</i> abide by the <i>Scriptures</i>. This doctrine of the <i>eternal Sonship</i>, as it has been lately explained in many a pamphlet, and many a paper in magazines, I must and do consider as an awful heresy, and mere sheer <i>Arianism</i>; which, in many cases, has terminated in <i>Socinianism</i>, and that in <i>Deism</i>. From such heterodoxies, and their abetters, may God save his Church! Amen!</p>
