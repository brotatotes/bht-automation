<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Thy cousin Elisabeth</b></i> — <i>Thy kinswoman</i>, συγγενης. As Elisabeth was of the tribe of <i>Levi</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:5">Luke 1:5</span>, and Mary of the tribe of <i>Judah</i>, they could not be relatives but by the mother's side.</p>
<p><i><b>She hath also conceived</b></i> — And this is wrought by the same power and energy through which <i>thou</i> shalt conceive. Thus God has given thee a proof and pledge, in what he has done for Elisabeth, of what he will do for thyself; therefore, have faith in God.</p>
<p><i><b>Who was called barren.</b></i> — It is probable that Elisabeth got this appellative by way of reproach; or to distinguish her from some other Elisabeth also well known, who had been blessed with children. Perhaps this is the <i>reproach</i> which Elisabeth speaks of, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:25">Luke 1:25</span>, her common name <i>among men</i>, among the people who knew her, being <i>Elisabeth the</i> <i>barren</i>.</p>
