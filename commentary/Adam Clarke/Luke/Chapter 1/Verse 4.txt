<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:4">Luke 1:4</span>. <i><b>Wherein thou hast been instructed.</b></i> — κατηχηθης - In which thou hast been <i>catechized</i>. It appears that Theophilus had already received the <i>first elements</i> of the Christian doctrine, but had not as yet been completely <i>grounded</i> in them. That he might know the certainty of the things in which he had been thus catechized, by having all the facts and their proofs brought before him <i>in order</i>, the evangelist sent him this faithful and Divinely inspired narrative. Those who content themselves with that knowledge of the doctrines of Christ which they receive from <i>catechisms</i> and <i>schoolmasters</i>, however important these elementary instructions may be, are never likely to arrive at such a knowledge of the truth as will make them wise unto salvation, or fortify them against the attacks of infidelity and irreligion. Every man should labour to acquire the most correct knowledge, and indubitable certainty, of those doctrines on which he stakes his eternal salvation. Some suppose that St. Luke refers here to the imperfect instruction which Theophilus had received from the defective Gospels to which he refers in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>.</p>
