<p>Verse 46. <i><b>And Mary said</b></i> — Two copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and some books mentioned by <i>Origen</i>, give this song to <i>Elisabeth</i>. It is a counterpart of the song of Hannah, as related in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:1-10">1 Samuel 2:1-10</span>.</p>
<p>This is allowed by many to be the first piece of <i>poetry</i> in the New Testament; but the address of the angel to Zacharias, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:13-17">Luke 1:13-17</span>, is delivered in the same way; so is that to the virgin, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:30-33">Luke 1:30-33</span>, and so also is Elisabeth's answer to Mary, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:42-45">Luke 1:42-45</span>. All these portions are easily reducible to the <i>hemistich</i> form in which the Hebrew poetry of the Old Testament is found in many MSS., and in which Dr. Kennicott has arranged the Psalms, and other poetical parts of the Sacred Writings. See his Hebrew Bible.</p>
<p><i><b>My soul doth magnify the Lord</b></i> — The verb μεγαλυνειν, <i>Kypke</i> has proved, signifies <i>to celebrate with words, to extol with praises</i>. This is the only way in which God can be <i>magnified</i>, or made <i>great</i>; for, strictly speaking, nothing can be <i>added</i> to God, for he is infinite and eternal; therefore the way to magnify him is to show forth and celebrate those acts in which he has manifested his <i>greatness</i>.</p>
