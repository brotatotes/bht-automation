<p>Verse 48. <i><b>He hath regarded</b></i> — <i>Looked favourably</i>, c., επεβλεψεν. In the most tender and compassionate manner he has visited me in my humiliation, drawing the reasons of his conduct, not from any excellence in me, but from his own eternal <i>kindness</i> and <i>love</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>All generations shall call me blessed.</b></i> — This was the character by which alone she wished to be known viz. <i>The blessed or happy</i> <i>virgin</i>. What dishonour do those do to this holy woman, who give her names and characters which her pure soul would abhor; and which properly belong to GOD <i>her Saviour</i>! By her votaries she is addressed as <i>Queen of Heaven, Mother of God</i>, &amp;c., titles both absurd and blasphemous.</p>
