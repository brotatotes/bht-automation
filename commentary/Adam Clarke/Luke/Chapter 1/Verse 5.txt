<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:5">Luke 1:5</span>. <i><b>In the days of Herod, the king</b></i> — This was <i>Herod</i>, surnamed the <i>Great</i>, the son of <i>Antipater</i>, an Idumean by birth, who had professed himself a proselyte to the Jewish religion, but regarded no religion, farther than it promoted his secular interests and ambition. Thus, for the first time, the throne of Judah was filled by a person not of Jewish extraction, who had been forced upon the people by the Roman government. Hence it appears plain that the prophecy of Jacob, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>, was now fulfilled; for <i>the sceptre had departed from Judah</i>: and now was the time, according to another prophecy, to look for the <i>governor</i> <i>from Bethlehem</i>, who should <i>rule</i> and <i>feed</i> the <i>people of Israel</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:1-2">Micah 5:1-2</span>. See a large account of the family of the Herods, in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span><i>"</i>. This was before Christ six years.</p>
<p><i><b>The course of Abiah</b></i> — When the sacerdotal families grew very numerous, so that <i>all</i> could not officiate together at the tabernacle, David divided them into <i>twenty-four</i> classes, that they might minister by turns, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+24:1">1 Chronicles 24:1</span>, c., each family serving a whole week, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+11:7">2 Kings 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+23:8">2 Chronicles 23:8</span>. <i>Abiah</i> was the eighth in the order in which they had been originally established: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+24:10">1 Chronicles 24:10</span>. These <i>dates</i> and <i>persons</i> are particularly mentioned as a full confirmation of the truth of the <i>facts</i> themselves; because any person, at the time this Gospel was written, might have satisfied himself by applying to the family of John the Baptist, the family of our Lord, or the surrounding neighbours. What a full proof of the Gospel history! It was published <i>immediately</i> after the <i>time</i> in which these facts took place; and among the very <i>people</i>, thousands of whom had been eye-witnesses of them; and among those, too, whose essential interest it was to have discredited them if they could; and yet, in all <i>that age</i>, in which only they could have been contradicted with advantage, no man ever arose to call them in question! What an absolute proof was this that the thing was impossible; and that the truth of the Gospel history was acknowledged by all who paid any attention to the evidences it produced!</p>
<p><i><b>Of the daughters of Aaron</b></i> — That is, she was of one of the sacerdotal families. This shows that John was most nobly descended: his father was a priest and his mother the daughter of a priest; and thus, both by father and mother, he descended from the family of Amram, of whom came Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, the most illustrious characters in the whole Jewish history.</p>
