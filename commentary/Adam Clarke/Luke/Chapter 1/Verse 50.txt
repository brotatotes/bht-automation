<p>Verse 50. <i><b>His mercy</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>on them that fear him</b></i> â€” His exuberant kindness manifests itself in acts of mercy to all those who fear or reverence his name; and this is continued <i>from generation to</i> <i>generation</i>, because he is <i>abundant</i> in goodness, and because he delighteth in mercy. This is a noble, becoming, and just character of the God of the Christians; a being who delights in the salvation and happiness of <i>all</i> his creatures, because his <i>name</i> is <i>mercy</i>, and his <i>nature love</i>.</p>
