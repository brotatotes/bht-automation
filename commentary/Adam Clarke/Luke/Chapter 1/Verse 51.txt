<p>Verse 51. <i><b>He hath showed strength</b></i> — Or, <i>He hath gained the </i> <i>victory</i>, εποιησε κρατος. The word κρατος is used for <i>victory</i>, by <i>Homer, Hesiod, Sophocles, Euripides</i>, and others.</p>
<p><i><b>With his arm</b></i> — Grotius has well observed, that God's <i>efficacy</i> is represented by his <i>finger</i>, his <i>great power</i> by his <i>hand</i>, and his <i>omnipotence</i> by his arm. The plague of lice was the <i>finger</i> of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:18">Exodus 7:18</span>. The plagues in general were wrought by his <i>hand</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:20">Exodus 3:20</span>, And the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea, which was effected by the <i>omnipotence</i> of God, is called the act of his <i>arm</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:16">Exodus 15:16</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>He hath scattered</b></i> — διεσκορπισεν, <i>hath scattered abroad</i>; as a whirlwind scatters dust and chaff.</p>
<p><i><b>The proud</b></i> — Or <i>haughty</i>, υπερηφανους; from υπερ <i>above</i>, and φαινω <i>I show </i>- the haughty men, who wish to be <i>noticed</i> in <i>preference</i> to all others, and feel sovereign contempt for all but themselves. These God scatters abroad-instead of being in his sight, as in their own, <i>the most excellent of the earth</i>, he treats them as <i>straw, stubble, chaff</i>, and <i>dust</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>In the imagination of their hearts.</b></i> — While they are forming their insolent, proud, and oppressive projects - laying their plans, and imagining that accomplishment and success are waiting at their right hand, the whirlwind of God's displeasure blows, and they and their machinations are dissipated together.</p>
