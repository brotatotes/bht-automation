<p>Verse 52. <i><b>He hath put down the mighty from their seats</b></i> â€” Or, <i>He</i> <i>hath taken down potentates from their thrones</i>. This probably alludes to the removal of <i>Saul</i> from the throne of Israel, and the establishment of the kingdom in the person and family of <i>David</i>. And as Mary spoke <i>prophetically</i>, this saying may also allude to the destruction of the kingdom of Satan and his allies, and the final prevalence of the kingdom of Christ.</p>
