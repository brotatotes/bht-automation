<p>Verse 53. <i><b>Filled the hungry - the rich he hath sent empty away.</b></i> â€” God is here represented under the notion of a person of unbounded benevolence, who is daily feeding multitudes at <i>his gates</i>. The <i>poor</i> and the <i>rich</i> are <i>equally</i> dependent upon him; to the one he gives his <i>affluence</i> for a season, and to the other his <i>daily</i> <i>bread</i>. The <i>poor man</i> comes through a sense of his want to get his daily support, and God feeds him; the <i>rich man</i> comes through the lust of gain, to get <i>more</i> added to his abundance, and, God sends him empty away - not only gives him nothing <i>more</i>, but often deprives him of that which he has, because he has not improved it to the honour of the giver. There is an allusion here, as in several other parts of this song, to the case of Hannah and Peninah, as related <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:2">1 Samuel 1:2</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:1-10">1 Samuel 2:1-10</span>.</p>
