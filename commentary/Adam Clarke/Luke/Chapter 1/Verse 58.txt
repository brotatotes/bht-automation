<p>Verse 58. <i><b>And her neighbours and her cousins - rejoiced with her.</b></i> â€” Because sterility was a reproach; and they now rejoiced with their relative, from whom that reproach was now rolled away. To rejoice with those whom God has favoured, and to congratulate them on the advantages which he has granted to them, is a duty which humanity, charity, and religion call upon us to fulfil.</p>
<p>1. It is a duty of <i>humanity</i>, which should be <i>punctually</i> performed. We are all <i>members</i> of each other, and should rejoice in the welfare of the whole. He who rejoices in his neighbour's prosperity increases his neighbour's happiness, and gets an addition to his own.</p>
<p>2. It is a duty which <i>charity</i> or <i>brotherly love</i> requires us to perform with <i>sincerity</i>. In the polite world, there is no duty better fulfilled <i>in word</i> than this is; but <i>sincerity</i> is utterly banished, and the giver and receiver are both convinced that <i>compliments</i> and <i>good wishes</i> mean-<i>nothing</i>. He who does not endeavour to take a <i>sincere</i> part in his neighbour's prosperity will soon feel ample punishment in the spirit of <i>jealousy</i> and <i>envy</i>.</p>
<p>3. It is a duty of <i>religion</i>, which should be fulfilled with <i>piety</i>. These neighbours and relatives saw that <i>God had magnified</i> <i>his mercy towards</i> Elisabeth, and they acknowledged <i>his</i> hand in the work. God is the dispenser of all good-he distributes his favours in mercy, judgment, and justice. Let us honour him in his gifts; and honour <i>those</i>, for his sake, who are objects of his favour. The society of believers are but <i>one</i> body; the talents, c., of every individual are profitable to the whole community at least none ate deprived of a share in the general welfare, but those who, through jealousy or envy, refuse to <i>rejoice</i> with him <i>towards whom</i> <i>God hath magnified his mercy</i>.</p>
