Verse 59. On the eighth day they came to circumcise — See an account of this institution in Clarke's notes on Genesis 17:10-14. Had circumcision been essential to an infant's salvation, God would not have ordered it to be delayed to the eighth day, because, in all countries, multitudes die before they arrive at that age.

Both are signs of the covenant - circumcision, of the putting away the impurity of the flesh; and baptism, of the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, producing the answer of a good conscience  towards God.
