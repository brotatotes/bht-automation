<p>Verse 59. <i><b>On the eighth day they came to circumcise</b></i> — See an account of this institution in Clarke's notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:10-14">Genesis 17:10-14</span>. Had <i>circumcision</i> been essential to an infant's salvation, God would not have ordered it to be delayed to the eighth day, because, in all countries, multitudes die before they arrive at that age. <i>Baptism</i>, which is generally allowed to have been substituted for circumcision, is no more necessary to the salvation of an infant than circumcision was. Both are <i>signs</i> of the covenant - <i>circumcision</i>, of the <i>putting away the impurity of the</i> <i>flesh</i>; and <i>baptism</i>, of the <i>washing of regeneration, and renewing</i> <i>of the Holy Ghost</i>, producing <i>the answer of a good conscience </i> <i>towards God</i>. Confer <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>. This should never be neglected: it is a <i>sign</i> and <i>token</i> of the spiritual grace.</p>
<p><i><b>They called him Zacharias</b></i> — Among the Jews, the child was named when it was circumcised, and ordinarily the name of the father was given to the first-born son.</p>
