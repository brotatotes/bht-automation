<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>. <i><b>They were both righteous</b></i> — Upright and holy in all their outward conduct in civil life.</p>
<p><i><b>Before God</b></i> — Possessing the spirit of the religion they professed; exercising themselves constantly in the presence of their Maker, whose eye, they knew, was upon all their conduct, and who examined all their motives.</p>
<p><i><b>Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord</b></i><b> </b><i><b>blameless.</b></i> — None being able to lay any evil to their charge. They were as exemplary and conscientious in the discharge of their <i>religious</i> duties as they were in the discharge of the offices of civil life. What a sacred pair! they made their duty to God, to their neighbour, and to themselves, walk constantly hand in hand. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:15">Matthew 3:15</span>. Perhaps εντολαι, <i>commandments</i>, may here mean the <i>decalogue</i>; and δικαιωματα, <i>ordinances</i>, the ceremonial and judicial laws which were delivered after the decalogue: as all the precepts delivered from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:1">Exodus 21:1</span>ff to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:1">Exodus 24:1</span>ff are termed δικαιωματα, <i>judgments</i> or <i>ordinances</i>.</p>
