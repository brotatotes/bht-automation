<p>Verse 60. <i><b>Not</b></i><b> so; </b><i><b>but he shall be called John.</b></i> — This is the name which the angel desired should be given him, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:13">Luke 1:13</span>, and of which Zacharias by writing had informed his wife. There is something very remarkable in the names of this family. <i>Zachariah</i>, זכריהו the <i>memory</i> or <i>memorial of Jehovah</i>; יהו yeho, at the end of the word, being contracted for יהוה <i>Yehovah</i>, as in many other names. Elisabeth, אליסבה the <i>Sabbath</i> or <i>rest of my strong</i> <i>God</i>: names probably given them by their parents, to point out some remarkable circumstance in their conception or birth. And <i>John</i>, which should always be written <i>Jehochanan</i> or <i>Yehochanan</i>, יהוחנן the <i>grace</i> or <i>mercy of Jehovah</i>: so named, because he was to go before and proclaim the <i>God of all grace</i>, and the mercy granted through him to a lost world.
