<p>Verse 63. <i><b>A writing table</b></i> — πινακιδιον, a <i>tablet</i>, a diminutive of πιναξ, a <i>table</i>. "The boys in Barbary are taught to write upon a smooth thin board, slightly daubed over with whiting, which may be rubbed off or renewed at pleasure. Such probably (for the Jewish children use the same) was the <i>little board</i>, or <i>writing table</i>, as we render it <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:63">Luke 1:63</span>, that was called for by Zacharias." Shaw's Travels, p. 194. My old MS. considers the word as meaning the <i>instrument</i> of writing, rather than the <i>tablet</i> on which he wrote: <i>and he aringe a poyntel, wroot seyinge, Joon is his name</i>.</p>
<p>A thin board, made out of the <i>pine</i> tree, smeared over with wax, was used among the ancients; and to this the Anglo-Saxon version seems to refer, as it translates πινακιδιον, [Anglo-Saxon], a <i>wax</i> <i>board</i> or <i>cloth</i>.</p>
<p>An intelligent friend has suggested a different mode of reading the 62nd and 63rd verses: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:62">Luke 1:62</span>. <i>And they asked his father how he would have him called</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:63">Luke 1:63</span>. <i>And he made signs for a writing table and wrote, His name is John</i>: "For," says my friend, "the 64th verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:64">Luke 1:64</span> proves his <i>mouth was not opened</i>, neither <i>his tongue loosed</i>, till after the child was named; therefore he could not <i>ask</i> for the table; and it is more reasonable that <i>he</i>, being dumb, should make signs, than that those should who had the use of their tongues." But, howsoever ingenious this may be, neither the words of the Greek text, nor their construction, will bear this version.</p>
