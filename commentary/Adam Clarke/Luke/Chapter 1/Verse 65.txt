<p>Verse 65. <i><b>And fear came</b></i> — Seeing what they might have thought a paralytic affection so suddenly and effectually healed. φοβος - This word certainly means in several places, <i>religious fear</i> or <i>reverence</i>; and in this sense it is used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:18">Romans 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:7">Romans 13:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:17">1 Peter 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:2">1 Peter 3:2</span>. The meaning of it here is plainly this: The inhabitants of Hebron and its environs, who were well acquainted with the circumstances of Zacharias and Elisabeth, perceived that God had in a remarkable manner visited them; and this begot in their minds a more than ordinary <i>reverence</i> for the <i>Supreme Being</i>. Thus the salvation of one often becomes an instrument of good to the souls of many. The inhabitants of this hill country seem to have been an open, honest-hearted, generous people; who were easily led to acknowledge the interposition of God, and to rejoice in the comfort and welfare of each other. The people of the <i>country</i> are more remarkable for these qualities than those in <i>towns</i> and <i>cities</i>. The latter, through that evil communication which corrupts good manners, are generally profligate, <i>selfish</i>, regardless of God, and inattentive to the operation of his hands.</p>
