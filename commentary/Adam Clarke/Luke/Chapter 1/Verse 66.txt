<p>Verse 66. <i><b>What manner of child shall this be!</b></i> — As there have been so many extraordinary things in his conception and birth, surely God has designed him for some extraordinary purpose. These things they <i>laid up in their heart</i>, patiently waiting to see what God would work.</p>
<p><i><b>The hand of the Lord was with him.</b></i> — God <i>defended</i> and <i>prospered</i> him in all things, and the prophetic spirit began to rest upon him.</p>
