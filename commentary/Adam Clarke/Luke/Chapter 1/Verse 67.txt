<p>Verse 67. <i><b>Zacharias - prophesied</b></i> â€” The word <i>prophesy</i> is to be taken here in its proper acceptation, for the <i>predicting</i> or <i>foretelling</i> <i>future events</i>. Zacharias speaks, not only of what God <i>had</i> already <i>done</i>, but also of what he was <i>about to do</i>, in order to save a lost world.</p>
