<p>Verse 68. <i><b>Blessed</b></i> be <i>the Lord God of Israel; for</i>, c.] Zacharias praises God for two grand benefits which he had granted to his people. 1. He has <i>visited</i> them. 2. He has <i>ransomed</i> them.</p>
<p>1. He speaks by the spirit of prophecy, which calls things that <i>are not</i>, as though they <i>were</i> because they are absolutely determined by the Most High, and shall be all fulfilled in their season. God <i>visits</i> his people in the <i>incarnation</i> of Jesus Christ; therefore this Christ is called by him, κυριοςοθεος, <i>Jehovah the God</i> of Israel. Here the highest and most glorious character of the Supreme Being is given to Christ.</p>
<p>2. This God <i>redeems his people</i>: it is for this end that he <i>visits</i> them. His soul is about to be made a sacrifice for sin: he becomes <i>flesh</i>, that he may suffer and die for the sin of the world. God, by taking upon him the nature of man, has <i>redeemed</i> that nature from eternal ruin.</p>
<p><i><b>He hath-redeemed</b></i> — εποιησε λυτρωσιν, <i>he hath made a ransom </i>- laid down the <i>ransom price</i>. λυτροω signifies particularly to <i>ransom a</i> <i>captive</i> from the <i>enemy</i>, by <i>paying</i> a <i>price</i>. The following remarkable passage from <i>Josephus</i>, Ant. b. xiv. c. 14, sect. 1, fully illustrates this meaning of the original. "Herod, not knowing what had happened to his brother, hastened λυτρωσασθαι, to <i>ransom</i> him from the enemy, and was willing to <i>pay</i> λυτρον υπερ αυτου, <i>a ransom</i> for him, to the amount of <i>three hundred talents</i>." Sinners are fallen into the hands of their <i>enemies</i>, and are <i>captives</i> to sin and death. Jesus <i>ransoms</i> them by his own blood, and restores them to life, liberty, and happiness. this truth the whole Bible teaches: this truth God has shown in certain measures, even to those nations who have not been favoured with the light of his written word: for Christ is that <i>true light</i>, which <i>enlightens</i> <i>every man</i> that cometh into the world.</p>
<p>How astonishing is the following invocation of the Supreme Being, (translated from the original <i>Sanscreet</i> by Dr. C. WILKINS,) still existing on a stone, in a cave near she ancient city of <i>Gya</i>, in the East Indies!</p>
<p>"The Deity, who is the Lord, the possessor of all, <i>appeared</i> in this ocean of natural beings, at the beginning of the <i>Kalee Yoog</i> (the age of contention and baseness.) He who is omnipresent and everlastingly to be contemplated, the Supreme Being, the Eternal One, the Divinity worthy to be adored-<i>APPEARED here with a PORTION</i> <i>of his DIVINE NATURE</i>. Reverence be unto thee in the form of (a) Bood-dha! Reverence be unto the Lord of the earth! Reverence be unto thee, an INCARNATION of the Deity, and the Eternal One! Reverence be unto thee, O God, in the <i>form of the God of mercy</i>; the dispeller of pain and trouble, the Lord of all things, the Deity who <i>overcometh the sins of the Kalee Yoog</i>; the guardian of the universe, the emblem of mercy toward those who serve thee - (b) O'M! the possessor of all things in VITAL FORM! Thou art (c) Brahma, Veeshnoo, and Mahesa! Thou art Lord of the universe! Thou art under the form of all things, movable and immovable, the possessor of the whole! and thus I adore thee. Reverence be unto the BESTOWER OF SALVATION, and the Ruler of the faculties! Reverence be unto thee, the DESTROYER of the EVIL SPIRIT! O Damordara, (d) show me favour! I adore thee, who art celebrated by a thousand names, and under various forms, in the shape of Bood-dha, the God of MERCY! Be propitious, O Most High God!"-ASIATIC RESEARCHES, vol. i. pp. 284, 285.</p>
<p>(a) <i>Bood-dha</i>. The name of the Deity, as <i>author of happiness</i>.</p>
<p>(b) <i>O'M</i>. A mystic emblem of the Deity, forbidden to be pronounced but in silence. It is a syllable formed of the <i>Sanscreet</i> letters a, o o, which in composition coalesce, and make o, and the nasal consonant m. The first letter stands for the <i>Creator</i>, the second for the <i>Preserver</i> and the third for the <i>Destroyer</i>. It is the same among the <i>Hindoos</i> as יהוה <i>Yehovah</i> is among the <i>Hebrews</i>.</p>
<p>(c) <i>Brahma</i>, the Deity in his <i>creative</i> quality. <i>Veeshnoo</i>, he <i>who filleth all space</i>, the Deity in his <i>preserving</i> quality. <i>Mahesa</i>, the Deity in his <i>destroying</i> quality. This is properly the Hindoo Trinity: for these three names belong to the same <i>Being</i>. See the notes to the <i>Bhagvat Geeta</i>.</p>
<p>(d) <i>Damordara</i>, or <i>Darmadeve</i>, the Indian God of Virtue.</p>
