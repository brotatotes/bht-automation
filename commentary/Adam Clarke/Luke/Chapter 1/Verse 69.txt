<p>Verse 69. <i><b>And hath raised up a horn of salvation</b></i> — That is, a <i>mighty</i> and <i>glorious Saviour</i>: a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:2">Psalms 18:2</span>. <i>Horns</i> are the well known emblems of <i>strength, glory</i>, and <i>power</i>, both in the sacred and profane writers, because the strength and beauty of horned animals consist in their horns. <i>Horns</i> have also been considered as emblems of <i>light</i>; therefore the heathen god <i>Apollo</i> is represented with horns, to point out the power, glory, and excellence of the solar light. The Chaldee paraphrast sometimes translates קרן <i>keren, horn</i>, by מלכות <i>malcuth</i>, or מלכותא <i>malcutha</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:10">1 Samuel 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+48:25">Jeremiah 48:25</span>, which signify a <i>kingdom</i>: but it is likely that the allusion is here made to the horns of the <i>altar</i>; and as the altar was a place of refuge and safety, and those who laid hold on its horns were considered to be under the protection of the Lord, so, according to the expression of Zacharias, Jesus Christ is a <i>new altar</i>, to which whosoever flees shall find refuge.</p>
<p>Some imagine that this form of speech is taken from the custom of ancient warriors, who had a <i>horn of steel</i> on the top of their <i>helmets</i>, which ordinarily lay <i>flat</i>, till the person came victorious from battle, and then it was <i>erected</i>, as emblematical of the victory gained. Such a horn as this is represented on the helmet of the Abyssinian kings and warriors: see the plates in <i>Bruce's Travels</i>. To this custom of wearing or <i>lifting up the </i> <i>horn</i>, the following scriptures are thought to allude: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:10">1 Samuel 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalms 112:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+148:4">Psalms 148:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="la+2:17">Lamentations 2:17</span>. In ancient <i>gems</i> and <i>coins</i>, this form of the horn on helmets is easily discernible, sometimes <i>flat</i>, sometimes <i>erected</i>. A horn, filled with various <i>fruits</i>, was also the emblem of <i>abundance</i> among the ancients: hence their <i>cornu copia</i>, or <i>horn of plenty</i>. From all this we may learn that the Lord Jesus gives a <i>luminous, powerfuly </i> <i>prevalent, glorious</i>, and <i>abundant</i> SALVATION or REFUGE to mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>In the house of his servant David</b></i> — Or, <i>in the family</i>: so the word οικος, <i>house</i>, is often used in the Sacred Writings. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:32">Luke 1:32</span>, the angel states that Mary was of the <i>family of David</i>; and Zacharias, who, from the nature of his office, must have been well acquainted with the public genealogical tables, attests the same thing. This is a matter of considerable importance; because it shows forth the truth of all the prophetic declarations, which uniformly state that the Messiah should come from the <i>family</i> and sit on the <i>throne</i> of DAVID.</p>
