<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:7">Luke 1:7</span>. <i><b>Both were now well stricken in years.</b></i> â€” By the order of God, <i>sterility</i> and <i>old age</i> both met in the person of <i>Elisabeth</i>, to render the birth of a son (humanly speaking) impossible. This was an exact parallel to the case of <i>Sarah</i> and <i>Abraham</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:30">Genesis 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:17">Genesis 17:17</span>. Christ must (by the miraculous power of God) be born of a virgin: whatever was connected with, or referred to, his incarnation must be miraculous and impressive. <i>Isaac</i> was his grand <i>type</i>, and therefore must be born miraculously - contrary to the common course and rule of nature: <i>Abraham</i> was a <i>hundred</i> years of age, <i>Sarah</i> was <i>ninety</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:17">Genesis 17:17</span>, and <i>it had CEASED to be with Sarah AFTER THE MANNER OF WOMEN</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:11">Genesis 18:11</span>, and therefore, from her <i>age</i> and <i>state</i>, the birth of a child must, according to nature, have been impossible; and it was thus; that it might be miraculous. <i>John the Baptist</i> was to be the forerunner of Christ; <i>his</i> birth, like that of <i>Isaac</i>, must be miraculous, because, like the other, it was to be a representation of the birth of Christ; therefore his parents were both far advanced in years, and besides, Elisabeth was <i>naturally</i> barren. The birth of these <i>three</i> extraordinary persons was announced nearly in the same way. God himself foretells the birth of Isaac, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:16">Genesis 17:16</span>. The angel of the Lord announces the birth of John the Baptist, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:13">Luke 1:13</span>; and six months after, the angel Gabriel, the same angel, proclaims to Mary the birth of Christ! Man is naturally an <i>inconsiderate</i> and <i>incredulous</i> creature: he must have extraordinary things to arrest and fix his attention; and he requires well-attested miracles from God, to bespeak and confirm his faith. Every person who has properly considered the nature of man must see that the whole of <i>natural</i> religion, so termed, is little else than a disbelief of <i>all</i> religion.</p>
