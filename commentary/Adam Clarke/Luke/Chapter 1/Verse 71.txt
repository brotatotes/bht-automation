<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:71">Luke 1:71</span>. <i><b>That we should be saved</b></i> (literally, <i>a salvation</i>)<b> </b><i><b>from</b></i><b> </b><i><b>our enemies</b></i> â€” As Zacharias spoke by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the salvation which he mentions here must necessarily be understood in a <i>spiritual</i> sense. <i>Satan, death</i>, and <i>sin</i> are the <i>enemies</i> from whom Jesus came to deliver us. <i>Sin</i> is the most dangerous of all, and is properly the only enemy we have to fear. <i>Satan</i> is without us, and can have no power over us, but what he gets through <i>sin</i>. <i>Death</i> is only in our <i>flesh</i>, and shall be finally destroyed (as it affects us) on the morning of the resurrection. Jesus redeems <i>from sin</i>; this is the grand, the glorious, the important victory. Let us get sin cast out, and then we need, fear neither <i>death</i>, nor the <i>devil</i>.</p>
