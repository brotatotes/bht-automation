<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:74-75">Luke 1:74-75</span>. <i><b>Being delivered</b></i>, c.] The salvation brought by Jesus Christ, consists in the following things: -</p>
<p>1. We are to be <i>delivered out of the hand of our enemies</i>, and <i>from all that hate us</i> so that sin shall neither have <i>dominion</i> <i>over</i> us, nor <i>existence in</i> us.</p>
<p>2. We are to <i>worship God</i>, λατρευειν, to <i>render him</i> that <i>service</i> and <i>adoration</i> which the letter and spirit of his <i>religion</i> require.</p>
<p>3. Ye are to live in <i>holiness</i>, a strict <i>inward</i> conformity to the mind of Christ-and <i>righteousness</i>, a full <i>outward</i> conformity to the precepts of the Gospel.</p>
<p>4. This is to be done <i>before God</i>, under the continual <i>influence</i> and <i>support</i> of his <i>grace</i>, and with a constant evidence of his <i>presence</i> and <i>approbation</i>.</p>
<p>5. This state is a state of true <i>happiness </i>- it is <i>without fear</i>. Sin is all cast out, holiness is brought in; God's power upholds, and his approbation cheers and comforts, the believing heart. Thus <i>misery</i> is precluded, and <i>happiness</i> established.</p>
<p>6. This blessedness is to continue as long as we exist - <i>all the</i> <i>days of our life</i>, in all ages, in all situations, and in all circumstances. What a pity to have lived so long <i>without</i> God in the world, when so much happiness and glory are to be enjoyed in <i>union</i> with him!</p>
<p>της ζωης, in the last clause, is omitted by many MSS., versions, and fathers. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text: however, it is but of small importance whether we read <i>all our days</i>, or, <i>all the</i> <i>days of our life</i>.</p>
