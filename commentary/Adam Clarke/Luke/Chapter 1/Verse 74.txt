Verse Luke 1:74-75. Being delivered, c.] The salvation brought by Jesus Christ, consists in the following things: -1. We are to be delivered out of the hand of our enemies, and from all that hate us so that sin shall neither have dominion over us, nor existence in us.2. We are to worship God, λατρευειν, to render him that service and adoration which the letter and spirit of his religion require.3. Ye are to live in holiness, a strict inward conformity to the mind of Christ-and righteousness, a full outward conformity to the precepts of the Gospel.4. This is to be done before God, under the continual influence and support of his grace, and with a constant evidence of his presence and approbation.5. This state is a state of true happiness - it is without fear. Sin is all cast out, holiness is brought in; God's power upholds, and his approbation cheers and comforts, the believing heart. Thus misery is precluded, and happiness established.6. This blessedness is to continue as long as we exist - all the days of our life, in all ages, in all situations, and in all circumstances. What a pity to have lived so long without God in the world, when so much happiness and glory are to be enjoyed in union with him!της ζωης, in the last clause, is omitted by many MSS., versions, and fathers. Griesbach has left it out of the text: however, it is but of small importance whether we read all our days, or, all the days of our life.
