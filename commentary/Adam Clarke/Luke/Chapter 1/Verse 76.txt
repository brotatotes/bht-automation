<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:76">Luke 1:76</span>. <i><b>And thou, child</b></i>, c.] Zacharias proclaims the dignity, employment, doctrine, and success of his son and the ruin and recovery of the Jews and the Gentiles.</p>
<p>1. His <i>dignity</i>. <i>Thou shalt be called</i> (constituted) <i>a prophet of</i> <i>the Most High</i>. <i>Prophet</i> has two acceptations:-</p>
<p>1st. A person who <i>foretells future events</i>; and;</p>
<p>2dly. A <i>teacher</i> of men in the things of God, 1Co 14:3.</p>
<p>John was a prophet in <i>both</i> senses: he proclaimed the mercy which <i>should</i> be communicated; announced the baptism of the Holy Spirit; and <i>taught</i> men how to leave their sins, and how to find the salvation of God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:5-14">Luke 3:5-14</span>. His very name, <i>Jehochanan</i>, the <i>grace</i> or <i>mercy of Jehovah</i>, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:60">Luke 1:60</span>,) was a constant <i>prediction</i> of the salvation of God. Our Lord terms him the <i>greatest prophet</i> which had ever appeared in the world. He had the honour of being the <i>last</i> and <i>clearest</i> prophet of the <i>old</i> covenant, and the <i>first</i> of the <i>new</i>.</p>
<p>2. His <i>employment</i>. <i>Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to</i> <i>prepare his ways</i>. He should be the <i>immediate</i> forerunner of Jesus Christ, none being capable of <i>succeeding</i> him in his ministry but Christ himself. He was to <i>prepare his ways</i>, to be the honoured instrument, in the hands of God, of disposing the hearts of multitudes of the Israelites to believe in and follow the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>3. Zacharias points out the <i>doctrine</i> or <i>teaching</i> of John. It should be γνωσις σωτηριας, <i>the science of salvation</i>. Men are <i>ignorant</i>, and they must be <i>instructed</i>. Human <i>sciences</i> may be profitable in <i>earthly</i> matters, but cannot profit the <i>soul</i>. The <i>science</i> that teaches God must come from God. No science is of any avail to the <i>soul</i> that does not bring <i>salvation</i> with it: this is the excellence of heavenly science, and an excellence that is <i>peculiar</i> to itself. No science but that which comes from God can ever save a soul from the <i>power</i>, the <i>guilt</i>, and the <i>pollution</i> of sin.</p>
<p>4. Zacharias predicts the <i>success</i> of his son's ministry. Under his preaching, the people should be directed to that <i>tender mercy</i> of God, through which they might obtain the <i>remission of their</i> <i>sins</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:77-78">Luke 1:77-78</span>. Those who are sent by God, and preach <i>his</i> truth, and <i>his</i> only, shall always be successful in their work; for it is for this very purpose that God has sent them; and it would be a marvellous thing, indeed, should <i>they</i> labour in vain. But there never was such a case, since God made man, in which a preacher was Divinely commissioned to preach Jesus and his salvation, and yet had <i>no fruit</i> of his labour.</p>
<p>5. Zacharias points out the <i>wretched state</i> in which the inhabitants of <i>Judea</i> and the <i>Gentile</i> world were then found.</p>
<p>(1) Their <i>feet</i> had wandered <i>out of the way of peace</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79">Luke 1:79</span>,) of temporal and spiritual prosperity.</p>
<p>(2) They had got into a state of <i>darkness </i>- they were blind concerning the things of God, and the things which belonged to their salvation.</p>
<p>(3) They had become <i>contented</i> inhabitants of this land of intellectual <i>darkness </i>- they had sat down in it, and were not concerned to get out of it.</p>
<p>(4) They were about to perish in it - <i>death</i> had his <i>dominion</i> there; and his swift approaches to them were now manifested to the prophet by seeing his <i>shadow</i> cast upon them.</p>
<p>Ignorance of God and salvation is the <i>shadow of death</i>; and the <i>substance</i>, eternal ruin, is essentially connected with the projected shadow. See these phrases explained at large on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:16">Matthew 4:16</span>.</p>
<p>6. Zacharias proclaims the <i>recovery</i> of a lost world. As the removal of this darkness, and redemption from this death, were now at hand, John is represented as being a <i>day-spring</i> from on high, a <i>morning star</i>, that foretold the speedy approach of the <i>day</i>, and the <i>rising</i> of the <i>Sun of righteousness</i>. That these words should be applied to <i>John</i>, and not to <i>Christ</i>, I am fully satisfied; and cannot give my reasons better for the arrangement I have made in the preceding notes, than in the words of an eminent critic, who, I find, has adopted nearly the same plan with myself. The passage, as I read it, is as follows: <i>Through the tender mercy of our God,</i> <i>by which he hath visited us: a day-spring from on high, to give</i> <i>light to them that sit in the darkness and in the shadow of death</i>, c. "Let the reader judge, whether my arrangement of this passage, which much better suits the original, be not far more elegant, and in all respects superior to the old translation. <i>Thou, child! wilt</i> <i>be a teacher-THOU WILT BE a day-spring from the sky</i>. And with what beauty and propriety is <i>John</i>, the <i>forerunner</i> of our Lord, styled <i>the dawn of day</i>, that ushers in the <i>rising</i> of the <i>Sun of</i> <i>righteousness</i>! And the concluding words - <i>to guide our feet into the</i> <i>way of peace </i>- is a comprehensive clause, after the manner of Hebrew poetry, belonging equally to the former sentence, beginning at - <i>And</i> <i>thou, child</i>! - and the latter, beginning at - <i>A day-spring from the</i> <i>sky</i>: for the people spoken of in the former are the <i>Jews</i> and in the latter, the <i>Gentiles</i>." - WAKEFIELD.</p>
