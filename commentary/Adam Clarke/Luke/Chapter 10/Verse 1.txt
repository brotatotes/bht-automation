<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span>. <i><b>The Lord appointed other seventy</b></i> — Rather, <i>seventy</i> <i>others</i>, not <i>other seventy</i>, as our translation has it, which seems to intimate that he had appointed seventy <i>before</i> this time, though, probably, the word <i>other</i> has a reference to the <i>twelve</i> chosen first: he not only chose twelve disciples to be constantly with him but he chose seventy others to go <i>before</i> him. Our blessed Lord formed every thing in his Church on the model of the Jewish Church; and why? Because it was the pattern shown by God himself, the Divine <i>form</i>, which pointed out the <i>heavenly substance</i> which now began to be established in its place. As he before had chosen <i>twelve</i> apostles, in reference to the <i>twelve patriarchs</i>, who were the chiefs of the <i>twelve tribes</i>, and the heads of the Jewish Church, he now <i>publicly appointed</i> (for so the word ανεδειζεν means) <i>seventy</i> others, as Moses did the <i>seventy</i> elders whom he associated with himself to assist him in the government of the people. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+18:19">Exodus 18:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:1-9">Exodus 24:1-9</span>. These Christ sent by <i>two</i> and <i>two</i>:</p>
<p>1. To teach them the necessity of <i>concord</i> among the ministers of righteousness.</p>
<p>2. That in the mouths of two witnesses every thing might be established. And,</p>
<p>3. That they might comfort and support each other in their difficult labour. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span>.</p>
<p>Several MSS. and versions have <i>seventy-two</i>. Sometimes the Jews chose six out of each tribe: this was the number of the great Sanhedrin. The names of these seventy disciples are found in the margin of some ancient MSS., but this authority is questionable.</p>
