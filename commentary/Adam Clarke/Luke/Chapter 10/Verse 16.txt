Verse Luke 10:16. He that despiseth you, despiseth me â€” "The holy, blessed God said: 'Honour my statutes, for they are my ambassadors: and a man's ambassador is like to himself. If thou honour my precepts, it is the same as if thou didst honour me; and if thou despise them, thou despisest me." R. Tancum. "He that murmurs against his teacher is the same as if he had murmured against the Divine Shekinah." Sanhedrin, fol. 110.
