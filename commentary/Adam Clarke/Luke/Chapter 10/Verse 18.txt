<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span>. <i><b>I beheld Satan</b></i> — Or, <i>Satan himself</i>, τον σαταναν, <i>the</i> <i>very Satan</i>, the <i>supreme adversary</i>, falling as lightning, with the utmost <i>suddenness</i>, as a flash of lightning falls from the clouds, and at the same time in the most <i>observable</i> manner. The fall was both very <i>sudden</i> and very <i>apparent</i>. Thus should the fall of the corrupt Jewish state be, and thus was the fall of idolatry in the Gentile world.</p>
