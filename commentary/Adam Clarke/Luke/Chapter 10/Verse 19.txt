<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:19">Luke 10:19</span>. <i><b>To tread on serpents</b></i>, c.] It is possible that by <i>serpents</i> and <i>scorpions</i> our Lord means the <i>scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>, whom he calls <i>serpents</i> and a <i>brood of vipers</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:33">Matthew 23:33</span>, (see the note there,) because, through the subtilty and venom of the old <i>serpent</i>, the devil, they <i>opposed</i> him and his doctrine and, by <i>trampling</i> on these, it is likely that he means, they should get a <i>complete victory</i> over such: as it was an ancient custom to trample on the kings and generals who had been taken in battle, to signify the complete conquest which had been gained over them.
