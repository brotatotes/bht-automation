<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:2">Luke 10:2</span>. <i><b>That he would send forth</b></i> — εκβαλη. There seems to be an allusion here to the case of reapers, who, though the harvest was perfectly ripe, yet were in <i>no hurry</i> to cut it down. News of this is brought to the <i>Lord of the harvest</i> the <i>farmer</i>, and he is entreated to exert his authority, and hurry them out; and this he does because the harvest is spoiling for want of being reaped and gathered in.
