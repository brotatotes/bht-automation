<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:20">Luke 10:20</span>. <i><b>Because your names are written in heaven.</b></i> â€” This form of speech is taken from the ancient custom of writing the names of all the citizens in a public register, that the several families might be known, and the inheritances properly preserved. This custom is still observed even in these kingdoms, though not particularly noticed. Every child that is born in the land is ordered to be <i>registered</i>, with the names of its parents, and the time when born, baptized, or registered; and this register is generally kept in the parish church, or in some public place of safety. Such a register as this is called in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>, c., <i>the book of life</i>, i.e. the book or register where the persons were enrolled as they <i>came into life</i>. It appears also probable, that when any person died, or behaved improperly, his name was sought out and erased from the book, to prevent any confusion that might happen in consequence of improper persons laying claim to an estate, and to cut off the <i>unworthy</i> from the rights and privileges of the peaceable, upright citizens. To this custom of blotting the names of deceased and disorderly persons out of the public registers, there appear to be allusions, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:32">Exodus 32:32</span>, where see the note and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+9:14">Deuteronomy 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+25:19">Deuteronomy 25:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+29:20">Deuteronomy 29:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+14:27">2 Kings 14:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:28">Psalms 69:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:13">Psalms 109:13</span>, and in other places.</p>
