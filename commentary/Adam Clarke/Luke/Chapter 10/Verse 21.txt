<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>. <i><b>Rejoiced in spirit</b></i> — Was truly and heartily joyous: felt an inward triumph. But τῳ πνευματι, τῳ ἁγιῳ, <i>the HOLY Spirit</i>, is the reading here of BCDKL, <i>six</i> others; the <i>three Syriac</i>, later <i>Persic, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, all the <i>Itala</i> except one, and <i>Augustin</i> and <i>Bede</i>. These might be considered sufficient authority to admit the word into the text.</p>
<p><i><b>I thank thee</b></i> — Bishop PEARCE justly observes, the thanks are meant to be given to God for revealing them to babes, not for hiding them from the others. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou hast hid</b></i> — That is, thou hast <i>not revealed</i> them to the scribes and Pharisees, who idolized their own wisdom; but thou <i>hast revealed</i> them to the simple and humble of heart.</p>
