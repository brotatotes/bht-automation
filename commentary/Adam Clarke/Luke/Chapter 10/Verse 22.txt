<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span>. The Codex Alexandrinus, several other very ancient MSS., and some ancient versions, as well as the <i>margin</i> of our <i>own</i>, begin this verse with, <i>And turning to his disciples, he said</i>. But as this clause begins <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:23">Luke 10:23</span>, it is not likely that it was originally in both. <i>Griesbach</i> has left these words out of the text, and Professor WHITE says, <i>Certissime</i> delenda, "These words should most assuredly be erased."</p>
