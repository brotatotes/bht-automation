Verse Luke 10:22. The Codex Alexandrinus, several other very ancient MSS., and some ancient versions, as well as the margin of our own, begin this verse with, And turning to his disciples, he said. But as this clause begins Luke 10:23, it is not likely that it was originally in both. Griesbach has left these words out of the text, and Professor WHITE says, Certissime delenda, "These words should most assuredly be erased."Ver. 22. All things are delivered to me â€” Matthew 11:27; Matthew 11:27.
