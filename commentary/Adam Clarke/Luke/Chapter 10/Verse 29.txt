<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Willing to justify himself</b></i> — Wishing to make it appear that he was a <i>righteous</i> man, and that consequently he was in the straight road to the kingdom of God, said, <i>Who is my neighbour</i>? supposing our Lord would have at once answered, "Every Jew is to be considered as such, and the Jews only." Now as he imagined he had never been deficient in his conduct to any person of his <i>own</i> <i>nation</i>, he thought he had amply fulfilled the law. This is the sense in which the Jews understood the word <i>neighbour</i>, as may be seen from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+19:15-18">Leviticus 19:15-18</span>. But our Lord shows here, that the acts of kindness which a man is bound to perform to his neighbour when in distress, he should perform to <i>any</i> person, of whatever <i>nation,</i> <i>religion</i>, or <i>kindred</i>, whom he finds in necessity. As the word πλησιον signifies one who is <i>near</i>, Anglo Saxon [A.S.], he that is <i>next</i>, this very circumstance makes any person our neighbour whom we <i>know</i>; and, if in <i>distress</i>, an object of our most compassionate regards. If a man came from the most <i>distant</i> part of the earth, the moment he is <i>near</i> you he has a claim upon your <i>mercy</i> and <i>kindness</i>, as you would have on his, were <i>your</i> dwelling-place transferred to <i>his</i> native country. It is evident that our Lord uses the word πλησιον (very properly translated neighbour, from <i>nae</i> or <i>naer</i>, near, and <i>buer</i>, to dwell) in its plain, literal sense. Any person whom you <i>know</i>, who <i>dwells hard</i> by, or who <i>passes</i> near you, is your <i>neighbour</i> while <i>within</i> your <i>reach</i>.</p>
