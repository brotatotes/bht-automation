Verse 30. And Jesus answering — Rather, Then Jesus took him up. This I believe to be the meaning of the word υπολαβων; he threw out a challenge, and our Lord took him up on his own ground. See WAKEFIELD'S Testament.A certain man went down from Jerusalem — Or, A certain man of Jerusalem going down to Jericho. This was the most public road in all Judea, as it was the grand thoroughfare between these two cities for the courses of priests, twelve thousand of whom are said to have resided at Jericho. See Lightfoot.Fell among thieves — At this time the whole land of Judea was much infested with hordes of banditti; and it is not unlikely that many robberies might have been committed on that very road to which our Lord refers.
