<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:31">Luke 10:31</span>. <i><b>And by chance</b></i> — κατα συγκυριαν properly means the <i>coincidence</i> of <i>time</i> and <i>circumstance</i>. At the time in which the poor Jew was half dead, through the wounds which he had received, a priest came where he was. So the <i>priest's</i> coming <i>while</i> the <i>man</i> was in that <i>state</i> is the <i>coincidence</i> marked out by the original words.</p>
