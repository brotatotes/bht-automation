<p>Verse 37. <i><b>He that showed mercy</b></i> — Or, <i>so much mercy</i>. His <i>prejudice</i> would not permit him to name the <i>Samaritan</i>, yet his <i>conscience</i> obliged him to acknowledge that he was the only righteous person of the three.</p>
<p><i><b>Go, and do thou likewise</b></i> — Be even to thy enemy in distress as kind, humane, and merciful, as this Samaritan was. As the <i>distress</i> was on the part of a <i>Jew</i>, and the <i>relief</i> was afforded by a <i>Samaritan</i>, the lawyer, to be consistent with the decision he had already given, must feel the force of our Lord's inference, that it was <i>his</i> duty to act to any person, of whatever nation or religion he might be, as this <i>Samaritan</i> had acted toward his countryman. It is very likely that what our Lord relates here was a real matter of fact, and not a <i>parable</i>; otherwise the captious lawyer might have objected that no such case had ever existed, and that any inference drawn from it was only begging the question; but as he was, in all probability, in possession of the fact himself, he was forced to acknowledge the propriety of our Lord's inference and advice.</p>
<p>Those who are determined to find something allegorical, even in the plainest portions of Scripture, affirm that the whole of this relation is to be allegorically considered; and, according to them, the following is the true exposition of the text.</p>
<p>The <i>certain man</i> means <i>Adam - went down</i>, his <i>fall </i>- from <i>Jerusalem, </i>יראה שלום yorih shalom, he shall see peace, perfection, c., meaning his state of primitive innocence and excellence - <i>to</i> <i>Jericho</i>, (ירחי yareacho, his moon,) the <i>transitory</i> and <i>changeable</i> state of existence in this world - <i>thieves</i>, sin and Satan - <i>stripped</i>, took away his righteousness, which was the clothing of the soul-<i>wounded</i>, infected his heart with all evil and hurtful desires, which are the wounds of the spirit - <i>half dead</i>, possessing a <i>living body</i>, carrying about a <i>soul dead</i> in sin.</p>
<p><i>The priest</i>, the moral law - the <i>Levite</i>, the ceremonial law - <i>passed</i> <i>by</i>, either <i>could</i> not or <i>would</i> not afford any relief, because by the law is the <i>knowledge</i> of sin, not the <i>cure</i> of it. <i>A certain </i> <i>Samaritan</i>, Christ for so he was called by the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span> - <i>as he journeyed</i>, meaning his coming from heaven to earth; his being <i>incarnated - came where he was</i>, put himself in man's place, and bore the punishment due to his sins - <i>had compassion</i>, it is through the love and compassion of Christ that the work of redemption was accomplished - <i>went to him</i>, Christ first <i>seeks</i> the sinner, who, through his miserable estate, is incapable of <i>seeking</i> or <i>going to</i> Christ - <i>bound up his wounds</i>, gives him comfortable promises, and draws him by his love - <i>pouring in oil</i>, pardoning <i>mercy - wine</i>, the consolations of the <i>Holy Ghost - set him on his own</i> <i>beast</i>, supported him <i>entirely</i> by his grace and goodness, so that <i>he</i> no longer lives, but Christ lives in him - <i>took him to an inn</i>, his <i>Church</i>, uniting him with his people - <i>took care of him</i>, placed him under the continual notice of his providence and love - <i>when he</i> <i>departed</i>, when he left the world and ascended to the Father - <i>took</i> <i>out two pence</i>, or denarii, the <i>law</i> and the <i>Gospel</i>; the one to convince of sin, the other to show how it is to be removed - <i>gave</i> <i>them to the host</i>, the ministers of the Gospel for the edification of the Church of Christ - <i>take care of him</i>, as they are Gods watchmen and God's stewards, they are to watch over the flock of Christ, and give to each his portion of meat in due season. <i>What</i> <i>thou spendest more</i>, if thou shouldst lose thy <i>health</i> and <i>life</i> in this work - <i>when I come again</i>, to judge the world, <i>I will repay</i> <i>thee</i>, I will reward thee with an eternity of glory.</p>
<p>Several primitive and modern fathers treat the text in this way. What I have given <i>before</i> is, I believe, the meaning of our blessed Lord. What I have given here is <i>generally true</i> in <i>itself</i>, but certainly does not follow from the text. Mr. Baxter's note here is good: "They who make the wounded man Adam, and the good Samaritan Christ, abuse the passage." A practice of this kind cannot be too strongly reprehended. Men may take that advantage of the circumstances of the case to illustrate the above facts and doctrines; but let no man say this is the <i>meaning</i> of the relation; no: but he may say, we may make this use of it. Though I cannot recommend this kind of preaching, yet I know that some simple upright souls have been edified by it. I dare not forbid a man to work by whom God may choose to work a miracle, because he follows not with us. But such a mode of interpretation I can never recommend.</p>
