<p>Verse 38. <i><b>A certain village</b></i> — If this village was Bethany, where Martha and Mary lived, at less than two miles' distance from Jerusalem, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:1">John 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:18">John 11:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:2">John 12:2</span>, then this must have happened <i>later</i> than Luke places it; because, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:29">Luke 19:29</span>, he represents Jesus as having arrived after this at Bethany; and what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:22">Luke 13:22</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11">Luke 17:11</span>, seems to confirm that this visit of Jesus to Martha and Mary ought to be placed later.

<p><i><b>Received him</b></i> — <i>Kindly received</i>, υπεδεξατο, she <i>received</i> him in a <i>friendly</i> manner, <i>under her roof</i>; and entertained him <i>hospitably</i>. So the word is used in the best Greek writers. Martha is supposed by some to have been a <i>widow</i>, with whom her brother Lazarus and sister Mary lodged.</p>
