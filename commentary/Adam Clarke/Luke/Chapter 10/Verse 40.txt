<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</span>. <i><b>Martha was cumbered</b></i> — περιεσπατο, <i>perplexed</i>, from περι, <i>about</i>, and σπαω, <i>I draw</i>. She was harassed with different cares and employments at the same time; one drawing one way, and another, another: a proper description of a worldly mind. But in Martha's favour it may be justly said, that all her anxiety was to provide <i>suitable</i> and <i>timely</i> entertainment for our Lord and his disciples; for this is the sense in which the word διακοςιας, <i>serving</i>, should be taken. And we should not, on the merest supposition, attribute earthly-mindedness to a woman whose character stands unimpeachable in the Gospel; and who, by entertaining Christ and his disciples, and providing liberally for them, gave the highest proof that she was influenced by liberality and benevolence, and not by parsimony or covetousness.</p>
<p><i><b>Dost thou not care</b></i> — Dost thou not think it wrong, that my sister thus leaves me to provide and prepare this supper, <i>alone</i>?</p>
<p><i><b>Help me.</b></i> — συναντιλαβηται, from συν, <i>together</i>, and αντιλαμβανομαι, <i>to support</i>. The idea is taken from two pillars meeting together at the top, exactly over the <i>centre</i> of the distance between their bases, and thus mutually supporting each other. Order her to <i>unite</i> her skill and strength with mine, that the present business may be done with that <i>speed</i> and in that order which the necessity and importance of the case demand.</p>
