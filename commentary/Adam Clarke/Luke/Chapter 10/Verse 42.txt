<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:42">Luke 10:42</span>. <i><b>One thing is needful</b></i> — This is the end of the sentence, according to <i>Bengel</i>. "Now Mary hath chosen, c.," begins a new one. One single dish, the simplest and plainest possible, is such as best suits me and my disciples, whose meat and drink it is to do the will of our heavenly Father.</p>
<p><i><b>Mary hath chosen that good part</b></i> — That is, of hearing my word, of which she shall not be deprived it being at present of infinitely greater importance to attend to my teaching than to attend to any domestic concerns. While thou art busily employed in providing that portion of perishing food for perishing bodies, Mary has chosen that spiritual <i>portion</i> which endures for ever, and which shall not be taken away from her; therefore I cannot command her to leave her present employment, and go and help thee to bring forward a variety of matters, which are by no means necessary at this time. Our Lord both preached and practised the doctrine of self-denial; he and his disciples were contented with a <i>little</i>, and sumptuous entertainments are condemned by the spirit and design of his Gospel. </p>
<p>THAT the salvation of the soul is the first and greatest of all human concerns, every man must acknowledge who feels that he has a soul; and in humility of mind to hear Jesus, is the only way of getting that acquaintance with the doctrine of salvation without which how can he be saved? While we fancy we are in no spiritual <i>necessity</i>, the things which concern salvation will not appear <i>needful</i> to us! A conviction that we are spiritually poor must precede our application for the true riches. The <i>whole</i>, says Christ, need not the <i>physician</i>, but those who are <i>sick</i>. Martha has been blamed, by incautious people, as possessing a carnal, worldly spirit; and as Mary Magdalene has been made the chief of all prostitutes, so has Martha of all the worldly-minded. Through her affectionate respect for our Lord and his disciples, and through that alone, she erred. There is not the slightest intimation that she was either worldly-minded or careless about her soul; nor was she at this time improperly employed, only so far as the abundance of her affection led her to make a greater provision than was necessary on the occasion. Nor are our Lord's words to be understood as a reproof; they are a kind and tender expostulation, tending to vindicate the conduct of Mary. The utmost that can be said on the subject is, Martha was <i>well</i> employed, but Mary, on this occasion, <i>better</i>.</p>
<p>If we attend to the punctuation of the original text, the subject will appear more plain. I shall transcribe the text from Bengel's own edition, Stutgardiae, 1734, 12mo. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:41">Luke 10:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:42">Luke 10:42</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:42">Luke 10:42</span>. αποκριθεις δε ειπεν αυτῃ ὁ Ιησους, Μαρθα, Μαρθα, μεριμνᾳς και τυρβαζῃ περι πολλα· ἑνος δε εϚι χρεια. Μαρια δε την αγαθην μεριδα εξελεξατο, ἡτις ουκ αφαιρεθησεται απ' αυτης. "Then Jesus answered her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxiously careful and disturbed about many things; but one thing is necessary. But Mary hath chosen that good portion which shall not be taken away from her." I have shown, in my notes, <i>that Martha was making a greater</i> <i>provision for her guests than was needful</i>; that it was in consequence of this that she required her sister's help; that Jesus tenderly reproved her for her unnecessary anxiety and superabundant provision, and asserted that but <i>one thing</i>, call it <i>course</i> or <i>dish, was necessary</i> on the occasion, yet she had provided <i>many</i>; and that this needless provision was the cause of the anxiety and extra labour. Then, taking occasion, from the circumstances of the case, to vindicate Mary's conduct, and to direct his loving reproof more pointedly at Martha's heart, he adds, <i>Mary hath chosen a good portion</i>; that is, she avails herself of the present opportunity to hear my teaching, and inform herself in those things which are essential to the salvation of the soul. I cannot, therefore, order her to leave my teaching, to serve in what I know to be an <i>unnecessary service</i>, however kindly designed: for it would be as unjust to deprive <i>her</i> of this <i>bread of life</i>, after which she so earnestly hungers, as to deprive thee, or thy <i>guests</i>, of that measure of <i>common food</i> necessary to sustain life. All earthly portions are perishing: "<i>Meats for the belly,</i> <i>and the belly for meats, but God will destroy both it and then;</i> <i>but the work of the Lord abideth for ever</i>;" her portion, therefore, <i>shall not be taken away from her</i>. This is my view of the whole subject; and all the terms in the original, not only countenance this meaning, but necessarily require it. The words, <i>one thing is needful</i>, on which we lay so much stress, are wanting in some of the most ancient MSS., and are <i>omitted</i> by some of the <i>fathers</i>, who quote all the rest of the passage: a plain proof that the meaning which we take out of them was not thought of in very ancient times; and in other MSS., versions, and fathers, there is an unusual <i>variety of readings</i> where even the <i>thing</i>, or <i>something like it</i>, is retained. Some have it thus; <i>Martha, Martha, thou labourest much, and yet a little is</i> <i>sufficient, yea, one thing only</i>. Others: <i>And only one thing is</i> <i>required</i>. Others: <i>Thou art curious and embarrassed about many</i> <i>things, when that which is needful is very small</i>. Others: <i>But here</i> <i>there need only a few things</i>. Others: <i>But a few things, or one</i> <i>only, is necessary</i>. Now these are the readings of <i>almost all</i> the ancient <i>versions</i>; and we plainly perceive, by them, that what we term the <i>one thing needful</i>, is not understood by one of them as referring to the <i>salvation of the soul</i>, but to the <i>provision</i> THEN to be made. It would be easy to multiply authorities, but I spare both my own time and that of my reader. In short, I wonder how the present most exceptionable mode of interpretation ever obtained; as having no countenance in the <i>text</i>, ancient MSS. or <i>versions</i>, and as being false in itself; for even Christ himself could not say, that <i>sitting at his feet</i>, and <i>hearing his word</i>, was the ONE <i>thing</i> NEEDFUL. Repentance, faith, <i>prayer</i>, obedience, and a thousand other things are necessary to our salvation, besides merely <i>hearing the doctrines of Christ</i>, even with the <i>humblest</i> <i>heart</i>.</p>
