<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:12">Luke 11:12</span>. <i><b>Offer him a scorpion?</b></i> — σκορπιον. The Greek etymologists derive the name from σκορπιζειν τον ιον, <i>scattering</i> <i>the poison</i>. But is there any <i>similitude</i> between a <i>scorpion</i> and an <i>egg</i>, that the one might be given and taken in <i>place</i> of the other? We know there is the utmost similitude between some <i>fish</i>, especially those of the <i>eel</i> kind, and <i>serpents</i>: and that there are <i>stones</i> exactly similar to <i>bread</i> in their appearance; from which we may conjecture that our Lord intended to convey the same idea of similitude between an <i>egg</i> and a <i>scorpion</i>. Perhaps the word scorpion here may be used for any kind of serpent that proceeds from an egg, or the word <i>egg</i> may be understood: the common snake is <i>oviparous</i>; it brings forth a number of <i>eggs</i>, out of which the young ones are hatched. If he asks an egg, will he, for one that might <i>nourish</i> him, give him <i>that</i> of a <i>serpent</i>. But Bochart states, <i>that the body of a scorpion is like to an egg, especially</i> <i>if it be a white scorpion; which sort</i> Nicander, AElian, Avicenna, <i>and others, maintain to be the first species. Nor do scorpions</i> <i>differ much in size from an egg in Judea, if we may credit what</i> <i>the monks of Messua say, that there are about Jerusalem, and</i> <i>through all Syria, great scorpions</i>, c. <i>Hieroz</i>. l. iv. cap. xxix. col. 641, edit. 1692. To this it may be said, there may be such a <i>similitude</i>, between a white scorpion and an egg, if the <i>legs</i> and <i>tail</i> of the former be taken away but how there can be a resemblance any other way, I know not. It is, however, a fact, that the <i>alligator</i> and <i>crocodile</i> come from eggs; two of those lie now before me, scarcely so large as the egg of the goose, longer, but not so thick. Now, suppose reference be made to one such egg, in which the young crocodile is hatched, and is ready to burst from its enclosure, would any father give such an egg to a hungry child? No. If the child asked an egg, he would not, instead of a proper one, give him that of the crocodile or the alligator, in which the young serpent was hatched, and from which it was just ready to be separated.</p>
