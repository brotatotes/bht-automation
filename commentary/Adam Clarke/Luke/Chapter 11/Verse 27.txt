<p>Verse 27. <i><b>A certain woman - lifted up her voice, and said</b></i> â€” It was very natural for a <i>woman</i>, who was probably a <i>mother</i>, to exclaim thus. She thought that the happiness of the woman who was mother to such a son was great indeed; but our blessed Lord shows her that even the holy virgin could not be benefited by her merely being the mother of his human nature, and that they only were happy who carried Christ in their hearts. True happiness is found in <i>hearing</i> the glad tidings of salvation by Christ Jesus, and <i>keeping</i> them in a holy heart, and practising them in an unblamable life.</p>
