<p>Verse 31. <i><b>The queen of the south</b></i>, &amp;c.] Perhaps it would be better to translate, <i>A queen of the south, and the men of this </i> <i>race, shall rise up in judgment</i>, &amp;c. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:7">Luke 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:7">Luke 11:7</span></span>. The 32d verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:32">Luke 11:32</span> may be read in the same way.</p>
