<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:36">Luke 11:36</span>. <i><b>The whole shall be full of light</b></i> â€” Or, <i>altogether</i> <i>enlightened</i>; i.e. when the eye is perfect, it enlightens the whole body. Every object within the reach of the eye is as completely seen as if there was an eye in every part. So the eye is to every part of the body what the lamp is to every part of the house.</p>
<p>When the light of Christ dwells fully in the heart, it extends its influence to every <i>thought, word</i>, and <i>action</i>; and directs its possessor how he is to act in all <i>places</i> and <i>circumstances</i>. It is of the utmost importance to have the soul properly influenced by the wisdom that comes from above. The doctrine that is <i>contrary</i> to the Gospel may say, <i>Ignorance is the mother of devotion</i>; but Christ shows that there can be no devotion without heavenly light. Ignorance is the mother of superstition; but with this the heavenly <i>light</i> has nothing to do.</p>
