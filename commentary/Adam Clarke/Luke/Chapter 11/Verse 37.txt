<p>Verse 37. <i><b>To dine</b></i> — οπως αριστηση. The word αριστειν dignifies the <i>first</i> eating of the day. The Jews made but <i>two</i> meals in the day; their αριστον may be called their <i>breakfast</i> or their <i>dinner,</i> because it was <i>both</i>, and was but a slight meal. Their chief meal was their δειπνον or supper, after the heat of the day was over; and the same was the principal meal among the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>. <i>Josephus</i>, in his Life, says, sect. 54, <i>that the legal hour of</i> <i>the</i> αριστον, <i>on the Sabbath, was the sixth hour</i>, or at twelve o'clock at noon, as we call it. What the hour was on the other days of the week, he does not say; but probably it was much the same. Bishop PEARCE.</p>
