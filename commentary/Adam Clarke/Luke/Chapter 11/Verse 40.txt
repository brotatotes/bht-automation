<p>Verse 40. <i><b>Did not he that made that which is without</b></i> â€” Did not the maker of the dish form it so, both outwardly and inwardly, as to answer the purpose for which it was made? And can it answer this purpose without being clean in the inside as well as on the outside? God has made you such, both as to your bodies and souls, as he intended should show forth his praise; but can you think that the purpose of God can be accomplished by you while you only attend to <i>external</i> legal purifications, your hearts being full of rapine and wickedness? How unthinking are you to imagine that God can be pleased with this <i>outward</i> purification, when all <i>within</i> is unholy!</p>
