<p>Verse 41. <i><b>Give alms of such things as ye have</b></i> — Meaning either what was within the <i>dishes</i> spoken of before; or what was within their <i>houses</i> or <i>power</i>: or what they had <i>at hand</i>, for so τα ενοντα is used by the purest Greek writers. Cease from <i>rapine</i>: far from spoiling the poor by wicked exactions, rather <i>give</i> them alms of every thing you <i>possess</i>; and when a <i>part</i> of every thing you <i>have</i> is sincerely consecrated to God for the use of the poor, then all that remains will be <i>clean</i> unto you; you will have the blessing of God in your basket and store, and every thing will be sanctified to you. These verses are very difficult, and are variously translated and interpreted by critics and divines. I have given what I believe to be our Lord's meaning, in the preceding paraphrase.
