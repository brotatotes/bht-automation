<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Ye are as graves which appear not</b></i> â€” In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:27">Matthew 23:27</span>, our Lord tells them that they <i>exactly resembled white-washed tombs</i>: they had no fairness but on the <i>outside</i>: (see the note there:) but here he says they are like <i>hidden tombs</i>, graves which were not distinguished by any outward decorations, and were not elevated above the ground, so that those who walked over them did not consider what corruption was within; so they, under the <i>veil</i> of hypocrisy, covered their iniquities, so that those who had any intercourse or connection with them did not perceive what accomplished knaves they had to do with.</p>
