<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Truly ye bear witness</b></i> â€” Ye acknowledge that those of old who killed the prophets were your <i>fathers</i>, and ye are about to show, by your conduct towards me and my apostles, that ye are not <i>degenerated</i>, that <i>ye</i> are as capable of murdering a prophet <i>now</i>, as <i>they</i> were <i>of old</i>.</p>
