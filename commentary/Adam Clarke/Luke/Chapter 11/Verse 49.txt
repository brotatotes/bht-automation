<p>Verse 49. <i><b>The wisdom of God</b></i> â€” These seem to be Luke's words, and to mean that Jesus, <i>the wisdom of God</i>, (as he is called, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>,) added the words which follow here, on that occasion: and this interpretation of the words is agreeable to that of Matthew, who makes Jesus speak in his own person: <i>Wherefore behold, I send you prophets</i>, &amp;c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span>. See the note there, and see Bishop PEARCE.</p>
