<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:51">Luke 11:51</span>. <i><b>From the blood of Abel</b></i> — See this subject explained at large on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Required</b></i> — εκζητηθησεται may be translated either by the word <i>visited</i> or <i>revenged</i>, and the latter word evidently conveys the meaning of our Lord. They are here represented as having this blood among them; and it is intimated that God will come by and by to <i>require</i> it, and to <i>inquire</i> how it was shed, and to <i>punish</i> those who shed it.</p>
