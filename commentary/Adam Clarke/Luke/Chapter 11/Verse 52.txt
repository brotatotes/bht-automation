Verse Luke 11:52. Ye have taken away the key of knowledge â€” By your traditions ye have taken away the true method of interpreting the prophecies: ye have given a wrong meaning to those scriptures which speak of the kingdom of the Messiah, and the people are thereby hindered from entering into it. Matthew 23:13.
