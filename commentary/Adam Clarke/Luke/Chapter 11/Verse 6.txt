<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:6">Luke 11:6</span>. <i><b>In his journey is come</b></i> — Or, perhaps more literally, <i>A</i> <i>friend of mine is come to me out of his way</i>, εξ οδου, which renders the case more urgent-a friend of mine, benighted, belated, and who has lost his way, is come unto me. This was a strong reason why he should have prompt relief.</p>
