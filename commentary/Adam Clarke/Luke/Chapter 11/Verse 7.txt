<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:7">Luke 11:7</span>. <i><b>My children are with me in bed</b></i> — Or, <i>I and my children</i> <i>are in bed</i>; this is Bishop PEARCE'S translation, and seems to some preferable to the common one. See a like form of speech in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:11">1 Corinthians 16:11</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span>. However, we may conceive that he had his little children, ταπαιδια, in bed with him; and this heightened the difficulty of yielding to his neighbour's request.</p>
<p><i>But if he persevere knocking</i>. (<i>At si ille perseveraverit</i> <i>pulsans</i>.) This sentence is added to the beginning of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:8">Luke 11:8</span>, by the <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, four copies of the <i>Itala, Ambrose,</i> <i>Augustin</i>, and <i>Bede</i>. On these authorities (as I find it in no Greek MS.) I cannot insert it as a <i>part</i> of the original text; but it is necessarily <i>implied</i>; for, as Bishop Pearce justly observes, unless the man in the parable be represented as <i>continuing</i> to solicit his friend, he could not possibly be said to use <i>importunity</i>: once only to ask is not to be importunate.</p>
