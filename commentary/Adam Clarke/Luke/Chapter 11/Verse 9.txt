<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:9">Luke 11:9</span>. <i><b>And</b></i> (or, <i>therefore</i>) <i><b>I say unto you, Ask</b></i> â€” Be importunate with God, not so much to prevail on <i>him</i> to save you, as to get yourselves brought into a proper disposition to receive that mercy which he is ever disposed to give. He who is not importunate for the salvation of his soul does not feel the need of being saved; and were God to communicate his mercy to such they could not be expected to be grateful for it, as favours are only prized and esteemed in proportion to the sense men have of their necessity and importance. See this subject explained <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7-8">Matthew 7:7-8</span>.</p>
