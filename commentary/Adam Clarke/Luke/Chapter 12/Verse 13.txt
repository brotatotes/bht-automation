<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:13">Luke 12:13</span>. <i><b>Speak to my brother, that he divide</b></i> â€” Among the Jews, the children had the inheritance of their fathers divided among them; the eldest had a double portion, but all the rest had equal parts. It is likely the person complained of in the text was the elder brother; and he wished to keep the whole to himself-a case which is far from being uncommon. The spirit of <i>covetousness</i> cancels all bonds and obligations, makes wrong right, and cares nothing for father or brother.</p>
