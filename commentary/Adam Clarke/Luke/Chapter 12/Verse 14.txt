<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:14">Luke 12:14</span>. <i><b>A judge</b></i> â€” Without some judgment given in the case, no division could be made; therefore Jesus added the word <i>judge</i>. PEARCE. A minister of Christ ought not to concern himself with <i>secular</i> affairs, any farther than charity and the order of discipline require it. Our Lord could have decided this difference in a moment; but the example of a perfect disengagement from worldly things was more necessary for the ministers of his Church than that of a charity applying itself to temporal concerns. He who preaches salvation to <i>all</i> should never make himself a <i>party</i> <i>man</i>; otherwise he loses the confidence, and consequently the opportunity of doing good to the party against whom he decides. Better to leave all these things to the civil magistrate, unless where a lawsuit may be prevented, and the matter decided to the satisfaction or acquiescence of both parties.</p>
