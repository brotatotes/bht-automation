<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:15">Luke 12:15</span>. <i><b>Beware of covetousness</b></i> — Or rather, <i>Beware of all</i> <i>inordinate desires</i>. I add πασης, <i>all</i>, on the authority of ABDKLM-Q, <i>twenty-three</i> others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Persic</i>, all the <i>Arabic, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, all the <i>Itala</i>, and several of the <i>primitive fathers</i>.</p>
<p><i>Inordinate desires</i>. πλεονεξιας, from πλειον, <i>more</i>, and εχειν, <i>to have</i>; the desire to have <i>more</i> and <i>more</i>, let a person possess whatever he may. Such a disposition of mind is never satisfied; for, as soon as one object is gained, the heart goes out after another.</p>
<p><i><b>Consisteth not in the abundance</b></i> — That is, <i>dependeth not on the</i> <i>abundance</i>. It is not <i>superfluities</i> that support man's life, but <i>necessaries</i>. What is <i>necessary</i>, God gives liberally; what is <i>superfluous</i>, he has not promised. Nor can a man's life be <i>preserved</i> by the abundance of his possessions: to prove this he spoke the following parable.</p>
