<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</span>. <i><b>Soul, thou hast much goods</b></i> â€” Great possessions are generally accompanied with <i>pride, idleness</i>, and <i>luxury</i>; and these are the greatest enemies to salvation. Moderate poverty, as one justly observes, is a great talent in order to salvation; but it is one which nobody desires.</p>
<p><i><b>Take thine ease, eat, drink</b></i>, and <i>be merry.</i>] This was exactly the creed of the ancient Atheists and Epicureans. <i>Ede, bibe, lude;</i> <i>post mortem nulla voluptas.</i> What a wretched portion for an immortal spirit! and yet those who know not God have no other, and many of them not even this.</p>
