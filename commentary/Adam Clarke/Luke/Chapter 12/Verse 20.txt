<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:20">Luke 12:20</span>. <b>Thou </b><i><b>fool!</b></i> — To imagine that a man's comfort and peace can depend upon <i>temporal</i> things; or to suppose that these can satisfy the wishes of an immortal spirit!</p>
<p><i><b>This night</b></i> — How awful was this saying! He had just made the necessary arrangements for the gratification of his sensual appetites; and, in the very night in which he had finally settled all his plans, his soul was called into the eternal world! What a dreadful awakening of a soul, long asleep in sin! He is now hurried into the presence of his Maker; none of his worldly goods can accompany him, and he has not a particle of heavenly treasure! There is a passage much like this in the book of Ecclesiasticus, 11:18, 19. <i>There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching,</i> <i>and this is the portion of his reward: Whereas he saith, I have</i> <i>found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods; and yet he</i> <i>knoweth not what time shall come upon him; and that he must leave</i> <i>those things to others, and die</i>. We may easily see whence the above is borrowed.</p>
