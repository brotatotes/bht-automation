<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:21">Luke 12:21</span>. <i><b>So</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>he</b></i> — That is, <i>thus will it be</i>. This is not an individual case; all who make this life their portion, and who are destitute of the peace and salvation of God, shall, sooner or later, be <i>surprised</i> in the same way.</p>
<p><i><b>Layeth up treasure for himself</b></i> — This is the essential characteristic of a covetous man: he desires riches; he gets them; he lays them up, not for the necessary uses to which they might be devoted, but for <i>himself</i>; to please himself, and to gratify his avaricious soul. Such a person is commonly called a <i>miser</i>, i.e. literally, a <i>wretched, miserable man</i>.</p>
