<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Fear not, little flock</b></i> — Or, <i>very little flock</i>, το μικρον ποιμνιον. This is what some term a double diminutive, and, literally translated, is, <i>little little flock</i>. Though this refers solely to the apostles and first believers, of whom it was <i>literally</i> true, yet we may say that the number of genuine believers <i>has</i> been, and <i>is</i> still, small, in comparison of <i>heathens</i> and <i>false Christians</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>It is your Father's good pleasure</b></i> — ευδοκησεν, It <i>hath pleased</i>, c., though this tense joined with an <i>infinitive</i> has often the force of the present. Our Lord intimated, God has <i>already</i> given you that kingdom which consists in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, and has undertaken to protect and save you to the uttermost therefore, fear not; the <i>smallness</i> of your number cannot hurt you, for omnipotence itself has undertaken your cause.</p>
