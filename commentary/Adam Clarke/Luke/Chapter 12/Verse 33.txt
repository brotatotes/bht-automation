<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Sell that ye have</b></i> â€” Dispose of <i>your goods</i>. Be not like the foolish man already mentioned, who <i>laid up</i> the produce of his fields, without permitting the poor to partake of God's bounty: turn the fruits of your fields (which are beyond what you need for your own support) into money, and give it in alms; and the treasure thus <i>laid out</i>, shall be as <i>laid up</i> for yourselves and families in heaven. This <i>purse</i> shall not <i>grow old</i>, and this <i>treasure</i> shill not <i>decay</i>. Ye shall by and by find both the <i>place</i> where you laid up the treasure, and the <i>treasure</i> itself in the <i>place</i>; for he who hath pity on the poor <i>lendeth</i> unto the Lord; and he may rest assured, that whatever, for Christ's sake, he thus lays out, it will be paid him again.</p>
