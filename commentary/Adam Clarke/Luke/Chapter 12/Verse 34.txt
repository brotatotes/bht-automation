<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Where your treasure is</b></i> â€” Men fix their hearts on their treasures, and often resort to the <i>place</i> where they have deposited them, to see that all is safe and secure. Let God be the treasure of your soul, and let your heart go frequently to the place where his honour dwelleth. There is a curious parallel passage to this in <i>Plautus</i>, quoted by Bishop <i>Pearce</i> on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:21">Matthew 6:21</span>. <i>Nam ego sum hic; animus domi est, sc. cum argento meo</i>. "I am here; but my heart is at home, i.e. with my money."</p>
