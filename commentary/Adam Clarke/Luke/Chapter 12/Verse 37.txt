<p>Verse 37. <i><b>He shall gird himself</b></i> â€” Alluding to the long garments which were worn in the eastern countries; and which, in <i>travelling</i> and <i>serving</i>, were <i>tucked up</i> in their <i>belts</i>. That those among the Romans who waited on the company at table were <i>girded</i>, and had their clothes <i>tucked up</i>, appears from what Horace says, Sat. b. vi. l. 107: <i>Veluti SUCCINCTUS cursitat HOSPES</i>, He runs about like a girded waiter. The <i>host</i> himself often performed this office. And ibid. viii. 10: <i>Puer alle cinctus</i>: and that the game custom prevailed among the <i>Jews</i> appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:4-5">John 13:4-5</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:8">Luke 17:8</span>. From this verse we may gather likewise, that it was the custom of those days, as it was, not long since, <i>among us</i>, for the <i>bridegroom</i>, at the wedding supper, to wait as a <i>servant</i> upon the company. See Bishop PEARCE.</p>
