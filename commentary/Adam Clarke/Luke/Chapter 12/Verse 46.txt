<p>Verse 46. <i><b>With the unbelievers.</b></i> — Or, rather, <i>the unfaithful</i>; των σπιστων. Persons who had the light and knowledge of God's word, but made an improper use of the privileges they received. The persons mentioned here differ widely from <i>unbelievers</i> or <i>infidels</i>, viz. those who were in a state of <i>heathenism</i>, because they had not the revelation of the Most High: the latter knew not the will of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span>, and, though they acted against it, did not do it in obstinacy; the former knew that will, and daringly opposed it. They were <i>unfaithful</i>, and therefore heavily punished.</p>
