<p>Verse 47. <i><b>Shall be beaten with many stripes.</b></i> â€” Criminals among the Jews could not be beaten with more than forty stripes; and as this was the sum of the severity to which a whipping could extend, it may be all that our Lord here means. But, in some cases, a man was adjudged to receive fourscore stripes! How could this be, when the law had decreed only forty? Answer: By doubling the crime. He received forty for each crime; if he were guilty of <i>two</i> offences, he might receive fourscore. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
