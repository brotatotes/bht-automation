<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Shall be beaten with few</b></i> â€” For petty offences the Jews in many cases inflicted so few as <i>four, five</i>, and <i>six</i> stripes. See examples in <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>From this and the preceding verse we find that it is a crime to be ignorant of God's will; because to every one God has given less or more of the means of instruction. Those who have had much light, or the opportunity of receiving much, and have not improved it to their own salvation, and the good of others, shall have punishment proportioned to the light they have abused. On the other hand, those who have had little light, and few means of improvement, shall have few stripes, shall be punished only for the abuse of the knowledge they possessed. See at the end of the chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:59">Luke 12:59</span></p>
