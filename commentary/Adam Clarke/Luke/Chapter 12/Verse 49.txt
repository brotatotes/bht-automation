<p>Verse 49. <i><b>I am come to send fire</b></i> â€” See this subject largely explained on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:34">Matthew 10:34</span>, &amp;c. From the connection in which these words stand, both in this place and in Matthew, it appears as if our Lord intended by the word <i>fire</i>, not only the consuming influence of the Roman <i>sword</i>, but also the influence of his own <i>Spirit</i> in the destruction of sin. In both these senses this fire was already kindled: as yet, however, it appeared but as a <i>spark</i>, but was soon to break out into an all-consuming flame.</p>
