<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:5">Luke 12:5</span>. <i><b>Fear him</b></i> â€” Even the <i>friends</i> of God are commanded to fear God, as a being who has authority to <i>send both body and soul into</i> <i>hell</i>. Therefore it is proper even for the most holy persons to maintain a fear of God, as the punisher of all unrighteousness. A man has but one life to lose, and one soul to save; and it is madness to sacrifice the salvation of the soul to the preservation of the life.</p>
