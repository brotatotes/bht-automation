<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:58">Luke 12:58</span>. <i><b>When thou goest with thine adversary</b></i> — This and the next verse are a part of our Lord's sermon upon the mount. See them explained <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:25-26">Matthew 5:25-26</span>. St. Luke is very particular in collecting and relating every word and action of our blessed Lord, but seldom gives them in the order of time in which they were spoken or done. See the <i>Preface</i> to this Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Give diligence</b></i> — δος ερασιαν, <i>Give labour</i>, do every thing in thy power to get free before a suit commences.</p>
<p><i><b>The officer</b></i> — πρακτωρ properly signifies such an officer as was appointed to levy the <i>fines</i> imposed by the law for a violation of any of its precepts. See <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
