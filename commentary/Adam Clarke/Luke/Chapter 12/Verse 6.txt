<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:6">Luke 12:6</span>. <i><b>Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings?</b></i> â€” See this explained on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:29">Matthew 10:29</span>, from which place we learn that two sparrows were sold for one farthing, and here; that <i>five</i> were sold for two farthings: thus we find a certain proportion-for <i>one</i> <i>farthing</i> you could get but <i>two</i>, while for <i>two farthings</i> you could get <i>five</i>.</p>
