Verse Luke 12:6. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? â€” See this explained on Matthew 10:29, from which place we learn that two sparrows were sold for one farthing, and here; that five were sold for two farthings: thus we find a certain proportion-for one farthing you could get but two, while for two farthings you could get five.
