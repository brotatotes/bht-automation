<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:7">Luke 12:7</span>. <i><b>Fear not therefore</b></i> â€” Want of faith in the providence and goodness of God is the source of all human inquietudes and fears. He has undertaken to save and defend those to the uttermost who trust in him. His <i>wisdom</i> cannot be surprised, his <i>power</i> cannot be <i>forced</i>, his <i>love</i> cannot <i>forget</i> itself. Man distrusts God, and fears that he is forgotten by him, because he judges of God by himself; and he knows that he is apt to forget his Maker, and be unfaithful to him.
