<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:11">Luke 13:11</span>. <i><b>A woman which had a spirit of infirmity</b></i> â€” Relative to this subject <i>three</i> things may be considered: -</p>
<p>I. The woman's infirmity.</p>
<p>II. Her cure. And</p>
<p>III. The conduct of the ruler of the synagogue on the occasion.</p>
<p>I. The woman's infirmity.</p>
<p>1. What was its <i>origin</i>? SIN. Had this never entered into the world, there had not been either pain, distortion, or death.</p>
<p>2. Who was the <i>agent</i> in it? <i>Satan</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span>. God has often permitted demons to act on and in the bodies of men and women; and it is not improbable that the principal part of unaccountable and inexplicable disorders still come from the same source.</p>
<p>3. What was the <i>nature</i> of this infirmity? She was <i>bowed</i> <i>together</i>, bent down to the earth, a situation equally painful and humiliating; the <i>violence</i> of which she could not support, and the <i>shame</i> of which she could not conceal.</p>
<p>4. What was the <i>duration</i> of this infirmity? <i>Eighteen years</i>. A long time to be under the constant and peculiar influence of the <i>devil</i>.</p>
<p>What was the <i>effect</i> of this infirmity? The woman was so bowed together that she <i>could in no case stand straight</i>, or look toward heaven.</p>
<p>II. The woman's cure.</p>
<p>1. <i>Jesus saw her</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:12">Luke 13:12</span>. Notwithstanding her infirmity was <i>great, painful</i>, and <i>shameful</i>, she took care to attend the synagogue. While she hoped for help from God, she saw it was her duty to wait in the appointed way, in order to receive it. Jesus saw her <i>distress</i>, and the <i>desire</i> she had both to worship her Maker and to get her health restored, and his eye affected his heart.</p>
<p>2. He <i>called</i> her to him. Her heart and her distress spoke loudly, though her lips were silent; and, as she was thus calling for help, Jesus calls her to himself that she may receive help.</p>
<p>3. <i>Jesus laid his hands on her</i>. The hand of his <i>holiness</i> <i>terrifies</i>, and the hand of his <i>power expels</i>, the demon. Ordinances, however excellent, will be of no avail to a sinner, unless he apprehend Christ in them.</p>
<p>4. <i>Immediately she was made straight</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:13">Luke 13:13</span>. This cure was -</p>
<p>1. A <i>speedy</i> one - it was done in an <i>instant</i>.</p>
<p>2. It was a <i>perfect</i> one - she was made <i>completely</i> whole.</p>
<p>3. It was a <i>public</i> one - there were <i>many</i> to attest and render it credible.</p>
<p>4. It was a <i>stable</i> and <i>permanent</i> one - she was <i>loosed</i>, for ever loosed from her infirmity.</p>
<p>5. Her soul partook of the good done to her body - <i>she glorified</i> <i>God</i>. As she knew before that it was <i>Satan</i> who had <i>bound</i> her, she knew also that it was <i>God</i> only that could <i>loose</i> her; and now, feeling that she is loosed, she gives God that honour which is due to his name. </p>
<p>2. He endeavours to prevent others from receiving the kind help of the blessed Jesus - <i>He said unto the people</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:14">Luke 13:14</span>. Men of this character who have extensive influence over the poor, &amp;c., do immense harm: they often hinder them from hearing that word which is able to save their souls. But for this also they must stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Reader, hast thou ever acted in this way?</p>
<p>3. Jesus retorts his condemnation with peculiar force <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:15-16">Luke 13:15-16</span>. Thou <i>hypocrite</i> to pretend zeal for God's glory, when it is only the workings of thy malicious, unfeeling, and uncharitable heart. Wouldst <i>thou</i> not even take thy <i>ass</i> to water upon the Sabbath day? And wouldst thou deprive a <i>daughter of Abraham</i> (one of thy own <i>nation</i> and <i>religion</i>) of the mercy and goodness of God upon the Sabbath? Was not the Sabbath instituted for the benefit of man?</p>
<p>4. <i>His adversaries were ashamed</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:17">Luke 13:17</span>. The <i>mask</i> of their hypocrisy, the only <i>covering</i> they had, is taken away; and now they are exposed to the just censure of that multitude whom they deceived, and from whom they expected continual applause.</p>
<p>5. His indignation and uncharitable censure, not only turn to his own confusion, but are made the instruments of the edification of the multitude - <i>they rejoiced at all the glorious things which he</i> <i>did</i>. Thus, O Lord! the wrath of man shall praise thee, and the remainder thereof thou shalt restrain.</p>
<p>A preacher will know how to apply this subject to general edification.</p>
