<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:23">Luke 13:23</span>. <i><b>Are there few that be saved?</b></i> — A question either of <i>impertinence</i> or <i>curiosity</i>, the answer to which can profit no man. The grand question is, <i>Can</i> I <i>be saved</i>? Yes. <i>How? Strive</i> <i>earnestly to enter in through the strait gate </i>- αγωνιζεσθε, <i>agonize </i>- exert every power of body and soul-let your salvation be the grand business of your whole life.</p>
