Verse Luke 13:23. Are there few that be saved? — A question either of impertinence or curiosity, the answer to which can profit no man. The grand question is, Can I be saved? Yes. How? Strive earnestly to enter in through the strait gate - αγωνιζεσθε, agonize - exert every power of body and soul-let your salvation be the grand business of your whole life.
