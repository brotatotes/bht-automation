Verse Luke 13:31. Depart hence, c.] It is probable that the place from which Christ was desired to depart was Galilee or Perea for beyond this Herod had no jurisdiction. It can scarcely mean Jerusalem, though it appears from Luke 23:7, that Herod Antipas was there at the time of our Lord's crucifixion.Herod will kill thee. â€” Lactantius says that this Herod was the person who chiefly instigated the Jewish rulers to put our Lord to death: Tum Pontius, et illorum clamoribus, et Herodis tetrarchae instigatione, metuentis ne regno pelleretur, victus est:-fearing lest himself should be expelled from the kingdom, if Christ should be permitted to set up his. See LACT. Inst. Div. lib. iv. c. xviii., and Bishop Pearce on Luke 23:7.
