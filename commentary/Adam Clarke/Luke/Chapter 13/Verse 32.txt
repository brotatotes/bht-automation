<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32">Luke 13:32</span>. <i><b>Tell that fox</b></i> — Herod was a very vicious prince, and lived in public incest with his sister-in-law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:17">Mark 6:17</span>: if our Lord meant him here, it is hard to say why the character of <i>fox</i>, which implies <i>cunning, design</i>, and <i>artifice</i>, to hide evil intentions, should be attributed to him, who never seemed studious to conceal his vices. But we may suppose that Christ, who knew his heart, saw that he covered his desire for the destruction of our Lord, under the <i>pretence</i> of <i>zeal</i> for the law and welfare of the Jewish people. A fox among the Jews appears to have been the emblem of a wicked ruler, who united cunning with cruelty, and was always plotting how he might aggrandize himself by spoiling the people. See a quotation in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>The following observation from the judicious Bishop Pearce deserves attention. "It is not certain," says he, "that Jesus meant Herod here; he might only have intended to call that man so, from whom the advice of departing came, (whether from the speaker himself, or the person who sent him,) for it is probable, that the advice was given <i>craftily</i>, and with design to frighten Jesus, and, make him go from that place."</p>
<p><i><b>To-day and to-morrow</b></i> — I am to work miracles for two days more, and on the third day I shall be put to death. But it is probable that this phrase only means, that he had but a <i>short</i> time to live, without specifying its duration.</p>
<p><i><b>Perfected.</b></i> — Or <i>finished</i>, τελειουμαι. I shall then have <i>accomplished</i> the purpose for which I came into the world, leaving nothing <i>undone</i> which the counsel of God designed me to <i>complete</i>. Hence, in reference to our Lord, the word implies his <i>dying</i>; as the plan of human redemption was not <i>finished</i>, till he bowed his head and gave up the ghost on the cross: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span>, where the same word is used. It is used also in reference to Christ's <i>death</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>. The word <i>finish</i>, &amp;c., is used in the same sense both by the Greeks and Latins. See KYPKE.</p>
