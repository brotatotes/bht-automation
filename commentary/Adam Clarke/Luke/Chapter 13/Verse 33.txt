Verse Luke 13:33. I must walk, c.] I must continue to work miracles and teach for a short time yet, and then I shall die in Jerusalem: therefore I cannot depart, according to the advice given me, (Luke 13:31,) nor can a hair of my head fall to the ground till my work be all done.To-day and to-morrow, c.] Kypke contends that the proper translation of the original is, I must walk to-day and to-morrow IN THE NEIGHBOURING COASTS: and that εχομενη is often understood in this way: see Mark 1:38, and his notes there.
