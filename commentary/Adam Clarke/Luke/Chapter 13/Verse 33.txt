<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:33">Luke 13:33</span>. <i><b>I must walk</b></i>, c.] I must continue to work miracles and teach for a short time yet, and then I shall die in Jerusalem: therefore I cannot <i>depart</i>, according to the advice given me, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:31">Luke 13:31</span>,) nor can a hair of my head fall to the ground till my work be all done.</p>
<p><i><b>To-day and to-morrow</b></i>, c.] Kypke contends that the proper translation of the original is, <i>I must walk to-day and to-morrow</i> <i>IN THE NEIGHBOURING COASTS</i>: and that εχομενη is often understood in this way: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:38">Mark 1:38</span>, and his notes there. That Christ was now in the jurisdiction of Herod, as he supposes, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:31">Luke 13:31</span> that he was on his last journey to Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span> that he had just passed through Samaria, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:52">Luke 9:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:56">Luke 9:56</span>; that as Samaria and Judea were under the Roman procurator, and <i>Perea</i> was subject to <i>Herod Antipas</i>, therefore he concludes that Christ was at this time in <i>Perea</i>; which agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1">Mark 10:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11">Luke 17:11</span>. He thinks, if the words be not understood in this way, they are contrary to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32">Luke 13:32</span>, which says that on it Christ is to die, while this says he is to live and act.</p>
<p><i><b>Perish out of Jerusalem.</b></i> — A man who professes to be a <i>prophet</i> can be tried on that ground only by the grand Sanhedrin, which always resides at Jerusalem; and as the Jews are about to put me to death, under the pretence of my being a false prophet, therefore my sentence must come from <i>this city</i>, and my death take place in it.</p>
