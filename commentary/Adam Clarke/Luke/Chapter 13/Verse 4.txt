<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:4">Luke 13:4</span>. <i><b>The tower in Siloam</b></i> — This tower was probably built over one of the porticoes near the pool, which is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:7">John 9:7</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ne+3:15">Nehemiah 3:15</span>.</p>
<p><i>Debtors</i>, οφειλεται, a Jewish phrase for <i>sinners</i>. Persons professing to be <i>under</i> the law are <i>bound</i> by the law to be obedient to all its precepts; those who obey not are reckoned <i>debtors</i> to the law, or rather to that Divine <i>justice</i> from which the law came. A different word is used when speaking of the <i>Galileans</i>: they are termed αμαρτωλοι, as this word is often used to signify <i>heathens</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37">Luke 7:37</span>; it is probably used here in nearly a similar sense. "Do ye who live in Jerusalem, and who consider your selves peculiarly attached to the law, and under the strongest obligations to obey it - do ye think that those Galileans were more <i>heathenish</i> than the rest of the Galileans, because they suffered such things? No. It was not on this account that they perished: both these cases exhibit a specimen of the manner in which ye shall all perish, if ye do not speedily repent, and turn to God."</p>
