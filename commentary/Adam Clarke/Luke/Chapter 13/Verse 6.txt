Verse Luke 13:6. A certain man] Many meanings are given to this parable, and divines may abound in them; the sense which our Lord designed to convey by it appears to be the following: -1. A person, τις, God Almighty.2. Had a fig tree, the Jewish Church.3. Planted in his vineyard - established in the land of Judea.4. He came seeking fruit - he required that the Jewish people should walk in righteousness, in proportion to the spiritual culture he bestowed on them.5. The vine-dresser - the Lord Jesus, for God hath committed all judgment to the Son, John 5:22.John 5:6. Cut it down - let the Roman sword be unsheathed against it.7. Let it alone - Christ is represented as intercessor for sinners, for whose sake the day of their probation is often lengthened; during which time he is constantly employed in doing every thing that has a tendency to promote their salvation.8. Thou shalt cut it down - a time will come, that those who have not turned at God's invitations and reproofs shall be cut off, and numbered with the transgressors.
