<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:7">Luke 13:7</span>. <i><b>Behold these three years</b></i> — From this circumstance in the parable, it may be reasonably concluded that Jesus had been, at the time of saying this, exercising his ministry for three years past; and, from what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:8">Luke 13:8</span>, of letting it alone this year also, it may be concluded likewise that this parable was spoken about a <i>year</i> before Christ's crucifixion; and, if both these conclusions are reasonable, we may thence infer that this parable was not spoken at the time which appears to be assigned to it, and that the whole time of Christ's public ministry was about <i>four</i> years. See Bishop Pearce. But it has already been remarked that St. Luke never studies chronological arrangement. See the <i>Preface</i> to this Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Why cumbereth it the ground?</b></i> — Or, in other words, <i>Why should the</i> <i>ground be also useless</i>? The tree itself brings forth no fruit; let it be cut down that a more profitable one may be planted in its <i>place</i>. <i>Cut it down</i>. The Codex Bezae has added here, φερετην αξινην, Bring the axe and cut it down. If this reading be genuine, it is doubtless an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:10">Matthew 3:10</span>: <i>Now the axe lieth at the root of the trees</i>. If the writer has added it on his own authority, he probably referred to the place above mentioned. See the note on the above text.</p>
<p>There is something very like this in the γεωπονικα, or De Re Rustica of the ancient Greek writers on agriculture. I refer to cap. 83 of lib. x., p. 773; edit. <i>Niclas</i>, entitled, Δενδρον ακαρπον καρποφορειν, <i>How</i> to <i>make a</i> barren <i>tree fruitful</i>. Having girded yourself, and tied up your garments, take a bipen or axe, and with an angry mind approach the tree as if about to cut it down. Then let some person come forward and deprecate the cutting down of the tree, making himself responsible for its future fertility. Then, seem to be appeased, and so spare the tree, and afterwards it will yield fruit in abundance. "Bean straw (manure of that material,) scattered about the roots of the tree, will make it fruitful." That a similar superstition prevailed among the Asiatics, <i>Michaelis</i> proves from the Cosmographer <i>Ibn</i> <i>Alvardi</i>, who prescribes the following as the mode to render a sterile palm tree fruitful: "The owner, armed with an axe, having an attendant with him, approaches the tree, and says, <i>I must cut</i> <i>this tree down, because it is unfruitful</i>. Let it alone, I beseech thee, says the other, and this year it will bring forth fruit. The owner immediately strikes it thrice with the back of his axe; but the other preventing him says, I beseech thee to spare it, and I will be answerable for its fertility. Then the tree becomes abundantly fruitful." Does not our Lord refer to such a custom?</p>
