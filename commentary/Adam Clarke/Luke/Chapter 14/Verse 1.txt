<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:1">Luke 14:1</span>. <i><b>Chief Pharisees</b></i> — Or, <i>one of the rulers of the</i> <i>Pharisees</i>. A man who was of the sect of the Pharisees, and one of the rulers of the people.</p>
<p><i><b>To eat bread on the Sabbath day</b></i> — But why is it that there should be an invitation or dinner given on the Sabbath day? Answer: The Jews purchased and prepared the best viands they could procure for the Sabbath day, in order to do it honour. See several proofs in Lightfoot. As the Sabbath is intended for the benefit both of the body and soul of man, it should not be a day of austerity or fasting, especially among the labouring poor. The most wholesome and nutritive food should be then procured if possible; that both body and soul may feel the influence of this Divine appointment, and give God the glory of his grace. On this blessed day, let every man eat his bread with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God. In doing this, surely there is no reason that a man should <i>feed himself without fear</i>. If the Sabbath be a festival, let it be observed unto the Lord; and let no unnecessary acts be done; and avoid that bane of religious solemnity, giving and receiving visits on the Lord's day.</p>
<p><i><b>They watched him.</b></i> — Or, <i>were maliciously watching</i>, παρατηρουμενοι - from παρα, <i>intens</i>. or denoting <i>ill</i>, and τηρεω, to <i>observe, watch</i>. <i>Raphelius</i>, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:2">Mark 3:2</span>, has proved from a variety of authorities that this is a frequent meaning of the word: - <i>clam et insidiose observare, quid alter agat </i>- to observe privately and insidiously what another does. The context plainly proves that this is the sense in which it is to be taken here. The conduct of this Pharisee was most execrable. Professing <i>friendship</i> and <i>affection</i>, he invited our blessed Lord to his table, merely that he might have a more favourable opportunity of watching his conduct, that he might accuse him, and take away his life. In eating and drinking, people feel generally less restraint than at other times, and are apt to converse more freely. The man who can take such an advantage over one of his <i>own guests</i> must have a baseness of soul, and a fellness of malice, of which, we would have thought, for the honour of human nature, that devils alone were capable. Among the <i>Turks</i>, if a man only taste <i>salt</i> with another, he holds himself bound, in the most solemn manner, never to do that person any injury. I shall make no apology for inserting the following anecdote.</p>
<p>A public robber in Persia, known by the name of <i>Yacoub, ibn</i> <i>Leits Saffer</i>, broke open the treasury of <i>Dirhem</i>, the governor of <i>Sistan</i>. Notwithstanding the obscurity of the place, he observed, in walking forward, something that <i>sparkled</i> a little: supposing it to be some precious stones, he put his hand on the place, and taking up something, touched it with his tongue, and found it to be <i>salt</i>. He immediately left the treasury, without taking the smallest article with him! The governor finding in the morning that the treasury had been broken open, and that nothing was carried off, ordered it to be published, that "Whoever the robber was who had broke open the treasury, if he declared himself, he should be freely pardoned, and that he should not only receive no injury, but should be received into the good graces of the governor." Confiding in the promise of Dirhem, <i>Yacoub</i> appeared. The governor asked; How it came to pass that, after having broken open the treasury, he took nothing away? <i>Yacoub</i> related the affair as it happened, and added, "<i>I believed that I was become your</i> <i>FRIEND in eating of your SALT, and that the LAWS of that</i> <i>friendship would not permit me to touch any thing that appertained</i> <i>to you</i>." <i>D'Herbelot</i>. Bib. Orient. p. 415. How base must that man be, who professes Christianity, and yet makes his own table a snare for his friend!</p>
