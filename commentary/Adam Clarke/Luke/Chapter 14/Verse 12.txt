<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:12">Luke 14:12</span>. <i><b>Call not thy friends</b></i>, c.] Our Lord certainly does not mean that a man should not entertain at particular times, his friends, c. but what he inculcates here is <i>charity to the poor</i> and what he condemns is those entertainments which are given to the <i>rich</i>, either to <i>flatter</i> them, or to procure a similar <i>return</i>; because the money that is thus criminally laid out properly belongs to the poor.</p>
