Verse Luke 14:12. Call not thy friends, c.] Our Lord certainly does not mean that a man should not entertain at particular times, his friends, c. but what he inculcates here is charity to the poor and what he condemns is those entertainments which are given to the rich, either to flatter them, or to procure a similar return; because the money that is thus criminally laid out properly belongs to the poor.
