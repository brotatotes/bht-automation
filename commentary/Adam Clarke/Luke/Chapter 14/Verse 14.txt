<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14">Luke 14:14</span>. <i><b>For they cannot recompense thee</b></i> â€” Because you have done it for God's sake only, and they cannot make you a recompense, therefore God will consider himself your debtor, and will recompense you in the resurrection of the righteous. There are many very excellent sayings among the rabbins on the excellence of charity. They produce both Job and Abraham as examples of a very merciful disposition. "Job, <i>say they</i>, had an open door on each of the four quarters of his house, that the poor, from whatever direction they might come, might find the door of hospitality open to receive them. But Abraham was more charitable than Job, for he travelled over the whole land in order to find out the poor, that he might conduct them to his house."</p>
