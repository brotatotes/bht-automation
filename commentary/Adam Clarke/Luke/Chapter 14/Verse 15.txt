<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:15">Luke 14:15</span>. <i><b>That shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</b></i> — This is spoken in conformity to the general expectation of the Jews, who imagined that the kingdom of the Messiah should be wholly of a secular nature. Instead of αρτον, <i>bread</i>, EKMS-V, more than <i>one</i> <i>hundred</i> others, with some <i>versions</i> and <i>fathers</i>, read αριστον, <i>a dinner</i>. This is probably the best reading, as it is likely it was a <i>dinner</i> at which they now sat; and it would be natural for the person to say, <i>Happy is he who shall dine in the kingdom of</i> <i>God</i>. It does not appear that there was any but this person present, who was capable of relishing the conversation of our Lord, or entering at all into its spiritual reference.</p>
