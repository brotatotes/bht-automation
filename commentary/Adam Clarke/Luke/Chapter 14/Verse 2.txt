<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:2">Luke 14:2</span>. <i><b>The dropsy.</b></i> — υδρωπικος, <i>dropsical</i>; from υδωπ, water, and ωψ, the countenance, because in this disorder the <i>face</i> of the patient is often very much bloated. Probably the insidious Pharisee had brought this dropsical man to the place, not doubting that our Lord's eye would affect his heart, and that he would instantly cure him; and then he could most plausibly accuse him for a breach of the Sabbath. If this were the case, and it is likely, how deep must have been the perfidy and malice of the Pharisee!</p>
