<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:23">Luke 14:23</span>. <i><b>Compel them to come in</b></i> — αναγκασον, <i>Prevail</i> on them by the most earnest entreaties. The word is used by Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:22">Matthew 14:22</span>, and by Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>; in both which places, when Christ is said, αναγκαζειν, to constrain his disciples to get into the vessel, nothing but his <i>commanding</i> or <i>persuading</i> them to do it can be reasonably understood. The Latins use <i>cogo</i>, and <i>compello</i>, in exactly the same sense, i.e. to <i>prevail</i> on by <i>prayers,</i> <i>counsels, entreaties</i>, c. See several examples in Bishop PEARCE, and in KYPKE. No other kind of constraint is ever recommended in the Gospel of Christ every other kind of compulsion is antichristian, can only be submitted to by cowards and knaves, and can produce nothing but hypocrites, See at the end of the chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:34">Luke 14:34</span></p>
