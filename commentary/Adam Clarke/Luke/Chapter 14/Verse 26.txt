<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:26">Luke 14:26</span>. <i><b>And hate not</b></i> â€” Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:37">Matthew 10:37</span>, expresses the true meaning of this word, when he says, <i>He who loveth his father and</i> <i>mother MORE than me</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>, he uses the word <i>hate</i> in the same sense. When we read, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:13">Romans 9:13</span>, <i>Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated</i>, the meaning is simply, I have loved Jacob - the Israelites, more than Esau-the Edomites; and that this is no arbitrary interpretation of the word <i>hate</i>, but one agreeable to the Hebrew idiom, appears from what is said on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:30-31">Genesis 29:30-31</span>, where Leah's being <i>hated</i> is explained by Rachel's being <i>loved more than Leah</i>.
