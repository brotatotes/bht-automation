<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:7">Luke 14:7</span>. <i><b>They chose out the chief rooms</b></i> â€” When custom and law have regulated and settled places in public assemblies, a man who is obliged to attend may take the place which belongs to him, without injury to himself or to others: when nothing of this nature is <i>settled</i>, the law of <i>humility</i>, and the love of <i>order</i>, are the only judges of what is proper. To take the highest place when it is not our due is public vanity: obstinately to refuse it when offered is another instance of the same vice; though private and concealed. Humility takes as much care to avoid the ostentation of an affected refusal, as the open seeking of a superior place. See <i>Quesnel</i>. In this parable our Lord only repeats advices which the rabbins had given to their pupils, but were too proud to conform to themselves. Rabbi Akiba said, Go two or three seats lower than the place that belongs to thee, and sit there till they say unto thee, <i>Go up higher</i>; but do not take the uppermost seat, lest they say unto thee, <i>Come down</i>: for it is better that they should say unto thee, <i>Go up, go up</i>; than that they should say, <i>Come down, come down</i>. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
