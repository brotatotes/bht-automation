<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:15">Luke 15:15</span>. <i><b>To feed swine.</b></i> â€” The basest and vilest of all employments; and, to a <i>Jew</i>, peculiarly degrading. Shame, contempt, and distress are wedded to sin, and can never be divorced. No character could be meaner in the sight of a Jew than that of a <i>swineherd</i>: and <i>Herodotus</i> informs us, that in Egypt they were not permitted to mingle with civil society, nor to appear in the worship of the gods, nor would the very dregs of the people have any matrimonial connections with them. HEROD. lib. ii. cap. 47.</p>
