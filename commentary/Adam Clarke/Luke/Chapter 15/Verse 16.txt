<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:16">Luke 15:16</span>. <i><b>With the husks</b></i> — κερατιων. <i>Bochart</i>, I think, has proved that κερατια does not mean <i>husks</i>: to signify which the Greek botanical writers use the word λοβοι; several examples of which he gives from <i>Theophrastus</i>. He shows, also, that the original word means the fruit of the <i>ceratonia</i> or <i>charub</i> tree, which grows plentifully in <i>Syria</i>. This kind of pulse, <i>Columella</i> observes, was made use of to feed <i>swine</i>. See BOCHART, <i>Hieroz</i>. lib. ii. cap. lvi. col. 707-10.</p>
