<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:18">Luke 15:18</span>. <i><b>Against heaven</b></i> — εις τον ουρανον; that is, <i>against God</i>. The Jews often make use of this periphrasis in order to avoid mentioning the <i>name</i> of God, which they have ever treated with the utmost reverence. But some contend that it should be translated, <i>even unto heaven</i>; a Hebraism for, I have sinned exceedingly-beyond all description.</p>
