<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:21">Luke 15:21</span>. <i>Make me as one of thy hired servants</i>, is <i>added</i> here by several MSS. and versions; but it is evident this has been added, merely to make his conduct agree with his resolution, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:19">Luke 15:19</span>. But by this a very great beauty is lost: for the design of the inspired penman is to show, not merely the <i>depth</i> of the profligate son's <i>repentance</i>, and the <i>sincerity</i> of his <i>conversion</i>, but to show the <i>great affection of the father</i>, and his <i>readiness</i> to <i>forgive</i> his disobedient son. His tenderness of heart cannot <i>wait</i> till the son has made his confession; his bowels yearn over him, and he <i>cuts short</i> his tale of contrition and self-reproach, by giving him the most plenary assurances of his pardoning love.</p>
