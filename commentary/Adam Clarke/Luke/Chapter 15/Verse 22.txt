<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:22">Luke 15:22</span>. <i><b>Bring forth the best robe</b></i> — <i>Bring out that chief</i> <i>garment</i>, την στολην την πρωτην, the garment which was laid by, to be used only on <i>birth-days</i> or <i>festival</i> times. Such as that which Rebecca had laid by for Esau, and which she put on Jacob when she made him personate his brother. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:15">Genesis 27:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Put a ring on his hand</b></i> — Giving a ring was in ancient times a mark of <i>honour</i> and <i>dignity</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:42">Genesis 41:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+21:8">1 Kings 21:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="es+8:2">Esther 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+6:17">Daniel 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Shoes on his feet</b></i> — Formerly those who were captivated had their shoes taken off, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+20:1">Isaiah 20:1</span>; and when they were restored to liberty their shoes were restored. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+28:15">2 Chronicles 28:15</span>. In <i>Bengal, shoes</i> of a superior quality make one of the distinguishing parts of a person's dress. Some of them cost as much as a <i>hundred rupees</i> a pair; £10 or £12. Reference is perhaps made here to some such costly shoes. It is the same among the <i>Chinese</i>: some very costly <i>shoes</i> and <i>boots</i> of that people are now before me.</p>
