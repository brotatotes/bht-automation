<p>Verse 28. <i><b>He was angry</b></i> â€” This refers to the indignation of the scribes and Pharisees, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:1-2">Luke 15:1-2</span>. In every point of view, the anger of the older son was <i>improper</i> and <i>unreasonable</i>. He had already received <i>his</i> part of the inheritance, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:12">Luke 15:12</span>, and his profligate brother had received no more than what was his just dividend. Besides, what the father had acquired <i>since</i> that division he had a right to dispose of as he pleased, even to give it all to one son; nor did the ancient customs of the Asiatic countries permit the <i>other</i> children to claim any share in such property thus disposed of. The following is an institute of the GENTOO <i>law</i> on this subject: (CODE, chap. ii. sect. 9, p. 79:) "If a father gives, by his own choice, land, houses, orchards, and the earning of his own industry, to one of his sons, the other sons shall not receive any share of it." Besides, whatever property the father had acquired <i>after</i> the above division, the son or sons, as the prodigal in the text, could have no claim at all on, according to another institute in the above Asiatic laws, see chap. ii. sect. ii. p. 85, but the father might divide it among those who remained with him: therefore is it said in the text, "Son, thou art ALWAYS <i>with me</i>, and ALL that I have is THINE," <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:31">Luke 15:31</span>.</p>
