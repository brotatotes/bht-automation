<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Never-a kid</b></i> â€” It is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:12">Luke 15:12</span>, that the father gave him his portion when his profligate brother claimed his; for <i>he divided his whole substance between them</i>. And though he had not <i>claimed</i> it, so as to <i>separate</i> from, and live independently of, his father, yet he might have done so whenever he chose; and therefore his complaining was both <i>undutiful</i> and <i>unjust</i>.</p>
