<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:30">Luke 15:30</span>. <i><b>This thy son</b></i> — THIS son of THINE - words expressive of supreme contempt: THIS <i>son </i>- he would not condescend to call him by his <i>name</i>, or to acknowledge him for his <i>brother</i>; and at the same time, bitterly reproaches his amiable father for his affectionate tenderness, and readiness to receive his once undutiful, but now penitent, child!</p>
<p><i><b>For HIM</b></i> — I have marked those words in small capitals which should be strongly accented in the pronunciation: this last word shows how supremely he despised his poor unfortunate brother.</p>
