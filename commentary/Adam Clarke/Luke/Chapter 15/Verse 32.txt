<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:32">Luke 15:32</span>. <i><b>This thy brother</b></i> — Or, THIS <i>brother of</i> THINE. To awaken this ill-natured, angry, inhumane man to a proper sense of his duty, both to his parent and brother, this amiable father returns him his <i>own unkind words</i>, but in a widely different spirit. <i>This</i> <i>son of mine</i> to whom I show mercy is THY <i>brother</i>, to whom thou shouldst show bowels of tenderness and affection; especially as he is no longer the <i>person</i> he was: he <i>was dead</i> in sin - he is <i>quickened</i> by the power of God: he was <i>lost</i> to thee, to me, to himself, and to our God; but now he is <i>found</i>: and he will be a comfort to me, a help to thee, and a standing proof, to the honour of the Most High, that God receiveth sinners. This, as well as the two preceding parables, was designed to vindicate the conduct of our blessed Lord in receiving tax-gatherers and heathens; and as the Jews, to whom it was addressed, could not but approve of the conduct of this benevolent father, and reprobate that of his <i>elder</i> <i>son</i>, so they could not but justify the conduct of Christ towards those outcasts of men, and, at least in the silence of their hearts, pass sentence of condemnation upon themselves. For the <i>sublime</i>, the <i>beautiful</i>, the <i>pathetic</i>, and the <i>instructive</i>, the <i>history of Joseph</i> in the Old Testament, and <i>the parable of the</i> <i>prodigal son</i> in the New, have no parallels either in sacred or profane history.</p>
<p>THE following reflections, taken chiefly from pious <i>Quesnel</i>, cannot fail making this <i>incomparable parable</i> still more instructive.</p>
<p>Three points may be considered here: I. The degrees of his fall. II. The degrees of his restoration; and, III. The consequences of his conversion.</p>
<p>I. The prodigal son is the emblem of a sinner who refuses to depend on and be governed by the Lord. How dangerous is it for us to desire to be at our own disposal, to live in a state of independency, and to be our own governors! God cannot give to wretched man a greater proof of his wrath than to abandon him to the corruption of his own heart.</p>
<p><i>Not many days</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:13">Luke 15:13</span>. The misery of a sinner has its <i>degrees</i> and he soon arrives, <i>step</i> by <i>step</i>, at the highest <i>pitch</i> of his wretchedness.</p>
<p>The <i>first degree</i> of his misery is, that he loses sight of God, and removes at a <i>distance</i> from him. There is a boundless distance between the love of God, and impure self-love; and yet, strange to tell, we pass in a moment from the one to the other!</p>
<p>The <i>second degree</i> of a sinner's misery is, that the <i>love of God</i> being no longer retained in the heart, <i>carnal love</i> and impure desires necessarily enter in, reign there, and corrupt all his actions.</p>
<p>The <i>third degree</i> is, that he squanders away all spiritual riches, and wastes the substance of his gracious Father in riot and debauch.</p>
<p><i>When he had spent all</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:14">Luke 15:14</span>. The <i>fourth degree</i> of an apostate sinner's misery is, that having forsaken God, and lost his grace and love, he can now find nothing but poverty, misery, and want. How <i>empty</i> is that soul which God does not fill! What a <i>famine</i> is there in that heart which is no longer nourished by the bread of life!</p>
<p>In this state, <i>he joined himself </i>- εκολληθη, <i>he cemented, closely</i> <i>united</i> himself, and <i>fervently cleaved to a citizen of that </i> <i>country</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:15">Luke 15:15</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>fifth degree</i> of a sinner's misery is, that he renders himself a slave to the devil, is made partaker of his nature, and incorporated into the infernal family. The <i>farther</i> a sinner goes from God, the <i>nearer</i> he comes to eternal ruin.</p>
<p>The <i>sixth degree</i> of his misery is, that he soon finds by experience the hardship and rigour of his slavery. There is no <i>master</i> so cruel as the <i>devil</i> no <i>yoke</i> so heavy as that of <i>sin;</i> and no <i>slavery</i> so <i>mean</i> and <i>vile</i> as for a man to be the drudge of his own carnal, shameful, and brutish <i>passions</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>seventh degree</i> of a sinner's misery is, that he has an insatiable hunger and thirst after happiness; and as this can be had only in God, and he seeks it in the creature, his misery must be extreme. <i>He desired to fill his belly with the husks</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:16">Luke 15:16</span>. The pleasures of sense and appetite are the pleasures of <i>swine</i>, and to such creatures is he resembled who has frequent recourse to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>.</p>
<p>II. Let us observe, in the next place, the several <i>degrees</i> of a sinner's <i>conversion</i> and <i>salvation</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> is, he begins to know and feel his misery, the guilt of his conscience, and the corruption of his heart. He <i>comes to </i> <i>himself</i>, because the Spirit of God <i>first comes to him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:17">Luke 15:17</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> is, that he <i>resolves</i> to forsake sin and all the occasions of it; and firmly purposes in his soul to return immediately to his God. <i>I will arise</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:18">Luke 15:18</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> is, when, under the influence of the spirit of faith, he is enabled to look towards God as a compassionate and tender-hearted <i>father</i>. <i>I will arise and go to my father</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>fourth</i> is, when he makes confession of his sin, and feels himself utterly <i>unworthy</i> of all God's favours, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:19">Luke 15:19</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>fifth</i> is, when he comes in the spirit of obedience, determined through grace to submit to the authority of God and to take his <i>word</i> for the rule of all his actions, and his Spirit for the guide of all his affections and desires.</p>
<p>The <i>sixth</i> is, his putting his holy resolutions into <i>practice</i> without delay; using the light and power already mercifully restored to him, and seeking God in his appointed ways. <i>And he</i> <i>arose and came</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:20">Luke 15:20</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>seventh</i> is, God tenderly receives him with the kiss of peace and love, blots out all his sins, and restores him to, and reinstates him in, the heavenly family. <i>His father-fell on his</i> <i>neck, and kissed him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:20">Luke 15:20</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>eighth</i> is, his being clothed with holiness, united to God, <i>married</i> as it were to Christ Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>, and having his feet shod with the shoes of the preparation of the Gospel of peace, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:15">Ephesians 6:15</span>, so that he may run the ways of God's commandments with alacrity and joy. <i>Bring the best robe - put a</i> <i>ring - and shoes</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:22">Luke 15:22</span>.</p>
<p>III. The <i>consequences</i> of the sinner's restoration to the favour and image of God are, <i>first</i>, the sacrifice of thanksgiving is offered to God in his behalf he enters into a covenant with his Maker, and feasts on the fatness of the house of the Most High.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, The whole heavenly family are called upon to share in the general joy the Church above and the Church below both triumph; for there is joy (peculiar joy) in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10">Luke 15:10</span>.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, God publicly acknowledges him for his son, not only by enabling him to abstain from every appearance of evil, but to walk before him in <i>newness</i> of <i>life</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:24">Luke 15:24</span>. The tender-hearted father repeats these words at <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:32">Luke 15:32</span>, to show more particularly that the soul is <i>dead</i> when <i>separated</i> from God; and that it can only be said to be <i>alive</i> when <i>united</i> to him through the Son of his love. A Christian's sin is a brother's <i>death</i>; and in proportion to our <i>concern</i> for this will our <i>joy</i> be at his <i>restoration</i> to spiritual life. Let us have a brotherly heart towards our brethren, as God has that of a father towards his children, and seems to be afflicted at their <i>loss</i>, and to rejoice at their being <i>found</i> again, as if they were necessary to his happiness.</p>
<p>In this parable, the <i>younger</i> profligate <i>son</i> may represent the <i>Gentile</i> world; and the <i>elder son</i>, who so long <i>served</i> his <i>father</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:20">Luke 15:20</span>, the <i>Jewish people</i>. The <i>anger</i> of the <i>elder</i> son explains itself at once - it means the <i>indignation</i> evidenced by the Jews at the <i>Gentiles</i> being received into the <i>favour</i> of God, and made, with them, fellow heirs of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>It may also be remarked, that those who were since called Jews and Gentiles, were at first one family, and children of the same father: that the descendants of Ham and Japhet, from whom the principal part of the Gentile world was formed, were, in their progenitors, of the primitive great family, but had afterwards fallen off from the true religion: and that the parable of the prodigal son may well represent the conversion of the Gentile world, in order that, in the fulness of time, both Jews and Gentiles may become one fold, under one Shepherd and Bishop of all souls.</p>
