<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:4">Luke 15:4</span>. <i><b>What man of you</b></i> — Our Lord spoke this and the following parable to justify his conduct in receiving and conversing with sinners or <i>heathens</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A hundred sheep</b></i> — Parables similar to this are frequent among the Jewish writers. The whole flock of mankind, both <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>, belongs unto this Divine Shepherd; and it is but reasonable to expect, that the gracious proprietor will look after those who have gone astray, and bring them back to the flock. The <i>lost sheep</i> is an emblem of a <i>heedless, thoughtless</i> sinner: one who follows the corrupt dictates of his own heart, without ever reflecting upon his conduct, or considering what will be the issue of his unholy course of life. No creature strays more easily than a sheep; none is more heedless; and none so incapable of finding its way back to the flock, when once gone astray: it will bleat for the flock, and still run on in an opposite direction to the place where the flock is: this I have often noticed. No creature is more <i>defenceless</i> than a sheep, and more exposed to be devoured by <i>dogs</i> and <i>wild beasts</i>. Even the <i>fowls</i> of the air seek their destruction. I have known ravens often attempt to destroy lambs by picking out their eyes, in which, when they have succeeded, as the creature does not <i>see</i> whither it is going, it soon falls an easy prey to its destroyer. Satan is ever going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour; in order to succeed, he <i>blinds</i> the understanding of sinners, and then finds it an easy matter to tumble them into the pit of perdition. Who but a <i>Pharisee</i> or a <i>devil</i> would find fault with the shepherd who endeavours to rescue his sheep from so much danger and ruin!</p>
