<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:7">Luke 15:7</span>. <i><b>Just persons, which need no repentance.</b></i> — Who do not require <i>such</i> a <i>change of mind</i> and <i>purpose</i> as these do - who are not so profligate, and cannot repent of sins they have never committed. Distinctions of this kind frequently occur in the Jewish writings. There are many persons who have been brought up in a sober and regular course of life, attending the ordinances of God, and being true and just in all their dealings; these most materially differ from the heathens mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:1">Luke 15:1</span>, because they believe in God, and attend the means of grace: they differ also essentially from the tax-gatherers mentioned in the same place, because they <i>wrong no man</i>, and are upright in their dealings. Therefore they cannot repent of the sins of a <i>heathen</i>, which they have not practised; nor of the <i>rapine</i> of a <i>tax-gatherer</i>, of which they have never been guilty. As, therefore, these <i>just persons</i> are put in opposition to the <i>tax-gatherers</i> and <i>heathens</i>, we may at once see the scope and design of our Lord's words: <i>these needed no repentance</i> in comparison of the others, as not being guilty of their crimes. And as these belonged, by outward profession at least, to the flock of God, and were sincere and upright according to their light, they are considered as being in no danger of being <i>lost</i>; and at they fear God, and work righteousness according to their light, he will take care to make those farther discoveries to them, of the purity of his nature, the holiness of his law, and the necessity of the atonement, which he sees to be necessary. See the case of <i>Cornelius</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>, c. On this ground, the owner is represented as feeling more joy in consequence of finding <i>one</i> <i>sheep</i> that was <i>lost</i>, there having been almost no hope of its recovery, than he feels at seeing ninety and nine still safe under his care. "Men generally rejoice more over a small <i>unexpected</i> advantage, than over a much greater good to which they have been accustomed." There are some, and their opinion need not be hastily rejected, who imagine that by the <i>ninety and nine just persons</i>, our Lord means the <i>angels</i>-that they are in <i>proportion</i> to men, as <i>ninety-nine</i> are to <i>one</i>, and that the Lord takes more pleasure in the return and salvation of one sinner, than in the uninterrupted obedience of ninety-nine holy angels and that it was through his superior love to fallen man that he took upon him <i>his</i> nature, and not the nature of <i>angels</i>. I have met with the following weak objection to this: viz. "The text says <i>just persons</i>; now, <i>angels</i> are not <i>persons</i>, therefore <i>angels</i> cannot be meant." This is extremely foolish; there may be the <i>person</i> of an <i>angel</i>, as well as of a <i>man</i>; we allow <i>persons</i> even in the Godhead; besides, the original word, δικαιοις, means simply just ones, and may be, with as much propriety, applied to <i>angels</i> as to <i>men</i>. After all, our Lord may refer to the <i>Essenes</i>, a sect among the Jews, in the time of our Lord, who were strictly and conscientiously moral; living at the utmost distance from both the hypocrisy and pollutions of their countrymen. These, when compared with the great mass of the Jews, needed no repentance. The reader may take his choice of these interpretations, or make a better for himself. I have seen other methods of explaining these words; but they have appeared to me either too absurd or too improbable to merit particular notice.</p>
