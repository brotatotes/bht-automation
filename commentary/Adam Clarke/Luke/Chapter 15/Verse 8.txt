<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:8">Luke 15:8</span>. <i><b>Ten pieces of silver</b></i> — δραχμας δεκα, <i>ten drachmas</i>. I think it always best to retain the names of these ancient coins, and to state their value in English money. Every reader will naturally wish to know by what <i>names</i> such and such coins were called in the countries in which they were current. The Grecian <i>drachma</i> was worth about <i>sevenpence three farthings</i> of our money; being about the same value as the Roman <i>denarius</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>drachma</i> that was lost is also a very expressive emblem of a sinner who is estranged from God, and enslaved to habits of iniquity. The <i>longer</i> a piece of money is lost, the less probability is there of its being again found; as it may not only lose its <i>colour</i>, and not be easily <i>observed</i>, but will continue to be more and more <i>covered</i> with <i>dust</i> and <i>dirt</i>: or its <i>value</i> may be vastly <i>lessened</i> by being so trampled on that a part of the <i>substance</i>, together with the <i>image</i> and <i>superscription</i>, may be worn off. So the sinner sinks <i>deeper</i> and <i>deeper</i> into the impurities of sin, loses even his <i>character</i> among men, and gets the image and superscription of his Maker defaced from his heart. He who wishes to find the image of God, which he has lost by sin, must attend to that word which will be a <i>lantern</i> to his steps, and receive that <i>Spirit</i> which is a <i>light</i> to the soul, to convince of sin, righteousness, and judgment. He must <i>sweep the house</i>-put away the evil of his doings; and <i>seek diligently</i>-use every means of grace, and cry incessantly to God, till he restore to him the light of his countenance. Though parables of this kind must not be obliged to <i>go on all fours</i>, as it is termed; yet they afford many useful hints to preachers of the Gospel, by which they may edify their hearers. Only let all such take care not to <i>force</i> meanings on the words of Christ which are contrary to their <i>gravity</i> and <i>majesty</i>.</p>
