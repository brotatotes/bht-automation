<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>. <i><b>A steward</b></i> — οικονομος, from οικος, a <i>house</i>, or οικια, <i>a family</i>, and νεμω, <i>I administer</i>; one who superintends domestic concerns, and ministers to the support of the family, having the products of the field, business, c., put into his hands for this very purpose. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>.</p>
<p>There is a parable very like this in Rab. Dav. Kimchi's comment on Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:21">Isaiah 40:21</span>: "The whole world may be considered as a <i>house</i> builded up: <i>heaven</i> is its <i>roof</i> the <i>stars</i> its <i>lamps;</i> and the <i>fruits</i> of the <i>earth</i>, the <i>table spread</i>. The <i>owner</i> and <i>builder</i> of this house is the <i>holy blessed God</i>; and <i>man</i> is the <i>steward</i>, into whose hands all the <i>business of the house is</i> <i>committed</i>. If he considers in his heart that the master of the house is always over him, and <i>keeps his eye</i> upon <i>his work</i>; and if, in consequence, he act <i>wisely</i>, he shall find <i>favour</i> in the eyes of the master of the house: but if the master find <i>wickedness</i> in him, he will remove him, מן יפקדתו <i>min pakidato</i>, from his STEWARDSHIP. The foolish <i>steward</i> doth not think of this: for as his eyes do not see the master of the house, he saith in his heart, 'I will eat and drink what I find in this house, and will take my pleasure in it; nor shall I be careful whether there be a Lord over this house or not.' When the Lord of the house marks this, he will come and expel him from the house, speedily and with great anger. Therefore it is written, <i>He bringeth the princes to nothing</i>." As is usual, our Lord has greatly improved this parable, and made it in every circumstance more striking and impressive. Both in the Jewish and Christian edition, it has great beauties.</p>
<p><i><b>Wasted his goods.</b></i> — Had been profuse and profligate; and had embezzled his master's substance.</p>
