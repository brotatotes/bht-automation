Verse Luke 16:10. He that is faithful in that which is least, c.] He who has the genuine principles of fidelity in him will make a point of conscience of carefully attending to even the smallest things and it is by habituating himself to act uprightly in little things that he acquires the gracious habit of acting with propriety fidelity, honour, and conscience, in matters of the greatest concern. On the contrary, he who does not act uprightly in small matters will seldom feel himself bound to pay much attention to the dictates of honour and conscience, in cases of high importance. Can we reasonably expect that a man who is continually falling by little things has power to resist temptations to great evils?
