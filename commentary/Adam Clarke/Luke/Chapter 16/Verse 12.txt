Verse Luke 16:12. That which is another man's — Or rather another's, τω αλλοτριω. That is, worldly riches, called another's:1. Because they belong to God, and he has not designed that they should be any man's portion.2. Because they are continually changing their possessors, being in the way of commerce, and in providence going from one to another. This property of worldly goods is often referred to by both sacred and profane writers. See a fine passage in Horace, Sat. l. ii. s. 2. v. 129.   Nature will no perpetual heir assign, Nor make the farm his property, or mine. FRANCIS. And the following in one of our own poets: -  "Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands." That which is your own? — Grace and glory, which God has particularly designed for you; which are the only proper satisfying portion for the soul, and which no man can enjoy in their plenitude, unless he be faithful to the first small motions and influences of the Divine Spirit.
