<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:12">Luke 16:12</span>. <i><b>That which is another man's</b></i> — Or rather <i>another's</i>, τω αλλοτριω. That is, worldly riches, called another's:</p>
<p>1. Because they belong to <i>God</i>, and he has not designed that they should be any man's portion.</p>
<p>2. Because they are continually <i>changing</i> their <i>possessors</i>, being in the way of commerce, and in providence going from one to another. This property of worldly goods is often referred to by both sacred and profane writers. See a fine passage in <i>Horace</i>, Sat. l. ii. s. 2. v. 129. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Who steals my purse steals <i>trash</i>; 'tis <i>something, nothing</i>;</p>

<p><i><b>That which is your own?</b></i> — Grace and glory, which God has particularly designed for you; which are the only proper satisfying portion for the soul, and which no man can enjoy in their plenitude, unless he be faithful to the first <i>small</i> motions and influences of the Divine Spirit.</p>
