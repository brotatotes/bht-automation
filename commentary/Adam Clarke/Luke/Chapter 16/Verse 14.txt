<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:14">Luke 16:14</span>. <i><b>They derided him</b></i> — Or rather, <i>They treated him with the</i> <i>utmost contempt</i>. So we may translate the original words εξεμυκτηριζον αυτον, which literally signifies, <i>in illum</i> <i>emunxerunt</i>-but must not be translated into English, unless, to come a little near it, we say, <i>they turned up their noses at him</i>; and why! Because <i>they</i> were <i>lovers of money</i>, and he showed them that all such were in danger of perdition. As they were wedded to <i>this</i> life, and not concerned for the <i>other</i>, they considered him one of the most absurd and foolish of men, and worthy only of the most sovereign contempt, because he taught that <i>spiritual</i> and <i>eternal</i> things should be <i>preferred</i> before the riches of the universe. And how many thousands are there of the very same sentiment to the present day!</p>
