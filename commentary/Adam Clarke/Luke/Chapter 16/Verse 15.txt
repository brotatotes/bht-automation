<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15">Luke 16:15</span>. <i><b>Ye - justify yourselves</b></i> â€” <i>Ye declare yourselves to be</i> <i>just</i>. Ye endeavour to make it appear to men that ye can still feel an insatiable thirst after the present world, and yet secure the blessings of another; that ye can reconcile God and mammon, - and serve two masters with equal zeal and affection; but God knoweth your hearts, - and he knoweth that ye are <i>alive</i> to the <i>world</i>, and <i>dead</i> to <i>God</i> and <i>goodness</i>. Therefore, howsoever ye may be esteemed among men, ye are an abomination before him. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:29">Luke 7:29</span>.</p>
