Verse Luke 16:18. Putteth away (or divorceth) his wife â€” See on Matthew 5:31; Matthew 5:32; Matthew 19:9; Matthew 19:10; Mark 10:12; where the question concerning divorce is considered at large. These verses, from the 13th to the 18th Luke 16:13-18 inclusive, appear to be part of our Lord's sermon on the mount; and stand in a much better connection there than they do here; unless we suppose our Lord delivered the same discourse at different times and places, which is very probable.
