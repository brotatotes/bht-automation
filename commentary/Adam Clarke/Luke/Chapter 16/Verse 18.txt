<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:18">Luke 16:18</span>. <i><b>Putteth away</b></i><b> </b>(or <i>divorceth</i>)<b> </b><i><b>his wife</b></i> â€” See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:31">Matthew 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:9">Matthew 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:10">Matthew 19:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:12">Mark 10:12</span>; where the question concerning <i>divorce</i> is considered at large. These verses, from the 13th to the 18th <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:13-18">Luke 16:13-18</span> inclusive, appear to be part of our Lord's sermon on the mount; and stand in a much better connection <i>there</i> than they do <i>here</i>; unless we suppose our Lord delivered the same discourse at different times and places, which is very probable.</p>
