<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:19">Luke 16:19</span>. <i><b>There was a certain rich man</b></i> â€” In the Scholia of some MSS. the name of this person is said to be <i>Ninive</i>. This account of the <i>rich man</i> and <i>Lazarus</i> is either a <i>parable</i> or a <i>real</i> <i>history</i>. If it be a <i>parable</i>, it is what <i>may be</i>: if it be a <i>history</i>, it is that which <i>has been</i>. Either a man <i>may live</i> as is here described, and go to perdition when he dies; or, some <i>have</i> lived in this way, and are now suffering the torments of an eternal fire. The account is equally instructive in whichsoever of these lights it is viewed. Let us carefully observe all the circumstances offered hereto our notice, and we shall see-I. The CRIME of this man; and II. His PUNISHMENT.</p>
<p>1. <i>There was a certain rich man in Jerusalem</i>. Provided this be a real history, there is no doubt our Lord could have mentioned his <i>name</i>; but, as this might have given great offence, he chose to suppress it. His being <i>rich</i> is, in Christ's account, the <i>first</i> part of his <i>sin</i>. To this circumstance our Lord <i>adds</i> nothing: he does not say that he was <i>born</i> to a large estate; or that he acquired one by <i>improper</i> methods; or that he was <i>haughty</i> or <i>insolent</i> in the possession of it. Yet here is the first degree of his reprobation-he <i>got</i> all he <i>could</i>, and <i>kept</i> all to <i>himself</i>.</p>
<p>2. <i>He was clothed with purple and fine linen</i>. Purple was a very precious and costly stuff; but our Lord does not say that in the use of it he exceeded the bounds of his income, nor of his rank in life; nor is it said that he used his superb dress to be an agent to his crimes, by corrupting the hearts of others. Yet our Lord lays this down as a <i>second</i> cause of his perdition.</p>
<p>3. <i>He fared sumptuously every day</i>. Now let it be observed that the law of Moses, under which this man lived, forbade nothing on this point, but <i>excess</i> in eating and drinking; indeed, it seems as if a person was authorized to taste the sweets of an abundance, which that law promised as a reward of fidelity. Besides, this rich man is not accused of having eaten food which was prohibited by the law, or of having neglected the abstinences and fasts prescribed by it. It is true, he is said to have <i>feasted</i> <i>sumptuously every day</i>; but our Lord does not intimate that this was carried to excess, or that it ministered to debauch. He is not accused of licentious discourse, of gaming, of frequenting any thing like our modern plays, balls, masquerades, or other impure and unholy assemblies; of speaking an irreverent word against Divine revelation, or the ordinances of God. ln a word, his <i>probity</i> is not attacked, nor is he accused of any of those crimes which pervert the soul or injure civil society. As Christ has described this man, does he appear culpable? What are his crimes? Why,</p>
<p>(1) He was <i>rich</i>.</p>
<p>(2) He was <i>finely clothed</i>. And</p>
<p>(3) He <i>feasted well</i>.</p>
<p>No other evil is spoken of him. In comparison of thousands, he was not only blameless, but he was a virtuous man.</p>
<p>4. But it is intimated by many that "he was an <i>uncharitable,</i> <i>hard-hearted, unfeeling wretch</i>." Yet of this there is not a word spoken by Christ. Let us consider all the circumstances, and we shall see that our blessed Lord has <i>not</i> represented this man as a monster of inhumanity, but merely as an indolent man, who sought and had his portion in this life, and was not at all concerned about another.</p>
<p>Therefore we do not find that when Abraham addressed him on the <i>cause</i> of his reprobation, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:25">Luke 16:25</span>, that he reproached him with <i>hard-heartedness</i>, saying, "Lazarus was hungry, and thou gavest him no meat; he was thirsty, and thou gavest him no drink, c." but he said simply, <i>Son, remember that thou didst receive thy good</i> <i>things in thy lifetime</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:25">Luke 16:25</span>. "Thou hast sought thy consolation upon the earth, thou hast borne no cross, mortified no desire of the flesh, received not the salvation God had provided for thee; thou didst not belong to the people of God upon earth, and thou canst not dwell with them in glory."</p>
<p>There are few who consider that it is a crime for those called <i>Christians</i> to live without <i>Christ</i>, when their lives are not stained with transgression. If Christianity only required men to live without gross <i>outward</i> sin, paganism could furnish us with many bright examples of this sort. But the religion of Christ requires a <i>conformity</i>, not only in a man's conduct, to the principles of the Gospel; but also a conformity in his heart to the spirit and mind of Christ.</p>
