<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:20">Luke 16:20</span>. <i><b>There was a certain beggar named Lazarus</b></i> — His name is mentioned, because his character was <i>good</i>, and his end <i>glorious</i>; and because it is the purpose of God that the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. <i>Lazarus</i>, לעזר is a contraction of the word אלעזר <i>Eliezar</i>, which signifies the <i>help</i> or <i>assistance</i> <i>of God </i>- a name properly given to a man who was both poor and afflicted, and had no help but that which came from heaven.</p>
