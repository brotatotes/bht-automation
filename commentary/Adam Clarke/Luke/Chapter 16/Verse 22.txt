<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:22">Luke 16:22</span>. <i><b>The rich man also died, and was buried</b></i> — There is no mention of this latter circumstance in the case of Lazarus; he was <i>buried</i>, no doubt-necessity required this; but he had the burial of a <i>pauper</i>, while the pomp and pride of the other followed him to the tomb. But what a difference in these burials, if we take in the reading of my <i>old</i> MS. BIBLE, which is supported by several <i>versions</i>: <i>forsothe the riche man is deed: and is buried in </i> <i>helle</i>. And this is also the reading of the Anglo-saxon,: [A.S.], <i>and was in hell buried</i>. In some MSS. the point has been wanting after εταφη, <i>he was buried</i>; and the following και, <i>and,</i> removed and set before επαρας <i>he lifted up</i>: so that the passage reads thus: <i>The rich man died also, and was buried in hell; and</i> <i>lifting up his eyes, being in torment, he saw</i>, c. But let us view the circumstances of this man's punishment.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he entered the place of his punishment, when he lifted up his eyes on high and what must his surprise be, to <i>see</i> himself separated from God, and to <i>feel</i> himself tormented in that flame! Neither himself, nor friends, ever suspected that the way in which he walked could have led to such a perdition.</p>
<p>1. <i>And seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:23">Luke 16:23</span>. He sees Lazarus clothed with glory and immortality - this is the <i>first</i> circumstance in his punishment. What a contrast! What a desire does he feel to resemble him, and what rage and despair because he is not like him? We may safely conclude that the view which damned souls have, in the gulf of perdition, of the happiness of the blessed, and the conviction that they themselves might have eternally enjoyed this felicity, from which, through their own fault, they are eternally excluded, will form no mean part of the punishment of the lost.</p>
<p>2. The presence of a good to which they never had any right, and of which they are now deprived, affects the miserable less than the presence of that to which they had a right, and of which they are now deprived. Even in hell, a damned spirit must <i>abhor</i> the <i>evil</i> by which he is tormented, and <i>desire</i> that <i>good</i> that would free him from his torment. If a lost soul could be <i>reconciled</i> to its torment, and to its situation, then, of course, its punishment must cease to be such. An eternal desire to escape from evil, and an eternal desire to be united with the supreme good, the gratification of which is for ever impossible, must make a <i>second</i> circumstance in the misery of the lost.</p>
<p>3. <i>Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good</i> <i>things</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:25">Luke 16:25</span>. The <i>remembrance</i> of the <i>good things</i> possessed in life, and now to be enjoyed no more for ever, together with the remembrance of <i>grace</i> offered or abused, will form a <i>third</i> circumstance in the perdition of the ungodly. <i>Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime</i>, c.</p>
<p>4. The torments which a soul endures in the hell of fire will form, through all eternity, a continual present source of indescribable wo. <i>Actual</i> torment in the flames of the bottomless pit forms a <i>fourth</i> circumstance in the punishment of the lost. <i>I</i> <i>am tormented in this flame</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:24">Luke 16:24</span>.</p>
<p>5. The known impossibility of ever escaping from this place of torment, or to have any alleviation of one's misery in it, forms a <i>fifth</i> circumstance in the punishment of ungodly men. <i>Besides all</i> <i>this, between us and you there is a great gulf</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:26">Luke 16:26</span>. The eternal purpose of God, formed on the principles of eternal reason, separates the <i>persons</i>, and the <i>places</i> of abode, of the righteous and the wicked, so that there can be no intercourse: <i>They who wish to pass over hence to you, cannot neither can</i> <i>they pass over, who would come from you hither</i>. A happy spirit cannot go from heaven to alleviate their miseries; nor can any of them escape from the place of their confinement, to enter among the blessed. There may be a <i>discovery</i> from hell of the paradise of the blessed; but there can be no intercourse nor connection.</p>
<p>6. The iniquitous conduct of relatives and friends, who have been perverted by the bad example of those who are lost, is a source of <i>present</i> punishment to them; and if they come also to the same place of torment, must be, to those who mere the instruments of bringing them thither, an <i>eternal</i> source of anguish. <i>Send</i> <i>Lazarus to my father's family, for I have five brothers, that he</i> <i>may earnestly testify</i> (διαμαρτυρηται) <i>to them, that they come not</i> <i>to this place of torment</i>. These brothers had probably been influenced by his example to content themselves with an earthly portion, and to neglect their immortal souls. Those who have been instruments of bringing others into hell shall suffer the deeper perdition on that account.</p>
