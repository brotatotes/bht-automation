<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:3">Luke 16:3</span>. <i><b>I cannot dig</b></i> â€” He could not submit to become a common day-labourer, which was both a <i>severe</i> and <i>base</i> employment: <i>To beg</i> <i>I am ashamed</i>. And as these were the only <i>honest</i> ways left him to procure a morsel of bread, and he would not submit to either, he found he must continue the system of <i>knavery</i>, in order to provide for his idleness and luxury, or else starve. Wo to the man who gets his bread in this way! The curse of the Lord must be on his head, and on his heart; in his basket, and is his store.</p>
