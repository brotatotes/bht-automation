<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:30">Luke 16:30</span>. <i><b>If one went to them from the dead</b></i>, &amp;c.] Many are desirous to see an inhabitant of the other world, and converse with him, in order to know what passes there. Make way! Here is a damned soul, which Jesus Christ has evoked from the hell of fire! Hear him! Hear him tell of his torments! Hear him utter his regrets! "But we cannot see him." No: God has, in his mercy, spared you for the present this punishment. How could <i>you</i> bear the sight of this damned spirit? Your very nature would fail at the appearance. Jesus keeps him as it were behind the curtain, and holds a conversation with him in your hearing, which you have neither <i>faith</i> nor <i>courage</i> sufficient to hold with him yourselves.</p>
