Verse Luke 16:6. A hundred measures of oil. — εκατον βατους, A hundred baths. The בת bath was the largest measure of capacity among the Hebrews, except the homer, of which it was the tenth part: see Luke 45:11; Luke 45:14. It is equal to the ephah, i.e. to seven gallons and a half of our measure.Take thy bill — Thy account - το γραμμα.
