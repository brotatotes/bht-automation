<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:7">Luke 16:7</span>. <i><b>A hundred measures of wheat.</b></i> — εκατον κορους, <i>a</i> <i>hundred cors</i>. κορος, from the Hebrew כר <i>cor</i>, was the largest measure of capacity among the Hebrews, whether for solids or liquids. As the <i>bath</i> was equal to the <i>ephah</i>, so the <i>cor</i> was equal to the <i>homer</i>. It contained about <i>seventy-five gallons</i> and <i>five pints</i> English. For the same reason for which I preserve the names of the ancient <i>coins</i>, I preserve the names of the ancient <i>measures</i>. What idea can a mere English reader have of the word <i>measure</i> in this and the preceding verse, when the original <i>words</i> are not only totally different, but the quantity is as <i>seven</i> to <i>seventy-five</i>? The original terms should be immediately inserted in the text, and the contents inserted in the <i>margin</i>. The present marginal reading is incorrect. I follow Bishop <i>Cumberland's</i> weights and measures. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:8">Luke 15:8</span>.</p>
<p>In the preceding relation, I have no doubt our Lord alluded to a custom frequent in the Asiatic countries: a custom which still prevails, as the following account, taken from Capt. Hadley's Hindostan Dialogues, sufficiently proves. A person thus addresses the captain: "Your Sirkar's deputy, whilst his master was gone to Calcutta, established a court of justice.</p>
<p>"Having searched for a good many debtors and their creditors, he learned the accounts of their bonds.</p>
<p>"He then made an agreement with them to get the bonds out of the bondsmen's hands for <i>half</i> the debt, if they would give him one <i>fourth</i>.</p>
<p>"Thus, any debtor for a <i>hundred</i> rupees, having given <i>fifty</i> to the creditor, and <i>twenty-five</i> to this knave, got his bond for <i>seventy-five</i> rupees.</p>
<p>"Having seized and flogged 125 bondholders, he has in this manner determined their loans, and he has done this business in your name." <i>Hadley's</i> Gram. Dialogues, p. 79. 5th edit. 1801.</p>
