<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span>. <i><b>The lord commended</b></i> — Viz. the master of this unjust steward. He spoke highly of the <i>address</i> and <i>cunning</i> of his iniquitous servant. He had, on his own principles, made a very prudent provision for his support; but his master no more <i>approved</i> of his conduct in <i>this</i>, than he did in his wasting his substance <i>before</i>. From the ambiguous and improper manner in which this is expressed in the common English translation, it has been supposed that our <i>blessed Lord commended</i> the conduct of this wicked man: but the word κυριος, there translated <i>lord</i>, simply means the <i>master</i> of the unjust steward.</p>
<p><i><b>The children of this world</b></i> — Such as mind worldly things only, without regarding God or their souls. A phrase by which the Jews always designate the <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Children of light.</b></i> — Such as are illuminated by the Spirit of God, and regard worldly things only as far as they may <i>subserve</i> the great purposes of their salvation, and become the instruments of good to others. But ordinarily the <i>former</i> evidence more carefulness and prudence, in providing for the support and comfort of this life, than the <i>latter</i> do in providing for another world.</p>
