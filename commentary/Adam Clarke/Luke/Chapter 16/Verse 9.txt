<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:9">Luke 16:9</span>. <i><b>The mammon of unrighteousness</b></i> — μαμωνα της αδικιας - literally, <i>the mammon</i>, or <i>riches, of injustice</i>. Riches <i>promise</i> MUCH, and <i>perform</i> NOTHING: they excite <i>hope</i> and <i>confidence</i>, and <i>deceive</i> both: in making a man <i>depend</i> on them for <i>happiness</i>, they <i>rob</i> him of the salvation of God and of eternal glory. For these reasons, they are represented as <i>unjust</i> and <i>deceitful</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>, where this is more particularly explained. It is evident that this must be the meaning of the words, because the <i>false</i> or <i>deceitful riches</i>, here, are put in opposition to the <i>true</i> <i>riches</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:11">Luke 16:11</span>; i.e. those Divine graces and blessings which promise <i>all good</i>, and give what they promise; never <i>deceiving</i> the expectation of any man. To insinuate that, if a man have acquired riches by unjust means, he is to sanctify them, and provide himself a passport to the kingdom of God, by giving them to the poor, is a most horrid and blasphemous perversion of our Lord's words. Ill gotten gain must be restored to the proper owners: if they are dead, then to their successors.</p>
<p><i><b>When ye fail</b></i> — That is, when ye <i>die</i>. The Septuagint use the word εκλειπειν in this very sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+42:17">Jeremiah 42:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+42:22">Jeremiah 42:22</span>. See Clarke on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:8">Genesis 25:8</span>. So does Josephus, War, chap. iv. 1, 9.</p>
<p><i><b>They may receive you</b></i> — That is, say some, the <i>angels</i>. Others, the <i>poor</i> whom ye have relieved will welcome you into glory. It does not appear that the poor are meant:</p>
<p>1. Because those who have relieved them may die a long time before <i>them</i>; and therefore they could not be in heaven to receive them on their arrival.</p>
<p>2. Many poor persons may be relieved, who will live and die in their sins, and consequently never enter into heaven themselves.</p>
<p>The expression seems to be a mere <i>Hebraism: - they may receive you</i>, for <i>ye shall be received</i>; i.e. God shall admit you, if you make a faithful use of his gifts and graces. He who does not make a faithful use of what he has received from his Maker has no reason to hope for eternal felicity. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:33">Matthew 25:33</span>; and, for similar <i>Hebraisms</i>, consult in the original, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:38">Luke 6:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:20">Luke 12:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6">Revelation 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>.</p>
