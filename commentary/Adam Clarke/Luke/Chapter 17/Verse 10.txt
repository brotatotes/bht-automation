<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:10">Luke 17:10</span>. <i><b>We are unprofitable servants</b></i> â€” This text has often been produced to prove that no man can live without committing sin against God. But let it be observed, the text says <i>unprofitable</i> servants, not <i>sinful</i> servants. If this text could be fairly construed to countenance <i>sinful imperfection</i>, it would be easy to demonstrate that there is not one of the spirits of just men made perfect, in paradise, nor a ministering angel at the throne of God, but is <i>sinfully imperfect</i>: for none of these can work righteousness, in the smallest degree, beyond those powers which God has given them; and justice and equity require that they should exert those powers to the uttermost in the service of their <i>Maker</i>; and, after having acted thus, it may be justly said, <i>They</i> <i>have done only what it was their duty to do</i>. The nature of God is illimitable, and all the attributes of that nature are infinitely glorious: they cannot be <i>lessened</i> by the <i>transgressions</i> of his creatures, nor can they be <i>increased</i> by the uninterrupted, eternal <i>obedience</i>, and unceasing <i>hallelujahs</i>, of all the intelligent creatures that people the whole vortex of nature. When ages, beyond the power of arithmetic to sum up, have elapsed, it may be said of the most pure and perfect creatures, "Ye are unprofitable servants." Ye have derived your being from the infinite fountain of life: ye are upheld by the continued energy of the Almighty: his glories are infinite and eternal, and your obedience and services, however excellent in themselves, and profitable to <i>you</i>, have added nothing, and can add nothing, to the absolute excellencies and glories of your God.</p>
