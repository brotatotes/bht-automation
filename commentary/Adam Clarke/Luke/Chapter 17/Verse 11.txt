<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11">Luke 17:11</span>. <i><b>He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee</b></i> â€” He first went through Galilee, whence he set out on his journey; and then through Samaria, of which mention is made, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51-52">Luke 9:51-52</span>. All who went from Galilee to Jerusalem must have necessarily passed through Samaria, unless they had gone to the westward, a very great way about. Therefore John tells us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:4">John 4:4</span>, that when Jesus left Judea to go into Galilee, <i>it was necessary for him to</i> <i>pass through Samaria</i>; for this plain reason, because it was the only proper road. "It is likely that our Lord set out from Capernaum, traversed the remaining villages of Galilee as far as Samaria, and then passed through the small country of Samaria, preaching and teaching every where, and curing the diseased, as usual." <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
