<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:13">Luke 17:13</span>. <i><b>They lifted up their voices</b></i> â€” They cried with <i>one</i> accord-they were all <i>equally</i> necessitous, and there was but <i>one</i> <i>voice</i> among them all, though <i>ten</i> were engaged in crying at the same time. As they were <i>companions</i> in suffering, they were also companions in prayer. Prayer should be strong and earnest, when the disease is great and inveterate. Sin is the worst of all leprosies; it not only <i>separates</i> those to whom it cleaves from the righteous, but it separates them from God; and nothing but the <i>pitying</i> heart and <i>powerful</i> hand of Christ Jesus can set any soul free from it.</p>
