<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:14">Luke 17:14</span>. <i><b>Show yourselves unto the priests.</b></i> — According to the direction, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+13:2">Leviticus 13:2</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+14:2">Leviticus 14:2</span>, c. Our Lord intended that their cure should be received by <i>faith</i>: they depended on his goodness and power and though they had no promise, yet they went at his command to do that which those only were required by the law to do who were <i>already</i> healed.</p>
<p><i><b>And - as they went</b></i> — In this spirit of implicit faith; <i>they were</i> <i>cleansed</i>. God highly honours this kind of faith, and makes it the instrument in his hand of working many miracles. He who will not believe till he receives what <i>he</i> calls <i>a reason for it</i>, is never likely to get his soul saved. The highest, the most sovereign <i>reason</i>, that can be given for <i>believing</i>, is that <i>God</i> has <i>commanded</i> it.</p>
