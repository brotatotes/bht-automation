<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:17">Luke 17:17</span>. <i><b>Where are the nine?</b></i> â€” Where are the numbers that from time to time have been converted to God? Are they still found praising him, with their faces on the dust, as they did at first? Alas! how many are turned back to perdition! and how many are again mingled with the world! Reader! art thou of this number?</p>
