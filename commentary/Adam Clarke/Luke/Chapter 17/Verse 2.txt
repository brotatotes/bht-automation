Verse Luke 17:2. A mill-stone — That drowning a person with a stone tied about the neck was an ancient mode of punishment, see proved in the note on Matthew 18:6; Matthew 18:7, to which let the following be added. To have a mill-stone hanged about the neck, was a common proverb. "Samuel saith, A man may marry, and after that addict himself to the study of the law. Rab. Jochanan saith, No: shall he addict himself to the study of the law with a mill-stone about his neck?"The place in Aristophanes, to which the reader is referred in the note on Matthew 18:6, is the following: - Αραν μετεωρον εις το βαραθρον εμβαλω, Εκ του λαρυγγος εκκρεμασας ὑπερβολον "Lifting him up into the air, I will plunge him into the deep: a great stone being hung about his neck." Aristoph. in Equit. ver. 1359.
