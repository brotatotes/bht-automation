<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:20">Luke 17:20</span>. <i><b>Cometh not with observation</b></i> — <i>With scrupulous</i> <i>observation</i>. That this is the proper meaning of the original, μετα παρατηρησεως, KYPKE and others have amply proved from the best Greek writers. As if he had said: "The kingdom of God, the glorious religion of the Messiah, does not come in such a way as to be discerned only by sagacious critics, or is only to be seen by those who are <i>scrupulously watching</i> for it; it is not of such a nature as to be confined to <i>one</i> place, so that men might say of it, <i>Behold it is</i> only <i>here</i>, or only <i>there</i>: for this kingdom of God is <i>publicly</i> revealed; and behold it is <i>among you</i>; I proclaim it <i>publicly</i>, and work those miracles which prove the kingdom of God <i>is</i> come; and none of these things are done in a <i>corner</i>."</p>
<p>Dr. Lightfoot has well observed that there are <i>two</i> senses especially in which the phrase "kingdom of heaven," is to be understood.</p>
<p>1. The promulgation and establishment of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>2. The total overthrow of the Jewish polity.</p>
<p>The Jews imagined that when the Messiah should come he would destroy the Gentiles, and reign gloriously over the Jews: the very reverse of this, our Lord intimates, should be the case. He was about to destroy the whole Jewish polity, and reign gloriously among the Gentiles. Hence he mentions the case of the general deluge, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. As if he had said: "The coming of this kingdom shall be as fatal to you as the deluge was to the old world, and as the fire and brimstone from heaven were to Sodom and Gomorrah." Our Lord states that this kingdom of heaven was within them, i.e. that they themselves should be the scene of these desolations, as, through their disobedience and rebellion, they possessed the seeds of these judgments. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>.</p>
