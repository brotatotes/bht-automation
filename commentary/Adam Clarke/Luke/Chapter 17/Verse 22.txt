<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:22">Luke 17:22</span>. <i><b>When ye shall desire to see one of the days</b></i> â€” As it was our Lord's constant custom to support and comfort the minds of his disciples, we cannot suppose that he intimates here that <i>they</i> shall be left destitute of those blessings necessary for their support in a day of trial. When he says, <i>Ye shall desire to see</i> <i>one of the days of the Son of man</i>, he either means, <i>ye</i> of this nation, <i>ye Jews</i>, and addresses his disciples as if they should bear witness to the truth of the declaration; intimating that heavy calamities were about to fall upon them, and that they should desire <i>in vain</i> to have those opportunities of returning to God which now they rejected; or, he means that such should the distressed state of this people be, that the disciples would through pity and tenderness desire the removal of those punishments from them, which could not be removed because the cup of their iniquity was <i>full</i>. But the former is more likely to be the sense of the place.</p>
