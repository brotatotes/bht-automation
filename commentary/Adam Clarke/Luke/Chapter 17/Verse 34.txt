<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:34-36">Luke 17:34-36</span>. On the subject of these verses see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:40-41">Matthew 24:40-41</span>. The 36th verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:36">Luke 17:36</span> is, without doubt, an interpolation; see the <i>margin</i>. It was probably borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:40">Matthew 24:40</span>. The whole verse is wanting in - ABEGHKLQS, more than fifty others, the Coptic, AEthiopic, Gothic, Slavonic, and many of the fathers: Griesbach has left it out of the text. Well might our translators say in the margin, This 36th <i>verse is wanting in most</i> <i>of the Greek copies</i>. Griesbach thinks it might have been omitted on account of the similar ending, (see the preceding verse,) or that it was borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:40">Matthew 24:40</span>.</p>
