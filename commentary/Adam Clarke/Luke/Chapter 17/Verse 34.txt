Verse Luke 17:34-36. On the subject of these verses see Matthew 24:40-41. The 36th verse Luke 17:36 is, without doubt, an interpolation; see the margin. It was probably borrowed from Matthew 24:40. The whole verse is wanting in - ABEGHKLQS, more than fifty others, the Coptic, AEthiopic, Gothic, Slavonic, and many of the fathers: Griesbach has left it out of the text. Well might our translators say in the margin, This 36th verse is wanting in most of the Greek copies. Griesbach thinks it might have been omitted on account of the similar ending, (see the preceding verse,) or that it was borrowed from Matthew 24:40.
