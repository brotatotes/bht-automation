<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:37">Luke 17:37</span>. <i><b>Where, Lord?</b></i> â€” In what place shall all these dreadful evils fall? The answer our Lord gives in a figure, the application of which they are to make themselves. Where the <i>dead carcass is</i>, there will be the <i>birds of prey </i>- where the <i>sin</i> is, there will the <i>punishment be</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:28">Matthew 24:28</span>.</p>
<p><i>Thither will the eagles</i> (or <i>vultures</i>) <i>be gathered together</i>. The jackal or <i>chakal</i> is a devourer of dead bodies; and the vulture is not less so: it is very remarkable how suddenly these birds appear after the death of an animal in the open field, though a single one may not have been seen on the spot for a long period before. The following chapter seems to be a continuation of this discourse: at least it is likely they were spoken on the same occasion. Both contain truths which the reader should carefully ponder, and receive in the spirit of prayer and faith, that he may not come into the same condemnation into which these have fallen.</p>
