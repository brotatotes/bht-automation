Verse 7. - 9. Which of you, having a servant â€” It is never supposed that the master waits on the servant -- the servant is bound to wait on his master, and to do every thing for him to the uttermost of his power: nor does the former expect thanks for it, for he is bound by his agreement to act thus, because of the stipulated reward, which is considered as being equal in value to all the service that he can perform.
