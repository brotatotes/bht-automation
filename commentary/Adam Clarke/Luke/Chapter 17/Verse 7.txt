<p>Verse 7. - 9. <i><b>Which of you, having a servant</b></i> â€” It is never supposed that the master waits on the servant -- the servant is bound to wait on his master, and to do every thing for him to the uttermost of his power: nor does the former expect <i>thanks</i> for it, for he is <i>bound</i> by his agreement to act thus, because of the stipulated reward, which is considered as being <i>equal</i> in value to <i>all the service</i> that he can perform.</p>
