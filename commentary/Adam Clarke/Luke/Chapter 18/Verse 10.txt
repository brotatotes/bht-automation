Verse Luke 18:10. A Pharisee — For a description of the Pharisees and their tenets, Matthew 16:1; Matthew 16:1.Publican. — See an account of these on Matthew 5:46. Both these persons went to the temple to pray, i.e. to worship God: they were probably both Jews, and felt themselves led by different motives to attend at the temple, at the hour of prayer: the one to return thanks for the mercies he had received; the other to implore that grace which alone could redeem him from his sins.
