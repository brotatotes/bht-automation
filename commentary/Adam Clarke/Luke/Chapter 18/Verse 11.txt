<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:11">Luke 18:11</span>. <i><b>Stood and prayed thus with himself</b></i> â€” Or, <i>stood by</i> <i>himself and prayed</i>, as some would translate the words. He probably supposed it disgraceful to appear to have any connection with this penitent publican: therefore his conduct seemed to say, "Stand by thyself; I am more holy than thou." He seems not only to have <i>stood by himself</i>, but also to have <i>prayed by himself</i>; neither associating in person nor in petitions with his poor guilty neighbour.</p>
<p><i><b>God, I thank thee</b></i>, c.] In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>, our Lord says, <i>Unless your righteousness abound more than that of the scribes</i> <i>and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of God</i>: see the note there. Now, the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is described here by a Pharisee himself. We find it was <i>twofold</i>:</p>
<p>1. It consisted in doing no harm to others.</p>
<p>2. In attending all the ordinances of God, then established in the Jewish economy and in these things they were not like <i>other men</i>, the bulk of the inhabitants of the land paying little or no attention to them.</p>
<p>That the Pharisees were in their origin a <i>pure</i> and <i>holy</i> people can admit of little doubt; but that they had awfully degenerated before our Lord's time is sufficiently evident. They had lost the <i>spirit</i> of their institution, and retained nothing else than its external <i>regulations</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>.</p>
<p>1. This Pharisee did no harm to others - I am not <i>rapacious</i>, nor <i>unjust</i>, nor an <i>adulterer</i>. I seize no man's property through false pretences. I take the advantage of no man's ignorance in buying or selling. I avoid every species of uncleanness. In a word, I do to others as I wish them to do to me. How many of those called <i>Christians</i> are not half as good as this Pharisee! And, yet, <i>he</i> was far from the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>2. He observed the ordinances of religion - <i>I fast twice in the</i> <i>week</i>. The Jewish days of fasting, in each week, were the <i>second</i> and <i>fifth</i>; what we call <i>Monday</i> and <i>Thursday</i>. These were instituted in remembrance of Moses' going up to the mount to give the law, which they suppose to have been on the <i>fifth</i> day; and of his descent, after he had received the two tables, which they suppose was on the <i>second</i> day of the week.</p>
