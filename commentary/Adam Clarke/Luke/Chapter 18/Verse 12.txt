<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:12">Luke 18:12</span>. <i><b>I give tithes of all that I possess.</b></i> — Or, <i>of all I</i> <i>acquire</i>, κτωμαι. <i>Raphelius</i> has well observed, that this verb, in the <i>present tense</i>, signifies to <i>acquire </i>- in the <i>preter</i>, to <i>possess</i>: the Pharisee's meaning seems to be, "As fast as I gain any thing, I give the tenth part of it to the house of God and to the poor." Those who dedicate a certain part of their earnings to the Lord should never let it rest with themselves, lest <i>possession</i> should produce <i>covetousness</i>. This was the Pharisee's righteousness, and the ground on which he builded his hope of final salvation. That the Pharisees had a strong opinion of their own righteousness, the following history will prove:-</p>
<p>"Rabbi Simeon, the son of Jochai, said: The whole world is not worth thirty righteous persons, such as our father Abraham. If there were only thirty righteous persons in the world, I and my son should make two of them; but if there were but twenty, I and my son would be of the number; and if there were but <i>ten</i>, I and my son would be of the number: and if there were but <i>five</i>, I and my son would be of the five; and if there were but <i>two</i>, I and my son would be those two; and if there were but <i>one</i>, myself should be that <i>one</i>." <i>Bereshith Rabba</i>, s. 35, fol. 34. This is a genuine specimen of Pharisaic pride. No wonder that our Lord accused these of pride and vain glory: they were far from humility, and consequently far from righteousness.</p>
