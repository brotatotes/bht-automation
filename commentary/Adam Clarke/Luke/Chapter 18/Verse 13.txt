<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span>. <i><b>The publican, standing afar off</b></i> — Not because he was a <i>heathen</i>, and dared not approach the <i>holy place</i>; (for it is likely he was a <i>Jew</i>;) but because he was a <i>true penitent</i>, and felt himself utterly unworthy to appear before God.</p>
<p><i><b>Would not lift up </b></i>- his <i>eyes</i>] Holding down the head, with the eyes fixed upon the earth, was,</p>
<p>1. A sign of deep distress.</p>
<p>2. Of a consciousness and confession of guilt. And,</p>
<p>3. It was the very <i>posture</i> that the Jewish rabbins required in those who prayed to God.</p>
<p>See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ezr+9:6">Ezra 9:6</span>; and <i>Mishna</i>, in <i>Berachoth</i>, chap. v.; and <i>Kypke's</i> note here. So the Pharisee appears to have forgotten one of his own precepts.</p>
<p><i><b>But smote upon his breast</b></i> — Smiting the breast was a token of excessive grief, commonly practised in all nations. It seems to intimate a desire, in the penitent, to <i>punish</i> that <i>heart</i> through the evil propensities of which the sin deplored had been committed. It is still used among the Roman Catholics in their general confessions.</p>
<p><i><b>God be merciful to me</b></i> — ιλασθητι μοι - Be <i>propitious</i> toward me <i>through sacrifice </i>- or, let an <i>atonement</i> be made for me. I am a <i>sinner</i>, and cannot be saved but in this way. The Greek word ιλασκω, or ιλασκομαι, often signifies to make expiation for sin; and is used by the <i>Septuagint</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+65:4">Psalms 65:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:38">Psalms 78:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+79:9">Psalms 79:9</span>, for כפר <i>kipper, he made an atonement</i>. So ιλασμος <i>a propitiation</i>, is used by the same, for חטאה <i>chataah, a sacrifice for sin</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+44:27">Ezekiel 44:27</span>; and ιλαστηριον, the <i>mercy seat</i>, is, in the above version, the translation of כפרת <i>kapporeth</i>, the <i>lid of the ark</i> of the covenant, <i>on</i> and <i>before</i> which the <i>blood</i> of the <i>expiatory</i> victim was sprinkled, on the great day of <i>atonement</i>. The verb is used in exactly the same sense by the best Greek writers. The following from <i>Herodotus</i>, lib. i. p. 19, edit. <i>Gale</i>, is full in point. Θυσιῃσι μεγαλῃσι τον εν Δελφοισι θεον ἹΛΑΣΚΕΤΟ, <i>Croesus</i> <i>appeased, or made an atonement to, the Delphic god by immense</i> <i>sacrifices</i>. We see then, at once, the <i>reason</i> why our blessed Lord said that the <i>tax-gatherer went down to his house justified rather</i> <i>than the other</i>:-he sought for mercy through an <i>atonement for sin</i>, which was the only way in which God had from the beginning purposed to save sinners. As the Pharisee depended on <i>his doing no</i> <i>harm</i>, and <i>observing</i> the ordinances of religion for his <i>acceptance</i> with God, according to the economy of <i>grace</i> and <i>justice</i>, he must be rejected: for as all had sinned and come short of the glory of God, and no man could make an atonement for his sins, so he who did not take refuge in that which God's mercy had provided must be excluded from the kingdom of heaven. This was no <i>new</i> doctrine: it was the doctrine publicly and solemnly preached by <i>every sacrifice</i> offered under the Jewish law. <i>Without shedding of blood there is</i> <i>no remission</i>, was the loud and constant cry of the whole Mosaic economy. From this we may see what it is to have a righteousness superior to that of the scribes and Pharisees. We must <i>humble</i> ourselves before God, which they did not: we must take <i>refuge</i> in the <i>blood</i> of the <i>cross</i>, which they would not; and be <i>meek</i> and <i>humble</i> of heart, which they were not.</p>
<p>Many suppose that the Pharisees thought they could acquire righteousness <i>of themselves</i>, independently of God, and that they did not depend on him for grace or power: but let us not make them <i>worse</i> than they were - for this is disclaimed by the Pharisee in the text, who attributes all the good he had to God: <i>O God, I thank</i> <i>thee, that I am not as others </i>- it is thou who hast made me to differ. But this was not sufficient: <i>restraining grace</i> must not be put in the place of the <i>great atonement</i>. Guilt he had contracted-and this guilt must be blotted out; and that there was no way of doing this, but through an atonement, the whole Jewish law declared. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>.</p>
