<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:14">Luke 18:14</span>. <i><b>Went doom to his house justified</b></i> — His sin blotted out; and himself accepted.</p>
<p><i><b>Rather than the other</b></i> — Η εκεινος: that is, the other was <i>not</i> accepted, because he <i>exalted</i> himself - he made use of the mercies which he acknowledged he owed to <i>God</i>, to make claims on the Divine approbation, and to monopolize the salvation of the Most High! <i>He</i> <i>was abased</i>, because he <i>vainly trusted that he was righteous</i>, and depended on what he <i>had</i> been <i>enabled</i> to do, and looked not for a <i>change</i> of heart, nor for <i>reconciliation</i> to God. It is a strange perversion of the human mind, to attempt to make God our <i>debtor</i> by the very blessings which his mere mercy has conferred upon us! It was a maxim among the Jews, that whoever brought a sacrifice to the temple returned justified. But our Lord shows that this depended on the state of mind-if they were not humbled under a sense of sin, they were not justified, though they had even offered a sacrifice.</p>
