<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:2">Luke 18:2</span>. <i><b>A judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man</b></i> — It is no wonder that our Lord calls this person an <i>unrighteous judge</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:6">Luke 18:6</span>. No person is worthy to be put in the sacred office of a <i>judge</i> who does not deeply fear God, and tenderly respect his fellow creatures. Because this person <i>feared not God</i>, he paid no attention to the calls of <i>justice</i>; and because he <i>respected not</i> <i>man</i>, he was unmoved at the complaint of the <i>widow</i>. Even among the heathens this was the character of a man totally abandoned to all evil. So Dion Cassius says of Vitellius, that <i>he neither regarded</i> <i>gods nor men</i> - ουτε των ανθρωπων, ουτε των θεων εφροντιζεν.</p>
