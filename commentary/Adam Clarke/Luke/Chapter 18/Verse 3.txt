<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:3">Luke 18:3</span>. <i><b>Avenge me of mine adversary.</b></i> — The original, εκδικησον με απο του αντιδικου μου, had better be translated, <i>Do me justice</i> <i>against</i>, or <i>vindicate me from, my adversary</i>. If the woman had come to get <i>revenge</i>, as our common translation intimates, I think our blessed Lord would never have permitted her to have the honour of a place in the sacred records. She desired to have <i>justice</i>, and that only; and by her <i>importunity</i> she got that which the unrighteous judge had no <i>inclination</i> to give, but merely for his <i>own ease</i>.</p>
