<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:6">Luke 18:6</span>. <i><b>Hear what the unjust judge saith.</b></i> â€” Our blessed Lord intimates that we should reason thus with ourselves: "If a person of such an infamous character as this judge was could yield to the pressing and continual solicitations of a poor widow, for whom he felt nothing but contempt, how much more ready must God be, who is infinitely good and merciful, and who loves his creatures in the tenderest manner, to give his utmost salvation to all them who diligently seek it!"</p>
