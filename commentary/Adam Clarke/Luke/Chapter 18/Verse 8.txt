<p>2. Because he is <i>inclined</i> to do it.</p>
<p><i><b>When the Son of man cometh</b></i> — To require the produce of the seed of the kingdom sown among this people.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall he find faith on the earth?</b></i> — Or rather, <i>Shall he find</i> <i>fidelity in this land</i>? Shall he find that the soil has brought forth a harvest proportioned to the culture bestowed on it? No! And therefore he destroyed that land.</p>
