Verse Luke 18:8. He will avenge them speedily. — Or, He will do them justice speedily - εν ταχει, instantly, in a trice.1. Because he has promised it; and2. Because he is inclined to do it.When the Son of man cometh — To require the produce of the seed of the kingdom sown among this people.Shall he find faith on the earth? — Or rather, Shall he find fidelity in this land? Shall he find that the soil has brought forth a harvest proportioned to the culture bestowed on it? No! And therefore he destroyed that land.
