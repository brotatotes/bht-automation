<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:9">Luke 18:9</span>. <i><b>Despised</b></i> — εξουθενουντας, <i>Disdained, made nothing of</i> others, <i>treated them with sovereign contempt</i>. Our Lord grants that the Pharisees made clean the outside: but, alas! what pride, vain glory, and contempt for others, were lodged within!</p>
