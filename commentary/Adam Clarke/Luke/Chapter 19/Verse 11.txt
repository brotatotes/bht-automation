<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:11">Luke 19:11</span>. <i><b>And as they heard these things</b></i> — I believe the <i>participle</i> of the <i>present</i> tense, here, is used for the participle of the <i>past</i>, or rather that the participle of the present conveys sometimes the <i>sense</i> of the <i>past</i>; for this discourse appears to have taken place the <i>next day</i> after he had lodged at the house of Zaccheus; for the text says that he was then <i>drawing nigh</i> to Jerusalem, from which Jericho was distant nineteen miles. I have not ventured to translate it so, yet I think probably the text should be read thus: And after they had heard these things, he proceded to speak a parable, because they were nigh to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><i><b>Immediately appear.</b></i> — Perhaps the generality of his followers thought that, on his arrival at Jerusalem, he would proclaim himself <i>king</i>.</p>
