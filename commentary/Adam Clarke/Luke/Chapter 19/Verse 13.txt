<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:13">Luke 19:13</span>. <i><b>Ten servants</b></i> — All those who professed to receive his doctrine. <i>Ten</i> was a kind of sacred number among the Hebrews, as well as <i>seven</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:31">Luke 14:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:8">Luke 15:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:1">Matthew 15:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ten pounds</b></i> — Ten <i>minas</i>. The Septuagint use the original word μναα for the Hebrew מנה <i>maneh</i>, from which it is evidently derived; and it appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+45:12">Ezekiel 45:12</span>, to have been equal to <i>sixty</i> shekels in money. Now suppose we allow the shekel, with Dean Prideaux, to be 3<i>s</i>., then the <i>mina</i> or <i>maneh</i> was equal to 9<i>£</i> English money. The impropriety of rendering the original word <i>pound</i>, will easily be seen by the most superficial reader. We should therefore retain the original word for the same reason so often before assigned. SUIDAS says, "The <i>talent</i> was sixty <i>minas</i>, the <i>mina</i> one hundred <i>drachms</i>, the <i>drachm</i> six <i>oboli</i>, the <i>obolus</i> six <i>chalci</i>, the <i>chalcus</i> seven <i>mites</i> or <i>lepta</i>."</p>
<p>By the <i>ten minas</i> given to <i>each</i>, we may understand the Gospel of the kingdom given to every person who professes to believe in Christ, and which he is to improve to the salvation of his soul. The <i>same</i> word is given to all, that all may believe and be saved.</p>
