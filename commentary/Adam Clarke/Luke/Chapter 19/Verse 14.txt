<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:14">Luke 19:14</span>. <i><b>His citizens</b></i> — Or <i>countrymen </i>- the Jewish people, who professed to be subjects of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Hated him</b></i> — Despised him for the meanness of his birth, his crucifixion to the world, and for the holiness of his doctrine. Neither mortification nor holiness suits the dispositions of the carnal mind.</p>
<p><i><b>Sent a message after him</b></i> — As, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:12">Luke 19:12</span>, there is an allusion to a person's going to Rome, when elected to be ruler of a province or kingdom, to receive that dignity from the hand of the emperor, so it is here intimated that, after the person went to receive this dignity, some of the discontented citizens took the opportunity to send an embassy <i>to the emperor</i>, to prevent him from establishing the object of their hatred in the government.</p>
<p><i><b>We will not have this man</b></i>, &amp;c.] The Jews rejected Jesus Christ, would not submit to his government, and, a short time after this, preferred even a murderer to him. <i>Like cleaves to like</i>. No wonder that those who <i>murdered</i> the Lord of glory should prefer a <i>murderer</i>, one of their own temper, to the Redeemer of their souls.</p>
