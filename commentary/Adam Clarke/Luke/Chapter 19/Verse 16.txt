<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:16">Luke 19:16</span>. <i><b>Lord, thy pound hath gained ten</b></i> â€” The principal difference between this parable and that of the talents above referred to is, that the <i>mina</i> given to each seems to point out the gift of the <i>Gospel</i>, which is the <i>same</i> to all who hear it; but the talents distributed in different proportions, according to each man's ability, seem to intimate that God has given different <i>capacities</i> and <i>advantages</i> to men, by which this one gift of the Gospel may be differently improved.</p>
