<p>Verse 25. <i><b>And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.</b></i> â€” This whole verse is omitted by the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, a few others, and some copies of the <i>Itala</i>. It is probably an observation that some person made while our Lord was delivering the parable, with a design to correct him in the distribution: as if he had said, "Why give the mina to that person? he has got ten already; give it to one of those who has fewer."</p>
