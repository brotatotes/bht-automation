<p>Verse 26. <i><b>And from him that hath not</b></i> â€” See this particularly explained <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:12">Matthew 13:12</span>. Perhaps it would be well, with Bishop PEARCE, to supply the word <i>gained</i>-give it to him who hath <i>gained</i> ten minas; <i>for I say unto you, That unto every one who hath</i> gained <i>shall be given; and, from him who hath not</i> gained, <i>even that</i> <i>which he hath</i> received, <i>shall be taken away</i>.</p>
