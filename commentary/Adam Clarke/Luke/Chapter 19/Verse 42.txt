<p>Verse 42. <i><b>The things</b></i> which belong <i>unto thy peace!</i>] It is very likely that our Lord here alludes to the <i>meaning</i> of the word <i>Jerusalem</i>, ירושלים from ירה <i>yereh, he shall see</i>, and שלום <i>shalom, peace</i> or <i>prosperity</i>. Now, because the inhabitants of it had not <i>seen</i> this <i>peace</i> and salvation, because they had refused to <i>open</i> their <i>eyes</i>, and behold this glorious <i>light</i> of heaven which shone among them, therefore he said, <i>Now they are hidden from</i> <i>thine eyes</i>, still alluding to the import of the name.</p>
