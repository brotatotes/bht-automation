Some suppose that it was on <i>Monday</i> in the passion week that he thus entered into Jerusalem, and purified the temple; and on <i>Thursday</i> he was seized late at night: during these four days he taught in the temple, and lodged each night at Bethany. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:17">Matthew 21:17</span>.</p>
