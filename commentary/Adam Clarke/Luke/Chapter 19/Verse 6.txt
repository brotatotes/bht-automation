Verse Luke 19:6. Received him joyfully. â€” He had now seen WHO he was, and he wished to hear WHAT he was; and therefore he rejoiced in the honour that God had now conferred upon him. How often does Christ make the proposal of lodging, not only in our house, but in our heart, without its being accepted! We lose much because we do not attend to the visitations of Christ: he passes by - he blesses our neighbours and our friends; but, often, neither curiosity nor any other motive is sufficient to induce us to go even to the house of God, to hear of the miracles of mercy which he works in behalf of those who seek him.
