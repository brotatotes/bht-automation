<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:8">Luke 19:8</span>. <i><b>The half of my goods I give to the poor</b></i> — Probably he had already done so for some time past; though it is generally understood that the expressions only refer to what he <i>now purposed</i> to do.</p>
<p><i><b>If I have taken any thing - by false accusation</b></i> — εσυκοφαντησα, from συκον, <i>a fig</i>, and φαινω, <i>I show</i> or <i>declare</i>; for among the primitive Athenians, when the use of that <i>fruit</i> was first found out, or in the time of a dearth, when all sorts of provisions were exceedingly scarce, it was enacted <i>that no figs</i> <i>should be exported from Attica</i>; and this law (not being actually repealed, when a plentiful harvest had rendered it useless, by taking away the reason of it) gave occasion to ill-natured and malicious fellows to accuse all persons they found breaking the <i>letter</i> of it; and from them all <i>busy informers</i> have ever since been branded with the name of <i>sycophants</i>. POTTER's Antiq. vol. i. c. 21, end.</p>
<p><i><b>I restore</b></i> him <i>fourfold.</i>] This restitution the Roman laws obliged the tax-gatherers to make, when it was proved they had abused their power by oppressing the people. But here was no such proof: the man, to show the sincerity of his conversion, does it of his own accord. He who has wronged his fellow must make <i>restitution</i>, if he have it in his power. He that does not do so cannot expect the mercy of God.
