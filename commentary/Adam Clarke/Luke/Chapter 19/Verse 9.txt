<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:9">Luke 19:9</span>. <i><b>Jesus said unto him</b></i> — Bishop PEARCE observes: "Probably Luke wrote αυτους, not αυτον, <i>said unto them</i>, i.e. to those who had before called Zaccheus a <i>sinner</i>; (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:7">Luke 19:7</span>); for Jesus here speaks of Zaccheus in the third person, <i>he also is a son of </i> <i>Abraham</i>, and therefore he was not then speaking to <i>him</i>." This conjecture of this respectable prelate is supported by the margin of the later <i>Syriac</i>, and by every copy of the <i>Itala</i> but <i>two</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To this house</b></i> — τω οικω τουτω, <i>To this very house</i> or <i>family</i>. As if he had said: "If he be a <i>sinner</i>, he stands in the greater need of <i>salvation</i>, and <i>the Son of man is come to seek and save</i> <i>what was lost</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:10">Luke 19:10</span>; and therefore to save this lost soul is a part of my errand into the world."
