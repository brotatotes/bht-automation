Verse Luke 19:9. Jesus said unto him — Bishop PEARCE observes: "Probably Luke wrote αυτους, not αυτον, said unto them, i.e. to those who had before called Zaccheus a sinner; (Luke 19:7); for Jesus here speaks of Zaccheus in the third person, he also is a son of  Abraham, and therefore he was not then speaking to him." This conjecture of this respectable prelate is supported by the margin of the later Syriac, and by every copy of the Itala but two.To this house — τω οικω τουτω, To this very house or family. As if he had said: "If he be a sinner, he stands in the greater need of salvation, and the Son of man is come to seek and save what was lost, Luke 19:10; and therefore to save this lost soul is a part of my errand into the world." See the sentiment contained in this verse explained on Matthew 18:11.
