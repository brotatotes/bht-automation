<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>. <i><b>Caesar Augustus</b></i> — This was <i>Caius Caesar Octavianus </i> <i>Augustus</i>, who was proclaimed emperor of Rome in the 29th year before our Lord, and died A.D. 14.</p>
<p><i><b>That all the world should be taxed.</b></i> — πασαν την οικουμενην, <i>the</i> <i>whole of that empire</i>. It is agreed, on all hands, that this cannot mean the <i>whole world</i>, as in the common translation; for this very sufficient reason, that the Romans had not the dominion of the whole earth, and therefore could have no right to raise <i>levies</i> or <i>taxes</i> in those places to which their dominion did not extend. οικουμενη signifies properly the <i>inhabited</i> part of the earth, from οικεω, to <i>dwell</i>, or <i>inhabit</i>. Polybius makes use of the <i>very words</i> in this text to point out the <i>extent</i> of the <i>Roman</i> <i>government</i>, lib. vi. c. 48; and <i>Plutarch</i> uses the word in exactly the same sense, <i>Pomp</i>. p. 635. See the passages in <i>Wetstein</i>. Therefore the whole that could be meant here, can be no more than that a <i>general</i> CENSUS of the inhabitants and their effects had been made in the reign of Augustus, through all the Roman dominions.</p>
<p>But as there is no <i>general</i> census mentioned in any historian as having taken place at this time, the meaning of οικουμενη must be farther <i>restrained</i>, and applied solely to the <i>land of Judea</i>. This signification it certainly has in this same evangelist, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:26">Luke 21:26</span>. <i>Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those</i> <i>things which are coming on the earth</i>, τη οικουμενη this land. The whole discourse relates to the calamities that were coming, not upon the <i>whole world</i>, nor the <i>whole of the Roman empire</i>, but on the <i>land of Judea</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:21">Luke 21:21</span>. <i>Then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains</i>. <i>Out</i> of Judea, therefore, there would be safety; and only those who <i>should</i> <i>be with child</i>, or <i>giving suck</i>, in those days, are considered as peculiarly unhappy, <i>because</i> they could not <i>flee away</i> from <i>that</i> <i>land</i> on which the scourge was to fall: for the <i>wrath</i>, or punishment, <i>shall be</i>, says our Lord, εν τω λαω τουτω, ON THIS VERY PEOPLE, viz. the <i>Jews</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:23">Luke 21:23</span>. It appears that St. Luke used this word in this sense in conformity to the <i>Septuagint</i>, who have applied it in precisely the same way, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:11">Isaiah 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:26">Isaiah 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:1">Isaiah 24:1</span>. And from this we may learn, that the word οικουμενη had been long used as a term by which the <i>land of Judea</i> was commonly expressed. Ἡ γη, which signifies <i>the earth</i>, or <i>world</i> in general, is frequently restrained to this sense, being often used by the evangelists and others for <i>all the country of Judea</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:25">Luke 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:3">Joshua 2:3</span>.</p>
<p>It is probable that the reason why this <i>enrolment</i>, or <i>census</i>, is said to have been <i>throughout the whole Jewish nation</i>, was to distinguish it from that <i>partial</i> one, made ten years after, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:37">Acts 5:37</span>, which does not appear to have extended beyond the estates of <i>Archelaus</i>, and which gave birth to the insurrection excited by <i>Judas of Galilee</i>. See <i>Josephus</i>, Ant. book xx. c. 3.</p>
