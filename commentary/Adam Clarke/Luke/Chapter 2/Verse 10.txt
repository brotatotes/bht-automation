<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:10">Luke 2:10</span>. <i><b>Behold, I bring you good tidings</b></i> — I am not come to declare the <i>judgments</i> of the Lord, but his <i>merciful</i> <i>loving-kindness</i>, the subject being a matter of <i>great joy</i>. He then declares his message. <i>Unto you </i>- to the Jews first, and then to the human race. Some modern MSS. with the utmost impropriety read ημιν, <i>us</i>, as if angels were included in this glorious work of redemption; but St. Paul says, <i>he took not upon him the nature of</i> <i>angels, but the seed of Abraham</i>, i.e. the nature of Abraham and his posterity, the human nature; therefore the good news is to <i>you</i>, - and not to yourselves <i>exclusively</i>, for it is <i>to all</i> <i>people</i>, to all the inhabitants of <i>this land</i>, and to the inhabitants of the whole earth.</p>
