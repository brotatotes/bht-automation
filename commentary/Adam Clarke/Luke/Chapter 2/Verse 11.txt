<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:11">Luke 2:11</span>. <i><b>A Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</b></i> — A <i>Saviour</i>, σωτηρ, the same as <i>Jesus</i> from σωζειν, to <i>make safe</i>, to <i>deliver, preserve, to make alive</i>, thus used by the Septuagint for החיה <i>hecheiah, to cause to escape</i>; used by the same for פלט <i>to confide in, to hope</i>. See the extensive acceptations of the verb in <i>Mintert</i>, who adds under σωτηρ: " The word properly denotes such a Saviour as perfectly frees us from all evil and danger, and is the author of perpetual salvation." On the word <i>Jesus</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>.</p>
<p><i>Which is Christ</i>. Χριστος, <i>the anointed</i>, from χριω <i>to</i> <i>anoint</i>, the same as משיה <i>Messiah</i>, from משח <i>mashach</i>. This name points out the Saviour of the world in his <i>prophetic, regal</i>, and <i>sacerdotal</i> offices: as in ancient times, <i>prophets, kings</i>, and <i>priests</i> were anointed with oil, when installed into their respective offices. <i>Anointing</i> was the same with them as <i>consecration</i> is with us. Oil is still used in the <i>consecration</i> of kings.</p>
<p>It appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>, that <i>anointing with oil</i>, in consecrating a person to any important office, whether <i>civil</i> or <i>religious</i>, was considered as an emblem of the communication of the gifts and graces of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>. This ceremony was used on <i>three</i> occasions, viz. the installation of <i>prophets, priests</i>, and <i>kings</i>, into their respective offices. But why should such an anointing be deemed necessary? Because the common sense of men taught them that all good, whether spiritual or secular, must come from God, its origin and cause. Hence it was taken for granted,</p>
<p>1. That no man could <i>foretell events</i>, unless inspired by the Spirit of God. And therefore the <i>prophet</i> was anointed, to signify the communication of the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>2. That no person could offer an acceptable <i>sacrifice</i> to God for the sins of men, or profitably minister in holy things, unless enlightened, influenced, and directed by the Spirit of grace and holiness. Hence the priest was anointed, to signify his being divinely qualified for the due performance of his sacred functions.</p>
<p>3. That no man could enact just and equitable laws which should have the prosperity of the community and the welfare of the individual continually in view, or could use the power confided to him only for the suppression of vice and the encouragement of virtue, but that man who was ever under the inspiration of the Almighty.</p>
<p>Hence <i>kings</i> were inaugurated by anointing with oil. Two of these offices only exist in all civilized nations, the <i>sacerdotal</i> and <i>regal</i>; and in some countries the <i>priest</i> and <i>king</i> are still consecrated by <i>anointing</i>. In the Hebrew language, משח <i>mashach</i> signifies <i>to anoint</i>; and המשיח <i>ha-mashiach</i>, the <i>anointed person</i>. But as no man was ever dignified by holding the <i>three offices</i>, so no person ever had the title <i>ha-mashiach</i>, the anointed one, but Jesus the Christ. He alone is <i>King</i> of kings, and Lord of lords: the king who <i>governs</i> the universe, and <i>rules</i> in the hearts of his followers; the <i>prophet</i> to instruct men in the way wherein they should go; and the great <i>high priest</i>, to make atonement for their sins.</p>
<p>Hence he is called the <i>Messias</i>, a corruption of the word המשיח <i>ha-mashiach,</i> <i>THE anointed ONE</i>, in Hebrew; which gave birth to ὁ Χριστος, <i>ho</i> <i>Christos</i>, which has precisely the same signification in Greek. Of him, Melchizedek, Abraham, Aaron, David, and others, were illustrious types; but none of these had the title of THE MESSIAH, or the ANOINTED of GOD: This does, and ever will, belong exclusively to <i>JESUS the CHRIST</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Lord</i>. Κυριος, the supreme, <i>eternal</i> Being, the ruler of the heavens and the earth. The Septuagint generally translate יהוה <i>Yehovah</i> by Κυριος. This Hebrew word, from היה <i>hayah, he was</i>, properly points out the <i>eternity</i> and <i>self-existence</i> of the Supreme Being; and if we may rely on the authority of <i>Hesychius</i>, which no scholar will call in question, Κυριος is a proper translation of יהוה <i>Yehovah</i>, as it comes from κυρω, - τυγχανω, <i>I am, I exist</i>. Others derive it from κυρος, <i>authority, legislative power</i>. It is certain that the <i>lordship</i> of Christ must be considered in a mere <i>spiritual</i> sense, as he never set up any <i>secular</i> government upon earth, nor commanded any to be established in his name; and there is certainly no spiritual government but that of God: and indeed the word <i>Lord</i>, in the text, appears to be properly understood, when applied to the <i>deity</i> of Christ. Jesus is a <i>prophet</i>, to reveal the will of God, and instruct men in it. He is a <i>priest</i>, to offer up sacrifice, and make atonement for the sin of the world. He is <i>Lord</i>, to rule over and rule in the souls of the children of men: in a word, he is <i>Jesus</i> the <i>Saviour</i>, to <i>deliver</i> from the <i>power,</i> <i>guilt</i>, and <i>pollution</i> of sin; to <i>enlarge</i> and <i>vivify</i>, by the influence of his Spirit; to <i>preserve</i> in the possession of the salvation which he has communicated; to <i>seal</i> those who believe, heirs of glory; and at last to receive them into the <i>fulness</i> of <i>beatitude</i> in his eternal joy.</p>
