<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:12">Luke 2:12</span>. <i><b>This</b></i> <b>shall be </b><i><b>a sign</b></i> (or token)<b> </b><i><b>unto you</b></i> â€” <i>You</i> <i>shall find</i> this glorious person, however strange it may appear, <i>wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a stable</i>! It is by <i>humility</i> that Christ comes to reign; and this is the only way into his kingdom! <i>Pride</i> is the character of all the children of Adam: <i>humility</i> the mark of the Son of God, and of all his followers. Christ came in the way of <i>humility</i> to destroy that <i>pride</i> which is the root of evil in the souls of men. And thus, according to the old medical aphorism, "<i>Opposites</i> are destroyed by their <i>opposites</i>."</p>
