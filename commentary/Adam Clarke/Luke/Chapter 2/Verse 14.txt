<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>. <i><b>Glory to God in the highest</b></i> — The design of God, in the incarnation, was to manifest the hidden glories of his nature, and to reconcile men to each other and to himself. The angels therefore declare that this incarnation shall manifest and promote the <i>glory of God</i>, εν υψιστοις not only in the <i>highest heavens</i>, among the <i>highest orders</i> of beings, but in the <i>highest</i> and most exalted degrees. For in this astonishing display of God's mercy, attributes of the Divine nature which had not been and could not be known in any other way should be now exhibited in the fulness of their glory, that even the angels should have fresh objects to contemplate, and new glories to exult in. These things the angels desire to look into, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>, and they desire it because they feel they are <i>thus</i> interested in it. The incarnation of Jesus Christ is an infinite and eternal benefit. Heaven and earth both partake of the <i>fruits</i> of it, and through it angels and men become one family, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:15">Ephesians 3:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Peace, good will toward men.</b></i> — Men are in a state of hostility with Heaven and with each other. The carnal mind is enmity against God. He who sins wars against his Maker; and</p>
<p>"Foe to God was ne'er true friend to man."</p>
<p>When men become <i>reconciled</i> to God, through the death of his Son, they love one another. They have <i>peace</i> with <i>God; peace</i> in their own <i>consciences</i>; and <i>peace</i> with their <i>neighbours: good will</i> dwells among them, speaks in them, and works by them. Well might this state of salvation be represented under the notion of the kingdom of God, a counterpart of eternal felicity. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>.</p>
