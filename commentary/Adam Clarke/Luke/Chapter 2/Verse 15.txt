<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:15">Luke 2:15</span>. <i><b>Let us now go even unto Bethlehem</b></i> — διελθωμεν, let us go across the country at the nearest, that we may lose no time, that we may speedily see this glorious reconciler of God and man. All delays are dangerous: but he who delays to seek Jesus, when the angels, the messengers of God, bring him glad tidings of salvation, risks his present safety and his eternal happiness. O, what would the damned in hell give for those moments in which the living hear of salvation, had they the same possibility of receiving it! Reader, be wise. Acquaint thyself <i>now</i> with God, and be <i>at peace</i>; and thereby good will come unto thee. Amen.</p>
