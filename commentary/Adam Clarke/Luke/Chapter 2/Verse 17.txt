<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:17">Luke 2:17</span>. <i><b>They made known abroad the saying</b></i> â€” These shepherds were the <i>first</i> preachers of the Gospel of Christ: and what was their text? Why, <i>Glory to God in the highest heavens, and on earth</i> <i>peace and good will among men</i>. This is the elegant and energetic <i>saying</i> which comprises the sum and substance of the Gospel of God. This, and this only, is the message which all Christ's true <i>pastors</i> or <i>shepherds</i> bring to men. He who, while he professes the religion of Christ, disturbs society by his <i>preachings</i> or <i>writings</i>, who excludes from the salvation of God all who hold not his <i>religious</i> or <i>political</i> creed, never knew the nature of the Gospel, and never felt its power or influence. How can <i>religious</i> <i>contentions, civil broils</i>, or <i>open wars</i>, look that Gospel in the face which publishes nothing but <i>glory to God</i>, and <i>peace and good</i> <i>will among men</i>? <i>Crusades</i> for the <i>recovery</i> of a <i>holy land</i> so called, (by the way, latterly, the most unholy in the map of the world,) and <i>wars</i> for the <i>support of religion</i>, are an insult to the Gospel, and blasphemy against God!</p>
