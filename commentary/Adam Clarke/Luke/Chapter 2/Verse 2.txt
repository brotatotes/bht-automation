<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:2">Luke 2:2</span>. <i><b>This taxing was first made when Cyrenius</b></i>, c.] The next difficulty in this text is found in this verse, which may be translated, <i>Now this first enrolment was made when Quirinus was</i> <i>governor of Syria</i>.</p>
<p>It is easily proved, and has been proved often, that <i>Caius</i> <i>Sulpicius Quirinus</i>, the person mentioned in the text, was not governor of Syria, till <i>ten</i> or <i>twelve</i> years <i>after</i> the birth of our Lord.</p>
<p>St. Matthew says that our Lord was born in the reign of Herod, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>, at which time <i>Quintilius Varus</i> was president of Syria, (Joseph. Ant. book xvii. c. 5, sect. 2,) who was preceded in that office by <i>Sentius</i> <i>Saturninus</i>. <i>Cyrenius</i>, or <i>Quirinus</i>, was not sent into Syria till <i>Archelaus</i> was removed from the government of Judea and <i>Archelaus</i> had reigned there between <i>nine</i> and <i>ten</i> years <i>after</i> the death of Herod; so that it is impossible that the census mentioned by the evangelist could have been made in the presidency of <i>Quirinus</i>.</p>
<p>Several learned men have produced solutions of this difficulty; and, indeed, there are various ways of solving it, which may be seen at length in Lardner, vol. i. p. 248-329. One or other of the two following appears to me to be the true meaning of the text.</p>
<p>1. When <i>Augustus</i> published this decree, it is supposed that <i>Quirinus</i>, who was a very active man, and a person in whom the emperor confided, was sent into Syria and Judea with <i>extraordinary</i> powers, to make the census here mentioned; though, at that time, he was not governor of Syria, for <i>Quintilius Varus</i> was then president; and that when he came, <i>ten</i> or <i>twelve</i> years after, into the presidency of Syria, there was another census made, to both of which St. Luke alludes, when he says, <i>This was the first</i> <i>assessment of Cyrenius, governor of Syria</i>; for so Dr. Lardner translates the words. The passage, thus translated, does not say that this assessment was made <i>when</i> Cyrenius was governor of Syria, which would not have been the truth, but that this was the <i>first</i> assessment which Cyrenius, who was (i.e. afterwards) governor of Syria, made; for after he became governor, he made a <i>second</i>. Lardner defends this opinion in a very satisfactory and masterly manner. See vol. i. p. 317. c.</p>
<p>2. The second way of solving this difficulty is by translating the words thus: <i>This enrolment was made BEFORE Cyrenius was</i> <i>governor of Syria</i> or, <i>before that of Cyrenius</i>. This sense the word πρωτος appears to have, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:30">John 1:30</span>: ὁτι πρωτος μου ην, <i>for he was BEFORE me</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18">John 15:18</span>: <i>The world hated me BEFORE</i> (προτον) <i>it hated you</i>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+19:43">2 Samuel 19:43</span>. Instead of πρωτη, some critics read προ της, <i>This enrolment was made</i> <i>BEFORE THAT of Cyrenius</i>. <i>Michaelis</i>; and some other eminent and learned men, have been of this opinion: but their conjecture is not supported by any MS. yet discovered; nor, indeed, is there any occasion for it. As the words in the evangelist are very ambiguous, the second solution appears to me to be the best.</p>
