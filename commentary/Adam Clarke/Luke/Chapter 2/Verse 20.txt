<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:20">Luke 2:20</span>. <i><b>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising</b></i> â€” These simple men, having satisfactory evidence of the truth of the <i>good</i> <i>tidings</i>, and feeling a Divine influence upon their own minds, returned to the care of their flocks, glorifying God for what he had shown them, and for the blessedness which they felt. "Jesus Christ, born of a woman, laid in a stable, proclaimed and ministered to by the heavenly host, should be a subject of frequent contemplation to the <i>pastors</i> of his Church. After having compared the predictions of the prophets with the facts stated in the evangelic history, their own souls being hereby confirmed in these sacred truths, they will <i>return to their flocks, glorifying</i> <i>and praising God</i> for what they had seen and heard in the Gospel history, just <i>as it had been told them</i> in the writings of the prophets; and, preaching these mysteries with the fullest conviction of their truth, they become instruments in the hands of God of begetting the same faith in their hearers; and thus the glory of God and the happiness of his people are both promoted." What subjects for contemplation! - what matter for praise!</p>
