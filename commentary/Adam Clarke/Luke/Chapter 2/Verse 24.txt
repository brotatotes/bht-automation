And to offer a sacrifice â€” Neither mother nor child was considered as in the Lord's covenant, or under the Divine protection, till these ceremonies, prescribed by the law, had been performed.A pair of turtle doves, c.] One was for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: see Leviticus 12:8. The rich were required to bring a lamb, but the poor and middling classes were required to bring either two turtle doves, or two pigeons. This is a proof that the holy family were not in affluence.

These reasons are sufficient to account for the purification of the holy virgin, and for the circumcision of the most holy Jesus.
