<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:24">Luke 2:24</span>. <i><b>And to offer a sacrifice</b></i> â€” Neither mother nor child was considered as in the Lord's covenant, or under the Divine protection, till these ceremonies, prescribed by the law, had been performed.</p>
<p><i><b>A pair of turtle doves</b></i>, c.] <i>One</i> was for a burnt-offering, and the <i>other</i> for a sin-offering: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+12:8">Leviticus 12:8</span>. The rich were required to bring a <i>lamb</i>, but the <i>poor</i> and middling classes were required to bring either <i>two turtle doves</i>, or <i>two pigeons</i>. This is a proof that the holy family were not in affluence. Jesus sanctified the state of <i>poverty</i>, which is the <i>general state</i> of man, by passing through it. Therefore the <i>poor</i> have the Gospel preached unto them and the <i>poor</i> are they who principally receive it.</p>
<p>Though neither Mary nor her son needed any of these purifications, for <i>she</i> was <i>immaculate</i>, and <i>He</i> was the <i>Holy</i> <i>One</i>, yet, had <i>she</i> not gone through the days of purification according to the law, she could not have appeared in the public worship of the Most High, and would have been considered as an apostate from the faith of the Israel of God; and had not <i>He</i> been circumcised and publicly presented in the temple, he could not have been permitted to enter either synagogue or temple, and no Jew would have heard him preach, or had any intercourse or connection with him. These reasons are sufficient to account for the <i>purification</i> of the <i>holy</i> virgin, and for the <i>circumcision</i> of the <i>most holy</i> Jesus.</p>
