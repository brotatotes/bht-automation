<p>Verse 25. <i><b>And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem</b></i> — This man is distinguished because of his singular piety. There can be no doubt that there were many persons in Jerusalem named <i>Simeon</i>, besides this man; but there was none of the name who merited the attention of God so much as he in the text. Such persevering exemplary piety was very rare, and therefore the inspired penman ushers in the account with <i>behold</i>! Several learned men are of the opinion that he was son to the famous <i>Hillel</i>, one of the most celebrated doctors and philosophers which had ever appeared in the Jewish nation since the time of Moses. Simeon is supposed also to have been the AB or president of the grand Sanhedrin.</p>
<p><i><b>The same man</b></i><b> was </b><i><b>just</b></i> — He steadily regulated all his conduct by the law of his God: <i>and devout </i>- he had fully consecrated <i>himself</i> to God, so that he added a <i>pious</i> heart to a <i>righteous</i> conduct. The original word ευλαβης, signifies also a person of <i>good report </i>- one <i>well received</i> among the people, or one cautious and circumspect in matters of religion; from ευ, <i>well</i>, and λαμβανω, <i>I take</i>: it properly denotes, one who takes any thing that is held out to him, <i>well</i> and <i>carefully</i>. He so professed and practised the religion of his fathers that he gave no cause for a friend to mourn on his account, or an enemy to triumph.</p>
<p>Several excellent MSS. read ευσεβης, <i>pious</i> or <i>godly</i>, from ευ, <i>well</i>, and σεβομαι, <i>I worship</i>; one who worships God <i>well</i>, i.e. in <i>spirit</i> and in <i>truth</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Waiting for the consolation of Israel</b></i> — That is, the Messiah, who was known among the pious Jews by this character: he was to be the <i>consolation</i> of Israel, because he was to be its <i>redemption</i>. This consolation of Israel was so universally expected that the Jews swore by it: <i>So let me see the Consolation, if such a thing be not</i> <i>so, or so</i>. See the <i>forms</i> in Lightfoot.</p>
<p><i><b>The Holy Ghost was upon him</b></i> — He was a man divinely <i>inspired,</i> <i>overshadowed</i>, and <i>protected</i> by the power and influence of the Most High.</p>
