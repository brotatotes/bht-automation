<p>Verse 26. <i><b>It was revealed unto him</b></i> — He was <i>divinely informed</i>, κεχρηματισμενον - he had an <i>express communication</i> from God concerning the subject. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him. The soul of a righteous and devout man is a proper habitation for the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>He should not see death</b></i> — They that <i>seek</i> shall <i>find</i>: it is impossible that a man who is earnestly seeking the salvation of God, should be permitted to die without finding it.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord's Christ.</b></i> — Rather, <i>the Lord's anointed</i>. That <i>prophet,</i> <i>priest</i>, and <i>king</i>, who was typified by so many <i>anointed</i> persons under the old covenant; and who was <i>appointed</i> to come in the fulness of time, to accomplish all that was written in the law, in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning him. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:11">Luke 2:11</span>.</p>
