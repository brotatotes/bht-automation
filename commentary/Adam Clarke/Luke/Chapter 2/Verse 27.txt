In this messenger of the covenant, the soul of Simeon delighted. Now the prophecy was just going to be fulfilled; and the Holy Spirit, who dwelt in the soul of this righteous man, directed him to go and see its accomplishment. Those who come, under the influence of God's Spirit, to places of public worship, will undoubtedly meet with him who is the comfort and salvation of Israel.After the custom of the law — To present him to the Lord, and then redeem him by paying five shekels, Numbers 18:15-16, and to offer those sacrifices appointed by the law. See Luke 2:24.
