<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Then took he him up in his arms</b></i> â€” What must the holy soul of this man have felt in this moment! O inestimable privilege! And yet ours need not be inferior: If a man love me, says Christ, he will keep my word; <i>and I and the Father will come</i> <i>in unto him, and make our abode with him</i>. And indeed even Christ <i>in the arms</i> could not avail a man, if he were not <i>formed</i> in his <i>heart</i>.</p>
