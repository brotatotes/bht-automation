<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace</b></i> — <i>Now thou dismissest</i>, απολυεις, <i>loosest</i> him from life; having lived long enough to have the grand end of life accomplished.</p>
<p><i><b>According to thy word</b></i> — It was promised to him, that he should not die till he had seen the Lord's <i>anointed</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:26">Luke 2:26</span>; and now, having seen him, he expects to be immediately <i>dismissed</i> in peace into the eternal world; having a full assurance and enjoyment of the salvation of God. Though Simeon means his <i>death</i>, yet the thing itself is not mentioned; for <i>death</i> has not only lost its <i>sting</i>, but its <i>name</i> also, to those who have, even by <i>faith</i>, seen the Lord's anointed.</p>
