Verse 31. Which thou hast prepared — ο ητοιμασας, which thou hast MADE READY before the face, in the presence, of all people. Here salvation is represented under the notion of a feast, which God himself has provided for the whole world; and to partake of which he has invited all the nations of the earth. There seems a direct allusion here to Isaiah 25:6, c. "In this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things," &c. Salvation is properly the food of the soul, by which it is nourished unto eternal life he that receiveth not this, must perish for ever.
