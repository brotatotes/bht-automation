<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Which thou hast prepared</b></i> — ο ητοιμασας, which thou hast MADE READY <i>before the face</i>, in the presence, of <i>all people</i>. Here salvation is represented under the notion of a <i>feast</i>, which God himself has provided for the whole world; and to partake of which he has invited all the nations of the earth. There seems a direct allusion here to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:6">Isaiah 25:6</span>, c. "In this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a <i>feast</i> of fat things," &amp;c. <i>Salvation</i> is properly the <i>food</i> of the soul, by which it is <i>nourished</i> unto eternal life he that receiveth not this, must perish for ever.</p>
