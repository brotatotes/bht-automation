<p>Verse 32. <i><b>A light to lighten the Gentiles</b></i> — φως εις αποκαλοψιν εθνων - <i>A light of the Gentiles, for revelation</i>. By Moses and the prophets, a <i>light of revelation</i> was given to the Jews, in the blessedness of which the <i>Gentiles</i> did not partake. By Christ and his apostles, a luminous <i>revelation</i> is about to be given unto the Gentiles, from the blessedness of which the <i>Jews</i> in general, by their obstinacy and unbelief, shall be long excluded. But to all true Israelites it shall be a <i>glory</i>, an evident fulfilment of all the predictions of the prophets, relative to the salvation of a lost world; and the first offers of it shall be made to the Jewish people, who may see in it the truth of their own Scriptures indisputably evinced.</p>
