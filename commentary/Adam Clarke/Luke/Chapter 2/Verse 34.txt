<p>Verse 34. <i><b>This</b></i><b> child </b><i><b>is set for the fall</b></i> — This seems an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14-15">Isaiah 8:14-15</span>: <i>Jehovah, God of hosts, shall be-for a stone of stumbling and</i> <i>rock of offence to both houses of Israel; and many among them</i> <i>shall stumble and fall</i>, c. As Christ did not come as a <i>temporal</i> <i>deliverer</i>, in which character alone the Jews expected him, the consequence should be, they would reject him, and so fall by the Romans. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11-12">Romans 11:11-12</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>. But in the fulness of time there shall be a <i>rising again of many in Israel</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And for a sign</b></i> — A <i>mark</i> or <i>butt</i> to shoot at - a metaphor taken from archers. Or perhaps Simeon refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10-12">Isaiah 11:10-12</span>. <i>There shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ENSIGN</i> <i>of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek</i>: - intimating that the Jews would reject it, while the Gentiles should flock to it as their <i>ensign</i> of <i>honour</i>, under which they were to enjoy a glorious rest.</p>
<p><i><b>That the thoughts</b></i> (or <i>reasonings</i>) <i><b>of many hearts may be</b></i><b> </b><i><b>revealed.</b></i> — I have transposed this clause to the place to which I believe it belongs. The meaning appears to me to be this: The rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish rulers will sufficiently prove that they sought the honour which comes from the world, and not that honour which comes from God: because they rejected Jesus, merely for the reason that he did not bring them a <i>temporal</i> <i>deliverance</i>. So the very Pharisees, who were loud in their professions of <i>sanctity</i> and <i>devotedness</i> to God, rejected Jesus, and got him crucified, because his kingdom <i>was not of this world</i>. Thus the reasonings of many hearts were revealed.</p>
