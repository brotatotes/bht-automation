<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Anna, a prophetess</b></i> — It does not appear that this person was a <i>prophetess</i> in the strict sense of the word, i.e. one who could foretell future events; but rather a holy woman; who, from her extensive knowledge and deep experience in Divine things, was capable of <i>instructing</i> others; according to the use of the word προφητευω, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>: <i>He that prophesieth, speaketh unto men to edification, and to</i> <i>exhortation, and to comfort</i>. So we find this holy widow proclaiming Jesus to all who looked for redemption in Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:38">Luke 2:38</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The tribe of Asher</b></i> — This was one of the ten tribes of the kingdom of Israel, several families of which had returned from their idolatry unto God, in the time that Hezekiah proclaimed the passover in Jerusalem, which is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+30:1-11">2 Chronicles 30:1-11</span>. Though her family might have been a distinguished one in Jerusalem, yet we find that it was her very exemplary piety that entitled her to be thus honourably mentioned in the sacred history. It is an honourable thing indeed to have one's name written in the <i>sacred</i> <i>records</i>; but to be written in the <i>book of life</i> is of infinitely greater moment.</p>
<p><i><b>Seven years</b></i> — She was a <i>pure</i> virgin when married, was favoured with her husband but <i>seven</i> years, and was now in all, taking in the time of her <i>virginity, marriage</i>, and <i>widowhood</i>, eighty-four years of age. At such an age, it might be supposed she was reasonably exempted from performing the <i>severer</i> duties of religion; but her <i>spirit</i> of <i>piety</i> continued still to burn with a steady and undiminished fame.</p>
