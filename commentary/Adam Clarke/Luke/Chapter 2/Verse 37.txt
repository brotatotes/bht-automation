<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Departed not from the temple</b></i> — Attended constantly at the hours of prayer, which were <i>nine</i> in the morning and <i>three</i> in the afternoon. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span>. It does not appear that women had any other functions to perform in that holy place.</p>
<p><i><b>With fastings</b></i> — She accompanied her devotion with frequent fastings, probably not <i>oftener</i> than <i>twice</i> in the week; for this was the custom of the most rigid Pharisees: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:12">Luke 18:12</span>.</p>
