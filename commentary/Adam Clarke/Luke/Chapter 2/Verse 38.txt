<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Coming in that instant</b></i> — αυτη τη ωρα, <i>at that very</i> <i>time</i>-while Simeon held the blessed Redeemer in his arms, and was singing his <i>departing</i> and <i>triumphal</i> song.</p>
<p><i><b>Gave thanks likewise</b></i> — She, as well as <i>Simeon</i>, returned God public thanks, for having sent this Saviour to Israel.</p>
<p><i><b>Spake of him</b></i> — Of the nature and design of his mission; and the glory that should take place in the land.</p>
<p><i><b>To all them that looked for redemption</b></i> — As Daniel's seventy weeks were known to be now completed, the more pious Jews were in constant expectation of the promised Messiah. They were expecting redemption, λυτρωσις; such a redemption as was to be brought about by an <i>atonement</i>, or <i>expiatory victim</i>, or <i>ransom price</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68">Luke 1:68</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>In Jerusalem.</b></i> — It is probable she went about from <i>house</i> to <i>house</i>, testifying the grace of God. In the margin of our common version, <i>Israel</i> is put instead of <i>Jerusalem</i>, which the translators thought was nearly as eligible as the word they received into the text. This marginal reading is supported by several MSS., all the <i>Arabic</i> and <i>Persic</i> versions, the <i>Vulgate</i>, and most copies of the <i>Itala</i>. Were this reading to be received, it would make a very essential alteration in the <i>meaning</i> of the text, as it would intimate that this excellent woman travelled <i>over the</i> <i>land of Israel</i>, proclaiming the advent of Christ. At all events, it appears that this widow was one of the <i>first</i> publishers of the Gospel of Christ, and it is likely that she <i>travelled</i> with it from house to house through the city of Jerusalem, where she knew they dwelt who were expecting the salvation of God.</p>
