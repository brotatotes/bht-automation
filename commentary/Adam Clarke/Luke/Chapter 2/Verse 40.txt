<p>Verse 40. <i><b>The child grew</b></i> — As to his <i>body </i>- being in perfect health.</p>
<p><i><b>Waxed strong in spirit</b></i> — His rational <i>soul</i> became strong and vigorous.</p>
<p><i><b>Filled with wisdom</b></i> — The divinity continuing to communicate itself more and more, in proportion to the increase of the <i>rational</i> principle. The reader should never forget that Jesus was <i>perfect man</i>, as well as <i>God</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And the grace of God was upon him.</b></i> — The word χαρις, not only means grace in the common acceptation of the word, (some blessing granted by God's mercy to those who are sinners, or have no <i>merit</i>,) but it means also <i>favour</i> or <i>approbation</i>: and this sense I think most proper for it here, when applied to the human nature of our blessed Lord; and thus our translators render the same word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:52">Luke 2:52</span>. Even Christ himself, who knew no sin, <i>grew</i> in the <i>favour</i> of <i>God</i>; and, as to his human nature, <i>increased</i> in the <i>graces</i> of the Holy Spirit. From this we learn that, if a man were as pure and as perfect as the man Jesus Christ himself was, yet he might nevertheless <i>increase</i> in the <i>image</i>, and consequently in the <i>favour</i>, of God. God loves every thing and person, in proportion to the nearness of the approaches made to his own perfections.</p>
