But it does not appear that infants were obliged to be present; and yet all the men-children are positively ordered to make their appearance at Jerusalem thrice in the year, Exodus 34:23. And our Lord, being now twelve years old, Luke 2:42, accompanies his parents to the feast.

According to the Jewish canons, it was the age at which they were obliged to begin to learn a trade.
