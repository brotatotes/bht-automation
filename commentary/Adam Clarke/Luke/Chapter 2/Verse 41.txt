<p>Verse 41. <i><b>His parents went - every year</b></i> â€” This was their constant custom, because positively enjoined by the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:17">Exodus 23:17</span>. But it does not appear that <i>infants</i> were obliged to be present; and yet <i>all the men-children</i> are positively ordered to make their appearance at Jerusalem <i>thrice</i> in the year, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:23">Exodus 34:23</span>. And our Lord, being now <i>twelve</i> years old, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:42">Luke 2:42</span>, accompanies his parents to the feast. Probably this was the <i>very age</i> at which the male children were obliged to appear before the Lord at the three public festivals - the feast of unleavened bread, of weeks, and of tabernacles. According to the Jewish canons, it was the age at which they were obliged to begin to learn a trade.</p>
