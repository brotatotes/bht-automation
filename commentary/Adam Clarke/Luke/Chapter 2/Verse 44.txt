<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Supposing him to have been in the company</b></i> — Some have supposed that the men and women marched in separate companies on these occasions, which is very likely; and that sometimes the <i>children</i> kept company with the <i>men</i>, sometimes with the <i>women</i>. This might have led to what otherwise seems to have been inexcusable carelessness in Joseph and Mary. Joseph, not seeing Jesus in the men's company, might suppose he was with his mother in the women's company; and Mary, not seeing him with her, might imagine he was with Joseph.</p>
<p><i><b>Went a day's journey</b></i> — Knowing what a treasure they possessed, how could they be so long without looking on it? Where were the bowels and tender solicitude of the mother? Let them answer this question who can.</p>
<p><i><b>And they sought him</b></i> — ανεζητουν, <i>They earnestly sought him</i>. They are now both duly affected with a sense of their great loss and great negligence.</p>
<p><i><b>Kinsfolk and acquaintance.</b></i> — Those of the same family and neighbourhood went up to Jerusalem together on such occasions.</p>
<p>I have frequently been reminded, says Mr. Ward, when reading this history, of the crowds going to some place in Bengal, to an <i>idol feast</i>. Men, women, and children, in large companies, may be seen travelling together, with their bedding, &amp;c., on their heads. They cook and prepare their victuals in some shady place near a town, where they can purchase the necessaries they want, and, after remaining two or three days at the festival, <i>return in</i> <i>companies</i> as they went.</p>
