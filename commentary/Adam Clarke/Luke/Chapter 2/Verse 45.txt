<p>Verse 45. <i><b>Seeking him.</b></i> — ζητουντες αυτον - or rather, <i>seeking him</i> <i>diligently</i>, ανζητουντες. This is the reading of BCDL, <i>six</i> others, Vulgate, and <i>nine</i> copies of the <i>Itala</i>. If they sought <i>earnestly</i> when they first found him missing, there is little doubt that their <i>solicitude</i> and <i>diligence</i> must be greatly <i>increased</i> during his three days' absence, therefore the word which I have adopted, on the above authority, is more likely to be the true reading than the ζητουντες of the common text, which simply signifies <i>seeking</i>; whereas the other strongly marks their <i>solicitude</i> and <i>diligence</i>.</p>
