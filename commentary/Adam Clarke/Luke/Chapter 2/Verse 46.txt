<p>Verse 46. <i><b>Sitting in the midst of the doctors</b></i> — The rabbins, who were explaining the law and the ceremonies of the Jewish religion to their disciples.</p>
<p><i><b>Asking them questions.</b></i> — Not as a <i>scholar</i> asks his teacher, to be <i>informed</i>; but as a <i>teacher</i>, who <i>proposes</i> questions to his scholars in order to take an occasion to <i>instruct</i> them.</p>
<p>In the time of Josephus, the Jewish teachers were either very <i>ignorant</i> or very <i>humble</i>: for he tells us that, "when he was about fourteen years of age, the chief priests, and the principal men of the city, were constantly coming to <i>him</i> to be more accurately instructed in matters relative to the law." See his Life, sect. ii. If this were true, it is no wonder to find them now listening, with the deepest attention, to such teaching as they never before heard.</p>
