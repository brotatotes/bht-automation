<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:49">Luke 2:49</span>. <i><b>How is it that ye sought me?</b></i> — Is not this intended as a gentle <i>reproof</i>? Why had ye me to <i>seek</i>? Ye should not have left my company, when ye knew I am constantly employed in performing the will of the Most High.</p>
<p><i><b>My Father's business?</b></i> — Εν τοις του πατρος μου, <i>My Father's</i> <i>concerns</i>. Some think that these words should be translated, <i>In my</i> <i>Father's house</i>; which was a reason that they should have sought him in the <i>temple</i> only. As if he had said, Where should a <i>child</i> be found, but in his <i>father's house</i>? This translation is defended by <i>Grotius, Pearce</i>, and others; and is the reading of the <i>Syriac</i>, later <i>Persic</i>, and <i>Armenian</i> versions. Our Lord took this opportunity to instruct Joseph and Mary concerning his <i>Divine</i> nature and <i>mission</i>. <i>My Father's concerns</i>. This saying, one would think, could not have been easily misunderstood. It shows at once that he <i>came down</i> from <i>heaven</i>. Joseph had <i>no concerns</i> in the temple; and yet we find they did not fully comprehend it. How slow of heart is man to credit any thing that comes from God!</p>
