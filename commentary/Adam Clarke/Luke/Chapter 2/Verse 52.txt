<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:52">Luke 2:52</span>. <i><b>Jesus increased in wisdom</b></i> â€” <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:40">Luke 2:40</span>.</p>
<p>THE following remarks, taken chiefly from Mr. <i>Claude</i>, on the foregoing subject, are well worth the reader's attention.</p>
<p>I. The birth of Christ is announced to the shepherds.</p>
<p>1. God causes his grace to descend not only on the great and powerful of the world, but also upon the most simple and inconsiderable; just as the heavens diffuse their influence not only on great trees, but also on the smallest herbs.</p>
<p>2. God seems to take more delight in bestowing his favours on the <i>most abject</i> than in distributing them among persons of elevated rank. Here is an example: for while he sent the <i>wise men</i> of the east to Herod, he sent an <i>angel</i> of heaven to the shepherds, and conducted them to the cradle of the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p>3. ln this meeting of the angels and shepherds, you see a <i>perpetual characteristic</i> of the economy of Jesus Christ; wherein the highest and most sublime things are joined with the meanest and lowest. In his person, the <i>eternal</i> WORD is united to a creature, the Divine nature to the human, infinity to infirmity, in a word, the Lord of glory to mean flesh and blood. On his cross, though he appears naked, crowned with thorns, and exposed to sorrows, yet at the same time he shakes the earth, and eclipses the sun. Here, in like manner, are angels familiar with shepherds; <i>angels</i>, to mark his <i>majesty; shepherds</i>, his <i>humility</i>.</p>
<p>4. This mission of angels relates to the <i>end</i> for which the Son of God came into the world; for he came to establish a communion between God and men, and to make peace between men and angels: to this must be referred what St. Paul says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>, <i>It pleased the Father, by him, to reconcile all things to</i> <i>himself</i>.</p>
<p>5. However simple and plain the employments of men may be, it is always very pleasing to God when they discharge them with a good conscience. While these shepherds were busy in their <i>calling</i>, God sent his angels to them.</p>
<p>6. God does, in regard to men, what these shepherds did in regard to their sheep. He is the great Shepherd of mankind, continually watching over them by his <i>providence</i>.</p>
<p>II. The <i>glory</i> of the Lord <i>shone</i> round the shepherds.</p>
<p>1. When angels borrow human forms, in order to appear to men, they have always some ensigns of grandeur and majesty, to show that they are not <i>men</i>, but <i>angels</i>.</p>
<p>2. The appearance of this <i>light</i> to the shepherds in the <i>night</i>, may very well be taken for a mystical symbol. <i>Night</i> represents the corrupt state of mankind when Jesus came into the world; a state of <i>ignorance</i> and <i>error</i>. <i>Light</i> fitly represents the salutary grace of Christ, which dissipates obscurity, and gives us the true <i>knowledge</i> of God.</p>
<p>III. The shepherds were filled with great fear.</p>
<p>1. This was the effect of their great <i>surprise</i>. When grand objects suddenly present themselves to us, they must needs fill us with astonishment and fear, for the mind, on these occasions, is not at liberty to exert its force; on the contrary, its strength is dissipated, and during this dissipation it is impossible not to fear.</p>
<p>2. This fear may also arise from emotions of <i>conscience</i>. Man is by nature a <i>sinner</i>, and consequently an object of the <i>justice</i> of God. While God does not manifest himself to him, he remains insensible of his sin; but, when God discovers himself to him, he awakes to feeling, and draws nigh to God as a trembling criminal approaches his judge. See this exemplified in the case of Adam, and in that of the Israelites when God appeared on the mountain: hence that proverbial saying, <i>We shall die, for we have seen God</i>.</p>
<p>3. The shepherds had just reason to fear when they saw before them an angel of heaven, surrounded with the ensigns of majesty, for angels had been formerly the <i>ministers of God's vengeance</i>. On this occasion, the sad examples of Divine vengeance, recorded in Scripture, and performed by the ministry of angels, might, in a moment, rise to view, and incline them to think that this angel had received a like order to destroy <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>IV. Observe the angel's discourse to the shepherds.</p>
<p>1. The angels say to them, <i>Fear not</i>. This preface was necessary to gain their attention, which fear, no doubt, had dissipated. The disposition which the angel wishes to awaken in them comports with the news which he intended to announce; for what has <i>fear</i> to do with the birth of the Saviour of the world?</p>
<p>2. The angel describes,</p>
<p>1st, The <i>person</i> of whom he speaks, a <i>Saviour, Christ, the Lord</i>; see before on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:11">Luke 2:11</span>. See,</p>
<p>2dly, <i>What</i> he speaks of him; <i>he is born unto you</i>.</p>
<p>3dly, He marks the time; <i>this day</i>.</p>
<p>4thly, He describes the <i>place; in the city of</i> <i>David</i>.</p>
<p>5thly, He specifies the <i>nature</i> of this important news; <i>a</i> <i>great joy which shall be unto all people</i>. See Claude's Essay, by Robinson, vol. i. p. 266, c.</p>
<p>Concerning Simeon, <i>three</i> things deserve to be especially noted: 1. His <i>faith</i>. 2. His <i>song</i>. And 3. His <i>prophecy</i>.</p>
<p>I. His faith.</p>
<p>1. He expected the promised Redeemer, in virtue of the promises which God had made and, to show that his faith was of the operation of God's Spirit, he lived a life of <i>righteousness</i> and <i>devotedness</i> to God. Many profess to expect the salvation which God has promised only to those who believe, while living in conformity to the world, under the influence of its spirit, and in the general breach of the righteous law of God.</p>
<p>2. The faith of Simeon led him only to wish for life that he might see him who was promised, and, be properly prepared for an inheritance among the sanctified. They who make not this use of life are much to be lamented. It would have been better for them had they never been born.</p>
<p>3. The faith of Simeon was crowned with success. Jesus came; he <i>saw</i>, he <i>felt</i>, he <i>adored</i> him! and, with a heart filled with the love of God, he breathed out his holy soul, and probably the last dregs of his life, in praise to the fountain of all good.</p>
<p>II. Simeon's song. By it he shows forth: -</p>
<p>1. The <i>joy</i> of his own <i>heart</i>. Lord, now thou dismissest thy servant; as if he had said: "Yes, O my God, I am going to quit this earth! I feel that thou callest me; and I quit it without regret. Thou hast fulfilled all my desires, and completed my wishes, and I desire to be detained no longer from the full enjoyment of thyself." O, how sweet is death, after such an enjoyment and discovery of eternal life!</p>
<p>2. Simeon shows forth the <i>glory of Christ</i>. He is the Sun of righteousness, rising on a dark and ruined world with light and salvation. He is the <i>light</i> that shall <i>manifest</i> the infinite kindness of God to the <i>Gentile people</i>; proving that God is good to <i>all</i>, and that his tender mercies are over <i>all his works</i>.</p>
<p>He is the <i>glory of Israel</i>. It is by him that the Gentiles have been led to acknowledge the Jews as the <i>peculiar people of God</i>; their books as the <i>word</i> of <i>God</i>, and their <i>teaching</i> as the <i>revelation</i> of <i>God</i>. What an honour for this people, had they known how to profit by it!</p>
<p>3. He astonished <i>Joseph</i> and <i>Mary</i> with his sublime account of the Redeemer of the world. They hear him glorified, and their hearts exult in it. From this Divine song they learn that this miraculous son of theirs is the <i>sum</i> and <i>substance</i> of all the promises made unto the <i>fathers</i>, and of all the predictions of the <i>prophets</i>.</p>
<p>III. Simeon's prophecy.</p>
<p>1. He addresses <i>Christ</i>, and foretells that he should be for the ruin and recovery of many in Israel. How astonishing is the folly and perverseness of man, to turn that into poison which God has made the choicest medicine; and thus to <i>kill</i> themselves with the <i>cure</i> which he has appointed for them in the infinity of his love! Those who <i>speak against</i> Jesus, his <i>ways</i>, his <i>doctrine</i>, his <i>cross</i>, his <i>sacrifice</i>, are likely to stumble, and fall, and rise no more for ever! May the God of mercy save the reader from this condemnation!</p>
<p>2. He addresses <i>Mary</i>, and foretells the <i>agonies</i> she must go through. What must this holy woman have endured when she saw her son <i>crowned</i> with <i>thorns, scourged, buffeted, spit upon </i>- when she saw his <i>hands</i> and his <i>feet nailed</i> to the <i>cross</i>, and his <i>side</i> <i>pierced</i> with a <i>spear</i>! What a sword through her own soul must each of these have been! But this is not all. These sufferings of Jesus are predicted thirty years before they were to take place! What a martyrdom was this! While he is nourished in her bosom, she cannot help considering him as a <i>lamb</i> who is <i>growing up</i> to be <i>sacrificed.</i> The <i>older</i> he grows, the <i>nearer</i> the <i>bloody scene</i> approaches! Thus her sufferings must <i>increase</i> with his <i>years</i>, and only <i>end</i> with his <i>life</i>!</p>
<p>3. He foretells the effects which should be produced by the persecutions raised against Christ and his followers. This sword of persecution shall lay open the hearts of many, and discover their <i>secret motives</i> and <i>designs</i>. When the doctrine of the cross is preached, and persecution raised because of it, then the precious are easily distinguished from the vile. Those whose hearts are not established by grace, now right with God, will turn aside from the way of righteousness, and deny the Lord that bought them. On the other hand, those whose faith stands not in the wisdom of man, but in the power of God, will continue faithful unto death, glorify God in the fire, and thus show forth the excellency of his salvation, and the sincerity of the profession which they had before made. Thus the thoughts of many hearts are <i>still</i> revealed.</p>
<p>The design of our blessed Lord in staying behind in the temple seems to have been twofold.</p>
<p>1st. To prepare the Jews to acknowledge in him a <i>Divine</i> and <i>supernatural wisdom</i>: and</p>
<p>2dly. To impress the minds of Joseph and Mary with a proper idea of his <i>independence</i> and <i>Divinity</i>.</p>
<p>Their conduct in this business may be a lasting lesson and profitable warning to all the disciples of Christ.</p>
<p>1st. It is possible (by not carefully watching the heart, and by not keeping sacredly and constantly in view the <i>spirituality</i> of every <i>duty</i>) to lose the presence and power of Christ, even in <i>religious ordinances</i>. Joseph and Mary were at the <i>feast of the</i> <i>passover</i> when they <i>lost</i> Jesus!</p>
<p>2dly. Many who have sustained loss in their souls are kept from making speedy application to God for help and salvation, through the foolish supposition that their state is not so bad as it really is; and, in the things of salvation, many content themselves with the persuasion that the religious people with whom they associate are the <i>peculiar favourites</i> of Heaven, and that they are in a state of complete safety while <i>connected</i> with them.</p>
<p>They, <i>supposing him to be in the company, went a day's journey</i>.</p>
<p>3dly. Deep sorrow and self-reproach must be the consequence of the discovery of so great a loss as that of the <i>presence</i> and <i>power</i> of Christ. <i>Joseph and Mary sought him sorrowing</i>.</p>
<p>4thly. When people are convinced, by the light of the Lord, that their souls are not in a safe state, and that unless they find the Redeemer of the world they must perish, they are naturally led to inquire among their <i>kinsfolk</i> and <i>acquaintance</i> for him who saves sinners. But this often proves <i>fruitless</i>; they know not Jesus themselves, and they cannot tell others where to find him.</p>
<p><i>They sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance, and found</i> <i>him not</i>.</p>
<p>5thly. When people perceive that they have proceeded in a certain course of life for a considerable time, without that salvation which God promises in his word, they should first <i>stop</i> and <i>inquire</i> into their state, and when they find that they have been posting into eternity, not only without a preparation for glory, but with an immense load of guilt upon their souls, they should <i>turn back</i>, and, as their time may be but short, they should <i>seek diligently</i>.</p>
<p><i>They turned back to Jerusalem, earnestly seeking him</i>.</p>
<p>6thly. The likeliest place to find Jesus and his salvation is the <i>temple</i>. The place where his pure unadulterated Gospel is preached, the sanctuary where the power and glory of God are seen in the conviction, conversion, and salvation of sinners. <i>They</i> <i>found him in the temple, among the doctors</i>.</p>
<p>7thly. Trials, persecutions, and afflictions are all nothing, when the <i>presence</i> and <i>power</i> of Christ are felt; but when a testimony of his approbation lives no longer in the heart, every thing is grievous and insupportable. The <i>fatigue</i> of the journey to <i>Bethlehem</i>, the <i>flight</i> from the cruelty of <i>Herod</i>, and the unavoidable <i>trials</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, were cheerfully supported by Joseph and Mary, because in all they had Jesus <i>with</i> them; but now they are in distress and misery because he is <i>behind</i> in Jerusalem. Reader, if thou have <i>lost</i> Jesus, take no rest to body or soul till thou have found him! <i>Without</i> him, all is confusion and ruin: <i>with</i> him, all is joy and peace.</p>
