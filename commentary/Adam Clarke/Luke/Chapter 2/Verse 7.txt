<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:7">Luke 2:7</span>. <i><b>Laid him in a manger</b></i> — Wetstein has shown, from a multitude of instances, that φατνη means not merely the <i>manger</i>, but the whole <i>stable</i>, and this I think is its proper meaning in this place. The Latins use <i>praesepe</i>, a manger, in the same sense. So Virgil, AEn. vii. p. 275.</p>
<p><i>Stabant ter centum nitidi in praesepibus altis.</i></p>
<p>"Three hundred sleek horses stood in lofty stables."</p>
<p>Many have thought that this was a full proof of the <i>meanness</i> and <i>poverty</i> of the holy family, that they were <i>obliged</i> to take up their lodging in a <i>stable</i>; but such people overlook the <i>reason</i> given by the inspired penman, <i>because there was no room for them</i> <i>in the inn</i>. As multitudes were going now to be enrolled, all the lodgings in the inn had been occupied <i>before</i> Joseph and Mary arrived. An honest man who had worked diligently at his business, under the peculiar blessing of God, as Joseph undoubtedly had, could not have been so destitute of money as not to be able to procure himself and wife a comfortable lodging for a night; and, had he been so ill fitted for the journey as some unwarrantably imagine, we may take it for granted he would not have brought his wife with him, who was in such a state as not to be exposed to any inconveniences of this kind without imminent danger.</p>
<p><i><b>There was no room for them in the inn.</b></i> — In ancient times, inns were as respectable as they were useful, being fitted up for the reception of <i>travellers</i> alone:-now, they are frequently haunts for the idle and the profligate, the drunkard and the infidel;-in short, for any kind of guests except Jesus and his genuine followers. To this day there is little room for such in most inns; nor indeed have they, in general, any business in such places. As the Hindoos travel in large companies to holy places and to festivals, it often happens that the inns (suraies) are so crowded that there is not room for one half of them: some lie at the door, others in the porch. These inns, or lodging-houses, are kept by Mohammedans, and <i>Mussulmans</i> obtain prepared food at them; but the Hindoos purchase rice, &amp;c., and cook it, paying about a halfpenny a night for their lodging.
