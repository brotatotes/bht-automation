<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:8">Luke 2:8</span>. <i><b>There were - shepherds abiding in the field</b></i> — There is no intimation here that these shepherds were exposed to the <i>open air</i>. They dwelt in the fields where they had their sheep penned up; but they undoubtedly had <i>tents</i> or <i>booths</i> under which they dwelt.</p>
<p><i><b>Keeping watch - by night.</b></i> — Or, as in the margin, <i>keeping the</i> <i>watches of the night</i>, i.e. each one keeping a watch (which ordinarily consisted of three hours) in his turn. The reason why they watched them in the field appears to have been, either to preserve the sheep from <i>beasts of prey</i>, such as wolves, foxes, c., or from freebooting banditti, with which all the land of Judea was at that time much infested. It was a custom among the Jews to send out their sheep to the deserts, about the passover, and bring them home at the commencement of the <i>first rain</i>: during the time they were out, the shepherds watched them night and day. As the passover occurred in the <i>spring</i>, and the <i>first rain</i> began early in the month of <i>Marchesvan</i>, which answers to part of our <i>October</i> and <i>November</i>, we find that the sheep were kept out in the open country during the whole of the <i>summer</i>. And as these shepherds had not <i>yet</i> brought home their flocks, it is a presumptive argument that <i>October</i> had not yet commenced, and that, consequently, our Lord was not born on the 25th <i>of December</i>, when no flocks were out in the fields nor could he have been born later than <i>September</i>, as the flocks were still in the fields <i>by</i> <i>night</i>. On this very ground the nativity in <i>December</i> should be given up. The feeding of the flocks by night in the fields is a <i>chronological fact</i>, which casts considerable light upon this disputed point. See the quotations from the <i>Talmudists</i> in <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>time</i> in which Christ was born has been considered a subject of great importance among Christians. However, the matter has been considered of no moment by Him who inspired the evangelists; as not one hint is dropped on the subject, by which it might be possible even to guess nearly to the time, except the <i>chronological fact</i> mentioned above. A late writer makes tho following remark: "The first Christians placed the baptism of Christ about the beginning of the fifteenth year of <i>Tiberius</i>; and thence reckoning back <i>thirty</i> years, they placed his birth in the forty-third year of the <i>Julian</i> period, the forty-second of <i>Augustus</i>, and the twenty-eighth after the victory at <i>Actium</i>. This opinion obtained till A. D. 527, when <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i> invented the vulgar account. Learned and pious men have trifled egregiously on this subject, making that of importance which the Holy Spirit, by his silence, has plainly informed them is of none. <i>Fabricius</i> gives a catalogue of no less than 136 different opinions concerning the YEAR of Christ's <i>birth</i>: and as to his <i>birth</i> DAY, that has been placed by Christian sects and learned men in every month in the year. The Egyptians placed it in <i>January </i>- Wagenseil, in <i>February </i>- Bochart, in <i>March</i>-some, mentioned by Clemens Alexandrinus, in <i>April </i>- others, in <i>May </i>- Epiphanius speaks of some who placed it in <i>June </i>- and of others who supposed it to have been in <i>July </i>- Wagenseil, who was not sure of <i>February</i>, fixed it probably in <i>August </i>- Lightfoot, on the 15th of <i>September </i>- Scaliger, Casaubon, and Calvisius, in <i>October </i>- others, in <i>November </i>- but the Latin Church, <i>supreme</i> in <i>power</i>, and <i>infallible</i> in <i>judgment</i>, placed it on the 25th of <i>December</i>, the very day on which the ancient Romans celebrated the feast of their goddess <i>Bruma</i>." See more in Robinson's Notes on Claude's Essay, vol. i. p. 275, &amp;c. Pope Julius I. was the person who made this alteration, and it appears to have been done for this reason: the sun now began his return towards the northern tropic, ending the winter, lengthening the short days, and introducing the spring. All this was probably deemed emblematical of the rising of the Sun of righteousness on the darkness of this world, and causing the day-spring from on high to visit mankind.</p>
