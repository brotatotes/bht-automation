<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>. <i><b>The angel of the Lord came upon them</b></i> — Or, <i>stood over</i> <i>them</i>, επεστη. It is likely that the angel appeared in the <i>air</i> at some little distance above them, and that from him the rays of the <i>glory of the Lord shone round about them</i>, as the rays of light are protected from the sun.</p>
<p><i><b>They were sore afraid.</b></i> — Terrified with the appearance of so glorious a being, and probably fearing that he was a messenger of <i>justice</i>, coming to denounce Divine judgments, or punish them immediately, for sins with which their consciences would not fail, on such an occasion, to reproach them.</p>
