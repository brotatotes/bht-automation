<p>Verse 38. <i><b>All live unto him.</b></i> â€” There is a remarkable passage in <i>Josephus's</i> account of the Maccabees, chap. xvi., which proves that the best informed Jews believed that the souls of righteous men were in the presence of God in a state of happiness. "<i>They who</i> <i>lose their lives for the sake of God, LIVE unto GOD, as do</i> <i>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of the patriarchs</i>." And one not less remarkable in <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, fol. 159. "Rabbi Abbin saith, The Lord said unto Moses, Find me out ten righteous persons among the people, and I will not destroy thy people. Then said Moses, Behold, here am <i>I, Aaron, Eleazar, Ithamar, Phineas, Caleb</i>, and <i>Joshua</i>; but God said, Here are but <i>seven</i>, where are the other three? When Moses knew not what to do, he said, O Eternal God, do those live that are dead! Yes, saith God. Then said Moses, If those that are dead do live, remember <i>Abraham, Isaac</i>, and <i>Jacob</i>." So the resurrection of the dead, and the immortality and immateriality of the soul, were not strange or unknown doctrines among the Jews.</p>
