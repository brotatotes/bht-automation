<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:43">Luke 20:43</span>. <i><b>Thy footstool.</b></i> â€” Literally, <i>the footstool of thy feet</i>. They shall not only be so far humbled that the feet <i>may</i> be set on them; but they shall be <i>actually</i> subjected, and put completely under that Christ whom they now despise, and are about to crucify.</p>
