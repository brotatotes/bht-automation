<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:2">Luke 21:2</span>. <i><b>A certain poor widow</b></i> — A widow <i>miserably poor</i>; this is the proper import of πενιχραν, and her being <i>miserably poor</i> heightened the merit of the action.</p>
<p><i><b>Two mites.</b></i> — Which Mark says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:42">Mark 12:42</span>, make a <i>farthing</i> or <i>quadrans</i>, the <i>fourth</i> part of an AS, or <i>penny</i>, as we term it. In Plutarch's time we find the smallest piece of brass coin in use among the Romans was the <i>quadrans</i>, but it appears that a smaller piece of money was in circulation among the Jews in our Lord's time, called here, and in Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:42">Mark 12:42</span>, a <i>lepton</i>, i.e. <i>small, diminished</i>, from λειπο, <i>I fail</i>. In ancient times our penny used to be marked with a deep indented cross, dividing the piece into <i>four equal parts</i>, which, when broken in <i>two</i>, made the <i>half-penny</i>, and, when broken into <i>four</i>, made the <i>fourthing</i>, what we have corrupted into <i>farthing</i>. Probably the Roman <i>quadrans</i> was divided in this way for the convenience of the poor. Our term <i>mite</i> seems to have been taken from the <i>animal</i> called by that name; for as <i>that</i> appeared to our ancestors to be the <i>smallest</i> of all animals, so this being the <i>smallest</i> of all coins was called by its name. <i>Junius</i> says that mite was a small base coin among the <i>Dutch</i>. Our word <i>mite</i> seems to be a contraction of the Latin <i>minutum, a small thing</i>, whence the French <i>miete</i>, a <i>crumb</i>, a very small <i>morsel</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span></span>.</p>
