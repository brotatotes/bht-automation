<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Take heed to yourselves</b></i> — See our Lord's parable, relative to this matter, explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:34">Mark 13:34</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Be overcharged</b></i> — Literally, <i>be made heavy</i>, as is generally the case with those who have eaten or drank too much. Take heed that ye be not rendered <i>secure</i> by an improper use of lawful things: do not make this earth your portion: expect its dissolution, and prepare to meet your God.</p>
