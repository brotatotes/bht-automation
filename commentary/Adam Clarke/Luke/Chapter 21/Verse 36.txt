<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:36">Luke 21:36</span>. <i><b>Watch ye therefore, and pray always</b></i> — Perhaps we should connect ες παντι καιρω, <i>continually</i>, with αγρυπνειτε, <i>watch</i>, as it appears to be the most natural order. Indeed the word <i>continually</i> belongs equally to both <i>watch</i> and <i>pray</i>; and no man is safe, at <i>any time</i>, who does not attend to this advice as <i>literally</i> as possible.</p>
<p><i><b>That shall come to pass</b></i> — That is, the tribulations which are on their way to overwhelm and destroy the Jewish people. These are sufficiently stated in the preceding verses.</p>
<p><i><b>To stand before the Son of man.</b></i> — To be <i>acquitted</i>, and to be <i>condemned</i>, are expressed, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>, by <i>standing</i> and <i>falling</i>. Those who were faithful to the grace they had received were not only not destroyed in the destruction of Jerusalem, but became heralds of the grace and mercy of God to the nations. Thus they were counted worthy <i>to stand before the Son of</i> <i>man</i>-to minister salvation in his name.</p>
