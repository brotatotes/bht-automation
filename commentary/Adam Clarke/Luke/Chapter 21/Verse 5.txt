<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:5">Luke 21:5</span>. <i><b>Goodly stones</b></i> — Or, <i>costly stones</i>. It has been thought by some that this relates not so much to the stones of which the temple was built, as to the <i>precious stones</i> with which it was decorated. For an account of the <i>stones</i> of the temple, <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1">Mark 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1">Mark 13:1</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And gifts</b></i> — Or, <i>consecrated things</i>, αναθημασι. αναθημα properly signifies a thing <i>consecrated to sacred uses</i>: αναθεμα signifies a thing <i>devoted to a curse</i>, or to <i>destruction</i>. They both come from the same root, ανατιθημι, <i>I lay up, separate</i>; and though two meanings cannot be more opposite than those assigned to these words, yet in the words themselves a short vowel (ε) in the place of a long one (η) makes all the difference between <i>blessing</i> and <i>cursing</i>.</p>
