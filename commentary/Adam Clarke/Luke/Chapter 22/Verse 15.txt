<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15">Luke 22:15</span>. <i><b>With desire I have desired</b></i> â€” A Hebraism for, <i>I have</i> <i>desired most earnestly</i>. Our Lord's meaning seems to be, that, having purposed to redeem a lost world by his blood, he ardently longed for the time in which he was to offer himself up. Such love did the holy Jesus bear to the human race. This <i>eucharistic</i> passover was celebrated once, by way of anticipation, before the bloody sacrifice of the victim of salvation, and before the <i>deliverance</i> it was appointed to commemorate; as the <i>figurative</i> passover had been likewise once celebrated before the going out of Egypt, and the <i>deliverance</i> of God's chosen people. <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
