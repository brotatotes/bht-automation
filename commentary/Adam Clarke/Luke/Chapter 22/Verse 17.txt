<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17">Luke 22:17</span>. <i><b>He took the cup</b></i> — This was not the <i>sacramental cup</i>, for that was taken <i>after</i> supper, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span>, but was the cup which was ordinarily taken <i>before</i> supper.</p>
<p><i><b>Divide it among yourselves</b></i> — Pass the cup from one to another; thus the cup which Christ gave to the first person on his right hand continued to be handed from one to another, till it came to the last person on his left.</p>
