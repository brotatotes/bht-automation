Verse Luke 22:18. I will not drink of the fruit of the vine â€” That is, before the time of another passover, the Holy Ghost shall descend, the Gospel of the kingdom be established, and the sacramental supper shall take place of the paschal lamb; for in a few hours his crucifixion was to take place. Matthew 26:29; Matthew 26:29.
