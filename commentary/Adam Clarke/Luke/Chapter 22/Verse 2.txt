<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:2">Luke 22:2</span>. <i><b>They feared the people.</b></i> â€” The great mass of the people seem to have been convinced that Christ was at least a prophet sent from God; and it is likely they kept steady in their attachment to him. The multitude, who are represented as clamouring for his blood at the crucifixion, appear to have been a mere mob, formed out of the <i>creatures</i> of the chief priests and Pharisees.</p>
