<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span>. <i><b>This cup</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the new testament in my blood</b></i> â€” Perhaps it might be better to paraphrase the passage thus: <i>This cup which is</i> <i>poured out for you</i>, signifies the blood of <i>the new covenant</i>, which is shortly to be ratified <i>in</i> (or <i>by</i>) the shedding of <i>my blood</i>. Or, <i>This cup is the new covenant, poured out for you with my</i> <i>blood</i>: - that is, the paschal sacrifice and my sacrifice happen together. But see <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p>It does not appear that our Lord handed either the bread or the cup to each person; he gave it to him who was next to him, and, by handing it from one to another, they shared it among themselves, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17">Luke 22:17</span>. In this respect the present mode of administering the Lord's Supper is not strictly according to the original institution.</p>
