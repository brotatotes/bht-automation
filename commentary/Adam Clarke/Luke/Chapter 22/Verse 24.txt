<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24">Luke 22:24</span>. <i><b>There was also a strife among them</b></i> â€” There are <i>two</i> different instances of this sort of <i>contention</i> or <i>strife</i> mentioned by the evangelists, each of which was accompanied with very different circumstances; one by Matthew, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:1">Matthew 18:1</span>, c., by Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:33">Mark 9:33</span>, c. and by Luke, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:46">Luke 9:46</span>, c. That contention cannot have been the same with this which is mentioned here. The other, related in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:20">Matthew 20:20</span>, &amp;c., and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:35">Mark 10:35</span>, &amp;c., must be what Luke intended here to record and this <i>strife</i> or <i>contention</i> was occasioned by the request which Zebedee's wife made to our Lord in favour of her sons, James and John but, then, Luke has mentioned this very much out of the order of time, it having happened while our Lord and his disciples were on their way to Jerusalem: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:17">Matthew 20:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</span>.
