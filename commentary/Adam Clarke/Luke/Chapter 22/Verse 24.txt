Verse Luke 22:24. There was also a strife among them â€” There are two different instances of this sort of contention or strife mentioned by the evangelists, each of which was accompanied with very different circumstances; one by Matthew, in Matthew 18:1, c., by Mark, Mark 9:33, c. and by Luke, in Luke 9:46, c. That contention cannot have been the same with this which is mentioned here. The other, related in Matthew 20:20, &c., and Mark 10:35, &c., must be what Luke intended here to record and this strife or contention was occasioned by the request which Zebedee's wife made to our Lord in favour of her sons, James and John but, then, Luke has mentioned this very much out of the order of time, it having happened while our Lord and his disciples were on their way to Jerusalem: Matthew 20:17; Mark 10:32.
