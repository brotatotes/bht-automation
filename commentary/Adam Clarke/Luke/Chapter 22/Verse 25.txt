<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Are called benefactors.</b></i> — The very Greek word used by the evangelist, ευεργεται, was the <i>surname</i> of some of the Ptolemies of Egypt; <i>Ptolemy Euergetes</i>, i.e. the <i>Benefactor</i>. It was a custom among the ancient Romans to distribute part of the lands which they had conquered on the frontiers of the empire to their soldiers; those who enjoyed such lands were called <i>beneficiarii</i>, beneficed persons; and the lands themselves were termed <i>beneficia</i>, benefices, as being held on the <i>beneficence</i> of the sovereign; and it is no wonder that such sovereigns, however tyrannical or oppressive they might have been in other respects, were termed <i>benefactors</i> by those who were thus dependent on their bounty.</p>
