<p>Verse 29. <i><b>I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath</b></i><b> </b><i><b>appointed unto me</b></i> — The <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, with some other MSS., the later <i>Syriac</i>, and <i>Origen</i>, read in the first clause, διαθηκην, <i>a covenant</i>. <i>I appoint unto you a COVENANT, as my Father hath</i> <i>appointed unto me a kingdom</i>: - Ye shall be ministers of the new covenant, as I am king in that spiritual kingdom to which it relates. This is a curious reading: but our Lord is probably to be understood as promising that they should get a kingdom - a state of blessedness, <i>as</i> he should get it - they <i>must go through much</i> <i>tribulation</i> in order to <i>enter into the kingdom of God</i>. So the Son of man <i>suffered</i> that he might enter into his glory: for the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross, and despised the shame, and is set down on the right hand of God.</p>
