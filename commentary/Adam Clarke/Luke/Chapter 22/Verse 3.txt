<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3">Luke 22:3</span>. <i><b>Then entered Satan into Judas</b></i> — The devil filled the heart of Judas with <i>avarice</i>; and that infamous passion led him to commit the crime here specified. This at once accounts for the whole of this most unprincipled and unnatural transaction. None but a devil, or he who is possessed by one, could have been guilty of it: - let the living lay this to heart. A minister of the Gospel, who is a lover of money, is constantly betraying the interests of Christ. He cannot serve <i>two</i> masters; and while his heart is possessed with the love of pelf, the love of God and zeal for perishing souls cannot dwell in him. What Satan could not do by the envy and malice of the high priests and Pharisees, he effects by Judas, a false and fallen minister of the Gospel of God. None are so dangerous to the interests of Christianity as persons of this stamp.</p>
