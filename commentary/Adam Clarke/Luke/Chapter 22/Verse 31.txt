<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Simon, Simon</b></i> — When a name is thus <i>repeated</i> in the sacred writings, it appears to be always intended as an expression of <i>love</i>, manifested by a <i>warning</i> voice. As if he had said, While thou and the others are contending for supremacy, Satan is endeavouring to destroy you all: but I have prayed for <i>thee</i>, as being in most danger.</p>
<p><i><b>Satan hath desired - you</b></i> — That is, all the apostles, but particularly the three contenders: the plural pronoun, υμας, sufficiently proves that these words were not addressed to Peter <i>alone</i>. Satan had already got <i>one</i>, Judas; he had nearly got <i>another</i>, Peter; and he wished to have <i>all</i>. But we see by this that the devil cannot even tempt a man unless he receive <i>permission</i>. He <i>desires</i> to do all evil; he is permitted only to do some.</p>
