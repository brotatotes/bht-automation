<p>Verse 32. <i><b>I have prayed for thee</b></i> — From the natural forwardness and impetuosity of thy own spirit, thou wilt be brought into the most imminent danger; <i>but I have supplicated for thee, that thy</i> <i>faith may not utterly fail </i>- εκλειπη, from εκ, <i>out</i>, and λειπω, <i>I fail</i>, to <i>fall utterly</i> or <i>entirely off</i>. Peter's faith did <i>fail</i>, but not <i>utterly</i>: he did <i>fall</i>, but he did not <i>fall</i> <i>off</i>, apostatize, or forsake his Master and his cause <i>finally</i>, as Judas did. Every body sees, from Peter's denial of his Lord, that his <i>faith did fail</i>, and his great courage too; and yet they read, in the common translation, that Christ prayed that it might <i>not</i> <i>fail</i>: can they then conceive that our Lord's prayer was heard? The translation which I have given above removes this embarrassment and apparent contradiction. It was certainly Peter's advantage that our Lord did pray for him; but it was not so much for his honour that he should stand in need of such a prayer, beyond all others. <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>When thou art converted</b></i> — Restored to a sense of thy folly and sin, and to me and my cause - <i>establish these thy brethren</i>. All the disciples forsook Jesus and fled, merely through fear of losing their lives; Peter, who continued for a while <i>near</i> him, denied his Master with oaths, and repeated this <i>thrice</i>: our Lord seems to intimate that, after this fall, Peter would become more cautious and circumspect than ever; and that he should become uncommonly strong in the faith, which was the case; and that, notwithstanding the <i>baseness</i> of his past conduct, he should be a proper instrument for strengthening the feeble minded, and supporting the weak. His two epistles to the persecuted Christians show how well he was qualified for this important work.</p>
