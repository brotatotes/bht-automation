<p>Verse 34. <i><b>The cock shall not crow this day</b></i> â€” <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:34">Matthew 26:34</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:30">Mark 14:30</span>, say, <i>this night</i>; both expressions are right, because the Jewish day, of twenty-four hours, began with the evening, and ended at the evening of the following day. On Peter's denial, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31-35">Matthew 26:31-35</span>.</p>
