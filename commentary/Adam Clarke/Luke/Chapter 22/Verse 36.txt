<p>Verse 36. <i><b>He that hath no sword</b></i> — Bishop PEARCE supposes that the word μαχαιραν, <i>sword</i>, has been inserted here from what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:38">Luke 22:38</span>, as it is evident our Lord never intended to make any resistance, or to suffer a sword to be used on the occasion; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:52">Matthew 26:52</span>. The word stands rather oddly in the passage: the verse, translated in the order in which it stands, is as follows: <i>And he who hath none, let him sell his garment and buy </i>- a sword. Now it is plain that the verb πωλησατω, <i>let him buy</i>, may be referred to πηραν a <i>scrip</i>, in the former part of the verse: therefore if, according to the bishop's opinion, the word <i>sword</i> be omitted, the passage may be understood thus: "When I sent you out before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span>, c., I intended you to continue itinerants only for a <i>few days</i>, and to preach the Gospel only to your <i>country-men</i> therefore you had but little need of a staff, purse, or scrip, as your journey was neither <i>long</i>, nor <i>expensive</i>; but <i>now</i> I am about to send you <i>into all the world, to preach the Gospel to every</i> <i>creature</i>; and, as ye shall be generally hated and persecuted for my sake, ye shall have need to make every prudent provision for your journey; and so necessary will it be for you to provide yourselves victuals, &amp;c., for your passage through your inhospitable country, that, if any of you have no <i>scrip</i> or <i>wallet</i>, he should sell even his upper garment to provide one." Others, who are for retaining the word <i>sword</i>, think that it was a proverbial expression, intimating a time of great difficulty and danger, and that now the disciples had need to look to themselves, for his murderers were at hand. The reader will observe that these words were spoken to the disciples just before he went to the garden of Gethsemane, and that the danger was now so very <i>near</i> that there could be no time for any of them to go and sell his garment in order to purchase a sword to defend himself and his Master from the attack of the Jewish mob.</p>
<p>Judea was at this time, as we have already noticed, much infested by robbers: while our Lord was with his disciples, they were perfectly safe, being shielded by his miraculous power. Shortly they must go into every part of the land, and will need weapons to defend themselves against wild beasts, and to intimidate wicked men, who, if they found them totally defenceless, would not hesitate to make them their prey, or take away their life. However the matter may be understood, we may rest satisfied that these <i>swords</i> were neither to be considered as <i>offensive</i> weapons, nor instruments to propagate the truth. The genius and spirit of the Christian religion is equally against <i>both</i>. Perhaps, in this counsel of our Lord, he refers to the contention about supremacy: as if he had said, Instead of contending among yourselves about who shall be the greatest, ye have more need to unite yourselves against the common enemy, who are now at hand: this counsel was calculated to show them the necessity of union among themselves, as their enemies were both numerous and powerful.</p>
