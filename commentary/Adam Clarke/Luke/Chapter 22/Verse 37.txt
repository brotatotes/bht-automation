<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Must yet be accomplished</b></i> — Probably meaning that, though this prophecy did refer to some particular matter in the time of the prophet, yet it <i>farther</i> (ετι) related to Christ, and could not have its complete accomplishment but in <i>his</i> crucifixion <i>as a criminal</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>For the things concerning me have an end.</b></i> — As if he had said, My work is now almost done; yours is only beginning; I am now about to be crucified and numbered with the transgressors; think what will be done to you, and what ought to be done by you; and then think if this be a time for you to be contending with each other. <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
