<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto</b></i><b> </b><i><b>them, It is enough.</b></i> — These words cannot be well understood as being an answer to the supposed command of Christ, <i>for every one</i> <i>who had no sword to go and sell his garment and buy one</i>; for, in this case, they were not <i>enough</i>, or <i>sufficient</i>, as <i>nine</i> of the disciples must be without any instrument of defence; but they may be understood as pointing out the readiness and determination of <i>Peter</i>, and perhaps some others, to defend our Lord: <i>Thou shalt</i> <i>not be treated as a transgressor; here are two swords, and we will</i> <i>fight for thee</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:33">Luke 22:33</span>, Peter had said, he <i>was ready to go with Christ either to prison or death</i>; which showed his strong resolution to stand by and defend his Master, even at the expense of his life. But, alas, he depended too much on <i>himself</i>!</p>
<p><i>It is enough</i>. The meaning probably is, there is enough said on the subject; as immediately after this he entered into his agony.</p>
<p>I must here confess that the matter about the <i>swords</i> appear to me very obscure. I am afraid I do not understand it, and I know of none who does. <i>Schoettgen</i> and <i>Lightfoot</i> have said much on the subject; others have endeavoured to get rid of the difficulty by translating μαχαιραν a <i>knife</i>, which was necessary on long journeys for providing forage and fuel; as they were to depend wholly on their own industry, under God, for all the necessaries of life, while going through the nations of the earth, preaching the Gospel to Jews and Gentiles. I cannot say which sense the reader should prefer.</p>
