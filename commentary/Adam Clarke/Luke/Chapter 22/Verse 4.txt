<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:4">Luke 22:4</span>. <i><b>And captains</b></i> — Among the priests who were in waiting at the temple, some were appointed φυλακες, for a <i>guard</i> to the temple; and over these were στρατηγοι <i>commanding officers</i>: both sorts are mentioned by Josephus, War, b. vi. c. 5. s. 3. Bp. PEARCE, See another sense of <i>captains</i>, in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:65">Matthew 27:65</span><i>"</i>. Dr. Lightfoot supposes these to have been the captains over the <i>watches</i>; for in three places the priests kept watch and ward in the temple, viz. in <i>Beth Abtenes</i>, in <i>Beth Nitsots</i>, and in <i>Beth</i> <i>Mokad</i>. The Levites also in twenty-one places more, <i>Middoth</i>, chap. i. Though these <i>watches</i> consisted of several persons in each, there was one set over them, as the captain or head of that watch. He thinks that Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:65">Matthew 27:65</span>, refers to one of these: <i>Ye have a watch</i> of your own; let some of them be sent to guard the sepulchre. The <i>captain of the temple</i>, he supposes to have been the chief or head of all these watches; and thus he was captain of the captains. In the same Talmudical tract it is said, The <i>ruler</i> <i>of the mountain of the temple</i> (i.e. <i>captain of the temple</i>) takes his walks through every watch with torches lighted before him: if he found any upon the watch, that was not standing on his feet, he said, <i>Peace be with thee</i>: but if he found him sleeping, he struck him with a stick, and he might also burn his clothes. And when it was said by others, What noise is that in the court? the answer was, It is the noise of a Levite under correction, whose garments they are burning, because he slept upon his watch. This custom casts light on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>: Behold, I come as a thief: blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. It is easy to distinguish this <i>captain of the</i> <i>mountain of the temple</i> from the <i>ruler of the temple, or sagan</i>: the former presided over the guards; the latter over the whole service of the temple. We have them both distinguished, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:1">Acts 4:1</span>: there is the <i>captain of the temple</i>; and <i>Annas</i>, who was the <i>sagan</i>. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
