<p>Verse 43. <i><b>There appeared an angel - from heaven</b></i> â€” It was as necessary that the fullest evidence should be given, not only of our Lord's <i>Divinity</i>, but also of his <i>humanity</i>: his miracles sufficiently attested the former; his hunger, weariness, and agony in the garden, as well as his death and burial, were proofs of the latter. As <i>man</i>, he needs the assistance of an angel to support his body, worn down by fatigue and suffering. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:44">Luke 22:44</span>.</p>
