<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Prayed more earnestly</b></i> — With greater <i>emphasis</i> and <i>earnestness</i> than usual, with strong crying and tears, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>; the reason given for which is, that he was in an <i>agony</i>. <i>Kypke</i> well observes, <i>Vox</i> αγωνια <i>summum animi</i> angorem <i>et</i> dolorem <i>indicat; et idem est, quod</i> αδημονειν, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:37">Matthew 26:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:34">Mark 14:34</span>. "The word αγωνια (agony) points out the utmost <i>anguish</i> and <i>grief</i> of soul, and is of the same import with αδημονειν in Matthew and Mark." <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:37">Matthew 26:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:37">Matthew 26:37</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Drops of blood</b></i> — <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:38">Matthew 26:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:38">Matthew 26:38</span></span>. Some have thought that the meaning of the words is, that the sweat was so profuse that every drop <i>was as large as a drop of blood</i>, not that the <i>sweat</i> was <i>blood</i> itself: but this does not appear likely. There have been cases in which persons in a debilitated state of body, or through horror of soul, have had their sweat tinged with blood. Dr. Mead from Galen observes, <i>Contingere interdum, poros ex multo</i> <i>aut fervido spiritu adeo dilatari, ut etiam exeat sanguis per eos,</i> <i>fiatque sudor sanguineus</i>. "Cases sometimes happen in which, through <i>mental pressure</i>, the pores may be so dilated that the blood may issue from them; so that there may be a bloody sweat." And Bishop PEARCE gives an instance from <i>Thuanus</i> (De Thou) of an Italian gentleman being so distressed with the fear of death that his body was covered with a bloody sweat. But it is fully evident that the <i>fear of death</i> could have no place in the mind of our blessed Lord. He was in the bloom of life, in perfect health, and had never suffered any thing from disease of any kind; this sweat was most assuredly produced by a preternatural cause.
