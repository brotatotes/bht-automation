<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</b></i> â€” Dost thou attempt to kiss me as a <i>friend</i>, while thou art delivering me up into the hands of my <i>enemies</i>? We need not wonder at all this, as Satan himself had entered into the heart of this traitor, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3">Luke 22:3</span>; consequently we can expect nothing from him but what is <i>fell, deceitful</i>, and <i>cruel</i>.</p>
