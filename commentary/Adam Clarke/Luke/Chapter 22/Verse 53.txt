<p>Verse 53. <i><b>I was daily with you in the temple</b></i> — Alluding to the <i>four</i> preceding days, during the whole of which he taught in the temple, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:37">Luke 21:37</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:17">Matthew 21:17</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>This is your hour, and the power of darkness.</b></i> — That is, the <i>time</i> in which you are permitted to <i>unrein</i> your malice; which ye could not do before, because God did not permit you; and so perfectly are ye under his <i>control</i> that neither you nor the <i>prince of</i> <i>darkness</i> can proceed a hair's breadth against me but through this permission: see at the end of the chapter. What a comfortable thought is it to the followers of Christ, that neither men nor demons can act against them but by the <i>permission</i> of their heavenly Father, and that he will not suffer any of those <i>who</i> <i>trust in him</i> to be tried above what they are able to bear, and will make the trial issue in their greater salvation, and in his glory!</p>
