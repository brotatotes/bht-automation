<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:10">Luke 23:10</span>. <i><b>The chief priests - vehemently accused him.</b></i> â€” Corrupt priests and teachers are generally the most implacable enemies of Christ and his truth. Evil passions betray those who are slaves to them. An affected moderation would have rendered these accusers less suspected, their accusations more probable, and the envy less visible than this <i>vehemence</i>: but <i>envy</i> seldom or never consults <i>prudence</i>: and God permits this to be so for the honour of truth and innocence. <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
