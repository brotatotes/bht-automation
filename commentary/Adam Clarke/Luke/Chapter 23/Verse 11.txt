<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:11">Luke 23:11</span>. <i><b>A gorgeous robe</b></i> — εσθητα λαμπραν. It probably means <i>a</i> <i>white robe</i>, for it was the custom of the Jewish nobility to wear such. Hence, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:4">Revelation 3:4</span>, it is said of the saints, <i>They shall walk with me in WHITE</i> (garments,) <i>because they are</i> <i>WORTHY</i>. In such a robe, Herod, by way of mockery, caused our Lord to be clothed; but, the nobility among the Romans wearing <i>purple</i> for the most part, Pilate's soldiers, who were Romans, put on Jesus a <i>purple robe</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:2">John 19:2</span>; both of them following the custom of their own country, when, by way of mocking our Lord as a king, they clothed him in robes of state.
