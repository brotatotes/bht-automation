<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:15">Luke 23:15</span>. <i><b>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him</b></i> — That is, to see whether he could find that Christ had ever attempted to raise any disaffection or sedition among the Galileans, among whom he had spent the principal part of his life; and yet Herod has not been able to find out any evil in his conduct. Your own accusations I have fully weighed, and find them to the last degree frivolous.</p>
<p>Instead of ανεπεμψα γαρ ὑμας προς αυτον, <i>for I sent you to him</i>, BHKLM, and many other MSS., with some versions, read ανεπεμψεν γαρ αυτον προς ἡμας, <i>for he hath sent him to us</i>. As if he had said, Herod hath sent him back to us, which is a sure proof that he hath found no blame in him."</p>
<p><i><b>Nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</b></i> — Or rather, <i>nothing</i> <i>worthy of death is committed by him</i>, Πεπραγμενον αυτῳ, not, <i>done</i> <i>unto him</i>. This phrase is of the same sense with ουδεν πεπραχεν αυτος, <i>he hath done nothing</i>, and is frequent in the purest Attic writers. See many examples in <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
