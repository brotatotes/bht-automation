Verse Luke 23:2. Perverting the nation — The Greek word διαστρεφοντα, signifies stirring up to disaffection and rebellion. Many MSS. and versions add ημων, OUR nation. They intimated that he not only preached corrupt doctrine, but that he endeavoured to make them disaffected towards the Roman government, for which they now pretended to feel a strong affection!Several copies of the Itala add, Destroying our law and prophets. Et solventem legem nostram et prophetas.Forbidding to give tribute to Caesar — These were the falsest slanders that could be invented. The whole of our Lord's conduct disproved them. And his decision in the case of the question about the lawfulness of paying tribute to Caesar, Matthew 22:21, was so fully known that we find Pilate paid not the least attention to such evidently malicious and unfounded accusations. Neither Christ nor any of his followers, from that day until now, ever forbade the paying tribute to Caesar; that is, constitutional taxes to a lawful prince.
