<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:22">Luke 23:22</span>. <i><b>I have found no cause of death in him</b></i> â€” <i>I find no crime</i> worthy <i>of death in him</i>. There is nothing proved against him that can at all justify me in putting him to death, So here our blessed Lord was in the most <i>formal manner</i> justified by his judge. Now as this decision was publicly known, and perhaps registered, it is evident that Christ died as an <i>innocent</i> person, and not as a <i>malefactor</i>. On the fullest conviction of his innocence, his judge pronounced him guiltless, after having patiently heard every thing that the inventive malice of these wicked men could allege against him; and, when he wished to dismiss him, a violent mob took and murdered him.</p>
