<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Weep not for me</b></i> â€” Many pious persons have been greatly distressed in their minds, because they could not weep on reading or hearing of the <i>sufferings of Christ</i>. For the relief of all such, let it be for ever known that no human spirit can possibly take any part in the passion of the Messiah. His sufferings were such as only God manifested in the flesh could bear; and, as they were all of an <i>expiatory</i> nature, no man can taste of or share in them. Besides, the sufferings of Christ are not a subject of <i>sorrow</i> to any man; but, on the contrary, of eternal rejoicing to the whole of a lost world. Some have even prayed to participate in the sufferings of Christ. The legend of St. Francis and his stigmata is well known. - He is fabled to have received the <i>marks</i> in his <i>hands, feet</i>, and <i>side</i>.</p>
<p>Relative to this point, there are many unwarrantable expressions used by religious people in their <i>prayers</i> and <i>hymns</i>. To give only one instance, how often do we hear these or similar words said or sung: -</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Give me to feel thy agonies!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> One drop of thy sad cup afford!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>Reader! <i>one drop</i> of this cup would bear down thy soul to endless ruin; and these agonies would annihilate the universe. He suffered <i>alone</i>: for of the people there was none with him; because his sufferings were to make an atonement for the sins of the world: and in the work of redemption he had no helper.</p>
