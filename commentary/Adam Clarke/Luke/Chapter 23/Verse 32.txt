<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Two other malefactors</b></i> — Ἑτεροι δυο κακουργοι, should certainly be translated <i>two others, malefactors</i>, as in the Bibles published by the King's printer, Edinburgh. As it now stands in the text, it seems to intimate that our blessed Lord was also a <i>malefactor</i>.</p>
