<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Offering him vinegar</b></i> â€” <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span></span>. Vinegar or small sour wine, was a common drink of the Roman soldiers; and it is supposed that wherever they were on duty they had a vessel of this liquor standing by. It appears that at least <i>two</i> cups were given to our Lord; one before he was nailed to the cross, viz. of wine mingled with myrrh, and another of vinegar, while he hung on the cross. Some think there were three cups: ONE of <i>wine mixed</i> <i>with myrrh</i>; the SECOND, of <i>vinegar mingled with gall</i>; and the THIRD, of <i>simple vinegar</i>. Allow these <i>three cups</i>, and the different expressions in all the evangelists will be included. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
