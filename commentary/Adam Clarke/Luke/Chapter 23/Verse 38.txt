<p><i><b>ln letters of Greek, and Latin and Hebrew</b></i> — The inscription was written in all these languages, which were the most common, that all might see the reason why he was put to death. The inscription was written in <i>Greek</i>, on account of the <i>Hellenistic</i> Jews, who were then at Jerusalem because of the passover; it was written in <i>Latin</i>, that being the language of the <i>government</i> under which he was crucified; and it was written in <i>Hebrew</i>, that being the language of the <i>place</i> in which this deed of darkness was committed. But, by the good providence of God, the inscription itself exculpated him, and proved the Jews to be rebels against, and murderers of, their king. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:37">Matthew 27:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:37">Matthew 27:37</span></span>.
