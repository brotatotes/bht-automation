<p>Verse 39. <i><b>One of the malefactors which were hanged.</b></i> â€” It is likely that the two robbers were not <i>nailed</i> to their crosses, but only <i>tied</i> to them by cords, and thus they are represented in ancient paintings. If not nailed, they could not have suffered much, and therefore they were found still alive when the soldiers came to give the <i>coup de grace</i>, which put a speedy end to their lives. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31-33">John 19:31-33</span>.</p>
