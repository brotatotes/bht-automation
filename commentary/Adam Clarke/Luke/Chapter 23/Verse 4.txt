Verse Luke 23:4. I find no fault in this man. â€” According to John 18:36; John 18:38, Pilate did not say this till after our Lord had declared to him that his kingdom was not of this world; and probably not till after he had found, on examining witnesses, (Luke 23:14,) that all their evidence amounted to no proof, of his having set up himself for a temporal king. See Bishop PEARCE.
