<p>Verse 40. <i><b>Dost not thou fear God</b></i> — The sufferings of this person had been sanctified to him, so that his heart was open to receive help from the hand of the Lord: he is a genuine penitent, and gives the fullest proof he can give of it, viz. the acknowledgment of the justice of his sentence. He had sinned, and he acknowledges his sin; his heart believes unto righteousness, and with his tongue he makes confession unto salvation. While he <i>condemns</i> himself he bears testimony that Jesus was <i>innocent</i>. Bishop PEARCE supposes that these were not robbers in the common sense of the word, but Jews who took up arms on the principle that the Romans were not to be submitted to, and that their levies of tribute money were oppressive; and therefore they made no scruple to rob all the Romans they met with. These Jews <i>Josephus</i> calls λησται, <i>robbers</i>, the same term used by the evangelists. This opinion gains some strength from the penitent thief's confession: <i>We</i> <i>receive the reward of our deeds </i>- we rose up against the government, and committed depredations in the country; <i>but this man hath done</i> <i>nothing amiss </i>- ατοπον, <i>out of place, disorderly</i>, - nothing calculated to raise <i>sedition</i> or <i>insurrection</i>; nor inconsistent with his declarations of peace and good will towards all men, nor with the nature of that spiritual kingdom which he came to establish among men; though he is now crucified under the pretence of disaffection to the Roman government.</p>
