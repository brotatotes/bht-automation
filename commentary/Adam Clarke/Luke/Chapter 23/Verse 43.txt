<p>Verse 43. <i><b>To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</b></i> — <i>Marcion</i> and the <i>Manichees</i> are reported to have left this verse out of their copies of this evangelist. This saying of our Lord is justly considered as a strong proof of the immateriality of the soul; and it is no wonder that those who have embraced the contrary opinion should endeavor to explain away this meaning. In order to do this, a <i>comma</i> is placed after σημερον, <i>to-day</i>, and then our Lord is supposed to have meant, "Thou shalt be with me after the resurrection I tell thee this, TO-DAY." I am sorry to find men-of great learning and abilities attempting to support this most feeble and worthless criticism. Such support a <i>good</i> cause cannot need; and, in my opinion, even a <i>bad cause</i> must be discredited by it.</p>
<p><i><b>In paradise</b></i>. The <i>garden of Eden</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:8">Genesis 2:8</span>, is also called, from the Septuagint, the <i>garden of Paradise</i>. The word <i>Eden</i>, signifies <i>pleasure</i> and <i>delight</i>. Several places were thus called; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:16">Genesis 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+19:12">2 Kings 19:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+37:12">Isaiah 37:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+27:23">Ezekiel 27:23</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+1:5">Amos 1:5</span>; and such places probably had this name from their <i>fertility, pleasant situation</i>, c., c. In this light the Septuagint have viewed <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:8">Genesis 2:8</span>. as they render the passage thus: εφυτευσεν ὁ Θεος παραδεισον εν Εδεμ, <i>God planted a paradise in</i> <i>Eden</i>. Hence the word has been transplanted into the New Testament and is used to signify a place of exquisite pleasure and delight. From this the ancient heathens borrowed their ideas of the gardens of the Hesperides, where the trees bore golden fruit and the gardens of <i>Adonis</i>, a word which is evidently derived from the Hebrew עדן <i>Eden</i>: and hence the origin of sacred groves, gardens, and other enclosures dedicated to purposes of devotion, some comparatively innocent, others impure. The word paradise is not Greek, but is of Asiatic origin. In Arabic and Persian it signifies a <i>garden</i>, a <i>vineyard</i>, and also the <i>place of the blessed.</i> In the Kushuf ul Loghat, a very celebrated Persian dictionary, the [Arabic] <i>Jenet al Ferdoos</i>, Garden of Paradise, is said to have been "created by God out of <i>light</i>, and that the prophets and wise men ascend thither."</p>
<p>Paradise was, in the beginning, the habitation of man in his state of innocence, in which he enjoyed that <i>presence</i> of his Maker which constituted his supreme happiness. Our Lord's words intimate that this penitent should be immediately taken to the abode of the spirits of the <i>just</i>, where he should enjoy the presence and approbation of the Most High. In the Institutes of Menu, chap. OEconomics, Inst. 243, are the following words: "A man habitually pious, whose offences have been expiated, is instantly conveyed, after death, to the higher world, with a radiant form, and a body of ethereal substance." The <i>state of the blessed</i> is certainly what our Lord here means: in what the <i>locality</i> of that state consists we know not. The Jews share a multitude of fables on the subject.</p>
