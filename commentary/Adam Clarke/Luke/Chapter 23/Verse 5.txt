<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:5">Luke 23:5</span>. <i><b>Saying, He stirreth up the people</b></i>, c.] In the <i>Codex</i> <i>Colbertinus</i>, a copy of the ancient <i>Itala</i> or <i>Antehieronymian</i> version, this verse stands thus: <i>He stirreth up the people,</i> <i>beginning from Galilee, and teaching through all Judea unto this</i> <i>place our wives and our children he hath rendered averse from us,</i> <i>and he is not baptized as we are</i>. As the Jews found that their charge of sedition was deemed frivolous by Pilate, they changed it, and brought a charge equally false and groundless against his doctrine.</p>
