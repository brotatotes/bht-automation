To <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:52">Luke 23:52</span>, another adds: <i>And when Pilate heard that he was dead, he glorified God and</i> <i>gave the body to Joseph</i>. On the circumstances of the crucifixion, see the observations at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:0">Matthew 27:0</span>, and consider how heinous sin must be in the sight of God, when it required such a sacrifice! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:0- :">Matthew 27:0- :</span></p>
