<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:7">Luke 23:7</span>. <i><b>Herod's jurisdiction</b></i> â€” The city of <i>Nazareth</i>, in which Christ had continued till he was thirty years of age, and that of <i>Capernaum</i>, in which he principally resided the last years of his life, were both in <i>Lower Galilee</i>, of which <i>Herod Antipas</i> was tetrarch. Pilate was probably glad of this opportunity to pay a little respect to Herod, whom it is likely he had irritated, and with whom he now wished to be friends.
