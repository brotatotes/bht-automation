<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>. <i><b>Bringing the spices</b></i> — To embalm the body of our Lord: but Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea had done this before the body was laid in the tomb. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39-40">John 19:39-40</span>. But there was a second embalming found necessary: the first must have been hastily and imperfectly performed; the spices now brought by the women were intended to complete the preceding operation.</p>
<p><i><b>And certain others with them.</b></i> — This clause is wanting in BCL, two others; <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Vulgate</i>, and in all the <i>Itala</i> except two. <i>Dionysius Alexandrinus</i>, and <i>Eusebius</i> also omit it. The omission is approved by Mill, Bengel, Wetstein, Griesbach, and others. Bishop Pearce thinks it should be left out for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. "They who came to the sepulchre, as is here said, being the same with those who, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:55">Luke 23:55</span>, are called <i>the women which came with him from Galilee</i>, there was no room for Luke (I think) to add as here, <i>and some others</i> came <i>with them</i>; because the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:55">Luke 23:55</span>, to which these refer, include all that can be supposed to be designed by the words in question.</p>
<p>2. Luke has named no particular woman here, and therefore he could not add <i>and some others</i>, &amp;c., these words necessarily requiring that the names of the women should have preceded, as is the case in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:10">Luke 24:10</span>, where, when Mary Magdalene, the other Mary, and Joanna, had been named, it is very rightly added, <i>and other women</i> <i>that were with them</i>."</p>
