Verse Luke 24:1. Bringing the spices — To embalm the body of our Lord: but Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea had done this before the body was laid in the tomb. See John 19:39-40. But there was a second embalming found necessary: the first must have been hastily and imperfectly performed; the spices now brought by the women were intended to complete the preceding operation.And certain others with them. — This clause is wanting in BCL, two others; Coptic, AEthiopic, Vulgate, and in all the Itala except two. Dionysius Alexandrinus, and Eusebius also omit it. The omission is approved by Mill, Bengel, Wetstein, Griesbach, and others. Bishop Pearce thinks it should be left out for the following reasons:1. "They who came to the sepulchre, as is here said, being the same with those who, in Luke 23:55, are called the women which came with him from Galilee, there was no room for Luke (I think) to add as here, and some others came with them; because the words in Luke 23:55, to which these refer, include all that can be supposed to be designed by the words in question.2. Luke has named no particular woman here, and therefore he could not add and some others, &c., these words necessarily requiring that the names of the women should have preceded, as is the case in Luke 24:10, where, when Mary Magdalene, the other Mary, and Joanna, had been named, it is very rightly added, and other women that were with them."
