<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span>. <i><b>Then arose Peter</b></i> — John went with him, and got to the tomb before him. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2-3">John 20:2-3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The linen clothes laid by themselves</b></i> — Or, <i>The linen clothes</i> <i>only</i>. This was the fine linen which Joseph of Arimathea bought, and wrapped the body in: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:46">Mark 15:46</span>. Small as this circumstance may at first view appear, it is, nevertheless, no mean proof of the resurrection of our Lord. Had the body been stolen away, all that was wrapped about it would have been taken away with it; as the <i>delay</i> which must have been occasioned by stripping it might have led to the detection of the theft; nor would the disciples have run such a risk if they had stolen him, when stripping the body could have answered no end. This circumstance is related still more particularly by John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:5-7">John 20:5-7</span>. <i>Peter seeth the linen clothes lie, and the napkin that was about</i> <i>his head not lying with the linen clothes, but WRAPPED together in</i> <i>a place by itself</i>. All these circumstances prove that the thing was done leisurely; order and regularity being observed through the whole. Hurry and confusion necessarily mark every act of robbery.</p>
