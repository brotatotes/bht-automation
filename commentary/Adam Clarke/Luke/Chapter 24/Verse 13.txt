<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13">Luke 24:13</span>. <i><b>Behold, two of them</b></i> — This long and interesting account is not mentioned by Matthew nor John, and is only glanced at by Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:12-13">Mark 16:12-13</span>. One of these disciples was <i>Cleopas</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:18">Luke 24:18</span>, and the other is supposed by many learned men, both ancient and modern, to have been <i>Luke</i> himself. See the sketch of his life prefixed to these notes. Some of the ancient versions have called the other disciple <i>Ammaus</i> and <i>Ammaon</i>, reading the verse thus: <i>Behold two of them, Ammaus and Cleopas, were going</i> <i>in that very day to a village about sixty furlongs distant from</i> <i>Jerusalem</i>. But the Persian says positively that it was <i>Luke</i> who accompanied Cleopas. See the inscription to section 140 of this Gospel in the Polyglott. Dr. Lightfoot thinks it was <i>Peter</i>, and proves that Cleopas and Alpheus were one and the same person.</p>
<p><i><b>Threescore furlongs.</b></i> — Some MSS. say 160 furlongs, but this is a mistake; for Josephus assigns the same distance to this village from Jerusalem as the evangelist does. War, b. vii. c. 6. s. 6. Αμμαους απεχει των Ἱεροσολυμων σταδιους ἑξηκοντα, <i>Ammaus is</i> <i>sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem</i>, about <i>seven</i> English miles and three-quarters. A <i>stadium</i> was about 243 yards, according to <i>Arbuthnot</i>.</p>
