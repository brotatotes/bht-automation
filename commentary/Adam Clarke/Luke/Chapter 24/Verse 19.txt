<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:19">Luke 24:19</span>. <i><b>Which was a prophet</b></i> — ανηρ προφητης, <i>a man prophet</i>, a genuine prophet; but this has been considered as a Hebraism: "for, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:14">Exodus 2:14</span>, a <i>man prince</i> is simply <i>a prince</i>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+31:3">1 Samuel 31:3</span>, <i>men archers</i> mean no more than <i>archers</i>." But my own opinion is, that this word is often used to <i>deepen</i> the signification, so in the above quotations: <i>Who made thee a man prince</i> (i.e. a mighty sovereign) <i>and a judge over us</i>! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:14">Exodus 2:14</span>. And, <i>the battle went sore against Saul, and the men archers</i> (i.e. the stout, or well aiming archers) <i>hit him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+31:3">1 Samuel 31:3</span>. So in PALAEPHATUS, de <i>Incredib</i>. c. 38. p. 47, quoted by <i>Kypke</i>, ην ανηρ βασιλευς μεγας, <i>He was a great and eminent king</i>. So ανηρ προφητης here signifies, he was a GENUINE <i>prophet</i>, nothing like those <i>false</i> ones by whom the people have been so often deceived; and he has proved the divinity of his mission by his heavenly teaching, and astonishing miracles.</p>
<p><i><b>Mighty in - word</b></i> — Irresistibly eloquent. <i>Powerful in deed</i>, working incontrovertible miracles. See <i>Kypke</i> in loco.</p>
