<p>Verse 25. <i><b>O fools and slow of heart to believe</b></i> â€” <i>Inconsiderate</i> men, justly termed such, because they had not properly <i>attended</i> to the description given of the Messiah by the prophets, nor to <i>his</i> teaching and miracles, as proofs that HE <i>alone</i> was the person they described.</p>
<p><i>Slow of heart - Backward</i>, not easy to be persuaded of the truth, always giving way to doubtfulness and distrust. This very imperfection in them is a strong evidence of the <i>truth</i> of the doctrine which they afterwards believed, and proclaimed to the world. Had they not had the <i>fullest assurance</i> of these things, they never would have credited them; and it is no small honour to the new-covenant Scriptures that such persons were chosen, first, to believe them; secondly, to proclaim them in the world; and, thirdly, to die on the evidence of those truths, the blessed influence of which they felt in their own hearts, and fully exemplified in their lives.</p>
