<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Ought not Christ to have suffered</b></i> — Ουχι εδει παθειν τον Χριστον, <i>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer</i>. This was the way in which sin must be expiated, and, without this, no soul could have been saved. The <i>suffering Messiah</i> is he alone by whom Israel and the world can be saved.</p>
