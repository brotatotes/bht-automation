<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Beginning at Moses</b></i>, c.] What a sermon this must have been, where all the prophecies relative to the <i>incarnation, birth,</i> <i>teaching, miracles, sufferings, death</i>, and <i>resurrection</i> of the blessed Jesus were all adduced, illustrated, and applied to himself, by an appeal to the well known facts which had taken place during his life! We are almost irresistibly impelled to exclaim, What a pity this discourse had not been preserved! No wonder their hearts burned within them, while hearing such a <i>sermon</i>, from such a <i>preacher</i>. The law and the prophets had all borne testimony, either directly or indirectly, to Christ and we may naturally suppose that these prophecies and references were those which our Lord at this time explained and applied to himself.
