<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:3">Luke 24:3</span>. <i><b>And found not the body of the Lord</b></i> â€” His holy <i>soul</i> was in <i>Paradise</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:43">Luke 23:43</span>; and the evangelist mentions the <i>body</i> particularly, to show that <i>this</i> only was subject to <i>death</i>. It is, I think, evident enough, from these and other words of Luke, that the doctrine of the <i>materiality</i> of the soul, made no part of his creed.</p>
