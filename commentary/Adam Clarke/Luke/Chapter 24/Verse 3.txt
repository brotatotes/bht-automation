Verse Luke 24:3. And found not the body of the Lord â€” His holy soul was in Paradise, Luke 23:43; and the evangelist mentions the body particularly, to show that this only was subject to death. It is, I think, evident enough, from these and other words of Luke, that the doctrine of the materiality of the soul, made no part of his creed.
