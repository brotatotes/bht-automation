<p>Verse 30. <i><b>He took bread</b></i> â€” This was the office of the master and father of a family, and this was our Lord's usual custom among his disciples. Those whom Christ <i>lodges</i> with he <i>feeds</i>, and feeds too with <i>bread</i> that himself hath <i>blessed</i>, and this feeding not only <i>strengthens</i>, but also <i>enlightens</i> the soul.</p>
