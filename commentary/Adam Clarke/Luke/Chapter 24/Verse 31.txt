<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Their eyes were opened</b></i> — But we are not to imagine that he administered the holy eucharist at this time; there is not the most distant evidence of this. It was a mere <i>family meal</i>, and ended before it was well begun.</p>
<p><i><b>They knew him</b></i> — His acting as father of the family, in <i>taking,</i> <i>blessing</i>, and <i>distributing</i> the <i>bread</i> among them, caused them to <i>recollect</i> those <i>lips</i> which they had often heard <i>speak</i>, and those <i>hands</i> by which they had often been fed. Perhaps he also threw off the disguise which he had before assumed; and now appeared in his own person.</p>
<p><i><b>He vanished out of their sight.</b></i> — Probably, during their surprise, he took the opportunity of withdrawing from the place; leaving them to reflect and meditate on what they had heard and seen.</p>
