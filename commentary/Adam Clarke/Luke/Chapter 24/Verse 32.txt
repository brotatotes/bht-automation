<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Did not our heart burn within us</b></i> — His word was in our heart as a burning fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+20:9">Jeremiah 20:9</span>. Our hearts waxed hot within us, and while we were musing the fire burned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:3">Psalms 39:3</span>. In some such way as this the words of the disciples may be understood: but there is a very remarkable reading here in the Codex Bezae; instead of καιομενη, <i>burned</i>, it has κεκαλυμμενη, <i>veiled</i>; and one of the <i>Itala</i> has, fuit excaecatum, <i>was blinded</i>. <i>Was not our</i> <i>heart veiled (blinded) when he conversed with us on the way, and</i> <i>while he unfolded the Scriptures to us</i>, seeing we did not know him?</p>
