<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Saying, The Lord</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>risen indeed</b></i> — The meaning here is, that these two disciples found the apostles, and those who were with them, unanimously testifying that Christ had risen from the dead. It is not the two disciples to whom we are to refer the word λεγοντας, <i>saying</i>; but to the body of the disciples.
