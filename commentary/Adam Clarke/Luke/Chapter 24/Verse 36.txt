Now, while they and the apostles are confirming each other in their belief of his resurrection, Jesus comes in, to remove every doubt, and to give them the fullest evidence of it. And it is ever true that, wherever two or three are gathered together in his name, he is in the midst of them.</p>
<p><i><b>Peace</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>unto you.</b></i> — The usual salutation among the Jews. <i>May you</i> <i>prosper in body and soul, and enjoy every heavenly and earthly</i> <i>good</i>!
