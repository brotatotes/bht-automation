Verse 37. And supposed that they had seen a spirit. â€” But if there be no such thing as a disembodied spirit, would not our Lord have shown them their error? Instead of this, he confirms them in their opinion, by saying, A spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me have, Luke 24:39; therefore he says, handle me and see me. They probably imagined that it was the soul only of our blessed Lord which they saw; but they were soon fully convinced of the identity of his person, and the reality of his resurrection; for,1. They saw his body.2. They heard him speak.3. They handled him.4. They saw him eat a piece of broiled fish and honeycomb, which they gave him.In these things it was impossible for them to have been deceived.
