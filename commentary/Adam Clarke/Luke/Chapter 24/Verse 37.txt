<p>Verse 37. <i><b>And supposed that they had seen a spirit.</b></i> â€” But if there be no such thing as a <i>disembodied spirit</i>, would not our Lord have shown them their error? Instead of this, he confirms them in their opinion, by saying, <i>A spirit hath not flesh and bones as you</i> <i>see me have</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:39">Luke 24:39</span>; therefore he says, <i>handle me and see me</i>. They probably imagined that it was the <i>soul</i> only of our blessed Lord which they saw; but they were soon fully convinced of the identity of his person, and the reality of his resurrection; for,</p>
<p>1. They <i>saw</i> his body.</p>
<p>2. They <i>heard</i> him speak.</p>
<p>3. They <i>handled</i> him.</p>
<p>4. They saw him <i>eat</i> a piece of broiled fish and honeycomb, which they gave him.</p>
<p>In these things it was impossible for them to have been deceived.</p>
