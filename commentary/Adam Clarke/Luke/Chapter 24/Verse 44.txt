<p>Verse 44. <i><b>The law - the prophets - the psalms</b></i> — This was the Jewish division of the whole old covenant. The LAW contained the <i>five</i> books of Moses; the PROPHETS, the Jews divided into <i>former</i> and <i>latter</i>; they were, according to Josephus, <i>thirteen</i>. "The PSALMS included not only the book still so named, but also three other books, Proverbs, Job, and Canticles. These all," says the above author, "contain hymns to God, and rules for the conduct of the lives of men." Joseph. Cont. App. i. 8. This account is imperfect: the common Jewish division of the writings of the old covenant is the following, and indeed seems to be the same to which our Lord alludes: -</p>
<p>I. The LAW, תורה <i>thorah</i>, including <i>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,</i> <i>Numbers</i>, and <i>Deuteronomy</i>.</p>
<p>II. The PROPHETS, נביאים, <i>nabiaim</i>, or <i>teachers</i>, including <i>Joshua, Judges</i>, the two books of <i>Samuel</i>, and the two books of <i>Kings</i>: these were termed the <i>former prophets</i>. <i>Isaiah, Jeremiah,</i> <i>Ezekiel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum,</i> <i>Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah</i>, and <i>Malachi</i>: these were termed the <i>latter prophets</i>.</p>
<p>III. The HAGIOGRAPHA, (<i>holy writings</i>), כתובים kethuvim, which comprehended the <i>Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Canticles, Ruth, </i> <i>Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah</i>, and the two books of <i>Chronicles</i>. The Jews made anciently only twenty-two books of the whole, to bring them to the number of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet; and this they did by joining <i>Ruth</i> to <i>Judges</i>, making the two books of <i>Samuel</i> only <i>one</i>; and so of <i>Kings</i> and <i>Chronicles</i>; joining the <i>Lamentations</i> to <i>Jeremiah</i>, and making the <i>twelve minor prophets</i> only <i>one</i> book.</p>
