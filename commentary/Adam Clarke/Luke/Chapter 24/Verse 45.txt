<p>Verse 45. <i><b>Then opened he their understanding</b></i> — διηνοιξεν, <i>He</i> <i>fully opened</i>. They had a <i>measure</i> of <i>light</i> before, so that they discerned the Scriptures to be the <i>true word</i> of God, and to speak of the Messiah; but they had not light <i>sufficient</i> to enable them to <i>apply</i> these Scriptures to their Lord and Master; but now, by the influence of Christ, they see, not only, the <i>prophecies</i> which pointed out the <i>Messiah</i>, but also the <i>Messiah</i> who was pointed out by these <i>prophecies</i>. The book of God may be received in general as a Divine revelation, but the proper <i>meaning, reference</i>, and <i>application</i> of the Scriptures can only be discerned by the light of Christ. Even the <i>very plain word of God</i> is a dead letter to those who are not enlightened by the grace of Christ; and why? because this word speaks of <i>spiritual</i> and <i>heavenly</i> things; and the carnal mind of man cannot discern them. They who receive not this inward teaching continue <i>dark</i> and <i>dead</i> while they live.</p>
