<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Ye are witnesses of these things.</b></i> â€” He gave them a full commission to proclaim these glad tidings of peace and salvation to a lost world. The disciples were <i>witnesses</i> not only that Christ had <i>suffered</i> and <i>rose again</i> from the dead; but also that he <i>opens</i> the <i>understanding</i> by the inspiration of his Spirit, that he gives <i>repentance</i>, that he <i>pardons sin</i>, and <i>purifies</i> from <i>all</i> <i>unrighteousness</i>, and that he is not <i>willing</i> that any should perish, but that <i>all</i> should come unto the <i>knowledge</i> of the <i>truth</i> and be <i>saved</i>. And these are the things of which their successors in the Gospel ministry must bear witness. As far as a man steadily and affectionately proclaims these doctrines, so far God will bless his labour to the salvation of those who hear him. But no man can with any propriety bear witness of that grace that <i>saves</i> the <i>soul</i>, whose own soul is <i>not saved</i> by that <i>grace</i>.</p>
