See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33">Acts 2:33</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Until ye be endued with power</b></i> — The energy of the Holy Ghost was to be communicated to them for <i>three</i> particular purposes.</p>
<p>1. That he might be in them, a <i>sanctifying comforter</i>, fortifying their souls and bringing to their remembrance whatever Jesus had before spoken to them.</p>
<p>2. That their <i>preaching</i> might be accompanied by his demonstration and power to the hearts of their hearers, so that they might believe and be saved.</p>
<p>3. That they might be able to <i>work miracles</i> to confirm their pretensions to a Divine mission, and to establish the truth of the doctrines they preached.</p>
