<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:5">Luke 24:5</span>. <i><b>Why seek ye the living among the dead?</b></i> â€” This was a common form of speech among the Jews, and seems to be applied to those who were foolishly, impertinently, or absurdly employed. As places of burial were unclean, it was not reasonable to suppose that the <i>living</i> should frequent them; or that if any was missing he was likely to be found in such places.</p>
