<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:51">Luke 24:51</span>. <i><b>Carried up into heaven.</b></i> — ανεφερετο - <i>into</i> that <i>heaven</i> from which he had <i>descended</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>. This was <i>forty days</i> after his resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span>, during which time he had given the most convincing proofs of that resurrection, not only to the <i>apostles</i>, but to many others-to upwards of five hundred at one time, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>.</p>
<p>As in his <i>life</i> they had seen the <i>way</i> to the kingdom, and in his <i>death</i> the <i>price</i> of the kingdom, so in his <i>ascension</i> they had the fullest proof of the <i>immortality of the soul</i>, the <i>resurrection</i> of the <i>human body</i>, and of his continual <i>intercession</i> at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>There are some remarkable circumstances relative to this ascension mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4-12">Acts 1:4-12</span>.</p>
