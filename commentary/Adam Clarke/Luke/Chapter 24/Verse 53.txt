<p><i><b>Praising and blessing God.</b></i> — Magnifying his mercy, and speaking good of his name.

May the God of infinite love give the reader the same portion in time and in eternity, through the same glorious and ever-blessed Jesus! Amen and amen.</p>
<p>THERE are various subscriptions to this book in the MSS. and versions. The following are the principal.</p>
<p><i>Through the assistance of the Most High God, the Gospel of St.</i> <i>Luke the physician, the proclaimer of eternal life, is finished</i>. ARAB.-<i>The most holy Gospel of Luke the Evangelist is completed</i>. SYR. - <i>The end of the holy Gospel according to Luke - written in </i> <i>Greek - published in Alexandria the Great, - in Troas, - in Rome, - in the</i> <i>confines of Achaia and Baeotia, - in Bithynia, - in Macedonia, - in the</i> <i>Italic</i> (or Latin) <i>character, fifteen years after the ascension of</i> <i>Christ</i>.</p>
<p>It is likely, the word <i>Amen</i> was added by the Church, on the reading of this book; but there is no evidence that it was affixed by the evangelist. It is omitted by some of the best MSS. and versions.</p>
<p>It is evident that, at the conclusion of this Gospel, St. Luke passes very rapidly over a number of interesting circumstances related by the other evangelists, and particularly by St. John, concerning the last forty days of our Lord's sojourning on earth; but, to compensate for this, he has mentioned a variety of important particulars which the others have passed by, a list of which I think it necessary to subjoin. It seems as if the providence of God had designed that none of these evangelists should stand alone: each has his peculiar excellence, and each his own style and mode of narration. They are all witnesses to the truth in general; and each most pointedly to every great fact of the Gospel history. In each there is something <i>new</i>; and no serious reader ever finds that the perusal of any <i>one</i> supersedes the necessity of carefully consulting and reading the others. The same facts and doctrines are exhibited by all in different points of view, which renders them both impressive and interesting; and this one circumstance serves to fix the narrative more firmly in the memory. We should have had slighter impressions from the Gospel history, had we not had the narrative at <i>four</i> different hands. This variety is of great service to the Church of God, and has contributed very much to diffuse the knowledge of the facts and doctrines contained in this history. Parallel passages have been carefully studied, and the different shades of meaning accurately marked out; and the consequence has been, what the wisdom of God designed, the fuller edification of the faithful. It is not the business of a commentator to point out beauties in the composition of the sacred text. Many might be selected from the evangelists in general, and not a few from <i>Luke</i>, who not only tells a true story, but tells it well; especially when he has occasion to connect the different parts of the narration with observations of his own. But this is his least praise: from his own account we learn that he took the utmost pains to get the most accurate and circumstantial information relative to the facts he was to relate: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>. While, therefore, he thus diligently and conscientiously sought for <i>truth</i>, the unerring Spirit of God led him into <i>all truth</i>. Even he who expected the revelation of the Almighty, and to be inspired by the Holy Spirit, that he might correctly, forcibly, and successfully proclaim the truth and righteousness of his Maker, must <i>stand upon his watch, and set</i> <i>himself upon his tower, and watch to see what God would speak IN</i> <i>him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:1">Habakkuk 2:1</span>. In a similar spirit we may expect the fruits of these revelations. He who carefully and conscientiously uses the <i>means</i> may expect the accomplishment of the <i>end</i>.</p>
<p>I cannot close these observations with a more profitable word than what is contained in that truly apostolic and sublime prayer for the second <i>Sunday in Advent</i>; and may he who reads it weigh every word in the spirit of faith and devotion! "Blessed God! who hast caused all holy scriptures to be written for our learning; grant that we may in such wise <i>hear</i> them, <i>read, mark, learn</i>, and <i>inwardly digest</i> them, that, by patience and comfort of thy holy word, we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which thou hast given us in our Saviour Jesus Christ!"</p>
