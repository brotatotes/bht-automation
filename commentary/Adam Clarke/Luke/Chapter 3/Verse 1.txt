<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1">Luke 3:1</span>. <i><b>Fifteenth year</b></i> — This was the <i>fifteenth</i> of his <i>principality</i> and <i>thirteenth</i> of his monarchy: for he was <i>two</i> years joint emperor, previously to the death of Augustus.</p>
<p><i><b>Tiberius Caesar</b></i> — This emperor succeeded Augustus, in whose reign Christ was born. He began his reign August 19, A.D. 14, reigned twenty-three years, and died March 16, A.D. 37, aged seventy eight years. He was a most infamous character. During the latter part of his reign especially, he did all the mischief he possibly could; and that his tyranny might not end with his life, he chose <i>Caius</i> <i>Caligula</i> for his successor, merely on account of his bad qualities; and of whom he was accustomed to say, <i>This young prince</i> <i>will be a SERPENT to the Roman people, and a PHAETHON to the rest</i> <i>of mankind</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Herod</b></i> — This was <i>Herod Antipas</i>, the son of <i>Herod</i> the <i>Great</i> who murdered the innocents. It was the same Herod who beheaded John Baptist, and to whom our Lord was sent by Pilate. See the account of the Herod family in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Iturea and Trachonitis</b></i> — Two provinces of Syria, on the confines of Judea.</p>
<p><i><b>Abilene</b></i> — Another province of Syria, which had its name from <i>Abila</i>, its chief city.</p>
<p>These estates were left to <i>Herod Antipas</i> and his brother <i>Philip</i> by the <i>will</i> of their father, <i>Herod</i> the Great; and were confirmed to them by the decree of <i>Augustus</i>.</p>
<p>That <i>Philip</i> was tetrarch of <i>Trachonitis</i>, in the fifteenth year of Tiberius, we are assured by Josephus, who says that Philip the brother of Herod died in the twentieth year of Tiberius, after he had governed <i>Trachonitis, Batanea</i>, and <i>Gaulonitis thirty-seven</i> years. <i>Antiq</i>. b. xviii. c. 5, s. 6. And Herod continued tetrarch of Galilee till he was removed by <i>Caligula</i>, the successor of Tiberius. <i>Antiq</i>. b. xviii. c. 8, s. 2.</p>
<p>That <i>Lysanius</i> was tetrarch of <i>Abilene</i> is also evident from <i>Josephus</i>. He continued in this government till the Emperor <i>Claudius</i> took it from him, A.D. 42, and made a present of it to <i>Agrippa</i>. See <i>Antiq</i>. b. xix. c. 5, s. 1.</p>
<p><i>Tetrarch</i> signifies the <i>ruler of the fourth part of a country</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1">Matthew 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1">Matthew 14:1</span></span>.</p>
