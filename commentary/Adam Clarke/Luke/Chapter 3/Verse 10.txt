<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:10">Luke 3:10</span>. <i><b>What shall we do then?</b></i> â€” The preaching of the Baptist had been accompanied with an uncommon effusion of that Spirit which convinces of sin, righteousness, and judgment. The people who heard him now earnestly begin to inquire <i>what they must do to</i> <i>be saved</i>? They are conscious that they are exposed to the judgments of the Lord, and they wish to escape from the coming wrath.</p>
