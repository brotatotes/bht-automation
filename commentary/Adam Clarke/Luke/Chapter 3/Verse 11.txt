<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:11">Luke 3:11</span>. <i><b>He that hath two coats</b></i>, &amp;c.] He <i>first</i> teaches the great mass of the <i>people</i> their duty to each other. They were <i>uncharitable</i> and <i>oppressive</i>, and he taught them not to expect any <i>mercy</i> from the hand of God, while they acted towards others in opposition to its dictates. If men be unkind and uncharitable towards each other, how can they expect the mercy of the Lord to be extended towards themselves?</p>
