Verse Luke 3:14. The soldiers likewise demanded of him — He, thirdly, instructs those among the military. They were either Roman soldiers, or the soldiers of Herod or Philip. Use no violence to any, μηδενα διασεισητε, do not extort money or goods by force or violence from any. This is the import of the words neminein concutite, used here by the Vulgate, and points out a crime of which the Roman soldiers were notoriously guilty, their own writers being witnesses. Concussio has the above meaning in the Roman law. See RAPHELIUS in loco.Neither accuse any falsely — Or, on a frivolous pretence - μηδε συκοφαντησητε, be not sycophants, like those who are base flatterers of their masters, who to ingratiate themselves into their esteem, malign, accuse, and impeach the innocent. Bishop PEARCE observes that, when the concussio above referred to did not produce the effect they wished, they often falsely accused the persons, which is the reason why this advice is added. Luke 19:7.Be content with your wages. — οψωνιοις. The word signifies not only the money which was allotted to a Roman soldier, which was tico oboli, about three halfpence per day, but also the necessary supply of wheat, barley, &c. See Raphelius.
