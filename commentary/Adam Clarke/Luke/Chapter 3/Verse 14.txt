<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:14">Luke 3:14</span>. <i><b>The soldiers likewise demanded of him</b></i> — He, <i>thirdly</i>, instructs those among the <i>military</i>. They were either Roman soldiers, or the soldiers of Herod or Philip. Use no violence to any, μηδενα διασεισητε, do not <i>extort money</i> or <i>goods</i> by <i>force</i> or <i>violence</i> from any. This is the import of the words <i>neminein</i> <i>concutite</i>, used here by the Vulgate, and points out a crime of which the Roman soldiers were notoriously guilty, their own writers being witnesses. <i>Concussio</i> has the above meaning in the Roman law. See RAPHELIUS <i>in loco</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither accuse</b></i><b> any </b><i><b>falsely</b></i> — Or, <i>on a frivolous pretence </i>- μηδε συκοφαντησητε, <i>be not sycophants</i>, like those who are base flatterers of their masters, who to ingratiate themselves into their esteem, malign, accuse, and impeach the innocent. Bishop PEARCE observes that, when the <i>concussio</i> above referred to did not produce the effect they wished, they often <i>falsely accused</i> the persons, which is the reason why this advice is added. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:7">Luke 19:7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Be content with your wages.</b></i> — οψωνιοις. The word signifies not only the <i>money</i> which was allotted to a Roman soldier, which was <i>tico oboli</i>, about three halfpence per day, but also the necessary supply of <i>wheat, barley</i>, &amp;c. See <i>Raphelius</i>.</p>
