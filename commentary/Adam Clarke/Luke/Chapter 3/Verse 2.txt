<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>. <i><b>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests</b></i> — Caiaphas was the son-in-law of Annas or Ananias, and it is supposed that they exercised the high priest's office by turns. It is likely that Annas only was considered as high priest; and that Caiaphas was what the Hebrews termed כהן משנה <i>cohen mishneh</i>, or סגן כהנים <i>sagan cohanim</i>, the high priest's <i>deputy</i>, or ruler of the temple. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4">Matthew 2:4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>.</p>
<p>The facts which St. Luke mentions here tend much to confirm the truth of the evangelical history. Christianity differs widely from <i>philosophic system</i>; it is <i>founded</i> in the goodness and authority of God; and <i>attested</i> by historic facts. It differs also from <i>popular </i> <i>tradition</i>, which either has had no pure <i>origin</i>, or which is lost in <i>unknown</i> or <i>fabulous antiquity</i>. It differs also from <i>pagan</i> and <i>Mohammedan</i> revelations, which were fabricated in a corner, and had no witnesses. In the above verses we find the <i>persons</i>, the <i>places</i>, and the <i>times</i> marked with the utmost exactness. It was under the first <i>Caesars</i> that the preaching of the Gospel took place; and in their time, the facts on which the whole of Christianity is founded made their appearance: an age the most <i>enlightened</i>, and best <i>known</i> from the multitude of its historic records. It was in Judea, where every thing that professed to come from God was scrutinized with the most <i>exact</i> and <i>unmerciful criticism</i>. In writing the history of Christianity, the evangelists appeal to certain facts which were publicly transacted in such places, under the government and inspection of such and such persons, and in such particular times. A thousand persons could have confronted the falsehood, had it been one! These appeals are made - a challenge is offered to the Roman government, and to the Jewish rulers and people - a new religion has been introduced in such a place, at such a time - this has been accompanied with such and such facts and miracles! Who can disprove this? All are silent. None appears to offer even an objection. The cause of infidelity and irreligion is at stake! If these facts cannot be disproved, the religion of Christ must triumph. None appears because none could appear. Now let it be observed, that the persons of <i>that time</i>, only, could confute these things had they been false; they never attempted it; therefore these facts are absolute and incontrovertible truths: this conclusion is necessary. Shall a man then give up his faith in such attested facts as these, because, more than a <i>thousand</i> years after, an infidel creeps out, and <i>ventures</i> publicly to sneer at what his iniquitous soul hopes is not true!</p>
<p><i><b>The word of God came unto John</b></i> — That is, the Holy Spirit that revealed to him this doctrine of salvation. This <i>came upon</i> him in the <i>desert</i>, where he was living in such a state of austerity as gave him full right to preach all the rigours of penitence to others. Thus we find that the first preachers, historians, and followers of the doctrines of the Gospel were men eminent for the <i>austerity</i> of their <i>lives</i>, the <i>simplicity</i> of their <i>manners</i>, and the <i>sanctity</i> of their <i>conduct</i>; they were authorized by God, and filled with the most precious gifts of his Spirit. And what are the <i>apostles</i> which the <i>new philosophy</i> sends us? Philosophers full of themselves, not guided by the <i>love</i> of truth or <i>wisdom</i>, but ever seeking their own glory; in constant hostility among themselves, because of their separate pretensions to particular discoveries, of the honour of which they would almost as soon lose life as be deprived. Who are they? Men of a mortified life and unblamable conversation? No - they are <i>poets</i> and <i>poetasters</i>; composers of <i>romances, novels, intrigues, farces, comedies</i>, &amp;c., full of extravagance and impurity. They are pretended <i>moralists</i> that preach up <i>pleasure</i> and <i>sensual gratification</i>, and dissolve, as far as they can, the <i>sacred</i> and <i>civil</i> ties that unite and support society. They are men whose guilt is heightened by their assuming the sacred name of <i>philosophers</i>, and dignifying their impure system with a name at which <i>Philosophy</i> herself <i>blushes</i> and <i>bleeds</i>.</p>
