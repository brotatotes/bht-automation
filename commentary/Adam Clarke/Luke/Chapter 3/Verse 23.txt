<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:23">Luke 3:23</span>. <i><b>Thirty years of age</b></i> — This was the age required by the law, to which the priests must arrive before they could be installed in their office: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+4:3">Numbers 4:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph</b></i> — This same phrase is used by <i>Herodotus</i> to signify one who was only <i>reputed</i> to be the son of a particular person: τουτον παις νομιζεται <i>he was SUPPOSED</i> <i>to be this man's son</i>.</p>
<p>Much learned labour has been used to reconcile this genealogy with that in St. Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1-17">Matthew 1:1-17</span>, and there are several ways of doing it; the following, which appears to me to be the <i>best</i>, is also the most <i>simple</i> and <i>easy</i>. For a more elaborate discussion of the subject, the reader is referred to the <i>additional observations</i> at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>MATTHEW, in <i>descending</i> from Abraham to Joseph, the spouse of the blessed virgin, speaks of SONS <i>properly such</i>, by way of natural generation: <i>Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob</i>, c. But <i>Luke</i>, in <i>ascending</i> from the Saviour of the world to GOD himself, speaks of <i>sons</i> either <i>properly</i> or <i>improperly such</i>: on this account he uses an <i>indeterminate</i> mode of expression, which may be applied to sons either <i>putatively</i> or <i>really</i> such. <i>And Jesus</i> <i>himself began to be about thirty years of age, being, as was</i> <i>SUPPOSED the son of Joseph-of Heli-of Matthat</i>, c. This receives considerable support from <i>Raphelius's</i> method of reading the original ων (ὡς ενομιζετο υἱος Ιωσηφ) του Ἡλι, <i>being (when</i> <i>reputed the son of Joseph) the son of Heli</i>, &amp;c. That St. Luke does not always speak of sons <i>properly</i> such, is evident from the first and last person which he names: <i>Jesus Christ</i> was only the <i>supposed</i> son of Joseph, because Joseph was the husband of his mother Mary: and <i>Adam</i>, who is said to be the <i>son of God</i>, was such only by <i>creation</i>. After this observation it is next necessary to consider, that, in the genealogy described by St. Luke, there are two sons <i>improperly</i> such: i.e. <i>two sons-in-law</i>, instead of two sons.</p>
<p>As the Hebrews never permitted <i>women</i> to enter into their genealogical tables, whenever a family happened to end with a <i>daughter</i>, instead of naming <i>her</i> in the genealogy, they inserted her <i>husband</i>, as the <i>son</i> of him who was, in reality, but his <i>father-in-law</i>. This import, bishop Pearce has fully shown, νομιζεσθαι bears, in a variety of places-Jesus was <i>considered</i> <i>according to law</i>, or <i>allowed custom</i>, to be the son of Joseph, as <i>he</i> was of Heli.</p>
<p>The two <i>sons-in-law</i> who are to be noticed in this genealogy are <i>Joseph</i> the son-in-law of <i>Heli</i>, whose <i>own</i> father was Jacob, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:16">Matthew 1:16</span> and <i>Salathiel</i>, the son-in-law of <i>Neri</i>, whose own father was <i>Jechonias</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:17">1 Chronicles 3:17</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:12">Matthew 1:12</span>. This remark alone is sufficient to remove every difficulty. Thus it appears that Joseph, <i>son</i> of <i>Jacob</i>, according to St. Matthew, was <i>son-in-law</i> of <i>Heli</i>, according to St. Luke. And <i>Salathiel, son</i> of <i>Jechonias</i>, according to the former, was <i>son-in-law</i> of <i>Neri</i>, according to the latter.</p>
<p>Mary therefore appears to have been the daughter of Heli; so called by abbreviation for <i>Heliachim</i>, which is the same in Hebrew with <i>Joachim</i>.</p>
<p>Joseph, son of Jacob, and Mary; daughter of Heli, were of the <i>same</i> family: both came from <i>Zerubbabel</i>; Joseph from <i>Abiud</i>, his eldest son, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:13">Matthew 1:13</span>, and Mary by <i>Rhesa</i>, the youngest. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:27">Luke 3:27</span>.</p>
<p><i>Salathiel</i> and <i>Zorobabel</i>, from whom St. Matthew and St. Luke cause Christ to proceed, were themselves descended from <i>Solomon</i> in a direct line: and though St. Luke says that Salathiel was <i>son</i> of <i>Neri</i>, who was descended from <i>Nathan</i>, Solomon's eldest brother, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:5">1 Chronicles 3:5</span>, this is only to be understood of his having espoused <i>Nathan's daughter</i>, and that <i>Neri</i> dying, probably, without male issues the two branches of the family of David, that of <i>Nathan</i> and that of <i>Solomon</i>, were both united in the person of <i>Zerubbabel</i>, by the marriage of <i>Salathiel</i>, chief of the regal family of Solomon, with the daughter of <i>Neri</i>, chief and heretrix of the family of <i>Nathan</i>. Thus it appears that Jesus, son of Mary, reunited in himself all the blood, privileges, and rights of the whole family of David; in consequence of which he is emphatically called, <i>The</i> <i>son of David</i>. It is worthy of being remarked that St. Matthew, who wrote principally for the <i>Jews</i>, extends his genealogy to <i>Abraham</i> through whom the promise of the Messiah was given to the Jews; but St. Luke, who wrote his history for the instruction of the <i>Gentiles</i>, extends his genealogy to <i>Adam</i>, to whom the promise of the Redeemer was given in behalf of himself and of all his posterity. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>, &amp;c.</p>
