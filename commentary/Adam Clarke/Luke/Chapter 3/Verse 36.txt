<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:36">Luke 3:36</span>. <i><b>Of Cainan</b></i> â€” This <i>Cainan</i>, the son of <i>Arphaxad</i>, and father of <i>Sala</i>, is not found in any other Scripture genealogy. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+10:24">Genesis 10:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:12">Genesis 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+1:18">1 Chronicles 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+1:24">1 Chronicles 1:24</span>, where <i>Arphaxad</i> is made the father of <i>Sala</i>, and no mention at all made of <i>Cainan</i>. Some suppose that <i>Cainan</i> was a surname of <i>Sala</i>, and that the names should be read <i>together</i> thus, <i>The son of Heber, the</i> <i>son of Salacainan, the son of Arphaxad</i>, c. If this does not <i>untie</i> the knot, it certainly <i>cuts</i> it and the reader may pass on without any great scruple or embarrassment. There are many sensible observations on this genealogy in the notes at the end of Bishop Newcome's Harmony.</p>
