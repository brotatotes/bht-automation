<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:1">Luke 4:1</span>. <i><b>Was led by the Spirit</b></i> — Or, <i>And was carried about</i>, ηγετο. Matthew says, αςηχθη, <i>he was brought up</i>. <i>Mark</i> says, <i>the Spirit driveth him</i> εκβαλλει - <i>putteth him forth</i>. But each of the evangelists attributes this to the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, not to <i>Satan</i>.</p>
<p>It may be useful to remark here, that, during the forty days and forty nights in which he is said to have been tempted by the devil, he is <i>carried about</i>, continually sustained and supported, by the Holy Ghost. Let those who are tempted by Satan <i>look for</i>, and, in virtue of the power and intercession of Christ, <i>claim</i>, the same support; and it matters little how many days they may be <i>assaulted</i> by the <i>devil</i>, while they are <i>carried about</i> by the <i>Spirit of God</i>.</p>
