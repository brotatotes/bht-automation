<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14">Luke 4:14</span>. <i><b>Returned in the power of the Spirit</b></i> — Εν τῃ δυναμει του πνευματος, <i>In the mighty power of the Spirit</i>. Having now conquered the grand adversary, he comes in the miracle-working energy of the Spirit to show forth his power, godhead, and love to the people, that they might believe and be saved. He who, through the grace of God, resists and overcomes temptation, is always <i>bettered</i> by it. This is one of the wonders of God's grace, that those very things which are designed for our utter ruin he makes the instruments of our greatest good. Thus Satan is ever duped by his own proceedings, and caught in his own craft.</p>
