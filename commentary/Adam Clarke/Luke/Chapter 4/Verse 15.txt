<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:15">Luke 4:15</span>. <i><b>And he taught in their synagogues</b></i> — We do not find that even the persecuting Jews ever hindered Christ or his disciples from preaching in their synagogues. Is it the same in every place where even the Christian religion is established by law? Would Jesus, or his apostles, or their most Scriptural representatives, be permitted to preach in one out of a thousand churches, in certain countries, unless they were strictly conformed to their external ecclesiastical customs? Nor even <i>then</i>, unless their doctrine were according to the taste of the managers and of the times.</p>
<p><i><b>Glorified of all.</b></i> — All felt the power of his preaching, and acknowledged the divinity of his mission. The scandal of the cross had not yet taken place.</p>
