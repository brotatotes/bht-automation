<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16">Luke 4:16</span>. <i><b>To Nazareth, where he had been brought up</b></i> — It is likely that our Lord lived principally in this city till the 30th year of his age; but, after he entered on his public ministry, his usual place of residence was at the house of Peter, in Capernaum.</p>
<p><i><b>As his custom was</b></i> — Our Lord regularly attended the public worship of God in the synagogues; for there the <i>Scriptures</i> were read: other parts of the worship were very corrupt; but it was the best at that time to be found in the land. To worship God <i>publicly</i> is the <i>duty</i> of every man, and no man can be guiltless who neglects it. If a person cannot get such public worship as he <i>likes</i>, let him frequent such as he can <i>get</i>. Better to attend the most indifferent than to stay at <i>home</i>, especially on the <i>Lord's day</i>. The <i>place</i> and the <i>time</i> are set apart for the worship of the true God: if others do not conduct themselves well in it, that is not your fault, and need not be any hinderance to <i>you</i>. You come to worship GOD - do not forget your errand-and God will supply the lack in the service by the teachings of his Spirit. Hear the saying of old Mr. Herbert: - "The worst speak something good: should all want sense,</p>

<p><i><b>Stood up for to read.</b></i> — The Jews, in general, sat while they taught or commented on the Sacred Writings, or the traditions of the elders; but when they <i>read</i> either the law or the prophets they invariably <i>stood up</i>: it was not lawful for them even to <i>lean</i> against any thing while employed in reading.</p>
