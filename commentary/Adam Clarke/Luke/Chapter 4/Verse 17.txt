<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:17">Luke 4:17</span>. <i><b>And when he had opened the book</b></i> — αναπτυζας, <i>When he</i> <i>had unrolled it</i>. The Sacred Writings used to this day, in all the Jewish synagogues, are written on <i>skins</i> of <i>basil, parchment</i>, or <i>vellum</i>, sewed end to end, and <i>rolled</i> on two <i>rollers</i>, beginning at each end; so that, in reading from right to left, they roll <i>off</i> with the left, while they roll <i>on</i> with the right. Probably the place in the Prophet Isaiah, here referred to, was the lesson for that day; and Jesus <i>unrolled</i> the manuscript till he came to the place: then, after having read, he rolled it up again, and returned it to the officer, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span>, the ruler of the synagogue, or his servant, whose business it was to take care of it. The place that he opened was probably the section for the day. See the table at the end of <i>Deuteronomy</i>, and the <i>note</i> at the end of that <i>table</i>.</p>
