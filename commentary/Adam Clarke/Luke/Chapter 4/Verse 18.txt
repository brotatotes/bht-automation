<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>. <i><b>The Spirit of the Lord</b></i> — This is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>; but our Lord immediately adds to it <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:7">Isaiah 42:7</span>. The proclaiming of liberty to the captives, and the acceptable year (or year of acceptance) of the Lord, is a manifest allusion to the proclaiming of the year of jubilee by sound of trumpet: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+25:9">Leviticus 25:9</span>, c., and the notes there. This was a year of general release of <i>debts</i> and <i>obligations</i> of <i>bond-men</i> and <i>women</i>; of <i>lands</i> and <i>possessions</i>, which had been <i>sold</i> from the families and tribes to which they belonged. Our Saviour, by applying this text to himself, a text so manifestly relating to the institution above mentioned, plainly declares the typical design of that institution. - LOWTH.</p>
<p><i><b>He hath anointed me</b></i> — I have been designed and set apart for this very purpose; my sole business among men is <i>to proclaim glad</i> <i>tidings to the poor</i>, c. All the functions of this new prophet are exercised on the <i>hearts</i> of men and the grace by which he works in the heart is a grace of <i>healing, deliverance</i>, and <i>illumination</i>; which, by an admirable virtue, causes them to pass from <i>sickness</i> to <i>health</i>, from <i>slavery</i> to <i>liberty</i>, from <i>darkness</i> to <i>light,</i> and from the lowest degrees of <i>misery</i> to supreme eternal <i>happiness</i>. See <i>Quesnel</i>. To those who feel their spiritual <i>poverty</i>, whose <i>hearts</i> are <i>broken</i> through a sense of their sins, who see themselves <i>tied</i> and <i>bound</i> with the chains of many evil <i>habits</i>, who sit in the <i>darkness</i> of guilt and misery, without a friendly hand to <i>lead</i> them in the way in which they should go-to these, the Gospel of the grace of Christ is a pleasing sound, because a present and full salvation is proclaimed by it; and the <i>present</i> is shown to be the <i>acceptable year</i> of the Lord; the <i>year</i>, the <i>time</i>, in which he saves to the uttermost all who come unto him in the name of his Son Jesus. Reader! what dost thou feel? <i>Sin-wretchedness-misery</i> of every description? Then come to Jesus - He <i>will</i> save THEE - he came into the world for this <i>very</i> <i>purpose</i>. Cast thy soul upon him, and thou shalt <i>not</i> perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
