<p>Verse 25. <i><b>In the days of Elias</b></i> â€” See this history, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:1-9">1 Kings 17:1-9</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:1-45">1 Kings 18:1-45</span>. This was evidently a miraculous interference, as no rain fell for three years and six months, even in the rainy seasons. There were two of these in Judea, called the <i>first</i> and the <i>latter</i> rains; the <i>first</i> fell in <i>October</i>, the <i>latter</i> in <i>April</i>: the first prepared the ground for the seed, the latter ripened the harvest. As both these rains were withheld, consequently <i>there was a great famine throughout all the land</i>.</p>
