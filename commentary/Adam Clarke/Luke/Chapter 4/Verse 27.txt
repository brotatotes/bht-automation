<p>Verse 27. <i><b>None of them was cleansed</b></i> â€” This verse is to be understood as the 26th; for Naaman, being a <i>Syrian</i>, was <i>no leper</i> <i>in Israel</i>.</p>
<p>The meaning of these verses is, God dispenses his benefits <i>when,</i> <i>where</i>, and to <i>whom</i> he pleases. No person can complain of his conduct in these respects, because no person <i>deserves</i> any good from his hand. God never <i>punishes</i> any but those who <i>deserve</i> it; but he blesses incessantly those who deserve it not. The reason is evident: <i>justice depends</i> on certain <i>rules</i>; but <i>beneficence</i> is <i>free</i>. <i>Beneficence</i> can bless both the <i>good</i> and the <i>evil;</i> <i>justice</i> can <i>punish</i> the <i>latter</i> only. Those who do not make this distinction must have a very confused notion of the conduct of Divine Providence among men.</p>
