<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Were filled with wrath</b></i> â€” They seem to have drawn the following conclusion from what our Lord spoke: "The <i>Gentiles</i> are more precious in the sight of God than the <i>Jews</i>; and to them his miracles of mercy and kindness shall be principally confined." This was pretty near the truth, as the event proved. Those who profit not by the light of God, while it is among them, shall have their candle extinguished. The kingdom of God was taken from the <i>Jews</i>, and given to the <i>Gentiles</i>; not because the Gentiles were <i>better</i> than they were, but because,</p>
<p>1st. The Jews had <i>forfeited</i> their privileges; and</p>
<p>2dly. Because Christ saw that the Gentiles would bring forth the <i>fruits</i> of the kingdom.</p>
