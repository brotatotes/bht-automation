<p>Verse 29. <i><b>The brow of the hill</b></i> — Mr. Maundrel tells us that this is still called "the <i>Mountain of the Precipitation</i>, and is half a league southward of Nazareth. In going to it, you cross first over the vale in which Nazareth stands; and then going down two or three furlongs, in a narrow cleft between the rocks, you there clamber up a short but difficult way on the right hand; at the top of which you find a great stone standing on the <i>brink</i> of <i>a</i> <i>precipice</i>, which is said to be the very place where our Lord was destined to be thrown down by his enraged neighbours." <i>Maundrel's</i> <i>Journey</i>, p. 116. Edit. 5th. 1732.</p>
