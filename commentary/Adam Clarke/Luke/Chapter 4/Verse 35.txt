<p>Verse 35. <i><b>And hurt him not.</b></i> â€” Though he <i>convulsed</i> him, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:26">Mark 2:26</span>, and <i>threw him down in the midst of them</i>, probably with the design to take away his life, yet our Lord permitted it not; and this appears to be the meaning of the place. The spirit was not permitted essentially to injure him at that time.</p>
