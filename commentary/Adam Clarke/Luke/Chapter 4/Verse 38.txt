<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Simon's wife's mother</b></i> â€” See Clarke on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14-17">Matthew 8:14-17</span>. As soon as Peter began to follow Christ, his family began to benefit by it. It is always profitable to contract an acquaintance with good men. One person full of faith and prayer may be the means of drawing down innumerable blessings on his family and acquaintance. Every person who knows the virtue and authority of Christ should earnestly seek his grace in behalf of all the spiritually diseased in his household; nor can he seek the aid of Christ in vain.</p>
