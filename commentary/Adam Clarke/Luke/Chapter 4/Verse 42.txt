<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:42">Luke 4:42</span>. <i><b>And the people sought him</b></i> — Rather, <i>Sought</i> him <i>earnestly</i>. Instead of εζητουν, <i>sought</i>, I read, επεζητουν, <i>earnestly sought</i>. This reading is supported by ABCDFLMS-V, and more than seventy others. <i>Wetstein</i> and <i>Griesbach</i> have both received it into the text. The people had tasted the good word of God, and now they cleave to Christ with their whole heart. <i>Hearing</i> the words of Christ, and <i>feeling</i> the influence of his Spirit upon the soul, will attract and influence the heart; and indeed nothing else can do it.</p>
<p><i><b>And stayed him</b></i> — Strove <i>to detain him</i>; κατειχον αυτον <i>they</i> <i>caught hold of him</i>. Thus showing their great earnestness to be farther instructed.</p>
