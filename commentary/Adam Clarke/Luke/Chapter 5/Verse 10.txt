Verse Luke 5:10. Thou shalt catch men. — ανθρωπους εση ζωγρων, Thou shalt catch men alive; this is the proper signification of the word. Fear not: these discoveries of God tend to life, not to death; and ye shall become the instruments of life and salvation to a lost world. These fish are taken to be killed and fed on; but those who are converted under your ministry shall be preserved unto eternal life. Matthew 4:18, &c., where this subject is considered more at large.
