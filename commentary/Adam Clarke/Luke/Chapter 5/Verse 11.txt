They forsook all, and followed him. â€” God expects this from every person, and especially from those in whose hearts, or in whose behalf, he has wrought a miracle of grace or of providence. Jesus intended to call Peter, James, and John, to become his disciples; and that they might see the propriety and importance of the call, he: -1st. TEACHES in their presence, that they may know his doctrine.2dly. He WORKS a MIRACLE before their eyes, that they might see and be convinced of his power.3dly. He CALLS them to go forth with this doctrine, and through this power, that they might teach the ignorant, and be successful in their work.
