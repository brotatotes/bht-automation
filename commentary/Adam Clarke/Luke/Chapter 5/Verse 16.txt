<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:16">Luke 5:16</span>. <i><b>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness</b></i> — Or rather, <i>He frequently withdrew into the desert</i>. This I believe to be the import of the original words, ην υποχωρων. He made it a frequent custom to withdraw from the multitudes for a time, and pray, teaching hereby the ministers of the Gospel that they are to receive fresh supplies of <i>light</i> and <i>power</i> from God by prayer, that they may be the more successful in their work; and that they ought to seek frequent opportunities of being in private with <i>God</i> and their <i>books</i>. A man can give nothing unless he first <i>receive</i> it; and no man can be successful in the ministry who does not constantly depend upon God, for the excellence of the power is all from him. Why is there so <i>much</i> preaching, and so <i>little</i> good done? Is it not because the preachers <i>mix</i> too much with the <i>world, keep</i> too long in the <i>crowd</i>, and are so <i>seldom</i> in private with <i>God</i>? Reader! Art thou a <i>herald</i> for the Lord of hosts? Make full proof of thy ministry! Let it never be said of thee, "He forsook all to follow Christ, and to preach his Gospel, but there was little or no fruit of his labour; for he ceased to be a <i>man of prayer</i>, and got into the <i>spirit</i> of the <i>world</i>." Alas! alas! is this luminous <i>star</i>, that was once <i>held</i> in the <i>right hand of Jesus</i>, fallen from the firmament of <i>heaven, down</i> to the EARTH!</p>
