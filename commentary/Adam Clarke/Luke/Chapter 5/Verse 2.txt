<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:2">Luke 5:2</span>. <i><b>Two ships</b></i> — δυο πλοια, <i>Two vessels</i>, It is highly improper to term these <i>ships</i>. They appear to have been only such <i>small boats</i> as are used to manage nets on flat smooth beaches: one end of the net is attached to the shore; the fishermen row out, and drop the net as they go, making a kind of semicircle from the shore; they return, and bring the rope attached to the other end with them, and then the net is hauled on shore; and, as it was sunk with weights to the bottom, and floated with corks at the top, all the fish in that compass were included, and drawn to shore.</p>
