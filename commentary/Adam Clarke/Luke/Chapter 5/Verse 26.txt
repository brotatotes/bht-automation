<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Strange things</b></i> — παραδοξα, <i>paradoxes</i>. A paradox is something that appears <i>false</i> and <i>absurd</i>, but is not <i>really</i> so: or, something <i>contrary</i> to the <i>commonly received opinion</i>. We have seen <i>wonders</i> wrought which seem <i>impossible</i>; and we should conclude them to be <i>tricks</i> and <i>illusions</i>, were it not for the indisputable evidence we have of their <i>reality</i>.</p>
