<p>Verse 28. <i><b>And he left all</b></i> — καταλιπων - <i>completely abandoning</i> his office, and every thing connected with it. He who wishes to preach the Gospel, like the disciples of Christ, must have no earthly entanglement. If he have, his whole labour will be marred by it. The concerns of his own soul, and those of the multitudes to whom he preaches, are sufficient to engross all his attention, and to employ all his powers.</p>
