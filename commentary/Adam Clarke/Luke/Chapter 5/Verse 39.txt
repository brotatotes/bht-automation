<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:39">Luke 5:39</span>. <i><b>The old is better.</b></i> — χρηστοτερος - Is more <i>agreeable</i> to the <i>taste</i> or <i>palate</i>. <i>Herodotus</i>, the scholiast on <i>Aristophanes,</i> and <i>Homer</i>, use the word in this sense. See <i>Raphelius</i>. The <i>old</i> <i>wine</i>, among the rabbins, was <i>the wine of three leaves</i>; that is, wine three years old; because, from the time that the vine had produced that wine, it had put forth its leaves three times. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>1. THE miraculous draught of fishes - the cleansing of the leper-the healing of the paralytic person - the calling of Levi - and the parable of the old and new bottles, and the old and new wine - all related in this chapter, make it not only very entertaining, but highly instructive. There are few chapters in the New Testament from which a preacher of the Gospel can derive more lessons of instruction; and the reader would naturally expect a more particular explanation of its several parts, had not this been anticipated in the notes and observations on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:0">Matthew 9:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span>ff to which chapter it will be well to refer.</p>
<p>2. The conduct as well as the preaching of our Lord is highly edifying. His <i>manner</i> of teaching made every thing he spoke interesting and impressive. He had many prejudices to remove, and he used admirable address in order to meet and take them out of the way. There is as much to be observed in the <i>manner</i> of speaking the truth, as in the <i>truth</i> itself, in order to make it effectual to the salvation of them who hear it. A harsh, unfeeling method of preaching the <i>promises</i> of the Gospel, and a smiling manner of producing the <i>terrors of the Lord</i>, are equally reprehensible. Some preachers are always severe and magisterial: others are always mild and insinuating: neither of these can do God's work; and it would take <i>two</i> such to make <i>one</i> PREACHER.</p>
