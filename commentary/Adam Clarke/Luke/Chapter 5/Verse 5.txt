He seems to comprise both ideas in this appellation he listened attentively to his teaching, and readily obeyed his orders. To hear attentively, and obey cheerfully, are duties we owe, not only to the sovereign Master of the world, but also to ourselves. No man ever took Jesus profitably for his teacher, who did not at the same time receive him as his Lord.We have toiled all the night — They had cast the net several times in the course of the night, and drew it to shore without success, and were now greatly disheartened.
