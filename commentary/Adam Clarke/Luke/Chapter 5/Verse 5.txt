<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:5">Luke 5:5</span>. <i><b>Simon - said - Master</b></i> — επιστατα. This is the first place where this word occurs; it is used by none of the inspired penmen but Luke, and he applies it only to our blessed Lord. It properly signifies a <i>prefect</i>, or one who is <i>set over</i> certain affairs or persons: it is used also for an instructer, or teacher. Peter considered Christ, from what he had heard, as <i>teacher</i> of a Divine doctrine, and as having <i>authority</i> to command, c. He seems to comprise <i>both ideas</i> in this appellation he listened attentively to his <i>teaching</i>, and readily <i>obeyed</i> his <i>orders</i>. To hear attentively, and obey cheerfully, are duties we owe, not only to the sovereign <i>Master</i> of the world, but also to ourselves. No man ever took Jesus profitably for his <i>teacher</i>, who did not at the same time receive him as <i>his Lord</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>We have toiled all the night</b></i> — They had cast the net several times in the course of the night, and drew it to shore without success, and were now greatly disheartened. I have seen several laborious draughts of this kind made without fruit. All labour must be fruitless where the blessing of God is not; but especially that of the ministry. It is the presence and influence of Christ, in a congregation, that cause souls to be gathered unto himself: without these, whatever the preacher's eloquence or abilities may be, all will be <i>night</i>, and <i>fruitless labour</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>At thy word I will let down the net.</b></i> — He who assumes the character of a <i>fisher of men</i>, under any authority that does not proceed from Christ, is sure to catch <i>nothing</i>; but he who labours by the <i>order</i> and under the <i>direction</i> of the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, cannot labour in vain.</p>
