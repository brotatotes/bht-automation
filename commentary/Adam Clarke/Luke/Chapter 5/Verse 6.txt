<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:6">Luke 5:6</span>. <i><b>Their net brake.</b></i> — Or, <i>began to break</i>, διερρηγνυτο, or, was <i>likely</i> to be <i>broken</i>. Had it <i>broke</i>, as our version states, they could have caught no fish. Grammarians give the following rule concerning words of this kind. <i>Verba completiva</i> <i>inchoative intelligenda</i>. Verbs which signify the accomplishment of a thing, are often to be understood as only signifying the <i>beginning</i> of that accomplishment. <i>Raphelius</i> gives some very pertinent examples of this out of <i>Herodotus</i>.</p>
