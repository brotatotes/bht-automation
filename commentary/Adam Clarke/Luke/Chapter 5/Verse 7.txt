<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:7">Luke 5:7</span>. <i><b>They beckoned unto their partners</b></i> — Had not these been called in to assist, the net must have been <i>broken</i>, and all the fish lost. What a pity there should be such envious separation among the different sects that profess to believe in Christ Jesus! Did they <i>help each other</i> in the spirit of Christian fellowship, more souls would be brought to the knowledge of the truth. Some will rather leave souls to perish than admit of <i>partners</i> in the sacred work. It is an intolerable pride to think nothing well done but what we do ourselves; and a diabolic envy to be afraid lest others should be more successful than we are.</p>
<p><i><b>They - filled both the ships</b></i> — Both the boats had as many as they could carry, and were so heavily laden that they were ready to sink. As one justly observes, "There are fish plenty to be taken, were there skilful <i>hands</i> to take, and <i>vessels</i> to contain them. Many are disputing about the <i>size, capacity</i>, and <i>goodness</i> of their <i>nets</i> and their <i>vessels</i>, while the fish are permitted to make their escape." Did the faithful fishers in both the vessels in these lands (the <i>established Church</i>, and the various branches of the <i>dissenting interest</i>) join heartily together, the nations might be converted to God; but, while the ridiculous disputes <i>for</i> and <i>against</i> particular <i>forms</i> last, there can be no unity. Were men as zealous to <i>catch souls</i>, as they are to support their particular <i>creeds</i>, and <i>forms</i> of worship, the state of Christianity would be more flourishing than it is at present. But the wall of separation is continually strengthened, each party fortifying it on <i>his own</i> side.</p>
