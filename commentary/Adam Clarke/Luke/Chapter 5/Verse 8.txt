<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:8">Luke 5:8</span>. <i><b>Depart from me; for I am a sinful man</b></i> — εξελθε απ εμου, <i>Go out from</i> me, i.e. from my boat. Peter was fully convinced that this draught of fish was a miraculous one; and that God himself had particularly interfered in this matter, whose presence and power he reverenced in the person of Jesus. But as he felt himself a <i>sinner</i>, he was afraid the Divine purity of Christ could not possibly endure him; therefore he wished for a separation from that power, which he was afraid might break forth and consume him. It seems to have been a received <i>maxim</i> among the Jews, that whoever had seen a particular manifestation of God should speedily die. Hence <i>Jacob</i> seemed astonished that <i>his life</i> should have <i>been</i> <i>preserved</i>, when <i>he had seen God face to face</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:30">Genesis 32:30</span>. So <i>the nobles of Israel saw God</i>, and yet <i>did eat and drink</i>; for <i>on</i> <i>them he had laid not his hand</i>, i.e. to destroy them, though it appears to have been expected by them, in consequence of this discovery which he made of himself. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:10-11">Exodus 24:10-11</span>, and the notes there. This supposition of the Jews seems to have been founded on the authority of God himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:20">Exodus 33:20</span>: <i>There shall no man see my FACE and LIVE</i>. So Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+5:26">Deuteronomy 5:26</span>: <i>Who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the</i> <i>living God, speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have</i>, and <i>LIVED</i>? So <i>Gideon</i> expected to be immediately slain, because he had <i>seen an angel of the Lord</i>, and a <i>miracle</i> performed by him. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+6:21-23">Judges 6:21-23</span>. So likewise <i>Manoah</i> and his wife, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:22">Judges 13:22</span>: <i>We shall surely DIE, for we have SEEN GOD</i>. These different passages sufficiently show in what sense these words of Peter are to be understood.</p>
