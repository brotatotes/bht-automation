<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:1">Luke 6:1</span>. <i><b>On the second Sabbath after the first</b></i> — εν σαββατω δευτεροπρωτω, <i>In the first Sabbath after the second</i>. What does this mean? In answering this question, commentators are greatly divided. Dr. <i>Whitby</i> speaks thus: "After the first day of the passover, (which was a Sabbath, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:16">Exodus 12:16</span>,) ye shall count unto you seven Sabbaths complete, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:15">Leviticus 23:15</span>, reckoning that day for the <i>first</i> of the <i>first week</i>, which was therefore called δευτεροπρωτον, <i>the first Sabbath from the second day of unleavened bread</i>; (the 16th of the month;) <i>the second</i> was called δευτεροδευτερον, <i>the</i> <i>second Sabbath from that day</i>; and the <i>third</i>, δευτεροτριτον, <i>the</i> <i>third Sabbath from the second day</i>; and so on, till they came to the <i>seventh</i> Sabbath from that day, i.e. to the 49th day, which was the day of <i>pentecost</i>. The mention of the seven Sabbaths, to be numbered with relation to this second day, answers all that <i>Grotius</i> objects against this exposition." WHITBY'S <i>Notes</i>.</p>
<p>By this Sabbath seems meant that which immediately followed the two great feasts, the first and last day of the passover, and was therefore the <i>second</i> after the proper passover day. The words in the Greek seem to signify, the <i>second first Sabbath</i>; and, in the opinion of some, the Jews had <i>three</i> first Sabbaths: viz. the first Sabbath after the <i>passover</i>; that after the feast of <i>pentecost</i>; and that after the feast of <i>tabernacles</i>. According to which opinion, this <i>second first Sabbath</i> must have been the first Sabbath after the pentecost. So we have the first Sunday after Epiphany; the first after Easter; the first after Trinity; and the first in Lent. Bp. PEARCE.</p>
<p>This was the next day after the passover, the day in which they were forbidden to labour, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:6">Leviticus 23:6</span>, and for this reason was termed <i>Sabbath</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:15">Leviticus 23:15</span>; but here it is marked by the name, <i>second first Sabbath</i>, because, being the day after the passover, it was in this respect the <i>second</i>; and it was also the <i>first</i>, because it was the first day of unleavened bread, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:15-16">Exodus 12:15-16</span>. MARTIN.</p>
<p>I think, with many commentators, that this transaction happened on the first Sabbath of the month Nisan; that is, after the second day of the feast of unleavened bread. We may well suppose that our Lord and his disciples were on their way from Jerusalem to Galilee, after having kept the passover. Bp. NEWCOME.</p>
<p>The <i>Vulgar Latin</i> renders δευτεροπρωτον, <i>secundoprimum</i>, which is literal and right. We translate it, the <i>second Sabbath after</i> <i>the first</i>, which is directly wrong; for it should have been the <i>first Sabbath after the second</i> day of the passover. On the 14th of <i>Nisan</i>, the passover was killed; the next day (the 15th) was the first day of the feast of unleavened bread; the day following (the 16th) the <i>wave sheaf</i> was offered, pursuant to the law, <i>on the</i> <i>morrow after the Sabbath</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+18:11">Leviticus 18:11</span>. The <i>Sabbath</i>, here, is not the seventh day of the week, but the <i>first</i> <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of unleavened bread</i>, let it fall on what day of the week it would. That and the <i>seventh day</i> of that feast were <i>holy convocations</i>, and therefore are here called <i>Sabbaths</i>. The morrow, therefore, after the <i>Sabbath</i>, i.e. after the 16th day of Nisan, was the day in which the <i>wave sheaf</i> was offered; and after that <i>seven Sabbaths</i> were counted, and <i>fifty</i> days completed, and the <i>fiftieth</i> day inclusively was the day of <i>pentecost</i>. Now these Sabbaths, between the <i>passover</i> and <i>pentecost</i>, were called the first, second, c., <i>Sabbaths after the second day</i> of the feast of unleavened bread. This <i>Sabbath</i>, then, on which the disciples plucked the ears of corn, was the <i>first Sabbath</i> after <i>that second</i> <i>day</i>. Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i>, has demonstrably proved this to be the meaning of this σαββατον δευτεροπρωτον, (Hor. Hebraic. in locum,) and from him F. <i>Lamy</i> and Dr. <i>Whitby</i> have so explained it. This <i>Sabbath</i> could not fall <i>before</i> the passover, because, till the second day of that feast, no <i>Jew</i> might <i>eat either bread or parched corn, or</i> <i>green ears</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:14">Leviticus 23:14</span>.) Had the disciples then gathered these ears of corn on any Sabbath <i>before the passover</i>, they would have broken <i>two</i> laws instead of <i>one</i>: and for the breach of these <i>two</i> laws they would infallibly have been accused whereas now they broke only <i>one</i>, (<i>plucking the ears of standing corn with one's</i> <i>hand</i>, being expressly allowed in the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+23:25">Deuteronomy 23:25</span>), which was that of the Sabbath. They took a liberty which the law gave them upon any other day; and our Lord vindicated them in what they did now, in the manner we see. Nor can this fact be laid <i>after</i> <i>pentecost</i>; because then the harvest was fully in. Within that interval, therefore, this <i>Sabbath</i> happened; and this is a plain determination of the time, according to the <i>Jewish</i> ways of reckoning, founded upon the text of Moses's law itself. Dr. WOTTON'S <i>Miscellaneous Discourses</i>, &amp;c., vol. i. p. 269.</p>
<p>The word δευτεροπρωτω, <i>the second first</i>, is omitted by BL, <i>four</i> others, <i>Syriac</i>, later <i>Arabic</i>, all the <i>Persic, Coptic, AEthiopic</i>, and <i>three</i> of the <i>Itala</i>. A note in the margin of the later <i>Syriac</i> says, <i>This is not in all copies</i>. The above MSS. read the verse thus: <i>It came to pass, that he walked through the corn fields on a</i> <i>Sabbath day</i>. I suppose they omitted the above word, because they found it difficult to fix the meaning, which has been too much the case in other instances.</p>
