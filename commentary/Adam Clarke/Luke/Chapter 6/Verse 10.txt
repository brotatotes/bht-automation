<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:10">Luke 6:10</span>. <i><b>Whole as the other.</b></i> — Many MSS., both here and in the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>, omit the word υγιης, <i>whole</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it out of the text.
