<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:11">Luke 6:11</span>. <i><b>They were filled with madness</b></i> â€” Pride, obstinacy, and interest, combined together, are capable of any thing. When men have once framed their <i>conscience</i> according to their <i>passions</i>, <i>madness</i> passes for <i>zeal</i>, the blackest conspiracies for pious designs, and the most horrid attempts for heroic actions. QUESNEL.</p>
