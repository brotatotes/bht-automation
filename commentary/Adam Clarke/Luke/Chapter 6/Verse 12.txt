<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span>. <i><b>In prayer to God.</b></i> — Or, <i>in the prayer of God</i>: or, <i>in</i> <i>the oratory of God</i>, εν τῃ προσευχῃ του Θεου. So this passage is translated by many critics; for which Dr. Whitby gives the following reasons: As the <i>mountain of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:1">Exodus 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:27">Exodus 4:27</span>; the <i>bread of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+21:17">Leviticus 21:17</span>; the <i>lamp of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+3:3">1 Samuel 3:3</span>; the <i>vessels of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+22:19">1 Chronicles 22:19</span>; the <i>altar of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+43:4">Psalms 43:4</span>; the <i>sacrifices of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:17">Psalms 51:17</span>; the <i>gifts of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:4">Luke 21:4</span>; the <i>ministers of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>; the <i>tabernacle of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+1:3">2 Chronicles 1:3</span>; the <i>temple of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>; the <i>synagogues of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+74:8">Psalms 74:8</span>; are all things <i>consecrated</i> or <i>appropriated</i> to God's service; so προσευχη του Θεου must, in all reason, be a <i>house of prayer to God</i>; whence it is called τοπος προσευχης, <i>a place of prayer</i>, 1 Mac. iii. 46; and so the word is certainly used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>; and by <i>Philo</i>, in his oration against <i>Flaccus</i>, where he complains that αιπροσευχαι, <i>their houses for prayer were pulled down</i>, and there was no place left in which they might worship God, or pray for Caesar; and by <i>Josephus</i>, who says the multitude was gathered εις της προσευχην, <i>into the house of prayer</i>: and so <i>Juvenal</i>, Sat. iii. v. 296, speaks to the mendicant Jew: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>In what house of prayer may I find thee begging?</i> </p>

<p>See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>. But on this it may be observed, that as the <i>mountains of God</i>, the <i>wind of God</i>, the <i>hail of God</i>, the <i>trees</i> <i>of God</i>, c., mean <i>very high</i> mountains, a <i>very strong</i> wind, <i>great and terrible</i> hail, <i>very tall</i> trees, c., so προσευχη του Θεου, here, may be very properly translated <i>the prayer of God</i> i.e. <i>very fervent and earnest prayer</i> and though διανυκτερευων may signify, <i>to lodge in a place for a night</i>, yet there are various places in the best Greek writers in which it is used, not to signify a <i>place</i>, but <i>to pass the night</i> in a particular <i>state</i>. So <i>Appian</i>, Bell. Pun. Εν τοις ὁπλοις διενυκτερευϚε μεθ' ἁπαντων - <i>He</i> <i>passed the night under arms with them all</i>. Idem, <i>Bell</i>. Civ. lib. v. διενυκτερευον - <i>They passed the night without food, without any</i> <i>regard to the body, and in the want of all things</i>. See more examples in <i>Kypke</i>, who concludes by translating the passage thus: <i>He passed the night without sleep in prayers to God</i>. Some of the Jews imagine that God himself prays; and this is one of his petitions: <i>Let it be my good pleasure, that my mercy overcome my</i> <i>wrath</i>. See more in <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
