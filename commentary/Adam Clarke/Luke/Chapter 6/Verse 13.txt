<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span>. <i><b>He chose twelve</b></i> — εκλεξαμενος απ αυτων, <i>He chose</i> <i>twelve OUT of them</i>. Our Lord at this time had several disciples, persons who were <i>converted</i> to God under his ministry; and, out of these converts, he chose twelve, whom he appointed to the work of the ministry; and called them <i>apostles</i>, i.e. persons <i>sent</i> or commissioned by himself, to preach that Gospel to others by which they had themselves been saved. These were favoured with extraordinary success:</p>
<p>1. Because they were brought to the knowledge of God themselves.</p>
<p>2. Because they received their commission from the great Head of the Church. And</p>
<p>3. Because, as <i>he</i> had sent them, he continued to accompany their preaching with the power of his Spirit.</p>
<p>These <i>three</i> things always unite in the character of a <i>genuine apostle</i>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:1-4">Matthew 10:1-4</span>.</p>
