<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:15">Luke 6:15</span>. <i><b>Called Zelotes</b></i> â€” Some Jews gave this name to themselves, according to <i>Josephus</i>, (War, b. iv. c. iii. s. 9, and vii. c. viii. s. 1,) "because they pretended to be more than ordinarily <i>zealous</i> for religion, and yet practised the very worst of actions." "But this (says the judicious Bp. Pearce) <i>Josephus</i> says of the <i>zealots</i>, at the time when <i>Vespasian</i> was marching towards Jerusalem. They probably were men of a different character above <i>forty</i> years before; which was the time when Jesus chose his twelve apostles, one of whom had the surname of the <i>Zealot</i>." It is very probable that this name was first given to certain persons who were more <i>zealous</i> for the cause of pure and undefiled religion than the rest of their neighbours; but like many other sects and parties who have <i>begun well</i>, they transferred their zeal for the <i>essentials</i> of religion to <i>nonessential</i> things, and from these to <i>inquisitorial</i> cruelty and murder.
