<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17">Luke 6:17</span>. <i><b>And stood in the plain</b></i> â€” In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>, which is supposed to be the parallel place, our Lord is represented as delivering this sermon <i>on the mountain</i>; and this has induced some to think that the sermon mentioned here by Luke, though the same in substance with that in Matthew, was delivered in a different place, and at another time; but, as Dr. Priestly justly observes, Matthew's saying that Jesus was <i>sat down</i> after he had gone up to the mountain, and Luke's saying that he <i>stood on the plain</i> when he healed the sick, before the discourse, are no inconsistencies. The whole picture is striking. Jesus ascends a mountain, employs the night in prayer; and, having thus solemnly invoked the Divine blessing, authoritatively separates the twelve apostles from the mass of his disciples. He then descends, and heals in the plain all the diseased among a great multitude, collected from various parts by the fame of his miraculous power. Having thus created attention, he likewise satisfies the desire of the people to hear his doctrine; and retiring first to the mountain whence he came, that his attentive hearers might follow him and might better arrange themselves before him - <i>Sacro digna silentio mirantur omnes</i> <i>dicere</i>. HORACE. <i>All admire his excellent sayings with sacred</i> <i>silence</i>. See Bishop Newcome's notes on his Harmony of the Gospels, p. 19.</p>
