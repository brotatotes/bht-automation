<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:22">Luke 6:22</span>. <i><b>They shall separate you</b></i> — Meaning, They will excommunicate you, αφορισωσινυμας, or <i>separate you</i> from their <i>communion</i>. Luke having spoken of their separating or excommunicating them, continues the same idea, in saying that they would cast out their <i>name</i> likewise, as a thing evil in itself. By <i>your name</i> is meant their name as his disciples. As such, they were sometimes called <i>Nazarenes</i>, and sometimes <i>Christians</i>; and both these names were matter of reproach in the mouths of their enemies. So James (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:7">James 2:7</span>) says to the converts, <i>Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called</i>? So when St. Paul (in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span>) is called a <i>ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes</i>, the character of a <i>pestilent fellow</i>, and, that of a <i>mover of sedition</i>, is joined to it; and, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:22">Acts 28:22</span>, the Jews say to Paul, <i>As concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken</i> <i>against</i>; and this is implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:14">1 Peter 4:14</span>, when he says, <i>If ye be reproached for the NAME of Christ</i>, i.e. as <i>Christians</i>; agreeably to what follows there in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span>, <i>If any man suffer as a Christian</i>, &amp;c. In after times we find <i>Pliny</i>, Epist. x. 97, consulting the Emperor <i>Trajan</i>, whether or no he should <i>PUNISH the NAME ITSELF</i>, (of <i>Christian</i>,) <i>though no</i> <i>evil should be found in it</i>. <i>NOMEN IPSUM, etiam si flagitiis</i> <i>careat, PUNIATUR</i>. See PEARCE.</p>
