<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Thy cloak - thy coat</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>, I have said that COAT, χιτωνα, signifies <i>under garment</i>, or <i>strait coat</i>; and CLOAK, ιματιον, means <i>upper garment</i>, or <i>great coat</i>. This interpretation is confirmed by the following observations of Bishop Pearce. The χιτων was a <i>tunica</i>, or <i>vestcoat</i>, over which the Jews and other nations threw an <i>outer coat</i>, or <i>gown</i>, called a <i>cloak</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>, (which is meant by ιματιον,) when they went abroad, or were not at work. Hence the common people at Rome, who did not usually wear, or had no right to wear, the <i>toga</i>, are called by Horace <i>tunicatus popellus</i>, Epist. i. 7, 65. This account of the difference between the χιτων and the ιματιον appears plainly from what <i>Maximus Tyrius</i> says, <i>The</i> <i>inner garment which is over the body they call</i> χιτωνισκον, <i>and the</i> <i>outer one the</i> ιματιον. And so <i>Plutarch</i>, (in NUPT. p. 139, ed. Fran. 1620,) speaking of a man who felt the heat of the sun too much for him, says that <i>he put off</i>, τον χιτωνα, τῳ ἰματιῳ, <i>his</i> <i>vestcoat also with his cloak</i>.</p>
