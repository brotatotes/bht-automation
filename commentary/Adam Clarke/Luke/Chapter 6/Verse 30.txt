Verse 30. Ask them not again. â€” Or, Do not beg them off. This probably refers to the way in which the tax-gatherers and Roman soldiers used to spoil the people. "When such harpies as these come upon your goods, suffer the injury quietly, leaving yourselves in the hand of God, rather than attempt even to beg off what belongs to you, lest on their part they be provoked to seize or spoil more, and lest you be irritated to sue them at law, which is totally opposite to the spirit and letter of the Gospel; or to speak bad words, or indulge wrong tempers, which would wound the spirit of love and mercy." Of such as these, and of all merciless creditors, who even sell the tools and bed of a poor man, it may be very truly said: -  VIRG. AEn. iii. ver. 214  "Monsters more fierce offended heaven ne'er sent From hell's abyss, for human punishment: - They snatch the meat, defiling all they find." DRYDEN. However, it is probable that what is here spoken relates to requiring a thing speedily that had been lent, while the reason for borrowing it still continues. In Ecclus. 20:15, it is a part of the character of a very bad man, that to-day he lendeth, and tomorrow will he ask it again. From Luke 6:27 to Luke 6:30 our blessed Lord gives us directions how to treat our enemies.  1. Wish them well.  2. Do them good.  3. Speak as well of them as possible.  4. Be an instrument of procuring them good from others; use your influence in their behalf.  5. Suffer patiently from them contempt and ill treatment.  6. Give up your goods rather than lose your meekness and charity towards them. The retaliation of those who hearken not to their own passion, but to Christ, consists in doing more good than they receive evil. Ever since our blessed Saviour suffered the Jews to take away his life, it is by his patience that we must regulate our own. Quesnel.
