<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Ask them not again.</b></i> â€” Or, <i>Do not beg them off</i>. This probably refers to the way in which the tax-gatherers and Roman soldiers used to spoil the people. "When such harpies as these come upon your goods, suffer the injury quietly, leaving yourselves in the hand of God, rather than attempt even to beg off what belongs to you, lest on their part they be provoked to seize or spoil more, and lest you be irritated to sue them at law, which is totally opposite to the spirit and letter of the Gospel; or to speak bad words, or indulge wrong tempers, which would wound the spirit of love and mercy." Of such as these, and of all <i>merciless</i> <i>creditors</i>, who even sell the <i>tools</i> and <i>bed</i> of a poor man, it may be very truly said: - </p>

<p>However, it is probable that what is here spoken relates to <i>requiring</i> a thing <i>speedily</i> that had been <i>lent</i>, while the <i>reason</i> for <i>borrowing</i> it still continues. In Ecclus. 20:15, it is a part of the character of a very bad man, <i>that to-day he lendeth, and</i> <i>tomorrow will he ask it again</i>.

<p>The retaliation of those who hearken not to their own passion, but to Christ, consists in doing <i>more</i> good than they receive evil. Ever since our blessed Saviour suffered the Jews to take away his life, it is by his <i>patience</i> that we must regulate our own. <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
