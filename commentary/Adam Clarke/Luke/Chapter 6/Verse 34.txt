<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Of whom ye hope to receive</b></i> â€” Or, <i>whom ye expect to</i> <i>return it</i>. "To make our neighbour purchase, <i>in any way</i>, the assistance which we give him, is to profit by his misery; and, by laying him under <i>obligations</i> which we expect him in <i>some way</i> or <i>other</i> to discharge, we increase his wretchedness under the pretence of relieving it."</p>
