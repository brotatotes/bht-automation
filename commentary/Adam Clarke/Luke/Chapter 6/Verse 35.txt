<p>Verse 35. <i><b>Love ye your enemies</b></i> — This is the most sublime precept ever delivered to man: a false religion durst not give a precept of this nature, because, without <i>supernatural</i> influence, it must be for ever impracticable. In these words of our blessed Lord we see the tenderness, sincerity, extent, disinterestedness, pattern, and issue of the love of God dwelling in man: a religion which has for its foundation the union of God and man in the same person, and the death of this august being for his enemies; which consists on earth in a reconciliation of the Creator with his creatures, and which is to subsist in heaven only in the union of the members with the head: could such a religion as this ever tolerate hatred in the soul of man, even to his most inveterate foe?</p>
<p><i><b>Lend, hoping for nothing again</b></i> — μηδεν απελπιζοντες. The rabbins say, he who lends without <i>usury</i>, God shall consider him as having observed every precept. Bishop Pearce thinks that, instead of μηδεν we should read μηδενα with the <i>Syriac</i>, later <i>Arabic</i>, and later <i>Persic</i>; and as απελπιζειν signifies <i>to despair</i>, or <i>cause to despair</i>, the meaning is, <i>not cutting off the hope</i> (of longer life) <i>of any man, neminis spem amputantes</i>, by denying him those things which he requests now to preserve him from perishing.</p>
