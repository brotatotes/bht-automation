<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Be ye therefore merciful</b></i> — Or, <i>compassionate</i>; οικτιρμινες, from οικτος, <i>commiseration</i>, which etymologists derive from εικω to <i>give place, yield</i>, because we readily <i>concede</i> those things which are necessary to them whom we commiserate. As God is ever <i>disposed</i> to give all necessary help and support to those who are miserable, so his followers, being influenced by the same spirit, are <i>easy</i> to be entreated, and are at all times <i>ready</i> to contribute to the uttermost of their power to relieve or remove the miseries of the distressed. A merciful or compassionate man <i>easily</i> forgets injuries; <i>pardons</i> them without being <i>solicited</i>; and does not permit repeated returns of ingratitude to deter him from <i>doing good</i>, even to the unthankful and the unholy. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:7">Matthew 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:7">Matthew 5:7</span></span>.</p>
