<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Judge not</b></i> — <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1">Matthew 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1">Matthew 7:1</span></span>. "How great is the goodness of God, in being so willing to put our judgment into our own hands as to engage himself not to enter into judgment with us, provided we do not usurp the right which belongs solely to him in reference to others!"</p>
<p><i><b>Condemn not</b></i> — "Mercy will ever incline us not to condemn those unmercifully whose faults are certain and visible; to lessen, conceal, and excuse them as much as we can without prejudice to truth and justice; and to be far from aggravating, divulging, or even desiring them to be punished."</p>
<p><i><b>Forgive</b></i> — The mercy and compassion which God recommends extend to the <i>forgiving</i> of all the injuries we have received, or can receive. To imitate in this the mercy of God is not a mere counsel; since it is proposed as a necessary mean, in order to receive mercy. What man has to forgive in man is almost <i>nothing</i>: man's debt to God is <i>infinite</i>. And who acts in this matter as if he wished to receive mercy at the hand of God! The spirit of revenge is equally destitute of <i>faith</i> and <i>reason</i>.</p>
