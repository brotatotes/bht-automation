<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Can the blind lead the blind?</b></i> â€” This appears to have been a general proverb, and to signify that a man cannot teach what he does not understand. This is strictly true in spiritual matters. A man who is not illuminated from above is utterly incapable of judging concerning spiritual things, and wholly unfit to be a <i>guide</i> to others. Is it possible that a person who is enveloped with the thickest darkness should dare either to <i>judge</i> of the state of others, or attempt to <i>lead</i> them in that path of which he is totally ignorant! If he do, must not his judgment be rashness, and his teaching folly? - and does he not endanger his own soul, and run the risk of falling into the ditch of perdition himself, together with the unhappy objects of his religious instruction?</p>
