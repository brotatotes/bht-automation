<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:4">Luke 6:4</span>. After this verse, the <i>Codex Bezae</i> and <i>two</i> ancient MSS. quoted by <i>Wechel</i>, have the following extraordinary addition:</p>
<p>Τῃ αυτῃ ἡμερᾳ θεασαμενος τινα εργαζομενον τῳ σαββατῳ, ειπεν αυτῳ, Ανθρωπε, ει μεν οιδας τι ποιεις μακαριος ει; ει δε μη οιδας επικαταρατος, και παραβατης ειτου νομου.</p>
<p><i>On the same day, seeing one working on</i> <i>the Sabbath, he said unto him, Man, if indeed thou knowest what</i> <i>thou dost, blessed art thou; but if thou knowest not, thou art</i> <i>cursed, and art a transgressor of the law</i>. Whence this strange addition proceeded, it is hard to tell. The meaning seems to be this: If thou now workest on the Jewish Sabbath, from a conviction that that Sabbath is abolished, and a new one instituted in its place, then <i>happy art thou</i>, for thou hast got Divine instruction in the nature of the Messiah's kingdom; but if thou doest this through a contempt for the law of God, then <i>thou art accursed</i>, forasmuch as thou art a transgressor of the law. The <i>Itala</i> version of the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, for παραβατης, <i>transgressor</i>, has this semi-barbaric word, <i>trabaricator</i>.</p>
