<p>Verse 40. <i><b>Every one that is perfect</b></i> — Or, <i>thoroughly instructed</i>, κατηρτισμενος: - from καταρτιζω, to <i>adjust, adapt, knit together,</i> <i>restore</i>, or <i>put in joint</i>. The noun is used by the Greek medical writers to signify the reducing a luxated or disjointed limb. It sometimes signifies to <i>repair</i> or <i>mend</i>, and in this sense it is applied to <i>broken nets</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:21">Matthew 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:19">Mark 1:19</span>; but in this place, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:21">Hebrews 13:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:17">2 Timothy 3:17</span>, it means <i>complete instruction</i> and <i>information</i>. Every one who is <i>thoroughly instructed</i> in Divine things, who has his heart <i>united</i> to God, whose <i>disordered</i> tempers and passions are purified and <i>restored</i> to <i>harmony</i> and <i>order</i>; every one who has in him the mind that was in Christ, though he cannot be <i>above</i>, yet will be <i>as</i>, his teacher - holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.</p>
<p>"The disciple who perfectly understands the rules and sees the example of his master, will think it his business to tread exactly in his steps, to do and suffer upon like occasions, as his master did: and so he will be like his master." WHITBY.</p>
