<p>Verse 46. <i><b>Lord, Lord</b></i> â€” God judges of the heart, not by <i>words</i>, but by <i>works</i>. A good servant never disputes, speaks little, and always follows his work. Such a servant a real Christian is: such is a faithful minister, always intent either on the work of his own salvation, or that of his neighbour; speaking more to God than to men; and to these as in the presence of God. The tongue is fitly compared by one to a <i>pump</i>, which empties the heart, but neither <i>fills</i> nor <i>cleanses</i> it. The love of God is a hidden spring, which supplies the heart continually, and never permits it to be dry or unfruitful. <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
