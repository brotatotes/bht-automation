Verse Luke 6:7. Watched him — Παρετηρουν αυτον, They maliciously watched him. This is the import of the word, Luke 14:1; Luke 20:20, and in the parallel place, Mark 3:2. See Raphelius on the last-quoted text, who has proved, by several quotations, that this is the proper meaning of the term.An accusation against him. — Instead of κατηγοριαν αυτον, his accusation, several eminent MSS. and versions add κατα, against, which I find our translators have adopted.
