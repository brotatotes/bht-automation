<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:7">Luke 6:7</span>. <i><b>Watched him</b></i> — Παρετηρουν αυτον, <i>They maliciously watched him</i>. This is the import of the word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:1">Luke 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:20">Luke 20:20</span>, and in the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:2">Mark 3:2</span>. See <i>Raphelius</i> on the last-quoted text, who has proved, by several quotations, that this is the proper meaning of the term.</p>
<p><i><b>An accusation against him.</b></i> — Instead of κατηγοριαν αυτον, <i>his</i> <i>accusation</i>, several eminent MSS. and versions add κατα, <i>against</i>, which I find our translators have adopted.</p>
