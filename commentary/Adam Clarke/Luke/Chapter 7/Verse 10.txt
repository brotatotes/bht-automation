<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:10">Luke 7:10</span>. <i><b>Found the servant whole</b></i> â€” This cure was the effect of the <i>faith, prayer</i>, and <i>humility</i> of the centurion, through which the almighty energy of Jesus Christ was conveyed to the sick man. But these very graces in the centurion were the products of grace. It is God himself who, by the gifts of his mercy, disposes the soul to receive its cure; and nothing can contribute to the reception of his grace but what is the fruit of grace itself. The apostle says, <i>The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath</i> <i>appeared unto all men</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>. It should therefore be our concern, not to resist the operations of this grace: for though we cannot endue ourselves with by gracious disposition, yet we can quench the Spirit, by whose agency these are produced in the soul. The centurion had not received the grace of God in vain.</p>
