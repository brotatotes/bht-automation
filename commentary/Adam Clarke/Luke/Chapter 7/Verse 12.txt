<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:12">Luke 7:12</span>. <i><b>Carried out</b></i> â€” The Jews always buried their dead <i>without</i> the city, except those of the family of David. No burying places should be tolerated <i>within</i> cities or towns; much less in or about <i>churches</i> and <i>chapels</i>. This custom is excessively injurious to the inhabitants; and especially to those who frequent public worship in such chapels and churches. God, decency, and health forbid this shocking abomination.</p>
<p>On the impropriety of burying in towns, churches, and chapels, take the following testimonies: <i>Extra urbem soliti sunt alii</i> <i>mortuos sepelire: Nos Christiani, eos non in urbes solum, sed et</i> <i>in TEMPLA recepimus, quo fit ut multi faetore nimis, fere </i> <i>exanimentur.</i> SCHOETTGEN. "Others were accustomed to bury their dead <i>without</i> the city. We Christians not only bury them <i>within</i> our cities, but receive them even into our <i>churches</i>! Hence many nearly lose their lives through the noxious effluvia." "Both the Jews and other people had their burying places without the city: - <i>Et certe</i> <i>ita postulat ratio publicae sanitatis, quae multum laedi solet</i> <i>aura sepulchrorum</i>: - and this the health of the public requires, which is greatly injured by the effluvia from graves." - <i>Rosenmuller</i>. From long observation I can attest that churches and chapels situated in grave-yards, and those especially within whose walls the dead are interred, are perfectly unwholesome; and many, by attending such places, are shortening their passage to the house appointed for the living. What increases the iniquity of this abominable and deadly work is, that the burying grounds attached to many churches and chapels are made a source of <i>private gain</i>. The whole of this preposterous conduct is as <i>indecorous</i> and <i>unhealthy</i> as it is <i>profane</i>. Every man should know that the <i>gas</i> which is disengaged from putrid flesh, and particularly from a human body, is not only unfriendly to, but destructive of, animal life. Superstition first introduced a practice which self-interest and covetousness continue to maintain.</p>
