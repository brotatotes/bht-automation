<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:16">Luke 7:16</span>. <i><b>God hath visited his people.</b></i> — Several MSS. and versions add, εις αγαθον, <i>for good</i>. Sometimes God visited his people in the way of judgment, to consume them in their transgressions; but it was now plain that he had visited them in the most tender compassion and mercy. This seems to have been added by some ancient copyist, by way of explanation.</p>
