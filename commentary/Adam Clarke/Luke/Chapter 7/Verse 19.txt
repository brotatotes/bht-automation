<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:19">Luke 7:19</span>. <i><b>Art thou he that should come?</b></i> — That is, <i>to save</i>. Art thou the promised Messiah? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:3">Matthew 11:3</span>.</p>
<p>Some have thought that this character of our Lord, ο ερχομενος, <i>he who cometh</i>, refers to the prophecy of Jacob, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>, where he is called שילה <i>Shiloh</i>, which <i>Grotius</i> and others derive from שלה <i>shalach, he sent</i>: hence, as the time of the fulfilment of the prophecy drew nigh, he was termed, <i>He who cometh</i>, i.e. he who is just now ready to make his appearance in Judea. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span>, a similar phrase is used, <i>Behold, thy king COMETH unto thee-having</i> <i>SALVATION</i>. This is meant of the Messiah only; therefore I think the words <i>to save</i>, are necessarily implied.</p>
