Verse Luke 7:19. Art thou he that should come? — That is, to save. Art thou the promised Messiah? Matthew 11:3.Some have thought that this character of our Lord, ο ερχομενος, he who cometh, refers to the prophecy of Jacob, Genesis 49:10, where he is called שילה Shiloh, which Grotius and others derive from שלה shalach, he sent: hence, as the time of the fulfilment of the prophecy drew nigh, he was termed, He who cometh, i.e. he who is just now ready to make his appearance in Judea. In Zechariah 9:9, a similar phrase is used, Behold, thy king COMETH unto thee-having SALVATION. This is meant of the Messiah only; therefore I think the words to save, are necessarily implied.
