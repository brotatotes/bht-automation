<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:21">Luke 7:21</span>. <i><b>Infirmities and plagues</b></i> — The following judicious note from Bp. PEARCE is worthy of deep attention: "Luke mentions here νοσοι, μαϚιγες, <i>leprosias</i>, and πνευματα πονηρα, i.e. diseases or ill habits of body, sores or lamenesses, and evil spirits: from whence we may conclude that <i>evil spirits</i> are reckoned by him (who speaks of distempers with more accuracy than the other evangelists) as things <i>different</i> from any disorders of the <i>body</i>, included in the two former words."</p>
<p><i><b>Unto many</b></i><b> that were </b><i><b>blind he gave light.</b></i> — Rather, <i>he kindly gave</i> <i>sight </i>- εχαρισατο το βλεπειν; or, <i>he graciously gave sight</i>. This is the proper meaning of the original words. In all his miracles, Jesus showed the tenderest mercy and kindness: not only the <i>cure</i>, but the <i>manner</i> in which he performed it, endeared him to those who were objects of his compassionate regards.</p>
