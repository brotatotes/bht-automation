<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Justified God</b></i> — Or, <i>declared God to be just </i>- εδικαιωσαν τον Θεον. The sense is this: John preached that the Divine wrath was coming upon the Jews, from which they might flee by repentance, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span>. The Jews, therefore, who were baptized by him, with the baptism of repentance, did thereby acknowledge that it is but <i>justice</i> in God to punish them for their wickedness unless they repented, and were baptized in token of it. Bp. PEARCE proves that this is the sense in which the word δικαιοω is used here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:4">Psalms 51:4</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+32:2">Job 32:2</span>, and by this evangelist again in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:29">Luke 10:29</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15">Luke 16:15</span>.</p>
