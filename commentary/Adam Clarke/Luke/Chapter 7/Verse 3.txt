<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:3">Luke 7:3</span>. <i><b>Elders of the Jews</b></i> â€” These were either <i>magistrates</i> in the place, or the <i>elders</i> of the <i>synagogue</i> which the centurion had built, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:5">Luke 7:5</span>. He sent these, probably, because he was afraid to come to Christ himself, not being a Jew, either by nation or religion. In the parallel place in Matthew, he is represented as coming to Christ himself; but it is a usual form of speech in all nations, to attribute the act to a person which is done not by himself, but by his <i>authority</i>.</p>
