<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Rejected the counsel of God</b></i> — Or, <i>frustrated the will </i> <i>of God </i>- την βουλην του Θεου ηθετησαν. <i>Kypke</i> says the verb αθετειν has two meanings: - 1, to <i>disbelieve</i>; 2, <i>despise</i>, or <i>disobey</i>: and that both senses may be properly conjoined here. The will of God was that all the inhabitants of Judea should <i>repent</i> at the preaching of John, be <i>baptized</i>, and <i>believe</i> in Christ Jesus. Now as they did <i>not repent</i>, &amp;c., at John's preaching, so they did <i>not believe</i> his testimony concerning Christ: thus the <i>will</i>, gracious <i>counsel</i>, or <i>design</i> of God, relative to their salvation, was <i>annulled</i> or <i>frustrated</i>. They <i>disbelieved</i> his promises, <i>despised</i> the Messiah, and <i>disobeyed</i> his precepts.</p>
