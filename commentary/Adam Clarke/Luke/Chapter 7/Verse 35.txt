Verse 35. Wisdom is justified, c.] Probably the children of wisdom is a mere Hebraism here for the products or fruits of wisdom hence the Vatican MS., one other, and some versions, have εργων, works, instead of τεκνων, sons, in the parallel place, Matthew 11:19. True wisdom shows itself by its works; folly is never found in the wise man's way, any more than wisdom is in the path of a fool. Theophylact's note on this place should not be overlooked. Εδικαιωθη, τουτ' εστιν ετιμηθη, Wisdom IS JUSTIFIED, that is, IS HONOURED, by all her children.
