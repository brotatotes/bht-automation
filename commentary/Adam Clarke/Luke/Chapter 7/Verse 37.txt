<p>Verse 37. <i><b>A woman - which was a sinner</b></i> — Many suppose that this woman had been a <i>notorious public prostitute</i>; but this is taking the subject by the very <i>worst</i> handle. My own opinion is, that she had been a <i>mere heathen</i> who dwelt in this city, (probably Capernaum,) who, through the ministry of Christ, had been before this converted to God, and came now to give this public testimony of her gratitude to her gracious deliverer from the darkness and guilt of sin. I am inclined to think that the original word, αμαρτωλος, is used for <i>heathen</i> or <i>Gentile</i> in several places of the sacred writings. I am fully persuaded that this is its meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:10-11">Matthew 9:10-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:45">Matthew 26:45</span>. <i>The Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners</i>, i.e. is delivered into the hands of the <i>heathens</i>, viz. the <i>Romans</i>, who alone could put him to death. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:15-17">Mark 2:15-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:41">Mark 14:41</span>. I think also it has this meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:32-34">Luke 6:32-34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:1-2">Luke 15:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:7">Luke 15:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10">Luke 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:7">Luke 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:31">John 9:31</span>. I think no other sense can be justly assigned to it in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:15">Galatians 2:15</span>: <i>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles</i>. We Jews, who have had the benefit of a <i>Divine revelation, know that a</i> <i>man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of</i> <i>Christ</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>), which other <i>nations</i>, who were <i>heathens</i>, not having a Divine <i>revelation</i>, could not know. It is, I think, likely that the grand subject of the self-righteous Pharisee's <i>complaint</i> was her being a <i>heathen</i>. As those who were <i>touched</i> by such contracted a legal defilement, he could not believe that Christ was a conscientious observer of the law, seeing he permitted her to touch him, <i>knowing</i> who she was; or, if he did not <i>know</i> that she was a <i>heathen</i>, it was a proof that he was no prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:39">Luke 7:39</span>, and consequently had not the discernment of spirits which prophets were supposed to possess. As the Jews had a law which forbade all iniquity, and they who embraced it being according to its requisitions and their profession <i>saints</i>; and as the Gentiles had no law to restrain <i>evil</i>, nor made any profession of <i>holiness</i>, the term αμαρτωλοι, or <i>sinners</i>, was first with peculiar propriety applied to <i>them</i>, and afterwards to all others, who, though they professed to be under the law, yet lived as Gentiles <i>without</i> the law. Many suppose this person to be the same as Mary Magdalene, but of this there is no solid proof.</p>
