<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Stood at his feet behind him</b></i> — In taking their meals, the eastern people reclined on one side; the loins and knees being bent to make the more room, the feet of each person were turned outwards behind him. This is the meaning of <i>standing BEHIND at his</i> <i>FEET</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Began to wash his feet with tears</b></i> — Ηρξατο βρεχειν - τοις δακρυσι, She began to water his feet - to let a <i>shower</i> of <i>tears</i> fall on them. As the Jews wore nothing like our <i>shoes</i>, (theirs being a mere <i>sole</i>, bound about the foot and ancle with thongs,) their feet being so much exposed had frequent need of washing, and this they ordinarily did before taking their meals.</p>
<p><i><b>Kissed his feet</b></i> — With <i>affectionate tenderness</i>, κατεφιλει, or kissed them <i>again</i> and <i>again</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:49">Matthew 26:49</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>kiss</i> was used in ancient times as the emblem of <i>love,</i> <i>religious reverence, subjection</i>, and <i>supplication</i>. It has the meaning of <i>supplication</i>, in the way of <i>adoration</i>, accompanied with <i>subjection</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:18">1 Kings 19:18</span>, <i>Whose mouths have not kissed Baal</i>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+31:27">Job 31:27</span>, <i>My mouth hath not kissed my hand</i>; I have paid no sort of <i>adoration</i> to <i>false gods</i>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:12">Psalms 2:12</span>, <i>Kiss the Son lest he be angry</i>,-close in with him, embrace affectionately, the offers of mercy made unto you through Christ Jesus, <i>lest he</i> (the Lord) <i>be angry with you, and ye perish</i>: which commandment this woman seems to have obeyed, both in the <i>literal</i> and <i>spiritual</i> sense. <i>Kissing the feet</i> was practised also among the <i>heathens</i>, to express <i>subjection</i> of <i>spirit</i>, and <i>earnest</i> <i>supplication</i>. See a long example in <i>Raphelius</i>, produced from <i>Polybius</i>, concerning the <i>Carthaginian</i> ambassadors when supplicating the <i>Romans</i> for peace. With an <i>humble and abject mind</i>, πεσοντες επι την γην, <i>they fell down on the earth</i>, τους ποδας καταφιλοιεν τῳ συνεδριῳ, <i>and kissed the feet of the council</i>. See also several examples in <i>Kypke</i>. Kissing the feet is a farther proof that this person had been educated a <i>heathen</i>. This was no part of a Jew's practice.</p>
