<p>Verse 41. <i><b>A certain creditor</b></i>, c.] It is plain that in this parable our Lord means, by the <i>creditor</i>, GOD, and, by the <i>two</i> <i>debtors, Simon</i> and the <i>woman</i> who was present. <i>Simon</i>, who had the light of the <i>law</i>, and who, in consequence of his profession as a <i>Pharisee</i>, was obliged to abstain from <i>outward</i> iniquity, might be considered as the <i>debtor</i> who owed only <i>fifty pence</i>, or <i>denarii</i>. The woman, whom I have supposed to be a <i>heathen</i>, not having these advantages, having no <i>rule</i> to regulate her actions, and no <i>curb</i> on her evil propensities, may be considered as the debtor who owed <i>five hundred pence</i>, or <i>denarii</i>. And when both were compared, <i>Simon's</i> debt to God might be considered, in reference to <i>hers</i>, as <i>fifty</i> to <i>five hundred</i>. However, we find, notwithstanding this great disparity, <i>both</i> were <i>insolvent</i>. Simon, the religious Pharisee, could no more pay his <i>fifty</i> to God than this poor <i>heathen</i> her <i>five hundred</i> and, if both be not <i>freely forgiven</i> by the Divine mercy, both must finally perish. <i>Having NOTHING to PAY,</i> <i>he kindly FORGAVE them both</i>. Some think that this very Simon was no inconsiderable debtor to our Lord, as having been mercifully cleansed from a <i>leprosy</i>; for he is supposed to be the same as <i>Simon the leper</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</span></span>.</p>
