Verse 44. Thou gavest me no water â€” In this respect Simon was sadly deficient in civil respect, whether this proceeded from forgetfulness or contempt. The custom of giving water to wash the guest's feet was very ancient. See instances in Genesis 18:4; Genesis 24:32; Judges 19:21; 1 Samuel 25:41. In Hindoostan it is the custom, that when a superior enters the house of an inferior, the latter washes his feet, and gives him water to rinse his mouth before he eats. See AYEEN AKBERY, vol. iii. p. 226.
