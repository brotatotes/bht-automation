<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Thou gavest me no water</b></i> â€” In this respect Simon was sadly deficient in <i>civil</i> respect, whether this proceeded from <i>forgetfulness</i> or <i>contempt</i>. The custom of giving water to wash the guest's feet was very ancient. See instances in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:4">Genesis 18:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:32">Genesis 24:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+19:21">Judges 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+25:41">1 Samuel 25:41</span>. In Hindoostan it is the custom, that when a superior enters the house of an inferior, the latter <i>washes his feet</i>, and gives him water to rinse his mouth before he eats. See AYEEN AKBERY, vol. iii. p. 226.</p>
