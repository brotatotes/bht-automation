Verse 45. Since the time I came in — Rather, Since the time SHE came in, αφ' ἡς εισηλθεν, not εισηλθον, I came in, for it is clear from Luke 7:37 that the woman came in after Christ, having heard that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's house. The reading which I have adopted is supported by several MSS. and Versions.
