<p>Verse 45. <i><b>Since the time I came in</b></i> — Rather, <i>Since the time SHE</i> <i>came in</i>, αφ' ἡς εισηλθεν, not εισηλθον, I <i>came in</i>, for it is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37">Luke 7:37</span> that the woman came in <i>after</i> Christ, having heard that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's house. The reading which I have adopted is supported by several MSS. and <i>Versions</i>.</p>
