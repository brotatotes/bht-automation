Verse 46. My head with oil thou didst not anoint â€” Anointing the head with oil was as common among the Jews as washing the face with water is among us. See Ruth 3:3; 2 Samuel 12:20; 2 Samuel 14:2; 2 Kings 4:2; and Psalms 23:5, where the author alludes to the Jewish manner of receiving and entertaining a guest. Thou preparest a table for me; anointest my head with oil; givest me an overflowing cup. See Matthew 5:17.
