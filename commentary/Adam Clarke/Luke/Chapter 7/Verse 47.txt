<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:47">Luke 7:47</span>. <i><b>For she loved much</b></i> — Or, <i>THEREFORE she loved much</i>. It appears to have been a consciousness of God's forgiving love that brought her at this time to the Pharisee's house. In the common translation her forgiveness is represented to be the <i>consequence</i> of her loving much, which is causing the <i>tree</i> to produce the <i>root</i>, and not the <i>root</i> the <i>tree</i>. I have considered οτι here as having the sense of διοτι, <i>therefore</i>; because, to make this sentence suit with the foregoing parable, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:42-43">Luke 7:42-43</span>, and with what immediately follows here, <i>but he to whom little is forgiven loveth</i> <i>little</i>, we must suppose her love was the <i>effect</i> of her being pardoned, not the <i>cause</i> of it. οτι seems to have the sense of <i>therefore</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:13">Matthew 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:17">1 Corinthians 10:17</span>; and in the Septuagint, in <i>De 33:52</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:19">Isaiah 49:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+9:15">Hosea 9:15</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:6">Ecclesiastes 5:6</span>. Both these particles are often interchanged in the New Testament.</p>
<p><i><b>Loved much - loveth little</b></i> — That is, A man's love to God will be in proportion to the <i>obligations</i> he <i>feels</i> himself under to the bounty of his Maker.</p>
