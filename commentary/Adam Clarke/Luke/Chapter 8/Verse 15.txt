<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>. <i><b>With patience.</b></i> — Rather, <i>with perseverance</i>. The Greek word υπομονη, which our translators render <i>patience</i>, properly signifies here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</span>, <i>perseverance</i>. The <i>good ground</i>, because it is <i>good</i>, strong and vigorous, <i>continues</i> to bear: <i>bad</i> or <i>poor</i> ground cannot produce a good crop, and besides it is very soon exhausted. The persons called the <i>good ground</i> in the text are filled with the power and influence of God, and therefore <i>continue</i> to bring forth fruit; i.e. they persevere in righteousness. From this we may learn that the <i>perseverance of the saints</i>, as it is termed, necessarily implies that they continue to bring forth fruit to the glory of God. Those who are not fruitful are not in a state of perseverance.</p>
