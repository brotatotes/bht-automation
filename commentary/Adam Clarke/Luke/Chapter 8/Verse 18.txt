<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>. <i><b>Even that which he seemeth to have.</b></i> — Or rather, <i>even</i> <i>what he hath</i>. ο δοκει εχειν, rendered by our common version, <i>what</i> <i>he seemeth to have</i>, seems to me to contradict itself. Let us examine this subject a little.</p>
<p>1. To <i>seem</i> to have a thing, is only to have it in <i>appearance</i>, and not in <i>reality</i>; but what is possessed in <i>appearance</i> only can only be taken away in <i>appearance</i>; therefore on the one side there is no <i>gain</i>, and on the other side no <i>loss</i>. On this ground, the text speaks just nothing.</p>
<p>2. It is evident that ο δοκει εχειν, <i>what he seemeth to have</i>, here, is equivalent to οεχει, <i>what he hath</i>, in the parallel places, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:25">Mark 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:12">Matthew 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:29">Matthew 25:29</span>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:26">Luke 19:26</span>.</p>
<p>3. It is evident, also, that these persons had <i>something</i> which might be <i>taken away</i> from them. For 1. The <i>word of God</i>, the Divine <i>seed</i>, was planted in their hearts. 2. It had already produced some good effects; but they permitted the devil, the cares of the world, the desire of riches, and the love of pleasure, to destroy its produce.</p>
<p>4. The word δοκειν is often an <i>expletive</i>: so <i>Xenophon</i> in <i>Hellen</i>, vi. ὁτι εδοκει πατικος φιλος αυτοις, <i>Because he seemed</i> <i>to be</i> (i.e. WAS) <i>their father's friend</i>. So in his OEeon. <i>Among the</i> <i>cities that seemed to be</i> (δοκουσαις, actually were) <i>at war</i>. So <i>Athenaeus</i>, lib. vi. chap. 4. <i>They who seemed to be</i> (δοκουντες, who really were) <i>the most opulent, drank out of brazen cups</i>.</p>
<p>5. It often <i>strengthens</i> the sense, and is thus used by the very best Greek writers. ULPIAN, in one of his notes on Demosthenes' <i>Orat. Olinth</i>. 1, quoted by Bishop PEARCE, says expressly, το δοκειν ου παντως επι αμφιβολου ταττουσιν οἱ παλαιοι, αλλα πολλακις και επι του αληθευειν. The <i>word</i> δοκειν is used by the <i>ancients</i> <i>to express, not always what is doubtful, but oftentimes what is</i> <i>true and certain</i>. And this is manifestly its meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24">Luke 22:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40">1 Corinthians 7:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:12">1 Corinthians 10:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:16">1 Corinthians 11:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:4">Philippians 3:4</span>; and in the text. See these meanings of the word established beyond the possibility of successful contradiction, in Bishop PEARCE'S notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:42">Mark 10:42</span>, and in KYPKE <i>in loc</i>.
