<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:2">Luke 8:2</span>. <i><b>Out of whom went seven devils</b></i> â€”. Who had been possessed in a most extraordinary manner; probably a case of inveterate lunacy, brought on by the influence of evil spirits. The number <i>seven</i> may here express the superlative degree.</p>
<p><i>Mary Magdalene</i> is commonly thought to have been a <i>prostitute</i> before she came to the knowledge of Christ, and then to have been a remarkable penitent. So <i>historians</i> and <i>painters</i> represent her: but neither from this passage, nor from any other of the New Testament, can such a supposition be legitimately drawn. She is here represented as one who had been possessed with <i>seven demons</i>; and as one among other women who had been healed by Christ of <i>evil</i> (or <i>wicked</i>) <i>spirits and infirmities</i>. As well might <i>Joanna</i> and <i>Susanna</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>, come in for a share of the censure as this Mary Magdalene; for they seem to have been dispossessed likewise by Jesus, according to St. Luke's account of them. They had all had infirmities, of what sort it is not said, and those infirmities were occasioned by evil spirits within them; and Jesus had healed them all: but <i>Mary Magdalene</i>, by her behaviour, and constant attendance on Jesus in his life-time, at his crucifixion, and at his grave, seems to have exceeded all the other women in duty and respect to his person.

<p>There is a marvellous propensity in commentators to make some of the women mentioned in the Sacred Writings appear as <i>women</i> of <i>ill</i> <i>fame</i>; therefore <i>Rahab</i> must be a <i>harlot</i>; and <i>Mary Magdalene</i>, a <i>prostitute</i>: and yet nothing of the kind can be <i>proved</i> either in the <i>former</i> or in the <i>latter</i> case; nor in that mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36">Luke 7:36</span>, c., where see the notes. Poor <i>Mary Magdalene</i> is made the patroness of <i>penitent prostitutes</i>, both by <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i> and to the scandal of her name, and the reproach of the Gospel, houses fitted up for the reception of such are termed <i>Magdalene hospitals</i>! and the persons themselves <i>Magdalenes</i>! There is not only no proof that this person was such as commentators represent her, but there is the strongest presumptive proof against it: for, if she ever had been such, it would have been contrary to every rule of <i>prudence</i>, and every dictate of <i>wisdom</i>, for Christ and his apostles to have permitted such a person to <i>associate</i> with them, however fully she might have been converted to God, and however exemplary her life, at that time, might have been. As the world, who had seen her conduct, and knew her character, (had she been such as is insinuated,) could not see the <i>inward change</i>, and as they sought to overwhelm Christ and his disciples with obloquy and reproach on every occasion, they would certainly have availed themselves of so favourable an opportunity to subject the character and ministry of Christ to the blackest censure, had he permitted even a converted prostitute to minister to him and his disciples. They were ready enough to say that he was the <i>friend of publicans and sinners</i>, because he conversed with them in order to instruct and save their souls; but they could never say he was a <i>friend of prostitutes</i>, because it does not appear that such persons ever came to Christ; or that he, in the way of his ministry, ever went to them. I conclude therefore that the common opinion is a vile slander on the character of one of the best women mentioned in the Gospel of God; and a reproach cast on the character and conduct of Christ and his disciples. From the whole account of Mary Magdalene, it is highly probable that she was a person of great respectability in that place; such a person as the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, could associate with, and a person on whose conduct or character the calumniating Jews could cast no aspersions.</p>
