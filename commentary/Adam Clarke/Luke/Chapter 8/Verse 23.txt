<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:23">Luke 8:23</span>. <i><b>There came down a storm of wind - and they - were in</b></i><b> </b><i><b>jeopardy.</b></i> — This is a parallel passage to that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>. <i>There was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like</i> <i>to be broken</i>: the latter clause of which is thus translated by the <i>Septuagint</i>: και το πλοιον εκινδυνευε του συντριβηναι, <i>And the ship</i> <i>was in the utmost danger of being dashed to pieces</i>. This is exactly the state of the disciples here; and it is remarkable that the very same word, εκινδυνευον, which we translate, <i>were in</i> <i>jeopardy</i>, is used by the evangelist, which is found in the Greek version above quoted. The word <i>jeopardy</i>, an inexpressive <i>French</i> term, and utterly unfit for the place which it now occupies, is properly the exclamation of a disappointed <i>gamester, Jeu perdu</i>! <i>The game is lost</i>! or, <i>j'ai perdu! I have lost</i>! i.e. <i>the game</i>.</p>
