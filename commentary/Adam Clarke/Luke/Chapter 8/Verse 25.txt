<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Where is your faith?</b></i> â€” Ye have a power to believe, and yet do not exercise it! Depend on God. Ye have <i>little faith</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:26">Matthew 8:26</span>), because you do not use the grace which I have already given you. Many are looking for more faith without using that which they have. It is as possible to hide this talent as any other.</p>
