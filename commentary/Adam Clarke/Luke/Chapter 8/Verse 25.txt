Verse 25. Where is your faith? â€” Ye have a power to believe, and yet do not exercise it! Depend on God. Ye have little faith, (Matthew 8:26), because you do not use the grace which I have already given you. Many are looking for more faith without using that which they have. It is as possible to hide this talent as any other.
