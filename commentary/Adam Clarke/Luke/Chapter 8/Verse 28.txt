<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Jesus</b></i><b>, thou </b><i><b>Son of God most high</b></i> â€” The words <i>Jesus</i> and <i>God</i> are both omitted here by several MSS.

They were constrained in a summary way to acknowledge his power; but it is probable they did not pronounce <i>names</i> which were of such dreadful import to themselves. The words which they spoke on the occasion seem to have been these, <i>What is it to thee and me, O Son of the most</i> <i>high</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>.</p>
