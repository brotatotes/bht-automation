<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>. <i><b>Herod's steward</b></i> — Though the original word, επιτροπος, signifies sometimes the <i>inspector</i> or <i>overseer</i> of a <i>province</i>, and sometimes a <i>tutor of children</i>, yet here it seems to signify the <i>overseer of Herod's domestic affairs</i>: the <i>steward of his </i> <i>household</i>. <i>Steward of the household</i> was an office in the king's palace by s. 24, of Hen. VIII. The person is now entitled <i>lord</i> <i>steward of the king's household</i>, and the office is, I believe, more honourable and of more importance than when it was first created. <i>Junius</i> derives the word from the Islandic stivardur, which is compounded of <i>stia, work</i>, and <i>vardur</i>, a <i>keeper</i>, or <i>overseer</i>: hence our words, <i>warder, warden, ward, guard,</i> <i>guardian</i>, &amp;c. The Greek word in Hebrew letters is frequent in the rabbinical writings, אפיטדופום, and signifies among them the deputy ruler of a province. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>. In the Islandic version, it is <i>forsionarmanns</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto him</b></i> — Instead of αυτω, <i>to him</i>, meaning <i>Christ</i>, many of the best MSS. and versions have αυτοις, to them, meaning both our Lord and the <i>twelve apostles</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:1">Luke 8:1</span>. This is unquestionably the true meaning. Christ receives these assistances and ministrations, says pious <i>Quesnel</i>,-</p>
<p>1. To honour poverty by subjecting himself to it.</p>
<p>2. To humble himself in receiving from his creatures.</p>
<p>3. That he may teach the ministers of the Gospel to depend on the providence of their heavenly Father.</p>
<p>4. To make way for the gratitude of those he had healed. And,</p>
<p>5. That he might not be burthensome to the <i>poor</i> to whom he went to preach.</p>
