<p>Verse 31. <i><b>And they besought him that he would not command them</b></i><b> </b><i><b>to go out into the deep.</b></i> â€” In the Chaldaic philosophy, mention is made of certain <i>material demons</i>, who are permitted to wander about on the earth, and are horribly afraid of being sent into abysses and subterranean places. <i>Psellus</i> says, <i>De Daemonibus</i>: "These <i>material</i> demons fearing to be sent into abysses, and standing in awe of the angels who send them thither, if even a man threaten to send them thither and pronounce the names of those angels whose office that is, it is inexpressible how much they will be affrighted and troubled. So great will their astonishment be, that they cannot discern the person that threatens them. And though it be some old woman or little old man that menaces them, yet so great is their fear that they depart as if the person who menaces had a power to kill them." See <i>Stanley's</i> Chaldaic Philosophy.</p>
