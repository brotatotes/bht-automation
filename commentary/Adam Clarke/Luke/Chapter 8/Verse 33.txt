<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into</b></i><b> </b><i><b>the swine</b></i> â€” Some critics and commentators would have us to understand all this of the <i>man himself</i>, who, they say, was a <i>most</i> <i>outrageous maniac</i>; and that, being permitted by our Lord, he ran after the swine, and drove them all down a precipice into the sea! This is solemn trifling indeed; or, at least, trifling with solemn things. It is impossible to read over the account, as given here by Luke, and admit this mode of explanation. <i>The devils went out</i> <i>of the man, and entered into the swine</i>; i.e. the madman ran after the swine! On this plan of interpretation there is nothing certain in the word of God; and every man may give it what meaning he pleases. Such comments are intolerable.</p>
