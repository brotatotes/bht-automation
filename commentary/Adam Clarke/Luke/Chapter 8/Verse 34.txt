<p>Verse 34. <i><b>They fled, and went and told it</b></i> — απελθοντες, <i>They</i> <i>went</i>, is omitted by almost every MS. of repute, and by the best of the ancient versions. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it out, and with propriety too, as it is not likely that so correct a writer as Luke would say, <i>They fled, and WENT and told it</i>.</p>
