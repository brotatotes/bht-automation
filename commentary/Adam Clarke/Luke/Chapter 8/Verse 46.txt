<p>Verse 46. <i><b>I perceive that virtue</b></i> — δυναμιν, Divine or <i>miraculous</i> <i>power</i>. This Divine emanation did not proceed always from Christ, as necessarily as <i>odours</i> do from <i>plants</i>, for then all who touched him must have been equally partakers of it. Of the many that touched him, this woman and <i>none else</i> received this Divine virtue; and why? Because she came in <i>faith</i>. Faith alone attracts and receives the energetic influence of God at all times. There would be more miracles, at least of <i>spiritual</i> healing, were there more <i>faith</i> among those who are called <i>believers</i>.</p>
