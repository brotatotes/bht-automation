<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:55">Luke 8:55</span>. <i><b>And he commanded to give her meat.</b></i> â€” Though she was raised to life by a miracle, she was not to be preserved by a miracle. Nature is God's great instrument, and he delights to work by it; nor will he do any thing by his sovereign power, in the way of miracle, that can be effected by his ordinary providence. Again, God will have us be workers together with him: he provides food for us, but he does not eat for us; we eat for ourselves, and are thus nourished on the bounty that God has provided. Without the <i>food</i>, man cannot be nourished; and unless he <i>eat</i> the food, it can be of no use to him. So, God provides salvation for a lost world, and bestows it on every penitent believing soul; but he neither repents nor believes for any man. A man repents and believes for himself, under the succours of God's grace.</p>
