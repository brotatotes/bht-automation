<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1">Luke 9:1</span>. <i><b>Power and authority</b></i> — δυναμιν και εξουσιαν. The words properly mean here, the power to work miracles; and that authority by which the whole demoniac system was to be subjected to them. The reader will please to observe:</p>
<p>1. That Luke mentions both <i>demons</i> and <i>diseases</i>; therefore he was either mistaken, or <i>demons</i> and <i>diseases</i> are <i>not</i> the <i>same</i>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>treatment</i> of these two was not the <i>same</i>:-the demons were to be <i>cast out</i>, the diseases to be <i>healed</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:1">Matthew 10:1</span>.</p>
