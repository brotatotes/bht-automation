Verse Luke 9:16. Then he took the five loaves â€” A minister of the Gospel, who is employed to feed souls, should imitate this conduct of Christ:1. He ought to exhort the people to hear with sedate and humble reverence.2. He should first take the bread of life himself, that he may be strengthened to feed others.3. He ought frequently to lift his soul to God, in order to draw down the Divine blessing on himself and his hearers.4. He should break the loaves - divide rightly the word of truth, and give to all such portions as are suited to their capacities and states.5. What he cannot perform himself, he should endeavour to effect by the ministry of others; employing every promising talent, for the edification of the whole, which he finds among the members of the Church of God. Under such a pastor, the flock of Christ will increase and multiply. See Quesnel.
