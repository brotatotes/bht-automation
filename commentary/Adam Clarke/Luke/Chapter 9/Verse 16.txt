<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:16">Luke 9:16</span>. <i><b>Then he took the five loaves</b></i> â€” A minister of the Gospel, who is employed to feed souls, should imitate this conduct of Christ:</p>
<p>1. He ought to exhort the people to hear with <i>sedate</i> and <i>humble</i> reverence.</p>
<p>2. He should first take the <i>bread</i> of life <i>himself</i>, that he may be <i>strengthened</i> to feed others.</p>
<p>3. He ought frequently to <i>lift</i> his soul to <i>God</i>, in order to draw down the Divine blessing on himself and his hearers.</p>
<p>4. He should <i>break</i> the <i>loaves </i>- divide rightly the word of truth, and give to all such portions as are suited to their capacities and states.</p>
<p>5. What he cannot perform himself, he should endeavour to effect by the ministry of others; employing every promising talent, for the edification of the whole, which he finds among the members of the Church of God. Under such a pastor, the flock of Christ will increase and multiply. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
