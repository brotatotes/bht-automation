<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Lose himself</b></i> — That is, his <i>life</i> or <i>soul</i>. See the parallel places, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:35">Mark 8:35</span>, and especially the note on the former.</p>
<p><i><b>Or be cast away?</b></i> — Or <i>receive</i> spiritual <i>damage</i> η ζημιωθεις. I have added the word <i>spiritual</i> here, which I conceive to be necessarily implied. Because, if a man received only <i>temporal</i> damage in some respect or other, yet <i>gaining</i> the <i>whole world</i> must amply compensate him. But if he should receive <i>spiritual</i> damage - hurt to his soul in the smallest degree, the possession of the universe could not indemnify him. Earthly goods may repair earthly losses, but they cannot repair any breach that may be made in the <i>peace</i> or <i>holiness</i> of the soul. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>.</p>
