<p>Verse 31. <i><b>His decease</b></i> — την εξοδον αυτον, <i>That going out</i> (or death) <i>of his</i>. That <i>peculiar</i> kind of death - its <i>nature,</i> <i>circumstances</i>, and <i>necessity</i> being considered. Instead of εξοδον, <i>thirteen</i> MSS. have δοξαν, <i>glory</i>. <i>They spoke of that glory of</i> <i>his, which he was about to fill up</i> (πληρουν) <i>at Jerusalem</i>. The <i>AEthiopic</i> unites both readings. The <i>death</i> of Jesus was his <i>glory</i>, because, by it, he gained the victory over sin, death, and hell, and purchased salvation and eternal glory for a lost world.</p>
