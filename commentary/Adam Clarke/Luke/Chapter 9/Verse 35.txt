<p>Verse 35. <i><b>This is my beloved Son</b></i> — Instead of ο αγαπητος, <i>the</i> <i>beloved one</i>, some MSS. and versions have εκλεκτος, <i>the chosen</i> <i>one</i>: and the <i>AEthiopic</i> translator, as in several other cases, to be sure of the true reading, retains <i>both</i>.</p>
<p><i>In whom I am well pleased</i>, or <i>have delighted</i>-is <i>added</i> by some very ancient MSS. Perhaps this addition is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>.</p>
