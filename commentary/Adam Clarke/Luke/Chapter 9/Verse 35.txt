Verse 35. This is my beloved Son — Instead of ο αγαπητος, the beloved one, some MSS. and versions have εκλεκτος, the chosen one: and the AEthiopic translator, as in several other cases, to be sure of the true reading, retains both.In whom I am well pleased, or have delighted-is added by some very ancient MSS. Perhaps this addition is taken from Matthew 17:5.
