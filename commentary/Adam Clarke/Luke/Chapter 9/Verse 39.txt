<p>Verse 39. <i><b>A spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out</b></i> — πνευμα λαμβανει αυτον. This very phrase is used by heathen writers, when they speak of <i>supernatural</i> influence. The following, from <i>Herodotus</i>, will make the matter, I hope, quite plain. Speaking of <i>Scyles</i>, king of the <i>Scythians</i>, who was more fond of Grecian manners and customs than of those of his countrymen, and who desired to be privately <i>initiated into the Bacchic mysteries</i>, he adds: "Now because the Scythians reproach the Greeks with these <i>Bacchanals</i>, and say that to imagine a god driving men into paroxysms of madness is not agreeable to sound reason, a certain <i>Borysthenian</i>, while the king was performing the ceremonies of initiation, went out, and discovered the matter to the Scythian army in these words: 'Ye Scythians ridicule us because we celebrate the <i>Bacchanals</i>, και ημεας ο θεος λαμβανει, and the GOD POSSESSES US: but now the <i>same demon</i>, ουτος ο δαιμων, has TAKEN POSSESSION, λελαβηκε, of your king, for he celebrates the Bacchanals, and υπο του θεου μαινεται, is filled with fury by this god." <i>Herodot</i>. l. iv. p. 250, edit. <i>Gale</i>.</p>
<p>This passage is exceedingly remarkable. The very expressions which Luke uses here are made use of by Herodotus. A <i>demon</i>, δαιμων, is the <i>agent</i> in the Greek historian, and a <i>demon</i> is the <i>agent</i> in the case mentioned in the text, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:42">Luke 9:42</span>. In <i>both</i> cases it is said the <i>demon possesses</i> the persons, and the very same <i>word</i>, λαμβανει is used to express this in both historians. Both historians show that the possessions were real, by the effects produced in the persons: the heathen king <i>rages</i> with <i>fury</i> through the influence of the <i>demon</i> called the god <i>Bacchus</i>; the person in the text <i>screams</i> out, (κραζει), is greatly <i>convulsed</i>, and <i>foams</i> at the mouth. Here was a real possession, and such as often took place among those who were worshippers of demons.</p>
