<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Let these sayings sink down into your ears</b></i> â€” Or, <i>put</i> <i>these words into your ears</i>. To <i>other</i> words, you may lend <i>occasional</i> attention - but to what concerns my <i>sufferings</i> and <i>death</i> you must <i>ever</i> listen. Let them <i>constantly</i> occupy a place in your most serious meditations and reflections.</p>
