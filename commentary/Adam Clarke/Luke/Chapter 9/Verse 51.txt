<p>Verse 51. <i><b>That he should be received up</b></i> — Bishop PEARCE says: "I think the word αναληψεως must signify, of Jesus's <i>retiring</i> or <i>withdrawing</i> himself, and not of his being <i>received up</i>: because the word συμπληρουσθαι, here used before it, denotes a time <i>completed</i>, which that of his <i>ascension</i> was not then. The sense is, that the time was come, when Jesus was no longer to retire from Judea and the parts about Jerusalem as he had hitherto done; for he had lived altogether in <i>Galilee</i>, lest the Jews should have laid hold on him, before the work of his ministry was ended, and full proofs of his Divine mission given, and some of the prophecies concerning him accomplished. John says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1">John 7:1</span>: <i>Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Jewry, because</i> <i>the Jews sought to kill him</i>. Let it be observed, that all which follows here in Luke, to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:45">Luke 19:45</span>, is represented by him as done <i>by Jesus in his last journey from Galilee to Jerusalem."</i></p>
<p><i><b>He steadfastly set his face</b></i> — That is, after proper and mature <i>deliberation</i>, he <i>chose</i> now to go up to Jerusalem, and <i>firmly</i> <i>determined</i> to accomplish his design.</p>
