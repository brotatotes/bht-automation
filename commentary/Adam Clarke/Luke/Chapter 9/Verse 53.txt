<p>Verse 53. <i><b>His face was</b></i> â€” They saw he was going up to Jerusalem to keep the feast; (it was the feast of tabernacles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:2">John 7:2</span>); and knowing him thereby to be a <i>Jew</i>, they would afford nothing for his <i>entertainment</i>; for, in religious matters, the <i>Samaritans</i> and <i>Jews</i> had no dealings: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:9">John 4:9</span>. The Samaritans were a kind of mongrel heathens; they feared Jehovah, and served other gods, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:34">2 Kings 17:34</span>. They apostatized from the true religion, and persecuted those who were attached to it. See an account of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>. Those only who have deserted the truth of God, or who are uninfluenced by it, hate them who embrace and act by it. When a man has once decidedly taken the road to heaven, he can have but little credit any longer in the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:1">1 John 3:1</span>.</p>
