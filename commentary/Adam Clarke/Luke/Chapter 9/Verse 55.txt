<p>Verse 55. <i><b>Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</b></i> â€” Ye do not consider that the present is a dispensation of infinite <i>mercy</i> and <i>love</i>; and that the design of God is not to <i>destroy</i> sinners, but to give them space to repent, that he may <i>save</i> them unto <i>eternal life</i>. And ye do not consider that the zeal which you feel springs from an evil principle, being more concerned for your own honour than for the honour of God. The disciples of that Christ who died for his enemies should never think of <i>avenging</i> themselves on their persecutors.</p>
