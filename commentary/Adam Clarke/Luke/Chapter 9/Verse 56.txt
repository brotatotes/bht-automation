Verse 56. And they went to another village. â€” Which probably did entertain them; being, perhaps, without the Samaritan borders.The words, Ye know not of what spirit ye are; for the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them, are wanting in ABCEGHLS-V, and in many others. Griesbach leaves the latter clause out of the text. It is probable that the most ancient MSS. read the passage thus: But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not of what spirit ye are. And they went to another  village. See the authorities in GRIESBACH.
