<p>Verse 56. <i><b>And they went to another village.</b></i> â€” Which probably did entertain them; being, perhaps, without the Samaritan borders.</p>
<p>The words, <i>Ye know not of what spirit ye are; for the Son of man</i> <i>is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them</i>, are wanting in ABCEGHLS-V, and in many others. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves the latter clause out of the text. It is probable that the most ancient MSS. read the passage thus: <i>But he turned, and rebuked them, and said,</i> <i>Ye know not of what spirit ye are. And they went to another </i> <i>village</i>. See the authorities in GRIESBACH.</p>
