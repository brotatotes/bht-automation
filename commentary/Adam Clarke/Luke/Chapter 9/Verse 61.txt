<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:61">Luke 9:61</span>. <i><b>Another also said</b></i> — This circumstance is not mentioned by any of the other evangelists; and Matthew alone mentions the former case, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:57-58">Luke 9:57-58</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home</b></i> — Επιτρεψον μοι αποταξασθαι τοις εις τον οικον μου - <i>Permit me to set in order</i> <i>my affairs at home</i>.
