<p><i><b>He was perplexed;</b></i> — <i>He was greatly perplexed</i> διηπορει. from δια <i>emphat</i>. and απορεω, <i>I am in perplexity</i>. It is a metaphor taken from a traveller, who in his journey meets with several paths, one only of which leads to the place whither he would go; and, not knowing which to take, he is distressed with perplexity and doubt. The verb comes from α, <i>negative</i>, and πορος, a <i>way</i> or <i>passage</i>. A guilty conscience is a continual pest: - Herod had murdered John, and he is terribly afraid, lest he should arise from the dead, and bring his deeds to light, and expose him to that punishment which he deserved.
