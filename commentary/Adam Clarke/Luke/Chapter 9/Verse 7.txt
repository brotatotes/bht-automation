Verse Luke 9:7. Herod the tetrarch — See note on Matthew 2:1; Matthew 14:1.By him — This is omitted by BCDL, two others, the Coptic,  Sahidic, Armenian, and four of the Itala. It is probable that Luke might have written, Herod, hearing of all the things that were done, c. but Matthew says particularly, that it was the fame of Jesus of which he heard: Matthew 14:1.He was perplexed; — He was greatly perplexed διηπορει. from δια emphat. and απορεω, I am in perplexity. It is a metaphor taken from a traveller, who in his journey meets with several paths, one only of which leads to the place whither he would go; and, not knowing which to take, he is distressed with perplexity and doubt. The verb comes from α, negative, and πορος, a way or passage. A guilty conscience is a continual pest: - Herod had murdered John, and he is terribly afraid, lest he should arise from the dead, and bring his deeds to light, and expose him to that punishment which he deserved. See Mark 6:16.
