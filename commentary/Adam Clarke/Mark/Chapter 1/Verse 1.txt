Verse Mark 1:1. The beginning of the Gospel — It is with the utmost propriety that Mark begins the Gospel dispensation by the preaching of John the Baptist, he being the forerunner of Jesus Christ, and the first proclaimer of the incarnated Messiah. Gospel-for the meaning of the word see the preface to Matthew. Matthew 1:1Son of God — To point out his Divine origin; and thus glancing at his miraculous conception. This was an essential character of the Messiah. See Matthew 16:16; Matthew 26:63; Luke 22:67, &c.
