<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:13">Mark 1:13</span>. <i><b>With the wild beasts</b></i> â€” This is a curious circumstance, which is mentioned by none of the other evangelists; and seems to intimate that he was in the most remote, unfrequented, and savage part of the desert; which, together with the diabolic influence, tended to render the whole scene the more horrid. Perhaps this very circumstance is mentioned, as emblematical of that <i>savage</i> and <i>brutal cruelty</i> with which he was persecuted to death by the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>, instigated thereto by the malice of <i>Satan</i>.</p>
