<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:15">Mark 1:15</span>. <i><b>The time is fulfilled</b></i> â€” That is, the time appointed for sending the <i>Messiah</i>; and particularly the time specified by Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</span>. Here are <i>four</i> points worthy of deep attention, in the preaching of the Son of God.</p>
<p>1. Every thing that is done is according to a plan laid by the Divine wisdom, and never performed till the time appointed was <i>filled up</i>.</p>
<p>2. That the kingdom and reign of sin are to be destroyed, and the <i>kingdom</i> of grace and <i>heaven</i> established in their place.</p>
<p>3. That the kingdom of God, and his reign by grace, begins with <i>repentance</i> for past sins.</p>
<p>4. That this reign of grace is <i>at hand</i>; and that nothing but an obstinate perseverance in sin and impenitence can keep any soul out of it; and that now is the accepted time to enter in.</p>
