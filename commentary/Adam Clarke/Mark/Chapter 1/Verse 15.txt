Verse Mark 1:15. The time is fulfilled â€” That is, the time appointed for sending the Messiah; and particularly the time specified by Daniel, Daniel 9:24-27. Here are four points worthy of deep attention, in the preaching of the Son of God.1. Every thing that is done is according to a plan laid by the Divine wisdom, and never performed till the time appointed was filled up.2. That the kingdom and reign of sin are to be destroyed, and the kingdom of grace and heaven established in their place.3. That the kingdom of God, and his reign by grace, begins with repentance for past sins.4. That this reign of grace is at hand; and that nothing but an obstinate perseverance in sin and impenitence can keep any soul out of it; and that now is the accepted time to enter in.
