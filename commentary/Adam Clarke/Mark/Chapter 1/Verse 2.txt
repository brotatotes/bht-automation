<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:2">Mark 1:2</span>. <i><b>As it is written in the prophets</b></i> — Rather, <i>As it is</i> <i>written by Isaiah the prophet</i>. I think this reading should be adopted, instead of that in the common text. It is the reading of the <i>Codex Bezae, Vatican</i>, and several other MSS. of great repute. It is found also in the <i>Syriac, Persic, Coptic, Armenian, Gothic,</i> <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i> versions, and in several of the <i>fathers</i>. As this prophecy is found both in <i>Isaiah</i> and <i>Malachi</i>, probably the reading was changed to ταιςπροφηταις, <i>the prophets</i>, that it might comprehend both. In one of ASSEMAN'S Syriac copies, both <i>Isaiah</i> and <i>Malachi</i> are mentioned. See all the authorities in <i>Griesbach</i>, 2d edit.; and see the parallel place in Matthew, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:3">Matthew 3:3</span>, where the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i> is mentioned, which seems fully to establish the authority of this reading.</p>
