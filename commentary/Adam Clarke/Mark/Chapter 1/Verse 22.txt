<p>Verse 22. <i><b>As one that had authority</b></i> — From God, to do what he was doing; and to teach a pure and beneficent system of truth.</p>
<p><i><b>And not as the scribes.</b></i> — Who had no such authority, and whose teaching was not accompanied by the power of God to the souls of the people:</p>
<p>1. because the <i>matter</i> of the teaching did not come from God; and</p>
<p>2. because the teachers themselves were not commissioned by the Most High. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:28">Matthew 7:28</span>.</p>
