Verse 22. As one that had authority — From God, to do what he was doing; and to teach a pure and beneficent system of truth.And not as the scribes. — Who had no such authority, and whose teaching was not accompanied by the power of God to the souls of the people:1. because the matter of the teaching did not come from God; and2. because the teachers themselves were not commissioned by the Most High. Matthew 7:28.
