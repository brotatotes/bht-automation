<p>Verse 23. <i><b>A man with an unclean spirit</b></i> â€” This demoniac is only mentioned by Mark and Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:33">Luke 4:33</span>. It seems the man had lucid intervals; else he could not have been admitted into the synagogue. <i>Unclean or impure spirit </i>- a common epithet for those fallen spirits: but here it may mean, one who filled the heart of him he possessed with LASCIVIOUS <i>thoughts, images, desires</i>, and <i>propensities</i>. By giving way to the first attacks of such a spirit, he may soon get in, and take full possession of the whole soul.</p>
