<p>Verse 25. <i><b>And Jesus rebuked him</b></i> â€” A spirit of this cast will only yield to the sovereign power of the Son of God. All <i>watchings, fasting</i>, and <i>mortifications</i>, considered <i>in themselves</i>, will do little or no good. Uncleanness, of every description, will only yield to the <i>rebuke</i> of God.</p>
