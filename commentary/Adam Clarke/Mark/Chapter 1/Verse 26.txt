<p>Verse 26. <i><b>And when the unclean spirit had torn him</b></i> — <i>And had</i> <i>thrown him down in the midst</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:35">Luke 4:35</span>, και σπαραξαν, <i>and convulsed</i> him. Never was there a person possessed by an unclean spirit who did not suffer a <i>convulsion</i>, perhaps a total <i>ruin</i> of nature by it. Sins of <i>uncleanness</i>, as the apostle intimates, are <i>against the body</i>; they sap the foundation of life, so that there are very few of this class, whether male or female, that live out half their days: they generally die <i>martyrs</i> to their lusts. When the propensities of the flesh are <i>most violent</i> in a person who is determined to serve God, it is often a proof that these are the <i>last efforts</i> of the impure spirit, who has great rages because he knows his time is but <i>short</i>.</p>
