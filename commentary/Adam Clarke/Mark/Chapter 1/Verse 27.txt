<p>Verse 27. <i><b>What thing is this?</b></i> — Words of surprise and astonishment.</p>
<p><i><b>And what new doctrine</b></i> — I have added the particle <i>and</i>, from the Syriac, as it helps the better to distinguish the members of the sentence; but there is a vast diversity in the MSS. on this verse. See <i>Griesbach</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>For with authority</b></i> — They had never heard such a gracious doctrine, and never saw any teaching supported by miracles before. How much must this person be superior to <i>men! - they</i> are brought into subjection by unclean spirits; this person subjects unclean spirits to <i>himself</i>.</p>
