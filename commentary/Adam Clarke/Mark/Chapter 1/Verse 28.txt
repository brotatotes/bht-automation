<p>Verse 28. <i><b>And immediately his fame spread abroad</b></i> — The miracle which he had performed was -</p>
<p>1. great;</p>
<p>2. evidenced much <i>benevolence</i> in the worker of it; and</p>
<p>3. was very <i>public</i>, being wrought in the synagogue.</p>
<p>The <i>many</i> who saw it published it wherever they went; and thus the fame of Christ, as an incomparable teacher, and unparalleled worker of miracles, became soon spread abroad through the land.</p>
<p>The word, ευθεως, <i>immediately</i>, occurs more frequently in this evangelist than in any other writer of the new covenant: it is very often superfluous, and may often be omitted in the translation, without any prejudice to the sense of the passage in which it is found. It seems to be used by St. Mark, as our ancient writers used <i>forsooth</i>, and such like words.</p>
