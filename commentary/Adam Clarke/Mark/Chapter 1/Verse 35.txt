<p>Verse 35. <i><b>In the morning a great while before day</b></i> — By πρωι, <i>the morning</i>, is to be understood the whole space of three hours, which finished the fourth watch of the night.</p>
<p><i><b>And there prayed.</b></i> — Not that <i>he</i> needed any thing, for in him dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; but that he might be a <i>pattern</i> to us. Every thing that our blessed Lord did he performed either as our <i>pattern</i>, or as our <i>sacrifice</i>.</p>
