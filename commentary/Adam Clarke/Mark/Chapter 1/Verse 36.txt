<p>Verse 36. <i><b>And Simon - followed after him.</b></i> — κατεδιωξαν, <i>followed</i> <i>him eagerly</i>. They had now begun to taste the good word of God, and thought they could never hear too much of it. Many possess this spirit when first converted to God. O! what a pity that they should ever lose it! The soul that <i>relishes</i> God's word is ever growing in grace by it.</p>
