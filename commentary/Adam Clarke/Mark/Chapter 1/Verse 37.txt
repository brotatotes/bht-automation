<p>Verse 37. <i><b>All</b></i><b> men </b><i><b>seek for thee.</b></i> â€” Some to <i>hear</i>; some to be <i>healed</i>; some to be <i>saved</i>; and some, perhaps, through no <i>good</i> motive. There are all sorts of followers in the train of Christ; but how few walk <i>steadily</i>, and <i>persevere</i> unto the <i>end</i>!</p>
