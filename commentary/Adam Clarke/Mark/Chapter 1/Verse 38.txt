<p>Verse 38. <i><b>The next towns</b></i> — κωμοπολεις properly signifies such towns as resembled cities for <i>magnitude</i> and <i>number</i> of inhabitants, but which were not <i>walled</i> as were <i>cities</i>. The <i>Codex Bezae</i>, most of the versions, and all the <i>Itala</i>, read, <i>Let us go into the</i> <i>neighbouring villages</i>, AND INTO THE CITIES.</p>
<p><i><b>For therefore came I forth.</b></i> — εις τουτο, <i>for this purpose am I</i> <i>come forth </i>- to preach the Gospel to every creature, that all might hear, and fear, and return unto the Lord. The <i>towns</i> and the <i>villages</i> will not come to the preacher - the preacher <i>must go to</i> <i>them</i>, if he desires their salvation. In this, also, Jesus has left his ministering servants an <i>example</i>, that they should follow his steps. Let no minister of God think he has delivered his own soul, till he has made an offer of salvation to every <i>city</i> and <i>village</i> within his reach.</p>
