Verse 39. And he preached — He continued preaching - ην κηρυσσων: this is the proper meaning of the words: he never slackened his pace-he continued proclaiming the glad tidings of salvation to all - there was no time to be lost - immortal souls were perishing for lack of knowledge; and the grand adversary was prowling about, seeking whom he might devour. This zealous, affectionate, and persevering diligence of Christ should be copied by all his servants in the ministry; it is not less necessary now than it was then. Thousands, thousands of Christians, so called, are perishing for lack of knowledge. O God, send forth more and more faithful labourers into thy vineyard!
