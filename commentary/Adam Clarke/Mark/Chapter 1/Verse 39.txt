<p>Verse 39. <i><b>And he preached</b></i> — <i>He continued preaching </i>- ην κηρυσσων: this is the proper meaning of the words: he never slackened his pace-he continued proclaiming the glad tidings of salvation to all - there was no time to be lost - immortal souls were perishing for lack of knowledge; and the grand adversary was prowling about, seeking whom he might devour. This zealous, affectionate, and persevering diligence of Christ should be copied by all his servants in the ministry; it is not less necessary <i>now</i> than it was <i>then</i>. Thousands, thousands of <i>Christians</i>, so called, are perishing for lack of knowledge. O God, send forth more and more faithful <i>labourers</i> into thy vineyard!</p>
