<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:40">Mark 1:40</span>. <i><b>There came a leper</b></i> â€” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:2">Matthew 8:2</span>, c. Should any be inclined to preach on this cleansing of the leper, <i>Mark</i> is the best evangelist to take the account from, because he is more circumstantial than either Matthew or Luke.</p>
<p>I. Consider this leper.</p>
<p>1. He <i>heard</i> of Jesus and his miracles.</p>
<p>2. He <i>came</i> to him for a cure, <i>conscious</i> of his disease.</p>
<p>3. He <i>earnestly besought</i> him to grant the mercy he needed.</p>
<p>4. He <i>fell down</i> on his <i>knees</i>, (with <i>his face to the earth</i>,</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:12">Luke 5:12</span>,) thus showing his humbled state, and the distress</p>
<p>of his soul.</p>
<p>5. He <i>appealed</i> to his love - <i>if thou wilt</i> with a full conviction</p>
<p>of his <i>ability - thou canst</i>; in order to get healed.</p>
<p>II. Consider Jesus.</p>
<p>1. He is <i>moved with tender compassion</i> towards him: this is the</p>
<p><i>alone source</i> of all human salvation.</p>
<p>2. He <i>stretches forth his hand</i>, showing thus his <i>readiness</i> to</p>
<p>relieve him.</p>
<p>3. He <i>touches</i> him; though this was prohibited by the law, and</p>
<p>rendered him who did it in any common case legally unclean.</p>
<p>4. He proves at once his <i>infinite love</i> and <i>unlimited power</i>, by</p>
<p>his <i>word</i> and by his <i>act; I will - be thou cleansed</i>; and</p>
<p><i>immediately</i> his leprosy was <i>removed</i>.</p>
