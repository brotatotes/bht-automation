Verse Mark 1:40. There came a leper â€” See the notes on Matthew 8:2, c. Should any be inclined to preach on this cleansing of the leper, Mark is the best evangelist to take the account from, because he is more circumstantial than either Matthew or Luke.I. Consider this leper.1. He heard of Jesus and his miracles.2. He came to him for a cure, conscious of his disease.3. He earnestly besought him to grant the mercy he needed.4. He fell down on his knees, (with his face to the earth,Luke 5:12,) thus showing his humbled state, and the distressof his soul.5. He appealed to his love - if thou wilt with a full convictionof his ability - thou canst; in order to get healed.II. Consider Jesus.1. He is moved with tender compassion towards him: this is thealone source of all human salvation.2. He stretches forth his hand, showing thus his readiness torelieve him.3. He touches him; though this was prohibited by the law, andrendered him who did it in any common case legally unclean.4. He proves at once his infinite love and unlimited power, byhis word and by his act; I will - be thou cleansed; andimmediately his leprosy was removed.But Matthew 8:2.
