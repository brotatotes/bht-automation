<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:45">Mark 1:45</span>. <i><b>Began to publish it much</b></i> — Began to publish πολλα, <i>many things</i>; probably all that he had heard about our Lord's miraculous works.</p>
<p><i><b>And to blaze abroad the matter</b></i> — That is, his own healing; thinking he could never speak too much, nor too well, of him who had thus mercifully and miraculously cleansed him.</p>
<p><i><b>Jesus could no more openly enter into the city</b></i> — A city of Galilee, probably Chorazin or Bethsaida, in which he did not appear, for fear of exciting the jealousy of the secular government, or the envy and malice of the Jewish rulers.</p>
<p><i><b>And they came to him from every quarter.</b></i> — So generally had the poor man, who was cleansed of his leprosy, spread abroad his fame. And can we suppose that, of all these people who came to him from all parts, and to whom he preached the glad tidings of the kingdom, by the power and authority of God, few or none were saved? This is a common opinion; but every person who seriously considers it must see that it is unfounded. Without doubt, Christ had thousands that were brought to God by his ministry; though, in general, only those are mentioned who were constant attendants on his person. It would be strange, if, while God manifested in the flesh was preacher, there should be few brought to the knowledge of themselves, and of the truth! In this respect he does not permit his faithful ministers to labour in vain. The Son of man sowed the seed of the kingdom; and it afterwards produced a plentiful harvest. Multitudes of Jews were converted by the preaching of the Gospel; and the first Christian Church was founded at Jerusalem.</p>
