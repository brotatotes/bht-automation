<p><i><b>Confessing their sins.</b></i> — It was an invariable custom among the Jews to admit no proselyte to baptism, till he had, in the most solemn manner, declared that he forever had renounced all idolatrous worship, all heathenish superstitions, and promised an entire and unreserved submission to the law of Moses. This was necessary for a <i>proselyte adult </i>- a <i>child</i> dedicated to God by baptism must be <i>brought up</i> in this faith.</p>
