<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1">Mark 10:1</span>. <i><b>He arose</b></i> — κακειθεν αναστας may be translated, <i>he</i> <i>departed thence</i>. The verb ανιστημι has this sense in some of the purest Greek writers. See <i>Kypke</i>. Many transactions took place between those mentioned in the preceding chapter, and these that follow, which are omitted by Matthew and Mark; but they are related both by Luke and John. See <i>Lightfoot</i>, and Bishop <i>Newcome</i>.</p>
