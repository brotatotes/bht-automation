<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:12">Mark 10:12</span>. <i><b>And if a woman shall put away her husband</b></i> â€” From this it appears that in some cases, the wife assumed the very <i>same</i> <i>right</i> of divorcing her husband that the husband had of divorcing his wife; and yet this is not recorded any where in the Jewish laws, as far as I can find, that the women had such a <i>right</i>. Indeed, were the law which gives the permission all on <i>one</i> side, it would be <i>unjust</i> and <i>oppressive</i>; but where it is equally balanced, the right being the <i>same</i> on each side, it must serve as a <i>mutual check</i>, and prevent those evils it is intended to cure. Among the Jews there are several instances of the women having taken other men, even during the life of their own husbands. Nor do we find any law by which they were punished. Divorce never should be permitted but on this ground-"The parties are <i>miserable</i> together, and they are both perfectly <i>willing</i> to be separated." Then, if every thing else be proper, let them go <i>different</i> ways, that they may not ruin both themselves and their hapless offspring.</p>
