<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:16">Mark 10:16</span>. <i><b>And he took them up in his arms</b></i> — One of the <i>Itala</i> reads <i>in sinu suo </i>- "in his bosom." Jesus Christ <i>loves</i> little children; and they are objects of his most <i>peculiar</i> care. Who can account for their continual <i>preservation</i> and <i>support</i>, while exposed to so many dangers, but on the ground of a <i>peculiar</i> and <i>extraordinary</i> providence?</p>
<p><i><b>And blessed them.</b></i> — Then, though <i>little children</i>, they were capable of receiving Christ's blessing. If <i>Christ</i> embraced them, why should not his <i>Church</i> embrace them? Why not <i>dedicate</i> them to God by <i>baptism</i>? - whether that be performed by <i>sprinkling, washing</i>, or <i>immersion</i>; for we need not dispute about the mode: on this point let every one be fully persuaded in his own mind. I confess it appears to me grossly heathenish and barbarous, to see parents who profess to believe in that Christ who loves children, and among them those whose creed does not prevent them from using infant baptism, depriving their children of an ordinance by which no soul can prove that they <i>cannot</i> be profited, and, through an unaccountable bigotry or carelessness, withholding from them the privilege of even a <i>nominal dedication</i> to God; and yet these very persons are ready enough to fly for a minister to baptize their child when they suppose it to be at the point of death! It would be no crime to pray that such persons should never have the privilege of hearing, <i>My father</i>! or, <i>My mother</i>! from the lips of their <i>own</i> child. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span>.</p>
