<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Then Jesus, beholding him</b></i> — <i>Looking earnestly</i>, εμβλεψας, or <i>affectionately upon him, loved him</i>, because of his <i>youth</i>, his <i>earnestness</i>, and his <i>sincerity</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>One thing thou lackest</b></i> — What was that? A heart disengaged from the world, and a complete renunciation of it and its concerns, that he might become a proper and successful labourer in the Lord's vineyard. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:21">Matthew 19:21</span>. To say that it was something <i>else</i> he lacked, when Christ explains here his own meaning, is to be <i>wise above</i> what is <i>written</i>.</p>
