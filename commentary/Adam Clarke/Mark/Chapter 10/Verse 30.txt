<p>Verse 30. <i><b>In this time</b></i> — Εν τῳ καιρῳ τουτῳ, <i>In this very time</i>. Though Jews and Gentiles have conspired together to destroy both me and you, my providence shall so work that nothing shall be lacking while any thing is necessary.</p>
<p><i>And fathers</i>. This is added by K, upwards of <i>sixty</i> others, <i>AEthiopic, Gothic, Slavonic, Saxon, Armenian, Coptic</i>, and in one of my own MSS. of the <i>Vulgate</i>.</p>
<p>Some have been greatly embarrassed to find out the <i>literal</i> truth of these promises; and, some in flat opposition to the text, have said they are all to be understood <i>spiritually</i>. But thus far is plain, that those who have left all for the sake of Christ do find, among genuine Christians, <i>spiritual relatives</i>, which are as dear to them as fathers, mothers, c. yet they have the promise of <i>receiving a hundredfold</i> often <i>literally</i> fulfilled: for, wherever a Christian travels among Christians, the <i>shelter</i> of their <i>houses</i>, and the <i>product</i> of their <i>lands</i>, are at his service as far as they are requisite. Besides, these words were spoken primarily to the <i>disciples</i>, and pointed out their <i>itinerant</i> manner of life; and how, travelling about from house to house, preaching the Gospel of the grace of God, they should, among the followers of Christ, be provided with every thing necessary in all places, as if the whole were their own. I have often remarked that the genuine messengers of God, in the present day have, as noted above, this promise literally fulfilled.</p>
<p><i><b>With persecutions</b></i> — For while you meet with nothing but <i>kindness</i> from true Christians, you shall be despised, and often afflicted, by those who are enemies to God and goodness; but, for your comfort, ye shall have in the <i>world to come</i>, αιωνι τῳ ερχομενῳ, <i>the coming world</i>, (that world which is <i>on its way</i> to meet you,) <i>eternal life</i>.</p>
