Verse 32. And he took again the twelve — Or thus: For having again taken the twelve, c. I translate και for, which signification it often bears see Luke 1:22; John 12:35, and elsewhere. This gives the reason of the wonder and fear of the disciples, FOR he began to tell them on the way, what was to befall him. This sense of και, I find, is also noticed by Rosenmuller. See on Matthew 20:17-19.
