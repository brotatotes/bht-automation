<p>Verse 32. <i><b>And he took again the twelve</b></i> — Or thus: <i>For having</i> <i>again taken the twelve</i>, c. I translate και <i>for</i>, which signification it often bears see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:22">Luke 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span>, and elsewhere. This gives the reason of the <i>wonder</i> and <i>fear</i> of the disciples, FOR <i>he began to tell them on the way, what was to</i> <i>befall him</i>. This sense of και, I find, is also noticed by <i>Rosenmuller</i>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:17-19">Matthew 20:17-19</span>.</p>
