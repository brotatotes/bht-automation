<p>Verse 46. <i><b>Blind Bartimeus</b></i> — בר <i>bar</i> in Syriac signifies <i>son.</i> It appears that he was thus named because Timeus, <i>Talmeus</i> or <i>Talmai</i>, was the name of his father, and thus the son would be called Bar-talmeus, or <i>Bartholomew</i>. Some suppose υιος Τιμαιου, <i>the son of Timeus</i>, to be an interpolation. Bartimeus the son of Timeus, ο τυφλος, THE <i>blind man</i>. It was because he was the most <i>remarkable</i> that this evangelist mentions him by name, as a person probably well known in those parts.</p>
