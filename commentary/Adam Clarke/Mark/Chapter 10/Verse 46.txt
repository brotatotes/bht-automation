Verse 46. Blind Bartimeus — בר bar in Syriac signifies son. It appears that he was thus named because Timeus, Talmeus or Talmai, was the name of his father, and thus the son would be called Bar-talmeus, or Bartholomew. Some suppose υιος Τιμαιου, the son of Timeus, to be an interpolation. Bartimeus the son of Timeus, ο τυφλος, THE blind man. It was because he was the most remarkable that this evangelist mentions him by name, as a person probably well known in those parts.
