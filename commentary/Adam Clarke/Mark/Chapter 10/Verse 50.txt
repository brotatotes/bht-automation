<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:50">Mark 10:50</span>. <i><b>And he, casting away his garment</b></i> â€” He cast off his <i>outward</i> covering, a <i>blanket</i>, or <i>loose piece of cloth</i>, the usual upper garment of an Asiatic mendicant, which kept him from the inclemency of the weather, that he might have nothing to hinder him from getting speedily to Christ. If every penitent were as ready to throw aside his <i>self-righteousness</i> and <i>sinful</i> <i>incumbrances</i>, as this blind man was to throw aside his garment, we should have fewer <i>delays</i> in conversions than we now have; and all that have been convinced of sin would have been brought to the knowledge of the truth. The reader will at least pardon the introduction of the following anecdote, which may appear to some as illustrative of the doctrine grounded on this text.</p>
<p>A great revival of religion took place in some of the American States, about the year 1773, by the instrumentality of some itinerant preachers sent from England. Many, both <i>whites</i> and <i>blacks</i>, were brought to an acquaintance with God who bought them. Two of these, a <i>white man</i> and a <i>negro</i>, meeting together, began to speak concerning the goodness of God to their souls, (a custom which has ever been <i>common</i> among truly religious people.) Among other things they were led to inquire how long each had known the salvation of God; and how long it was, <i>after</i> they were convinced of their sin and danger, <i>before</i> each got a satisfactory evidence of pardoning mercy. The <i>white man</i> said, "I was three months in deep distress of soul, before God spoke peace to my troubled, guilty conscience." "But it was only a fortnight," replied the <i>negro</i>, "from the time I first heard of Jesus, and felt that I was a sinner, till I received the knowledge of salvation by the remission of sins." "But what was the reason," said the <i>white</i> <i>man</i>, "that you found salvation sooner than I did?" "This is the reason," replied the other; "you <i>white men</i> have much <i>clothing</i> upon you, and when Christ calls, you cannot <i>run</i> to him; but we poor negroes have only this, (pointing to the <i>mat</i> or cloth which was tied round his waist,) and when we hear the call, we throw it off <i>instantly</i>, and <i>run</i> to him."</p>
<p>Thus the poor son of <i>Ham</i> illustrated the text without intending it, as well as any doctor in the universe. People who have been <i>educated</i> in the principles of the Christian religion imagine themselves on this account <i>Christians</i>; and, when convinced of sin, they find great difficulty to come as <i>mere sinners</i> to God, to be saved only through the merits of Christ. Others, such as the negro in question, have nothing to plead but this, <i>We have never</i> <i>heard of thee, and could not believe in thee of whom we had not</i> <i>heard</i>; but this excuse will not avail now, as the true light is come-therefore they <i>cast off</i> this <i>covering</i>, and come to Jesus.
