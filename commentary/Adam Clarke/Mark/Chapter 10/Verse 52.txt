<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:52">Mark 10:52</span>. <i><b>Followed Jesus in the way.</b></i> — Instead of τῳ Ιησου, <i>Jesus</i>, several eminent critics read αυτω, <i>him</i>. This is the reading of ABCDL, <i>fourteen</i> others, <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, <i>two Persic, Vulgate</i>, all the <i>Itala</i>, and <i>Origen</i> once. JESUS is the common reading; but this sacred name having occurred so immediately before, there could be no necessity for repeating it here, nor would the repetition have been elegant.</p>
<p>This very remarkable cure gives us another proof, not only of the sovereign power, but of the <i>benevolence</i>, of Christ: nor do we ever see that <i>sovereign</i> power used, but in the way of <i>benevolence</i>. How slow is God to punish! - how prone to spare! To his infinite benevolence, can it be any gratification to destroy any of the children of men? No! We must take great heed not to attribute to his <i>sovereignty</i>, acts which are inconsistent with his <i>benevolence</i> and <i>mercy</i>. I am afraid this is a prevailing error; and that it is not confined to any religious party exclusively.</p>
