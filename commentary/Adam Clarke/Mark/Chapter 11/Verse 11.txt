Verse Mark 11:11. When he had looked round about upon all things — He examined every thing - to see if the matters pertaining to the Divine worship were properly conducted; to see that nothing was wanting-nothing superfluous.And now the eventide was come — The time in which he usually left Jerusalem, to go to Bethany.
