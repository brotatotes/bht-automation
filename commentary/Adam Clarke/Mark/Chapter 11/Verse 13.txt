<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:13">Mark 11:13</span>. <i><b>For the time of figs was not yet.</b></i> — Rather, <i>For it</i> <i>was not the season of gathering figs yet</i>. This I am fully persuaded is the true <i>sense</i> of this passage, ου γαρ ην καιρος συκων. For a proof that καιρος here signifies the time of <i>gathering</i> the figs, see the LXX. in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:3">Psalms 1:3</span>. <i>He bringeth forth his fruit</i>, εν καιρω αυτου, <i>in his season</i>; i.e. in the time in which fruit should be ripe, and fit for gathering. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:2">Mark 12:2</span>: -And at the <i>season</i>, τῳ καιρῳ, the time of gathering the fruits of the vineyard. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:34">Matthew 21:34</span>: - <i>When the time of the fruit drew near</i>; ὁ καιρος των καρπων, the time in which the fruits were to be <i>gathered</i>, for it was then that the Lord of the vineyard sent his servants to <i>receive</i> the fruits; i.e. so much of them as the holder of the vineyard was to pay to the owner by way of <i>rent</i>; for in those times rent was paid in <i>kind</i>.</p>
<p>To the above may be added, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+5:26">Job 5:26</span>: - <i>Thou shalt come to thy grave in</i> FULL AGE, <i>like as a shock of corn</i> <i>cometh in his season</i>; κατακαιρον, in the time in which it should be reaped.</p>
<p>When our Lord saw this fig tree by the <i>way-side</i>, apparently flourishing, he went to it to gather some of the figs: being on the <i>way-side</i>, it was not <i>private</i>, but <i>public</i> property; and any traveller had an equal right to its fruit. As it was not as yet the <i>time</i> for <i>gathering</i> in the fruits, and yet <i>about</i> the <i>time</i> when they were <i>ready</i> to be gathered, our Lord with propriety expected to find some. But as this happened about <i>five days</i> before that passover on which Christ suffered, and the passover that year fell on the beginning of <i>April</i>, it has been asked, "How could our Lord expect to find <i>ripe</i> figs in the end of <i>March</i>?" Answer, Because figs were <i>ripe</i> in Judea as early as the <i>passover</i>. Besides, the fig tree puts forth its fruit <i>first</i>, and afterwards its leaves. Indeed, this tree, in the climate which is proper for it, has fruit on it all the year round, as I have often seen. All the difficulty in the text may be easily removed by considering that the <i>climate</i> of <i>Judea</i> is widely different from that of <i>Great</i> <i>Britain</i>. The <i>summer</i> begins there in March, and the <i>harvest</i> at the passover, as all travellers into those countries testify; therefore, as our Lord met with this tree five days <i>before</i> the passover, it is evident, - 1st. That it was the <i>time</i> of <i>ripe</i> figs: and, 2ndly. That it was <i>not</i> the <i>time</i> of <i>gathering</i> them, because this did not begin till the <i>passover</i>, and the transaction here mentioned took place <i>five</i> days before.</p>
<p>For farther satisfaction on this point, let us suppose: - </p>
<p>I. That this tree was intended to point out the <i>state</i> of the <i>Jewish</i> <i>people</i>.</p>
<p>1. They made a <i>profession</i> of the true religion.</p>
<p>2. They considered themselves the <i>peculiar</i> people of God, and despised and <i>reprobated</i> all others.</p>
<p>3. They were only <i>hypocrites</i>, having nothing of religion but the <i>profession - leaves</i>, and no <i>fruit</i>.</p>
<p>II. That our Lord's conduct towards this tree is to be considered as <i>emblematical</i> of the treatment and final perdition which was to come upon this hypocritical and ungodly nation.</p>
<p>1. It was a <i>proper</i> time for them to have borne <i>fruit</i>: Jesus had been preaching the doctrine of repentance and salvation among them for more than <i>three</i> years; the choicest influences of Heaven had descended upon them; and every thing was done in this vineyard that ought to be done, in order to make it fruitful.</p>
<p>2. The time was now at hand in which God would require <i>fruit, good fruit</i>; and, if it did not produce such, the tree should be hewn down by the Roman axe.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>1. The <i>tree</i> is properly the Jewish nation.</p>
<p>2. Christ's <i>curse</i> the sentence of destruction which had now gone out against it; and,</p>
<p>3. Its <i>withering away</i>, the final and total ruin of the Jewish state by the Romans.</p>
<p>His cursing the fig tree was not occasioned by any <i>resentment</i> at being <i>disappointed</i> at not finding fruit on it, but to <i>point out</i> unto his disciples the wrath which was coming upon a people who had now nearly filled up the measure of their iniquity.</p>
<p>A <i>fruitless soul</i>, that has had much cultivation bestowed on it, may expect to be dealt with as God did with this unrighteous nation. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>, &amp;c.</p>
