<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:3">Mark 11:3</span>. <i><b>And straightway he will send him hither.</b></i> — From the text, I think it is exceedingly plain, that our Lord did not <i>beg</i>, but <i>borrow</i>, the colt; therefore the latter clause of this verse should be understood as the promise of <i>returning</i> him. Is not the proper translation the following? <i>And if any one say to you, Why</i> <i>do ye this? Say, the Lord hath need of him, and will speedily</i> <i>send him back hither</i> - και ευθεως αυτον αποστελλει ὡδε. Some eminent critics take the same view of the passage.</p>
