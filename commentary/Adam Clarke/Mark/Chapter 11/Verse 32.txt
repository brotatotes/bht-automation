<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:32">Mark 11:32</span>. <i><b>They feared the people</b></i> — Or rather, <i>We fear</i>, c. Instead of εφοβουντο, <i>they feared</i> the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, seven others, later <i>Syriac, Arabic, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i>, read φοβουμεν, or φοβουμεθα. The common reading appearing to me quite improper.</p>
<p>WE <i>fear the people</i>. εαν, <i>if</i>, before ειπωμεν, <i>we shall</i> <i>say</i>, is omitted by ABCEFGHLS, and more than fifty others. Bengel leaves it out of the text, and puts a note of interrogation after εξ ανθρωπων; and then the whole passage reads thus: <i>But shall we</i> <i>say, Of men? They feared the people</i>, c. This change renders the adoption of φοβουμεν, <i>we fear</i>, unnecessary. Several critics prefer this mode of distinguishing the text. However the critics may be puzzled with the text, the scribes, chief priests, and elders were worse puzzled with our Lord's question. They must convict themselves or tell a most palpable falsehood. - They told the lie, and so escaped for the present.</p>
<p>1. ENVY, malice, and double dealing have always a difficult part to act, and are ultimately confounded by their own projects and ruined by their own operations. On the other hand, simplicity and sincerity are not obliged to use a mask, but always walk in a plain way.</p>
<p>2. The case of the barren fig-tree which our Lord cursed has been pitifully misunderstood and misapplied. The whole account of this transaction, as stated above, I believe to be correct it is so much in our Lord's usual manner that the propriety of it will scarcely be doubted. He was ever acting the part of the <i>philosopher, moralist</i>, and <i>divine</i>, as well as that of the <i>Saviour</i> <i>of sinners</i>. In his hand, every providential occurrence and every object of nature, became a means of instruction: the <i>stones</i> of the desert, the <i>lilies</i> of the field, the <i>fowls</i> of heaven, the <i>beasts</i> of the forest, <i>fruitful</i> and <i>unfruitful</i> trees, with every ordinary occurrence, were so many grand <i>texts</i>, from which he preached the most illuminating and impressive sermons, for the instruction and salvation of his audience. This wisdom and condescension cannot be sufficiently admired. But shall the example of the <i>fruitless</i> <i>fig tree</i> be lost on <i>us</i> as well as on the <i>Jews</i>? God forbid! Let us therefore take heed, lest having been so long unfruitful, God should say, <i>Let no fruit appear on thee hereafter for ever</i>! and in consequence of this, we wither and die away! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:27">Mark 11:27</span>.</p>
