<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</b></i> â€” This scribe appears to have been a prudent, sensible, and pious man; <i>almost</i> a Christian - so <i>near</i> the kingdom of God that he might have easily stepped in. It is very probable that he did at last <i>believe</i> in and <i>confess</i> Jesus.</p>
