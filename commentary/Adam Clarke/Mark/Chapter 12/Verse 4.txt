<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:4">Mark 12:4</span>. <i><b>At him they cast stones and wounded</b></i><b> him </b><i><b>in the head</b></i> — Or rather, as most learned men agree, <i>they made short work of it</i>, εκεφαλαιωσαν. We have followed the Vulgate, <i>illum in capite</i> <i>vulneraverunt</i>, in translating the original, <i>wounded</i> him <i>in the</i> <i>head</i>, in which signification, I believe, the word is found in no Greek writer. ανακεφαλαιοομαι signifies to <i>sum up, to comprise</i>, and is used in this sense by St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>. From the parable we learn that these people were determined to hear <i>no</i> reason, to do <i>no</i> justice, and to keep the <i>possession</i> and the <i>produce</i> by violence; therefore they fulfilled their purpose in the <i>fullest</i> and <i>speediest</i> manner, which seems to be what the evangelist intended to express by the word in question. Mr. Wakefield translates, <i>They speedily sent him away</i>; others think the meaning is, <i>They shaved their heads</i> and made them look ridiculously; this is much to the same purpose, but I prefer, <i>They made short work of</i> <i>it</i>. Dr. Lightfoot, De Dieu, and others, agree in the sense given above; and this will appear the more probable, if the word λιθοβολησαντες, <i>they cast stones</i>, be omitted, as it is by BDL, the <i>Coptic, Vulgate</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i>.</p>
