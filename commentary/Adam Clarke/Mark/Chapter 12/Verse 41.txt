<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>. <i><b>Cast money into the treasury</b></i> — It is worthy of observation, that the money put into the treasury, even by the <i>rich</i>, is termed by the evangelist χαλκον, <i>brass money</i>, probably that species of small <i>brass</i> coin which was called פרוטה <i>prutah</i> among the Jews, two of which make a farthing, and twenty-four an Italian <i>assarius</i>, which <i>assarius</i> is the twenty-fourth part of a silver penny. We call this, <i>mite</i>, from the French, <i>miete</i>, which signifies a crumb, or very small morsel. The prutah was the smallest coin in use among the Jews: and there is a canon among the rabbins that no person shall put less than two prutahs into the treasury. This poor widow would not give less, and her poverty prevented her from giving more. And whereas it is said that <i>many rich persons cast</i> in MUCH, πολλα, (many,) this may only refer to the <i>number</i> of the <i>prutahs</i> which they threw in, and not to the <i>value</i>. What opinion should we form of a rich man, who, in a collection for a public charity, only threw in a <i>handful</i> of <i>halfpence</i>? See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:1">Luke 21:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:26">Matthew 5:26</span>. The whole of this account is lacking in Matthew. Another proof that Mark did not <i>abridge</i> him.</p>
<p>Let us examine this subject a little more closely: Jesus prefers the widow's two mites to all the offerings made by the rich.</p>
<p>In the preceding account, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>, it is said Jesus <i>beheld</i> how the people cast money into the treasury. To make this relation the more profitable, let us consider Christ the <i>observer</i> and <i>judge</i> of human actions.</p>
<p>I. Christ the <i>observer</i>.</p>
<p>1. Christ <i>observes</i> all men and <i>all things</i>: all our actions are before his eyes, what we do in <i>public</i> and what we do in <i>private</i> are equally known unto him.</p>
<p>2. He <i>observes</i> the <i>state</i> and <i>situation</i> we are in: his eye was upon the <i>abundance</i> of the rich who had given much; and he was well acquainted with the <i>poverty</i> and desolate state of the widow who had given her <i>all</i>, though that was but <i>little</i> in itself. What an <i>awful</i> thought for the <i>rich</i>! "God sees every penny I possess, and constantly observes how I lay it out." What a <i>comfortable</i> thought for the <i>poor</i> and <i>desolate</i>! The eye of the most <i>merciful</i> and <i>bountiful</i> Jesus continually <i>beholds</i> my poverty and distress, and will cause them to work for my good.</p>
<p>3. Christ <i>sees</i> all the <i>motives</i> which lead men to perform their respective actions; and the <i>different</i> motives which lead them to perform the <i>same</i> action: he knows whether they act through <i>vanity,</i> <i>self-love, interest, ambition, hypocrisy</i>, or whether through <i>love,</i> <i>charity, zeal</i> for his glory, and a hearty desire to <i>please</i> him.</p>
<p>4. He <i>observes</i> the circumstances which accompany our actions; whether we act with <i>care</i> or <i>negligence</i>, with a <i>ready</i> mind or with <i>reluctance</i>.</p>
<p>5. He <i>observes</i> the <i>judgment</i> which we form of that which we do in his name; whether we esteem ourselves more on account of what we have done, speak of it to others, dwell on our labours, sufferings, expenses, success, c., or whether we humble ourselves because we have done so <i>little</i> good, and even that little in so <i>imperfect</i> a way.</p>
<p>II. See the <i>judgment</i> Christ forms of our actions.</p>
<p>1. He appears <i>surprised</i> that so much <i>piety</i> should be found with so much <i>poverty</i>, in this poor <i>widow</i>.</p>
<p>2. He shows that works of charity, c., should be estimated, not by their <i>appearance</i>, but by the <i>spirit</i> which produces them.</p>
<p>3. He shows by this that all men are properly in a state of <i>equality</i> for though there is and ought to be a difference in outward things, yet God looks upon the <i>heart</i>, and the poorest person has it in his power to make his <i>mite</i> as acceptable to the Lord, by <i>simplicity</i> of <i>intention</i>, and <i>purity</i> of <i>affection</i>, as the <i>millions</i> given by the affluent. It is just in God to rate the <i>value</i> of an action by the <i>spirit</i> in which it is done.</p>
<p>4. He shows that men should judge <i>impartially</i> in cases of this kind, and not permit themselves to be carried away to decide <i>for</i> a person by the largeness of the gift on the one hand, or <i>against</i> him by the smallness of the bounty on the other. Of the poor widow it is said, She has cast in more than all the <i>rich</i>. Because: 1. She gave <i>more</i> she gave her <i>all</i>, and they gave only a <i>part</i>. 2. She did this in a better <i>spirit</i>, having a <i>simple</i> desire to <i>please God</i>. Never did any king come near the liberality of this widow; she gave <i>all</i> that she had, ὁλον τον βιον αὑτης, <i>her</i> <i>whole life</i>, i.e. all that she had to provide for one day's sustenance, and could have no more till by her labour she had acquired it. What trust must there be in the Divine Providence to perform such an act as this!</p>
<p>Two important lessons may be learned from her conduct. 1. A lesson of <i>humiliation</i> to the rich, who, by reason of covetousness on the one hand, and luxury on the other, give but little to GOD and the <i>poor</i>. A lesson of <i>reproof</i> to the <i>poor</i>, who, through distrust of God's providence, give nothing at all. Our possessions can only be sanctified by giving a portion to God. There will be infallibly a blessing in the <i>remainder</i>, when a part has been given to God and the poor. If the rich and the poor reflect seriously on this, the one will learn <i>pity</i>, the other <i>liberality</i>, and both be blessed in their deed. He must be a <i>poor</i> man indeed who cannot find one <i>poorer</i> than himself.</p>
