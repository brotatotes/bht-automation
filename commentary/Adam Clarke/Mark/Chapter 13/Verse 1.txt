<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1">Mark 13:1</span>. <i><b>See what manner of stones</b></i> â€” Josephus says, ANT. b. xv. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:0">Mark 11:0</span>: "That these stones were <i>white</i> and strong, FIFTY <i>feet</i> long, TWENTY-FOUR broad, and SIXTEEN in thickness." If this account can be relied on, well might the disciples be struck with wonder at such a superb edifice, and formed by such immense stones! The principal contents of this chapter are largely explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>:, and to these the reader is requested to refer.</p>
