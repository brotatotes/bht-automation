<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:30">Mark 13:30</span>. <i><b>This generation</b></i> — Ἡ γενεα αὑτη, <i>This very race of</i> <i>men</i>. It is certain that this word has <i>two</i> meanings in the Scriptures; that given in the text, and that above. <i>Generation</i> signifies a period of a certain number of years, sometimes more, sometimes less. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+1:35">Deuteronomy 1:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+2:14">Deuteronomy 2:14</span>, Moses uses the word to point out a term of thirty-eight years, which was precisely the number in the present case; for Jerusalem was destroyed about thirty-eight years after our Lord delivered this prediction. But as there are <i>other</i> events in this chapter, which certainly look <i>beyond</i> the destruction of Jerusalem, and which were to take place before the Jews should cease to be a <i>distinct</i> people, I should therefore prefer the translation given above. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:34">Matthew 24:34</span>.</p>
