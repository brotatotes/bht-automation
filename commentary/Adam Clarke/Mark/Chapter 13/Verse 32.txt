<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:32">Mark 13:32</span>. <i><b>Neither the Son</b></i> — This clause is not found either in Matthew or Luke; and Ambrose says it was wanting in some Greek copies in his time. To me it is utterly unaccountable, how Jesus, who knew so <i>correctly</i> all the <i>particulars</i> which he here lays down, and which were to a jot and tittle verified by the event - how he who knew that not <i>one</i> stone should be left on <i>another</i>, should be ignorant of the <i>day</i> and <i>hour</i> when this should be done, though <i>Daniel</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>, c., could fix the very <i>year</i>, not less than five hundred years before it happened: how he in whom the <i>fulness of the Godhead dwelt</i> <i>bodily</i>, and all the treasures of <i>wisdom</i> and <i>knowledge</i>, should not know this <i>small matter</i>, I cannot comprehend, but on this ground, that the Deity which dwelt in the man Christ Jesus might, at one time, communicate less of the knowledge of futurity to him than at another. However, I strongly suspect that the clause was not originally in this Gospel. Its not being found in the parallel places in the other evangelists is, in my opinion, a strong presumption against it. But Dr. Macknight, and others, solve this difficulty in the following manner. They suppose the verb οιδεν to have the force of the Hebrew conjugation <i>Hiphel</i>, in which verbs are taken in a <i>causative, declarative</i>, or <i>permissive</i> sense and that it means here, <i>make known</i>, or <i>promulge</i>, as it is to be understood in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:2">1 Corinthians 2:2</span>. This intimates that this secret was not to be <i>made known</i>, either by <i>men</i> or <i>angels</i>, no, not even by the Son of man himself; but it should be <i>made known</i> by the Father only, in the execution of the purposes of his <i>justice</i>. I am afraid this only <i>cuts</i> the knot, but does not <i>untie</i> it.</p>
