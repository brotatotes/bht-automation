<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:34">Mark 13:34</span>. <i><b>Left his house</b></i> — οικιαν, <i>family</i>. Our blessed Lord and Master, when he ascended to heaven, commanded his servants to be <i>faithful</i> and <i>watchful</i>. This fidelity to which he exhorts his servants consists in doing every thing <i>well</i> which is to be done, in the <i>heart</i> or in the <i>family</i>, according to the full extent of the duty. The <i>watchfulness</i> consists in suffering no <i>stranger</i> nor <i>enemy</i> to enter in by the <i>senses</i>, which are the <i>gates</i> of the soul; in permitting nothing which belongs to the Master to <i>go out</i> without his consent; and in carefully observing all commerce and correspondence which the heart may have abroad in the world, to the prejudice of the Master's service. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
