<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:35">Mark 13:35</span>. <i><b>Watch ye therefore</b></i> â€” The more the master is expected, the more diligent ought the servants to be in working, watching, and keeping themselves in readiness. Can one who has received the sentence of his death, and has no right to live a moment, need any admonition to prepare to die? Does not a prisoner who expects his deliverance, hold himself in continual readiness to leave his dungeon?</p>
