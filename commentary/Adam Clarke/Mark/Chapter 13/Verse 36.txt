<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:36">Mark 13:36</span>. <i><b>He find you sleeping.</b></i> â€” <i>A porter asleep</i> exposes the house to be <i>robbed</i>, and well deserves punishment. No wonder that the man is constantly suffering loss who is frequently off his guard.</p>
<p>Our Lord shows us in this parable:</p>
<p>1. That himself, <i>ascended to</i> heaven, is the man <i>gone from home</i>.</p>
<p>2. That <i>believers</i> collectively are his <i>family</i>.</p>
<p>3. That <i>his servants</i> are those who are employed in the work of faith and labour of love.</p>
<p>4. That the <i>porter</i> represents the <i>ministers</i> of his Gospel, who should continually watch for the safety and welfare of the whole flock.</p>
<p>5. That every one has <i>his own work </i>- that which belongs to <i>himself</i> and to none other, and for the accomplishment of which he receives sufficient strength from his Lord.</p>
<p>6. That these <i>servants</i> and <i>porters</i> shall give an account to their Lord, how they have exercised themselves in their respective departments.</p>
<p>7. And that as the master of the family will certainly come to require this account at <i>a time</i> when men are <i>not aware</i>, therefore they should be always <i>watchful</i> and <i>faithful</i>. And,</p>
<p>8, That this is a duty incumbent on <i>every soul</i> of man, <i>What I say unto you, I say unto</i> ALL, WATCH! If, after all these warnings, the followers of God be found <i>careless</i>, their misery and condemnation must be great.</p>
