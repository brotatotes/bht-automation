Verse Mark 13:36. He find you sleeping. â€” A porter asleep exposes the house to be robbed, and well deserves punishment. No wonder that the man is constantly suffering loss who is frequently off his guard.Our Lord shows us in this parable:1. That himself, ascended to heaven, is the man gone from home.2. That believers collectively are his family.3. That his servants are those who are employed in the work of faith and labour of love.4. That the porter represents the ministers of his Gospel, who should continually watch for the safety and welfare of the whole flock.5. That every one has his own work - that which belongs to himself and to none other, and for the accomplishment of which he receives sufficient strength from his Lord.6. That these servants and porters shall give an account to their Lord, how they have exercised themselves in their respective departments.7. And that as the master of the family will certainly come to require this account at a time when men are not aware, therefore they should be always watchful and faithful. And,8, That this is a duty incumbent on every soul of man, What I say unto you, I say unto ALL, WATCH! If, after all these warnings, the followers of God be found careless, their misery and condemnation must be great.
