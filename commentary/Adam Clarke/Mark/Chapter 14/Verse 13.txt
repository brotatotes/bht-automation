<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:13">Mark 14:13</span>. <i><b>Bearing a pitcher of water</b></i> â€” How correct is the foreknowledge of Jesus Christ! Even the <i>minutest</i> circumstances are comprehended by it! An <i>honest employment</i>, howsoever <i>mean</i>, is worthy the attention of God; and even a man bearing a <i>pitcher of</i> <i>water</i> is marked in all his steps, and is an object of the merciful regards of the Most High. This man was employed in carrying home the water which was to be used for baking the unleavened bread on the following day; for on that day it was not lawful to carry any: hence they were obliged to fetch it on the preceding evening.</p>
