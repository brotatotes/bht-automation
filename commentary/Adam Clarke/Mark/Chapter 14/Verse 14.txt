<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:14">Mark 14:14</span>. <i><b>Say ye to the good man of the house</b></i> — ειπατε τω οικοδεσποτη - Say ye to the master of the house. The <i>good man</i> and the <i>good woman</i> mean, among us, the <i>master</i> and <i>mistress</i> of the house. A <i>Hindoo</i> woman never calls her husband by his name; but simply, <i>the man of the house</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Where is the guest chamber?</b></i> — Respectable householders, says Mr. Ward, have a room which they call the strangers' room, (<i>utit'</i> <i>hu-shala</i>,) which is especially set apart for the use of guests. This appears to have been the custom in <i>Judea</i> also.</p>
