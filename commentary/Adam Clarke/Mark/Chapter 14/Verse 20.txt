<p>Verse 20. <i><b>That dippeth with me in the dish.</b></i> â€” In the east, persons never eat together from one dish, except when a strong attachment subsists between <i>two</i> or <i>more</i> persons of the <i>same</i> caste; in such a case one invites another to come and sit by him and eat from the same dish. This custom seems to have existed among the Jews; and the sacred historian mentions this notice of our Lord's, <i>It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the</i> <i>dish</i>, to mark more <i>strongly the perfidy</i> of the character of Judas.</p>
