<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</span>. <i><b>Alabaster box</b></i> — Among critics and learned men there are various conjectures concerning the alabaster mentioned by the evangelists: some think it means a <i>glass</i> phial; others, that it signifies a small vessel <i>without a handle</i>, from α negative and λαβη, <i>a handle</i>; and others imagine that it merely signifies a <i>perfume</i> or <i>essence bottle</i>. There are several species of the soft calcareous stone called <i>alabaster</i>, which are enumerated and described in different chemical works.</p>
<p><i><b>Spikenard</b></i> — Or <i>nard</i>. An Indian plant, whose root is very small and slender. It puts forth a long and small stalk, and has several ears or <i>spikes</i> even with the ground, which has given it the name of <i>spikenard</i>: the taste is bitter, acrid, and aromatic, and the smell agreeable. CALMET.</p>
<p><i><b>Very precious</b></i> — Or rather, <i>unadulterated</i>: this I think is the proper meaning of πιστικης. <i>Theophylact</i> gives this interpretation of the passage: "Unadulterated hard, and prepared with fidelity." Some think that πιστικη is a contraction of the Latin <i>spicatae</i>, and that it signifies the <i>spicated</i> nard, or what we commonly call the <i>spikenard</i>. But Dr. Lightfoot gives a different interpretation. πιστικη he supposes to come from the Syriac פיסתקא <i>pistike</i>, which signifies the <i>acorn</i>: he would therefore have it to signify an aromatic confection of <i>nard, maste</i>, or <i>myrobalane</i>. See his <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Talmudical Exercitations</i>; and see <i>Scheuchzer's</i> Physica Sacra.</p>
<p><i><b>She brake the box</b></i> — Rather, <i>she broke the seal</i>. This is the best translation I can give of the place; and I give it for these reasons:</p>
<p>1. That it is not likely that a box exceedingly precious in itself should be <i>broken</i> to get out its contents.</p>
<p>2. That the <i>broken pieces</i> would be very inconvenient if not injurious to the <i>head</i> of our Lord, and to the <i>hands</i> of the woman.</p>
<p>3. That it would not be easy effectually to separate the oil from the <i>broken</i> <i>pieces</i>. And,</p>
<p>4. That it was a custom in the eastern countries to <i>seal</i> the bottles with <i>wax</i> that held the perfumes; so that to come at their contents no more was necessary than to <i>break the seal</i>, which this woman appears to have done; and when the seal was thus broken, she had no more to do than to <i>pour out</i> the liquid ointment, which she could not have done had she broken the bottle.</p>
<p>The bottles which contain the [Hindu] <i>gul i attyr</i>, or attyr of roses, which come from the east, are sealed in this manner. See a number of proofs relative to this point in HARMER'S <i>Observations</i>, vol. iv. 469. Pouring <i>sweet-scented oil</i> on the <i>head</i> is common in Bengal. At the close of the festival of the goddess <i>Doorga</i>, the Hindoos worship the <i>unmarried daughters</i> of <i>Brahmins</i>: and, among other ceremonies, pour <i>sweet-scented oil on their heads</i>.
