<p>Verse 52. <i><b>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them</b></i><b> </b><i><b>naked.</b></i> â€” It has often been intimated, by the inhabitants of <i>India</i>, that a European in strait clothes must be in great danger when his clothes take fire. From their loose clothing they can suddenly disengage themselves. When two Hindoos are engaged in a violent quarrel, and one seizes the clothing of the other, often the latter will leave his clothes in the hands of his opponent, and <i>flee away naked</i>. This seems to have been the case with the person mentioned above. See WARD'S <i>Customs</i>.</p>
