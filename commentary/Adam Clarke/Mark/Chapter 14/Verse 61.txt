<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:61">Mark 14:61</span>. <i><b>Of the Blessed?</b></i> — Θεου του ευλογητου, Or, <i>of God the</i> <i>blessed</i> one. Θεου, is added here by AK, ten others, <i>Vulgate</i>, and one of the <i>Itala</i>. It might be introduced into the text, put in Italics, if the authority of the MSS. and versions be not deemed sufficient. It appears necessary for the better understanding of the text. The adjective, however, conveys a good sense by itself, and is according to a frequent Hebrew form of speech.</p>
