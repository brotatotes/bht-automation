<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:72">Mark 14:72</span>. <i><b>And when he thought thereon, he wept.</b></i> — Or, <i>he fell</i> <i>a weeping</i>. This Mr. <i>Wakefield</i> thinks comes nearest to the original, επιβαλων εκλαιε. Others think it means the wrapping of his head in the skirts of his garment, through shame and anguish. Others think that επιβαλων rather refers to the <i>violence</i>, or <i>hurry</i>, with which he left the place, being <i>impelled</i> thereto by the terrors and remorse of his guilty conscience. Our own translation is as good as any.</p>
