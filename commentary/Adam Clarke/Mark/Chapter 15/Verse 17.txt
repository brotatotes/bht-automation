<p>Verse 17. <i><b>And platted a crown of thorns</b></i> — In the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:29">Matthew 27:29</span>, I have ventured to express a doubt whether our Lord was crowned with <i>thorns</i>, in our sense of the word; this crown being designed as an instrument of torture. I am still of the same opinion, having considered the subject more closely since writing that note. As there I have referred to Bishop Pearce, a man whose merit as a commentator is far beyond my praise, and who, it is to be regretted, did not complete his work on the New Testament, I think it right to insert the whole of his note here.</p>
<p>"The word ακανθων may as well be the plural genitive case of the word ακανθος as of ακανθη: if of the latter, it is rightly translated, <i>of thorns</i>; but the former would signify what we call <i>bear's-foot</i>, and the French, <i>branche ursine</i>. This is not of the thorny kind of plants, but is soft and smooth. Virgil calls it <i>mollis acanthus</i>, Ecl. iii. 45, Geor. iv. 137. So does <i>Pliny, sec</i>. Epist. ver. 6. And Pliny the elder, in his Nat. Hist. xxii. 22, p. 277, edit. Hard., says that it is <i>laevis</i>, smooth; and that it is one of those plants that are cultivated in gardens. I have somewhere read, but cannot at present recollect where, that this soft and smooth herb was very common in and about Jerusalem. I find nothing in the New Testament said concerning this crown, which Pilate's soldiers put on the head of Jesus, to incline one to think that it was of <i>thorns</i>, and intended, as is usually supposed, to put him to pain. The <i>reed</i> put into his hand, and the <i>scarlet robe</i> on his back, were only meant as marks of mockery and contempt. One may also reasonably judge, by the soldiers being said to <i>plat</i> this crown, that it was not composed of such twigs and leaves as were of a <i>thorny</i> nature. I do not find that <i>it</i> is mentioned by any of the primitive Christian writers as an instance of the cruelty used towards our Saviour, before he was led to his crucifixion, till the time of Tertullian, who lived after Jesus's death at the distance of above 160 years. He indeed seems to have understood ακανθων in the sense of <i>thorns</i>, and says, De Corona Militar. sect. xiv. edit. Pamel. Franck. 1597, <i>Quale, oro te,</i> <i>Jesus Christus sertum pro utroque sexu subiit? Ex spinis, opinor,</i> <i>et tribulis</i>. The total silence of Polycarp, Barnabas, Clem. Romanus, and all the other Christian writers whose works are now extant, and who wrote before Tertullian, in particular, will give some weight to incline one to think that this crown was not platted with <i>thorns</i>. But as this is a point on which we have not sufficient evidence, I leave it almost in the same state of uncertainty in which I found it. The reader may see a satisfactory account of <i>acanthus</i>, bear's-foot, in Quincy's English Dispensatory, part ii. sect. 3, edit. 8, 1742."</p>
<p>This is the whole of the learned and judicious prelate's note; on which I have only to observed that the species of <i>acanthus</i> described by <i>Virgil</i> and the two <i>Plinys</i>, as <i>mollis</i> and <i>laevis,</i> soft and smooth, is, no doubt, the same as that formerly used in medicine, and described by Quincy and other pharmacopaeists; but there are other species of the same plant that are <i>prickly</i>, and particularly those called the <i>acanthus spinosus</i>, and the <i>ilicifolius</i>, the latter of which is common in both the Indies: this has leaves something like our common <i>holly</i>, the jagged edges of which are armed with <i>prickles</i>; but I do not conceive that this kind was used, nor indeed any other plant of a <i>thorny</i> nature, as the Roman soldiers who platted the crown could have no interest in adding to our Lord's sufferings; though they smote him with the rod, yet their chief object was to render him <i>ridiculous</i>, for pretending, as they imagined, to <i>regal</i> authority. The common wild <i>acanthas</i> or <i>bear's-foot</i>, which I have often met in the dry <i>turf</i> <i>bogs</i> in Ireland, though it have the appearance of being <i>prickly</i>, yet is not, in fact, so. Several shoots grow from one root, about four or five inches long, and about as thick as a little finger. A parcel of such branches, platted by their roots in a string, night be made to look even ornamental, tied about the temples and round the head. It would finely imitate a crown or diadem. But I know not if this plant be a native of Judea.</p>
