<p>Verse 25. <i><b>The third hour</b></i> — It has been before observed, that the Jews divided their night into <i>four watches</i>, of <i>three hours</i> each. They also divided the <i>day</i> into four general parts. The first began at sunrise. The second three hours after. The third at mid-day. The fourth three hours after, and continued till sunset. Christ having been nailed to the cross a little after <i>mid-day</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14-16">John 19:14-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:17">John 19:17</span>, and having expired about <i>three o'clock</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:33">Mark 15:33</span>, the whole business of the crucifixion was finished within the space of this <i>third division</i> of the day, which Mark calls here the <i>third hour</i>. Commentators and critics have found it very difficult to reconcile this <i>third</i> hour of Mark, with the <i>sixth</i> hour of John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span>. It is supposed that the true reading, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span>, should be τριτη, the <i>third</i>, instead of εκτη the <i>sixth</i>; a mistake which might have readily taken place in ancient times, when the character γ <i>gamma</i>, which was put for τριτη, <i>three</i>, might have been mistaken for Ϛ <i>episema</i>, or <i>sigma tau</i>, which signifies <i>six</i>. And τριτη, the <i>third</i>, instead of εκτη, the <i>sixth</i>, is the reading of some very eminent MSS. in the place in question, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span>. See <i>Bengel, Newcome, Macknight, Lightfoot, Rosenmuller</i>, &amp;c., on this perplexing point.</p>
