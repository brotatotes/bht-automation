<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:43">Mark 15:43</span>. <i><b>Went in boldly unto Pilate</b></i> â€” He who was a coward before now acts a more open, fearless part, than any of the disciples of our Lord! This the Holy Spirit has thought worthy of especial notice. It needed no small measure of courage to <i>declare</i> now for Jesus, who had been a few hours ago condemned as a <i>blasphemer</i> by the <i>Jews</i>, and as a seditious person by the <i>Romans</i>; and this was the more remarkable in <i>Joseph</i>, because hitherto, for <i>fear</i> of the Jews, he had been only a <i>secret</i> disciple of our Lord. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span>.</p>
<p>The apostle says, <i>We have</i> BOLDNESS <i>to enter into the holiest</i> <i>through his blood</i>. Strange as it may appear, the <i>death</i> of Jesus is the grand cause of <i>confidence</i> and <i>courage</i> to a believing soul.</p>
