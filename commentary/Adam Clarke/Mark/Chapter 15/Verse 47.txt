<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:47">Mark 15:47</span>. <i><b>Beheld where he was laid.</b></i> â€” The courage and affection of these holy women cannot be too much admired. The <i>strength of the Lord is perfected in weakness</i>; for here a <i>timid</i> man, and a few <i>weak</i> women, acknowledge Jesus in death, when the <i>strong</i> and the <i>mighty</i> utterly forsook him.</p>
<p>HUMAN <i>strength</i> and human <i>weakness</i> are only <i>names</i> in religion. The <i>mightiest</i> MAN, in the hour of trial, can do nothing without the strength of God; and the <i>weakest</i> WOMAN can do all things, if Christ strengthen her. These truths are sufficiently exemplified in the case of Peter and all his brother disciples on the one hand; and Joseph of Arimathea and the two Marys on the other. And all this is recorded, equally to prevent both <i>presumption</i> and <i>despair</i>. Reader, let not these examples be produced before <i>thee</i> in vain.</p>
