<p>Dr. Lightfoot's criticism upon this passage is worthy of notice.</p>
<p>"That, in the verses immediately going before, the discourse is of the two disciples going to <i>Emmaus</i>, is without all controversy. And then how do these things consist with that relation in <i>Luke</i>, who saith, That <i>they two, returning to Jerusalem, found the eleven</i> <i>gathered together, and they that were with them; who said, The</i> <i>Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:34">Luke 24:34</span>. The word λεγοντας, <i>saying</i>, evidently makes those to be the words των ενδεκα, <i>of the eleven</i>, and of those that were gathered together with them; which, when you read the versions, you would scarcely suspect. For when that word is rendered by the SYRIAC, [Syriac] <i>cad amrin</i>; by the ARABIC, [Arabic] <i>wehom yekolon</i>; by the VULGATE, <i>dicentes</i>; by the ITALIAN, <i>dicendo</i>; by the FRENCH, <i>disans</i>; by the ENGLISH, <i>saying</i>; who, I pray, would take it in another sense, than that those <i>two</i> that returned from <i>Emmaus</i> said, <i>The Lord is risen</i> <i>indeed</i>, c.? But in the original <i>Greek</i>, when it is the <i>accusative</i> case, it is plainly to be referred to the eleven disciples, and those that were together with them as if they had discoursed among themselves of the appearance made to <i>Peter</i>, either before, or now in the very access of those two coming from <i>Emmaus</i>. And yet, says this our evangelist, that when those two had related the whole business, they gave no credit to them; so that, according to <i>Luke</i>, they believed Christ was risen, and had appeared to Simon, before they told their story; but, according to <i>Mark</i>, they believed it <i>not</i>, no, not <i>when they had told it</i>. The reconciling therefore of the evangelists is to be fetched thence, that those words pronounced by the eleven, Ὁτι ηγερθη ὁ Κυριος οντως, c., <i>The Lord is risen indeed</i>, &amp;c., do not manifest their absolute confession of the resurrection of <i>Christ</i>, but a conjectural reasoning of the sudden and unexpected return of <i>Peter</i>. I believe that <i>Peter</i> was going with Cleophas into <i>Galilee</i>, and that being moved with the words of <i>Christ</i>, told him by the women, <i>Say to his</i> <i>disciples and Peter, I go before you into Galilee</i>-think with yourself how doubtful <i>Peter</i> was, and how he fluctuated within himself after his threefold denial, and how he gasped to see the Lord again, if he were risen, and to cast himself an humble suppliant at his feet. When therefore he heard these things from the women, (and he had heard it indeed from <i>Christ</i> himself, while he was yet alive, that when he arose he would go before them into <i>Galilee</i>,) and when the rest were very little moved with the report of his resurrection, nor as yet stirred from that place, he will try a journey into <i>Galilee</i>, and <i>Alpheus</i> with him which, when it was well known to the rest, and they saw him return so soon and so unexpectedly - Certainly, say they, the Lord is risen, and hath appeared to <i>Peter</i>, otherwise he had not so soon come back again. And yet, when he and <i>Cleophas</i> open the whole matter, they do not yet believe even <i>them</i>."</p>
