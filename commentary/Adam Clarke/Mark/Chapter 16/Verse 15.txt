Verse Mark 16:15. Go ye into all the world — Matthew 28:19.And preach the Gospel to every creature. — Proclaim the glad tidings - of Christ crucified; and raised from the dead - to all the creation, πασῃ τῃ κτισει - to the Gentile worid; for in this sense בריות berioth, is often understood among the rabbins; because HE, through the grace of God, hath tasted death for EVERY man, Hebrews 2:9. And on the rejection of the Gospel by the Jews, it was sent to the whole Gentile world.
