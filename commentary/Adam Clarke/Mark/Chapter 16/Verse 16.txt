<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span>. <i><b>He that believeth</b></i> â€” He that credits this Gospel as a revelation from God: <i>and is baptized </i>- takes upon him the <i>profession</i> of it, obliging himself to walk <i>according</i> to its <i>precepts: he</i> <i>shall be saved</i>-redeemed from sin here, and brought at last to the enjoyment of my eternal glory. <i>But he that believeth not, shall</i> <i>be damned</i>-because he rejects the <i>only</i> provision that could be effectual to his soul's salvation.</p>
