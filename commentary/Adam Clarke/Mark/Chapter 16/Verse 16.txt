Verse Mark 16:16. He that believeth â€” He that credits this Gospel as a revelation from God: and is baptized - takes upon him the profession of it, obliging himself to walk according to its precepts: he shall be saved-redeemed from sin here, and brought at last to the enjoyment of my eternal glory. But he that believeth not, shall be damned-because he rejects the only provision that could be effectual to his soul's salvation.
