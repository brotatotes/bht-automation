<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Take up serpents</b></i> — Several MSS. add εν ταις χερσιν, <i>in their hands </i>- shall be enabled to give, when such a proof may be serviceable to the cause of truth, this evidence of their being continually under the <i>power</i> and <i>protection</i> of God, and that <i>all</i> <i>nature</i> is subject to him. This also was literally fulfilled in the case of Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:5">Acts 28:5</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>If they drink any deadly thing</b></i> — θανασιμον (φαρμακον) being understood-if they should through <i>mistake</i>, or <i>accident</i>, drink any poisonous matter, their <i>constant preserver</i> will take care that it shall not injure them. See a similar promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:2">Isaiah 43:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>They shall lay hands on the sick</b></i> — And I will convey a healing power by their hands, so that the sick shall recover, and men shall see that these are <i>sent</i> and <i>acknowledged</i> by the Most High. Several instances of this kind are found in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>That the <i>apostles</i> of our Lord should not lose their lives by <i>poison</i> is most fully asserted in this verse, and there is neither <i>record</i> nor <i>tradition</i> to disprove this. But it is worthy of remark, that <i>Mohammed</i>, who styled himself THE APOSTLE OF GOD, lost his life by <i>poison</i>; and had he been a <i>true</i> apostle of God, he could not have fallen by it. <i>Al Kodai, Abul Feda</i>, and <i>Al Janabi</i>, give the following account.</p>
<p>When Mohammed, in the seventh year of the Hejra, A. D. 628, had taken the city of <i>Kheebar</i>, from the Arab Jews, he took up his lodgings at the house of <i>Hareth</i>, the father of <i>Marhab</i> the Jewish general, who had been slain at the taking of the city by <i>Alee</i>, the son-in-law of <i>Mohammed. Zeenab</i> the daughter of <i>Hareth</i>, who was appointed to dress the prophet's dinner, to avenge the fall of her people, and the death of her brother, put poison in a roasted lamb which was provided for the occasion. <i>Bashar</i>, one of his companions, falling on too hastily, fell dead on the spot. <i>Mohammed</i> had only chewed one mouthful, but had not swallowed it: though, on perceiving that it was poisoned, he immediately spat it out, yet he had swallowed a sufficiency of the juice to lay the foundation of his death; though this did not take place till about <i>three</i> years after: but that it was the cause of his death <i>then</i>, his dying words related by <i>Al Janabi</i>, and others, sufficiently testify. When the mother of <i>Bashar</i> came to see him in his dying agonies, he thus addressed her: "O mother of <i>Bashar</i>, I now feel the veins of my heart bursting through the poison of that morsel which I ate with thy son at <i>Kheebar</i>."</p>
<p><i>Abul Feda, Ebnol Athir</i>, and <i>Ebn Phares</i> say, that the prophet acknowledged on his death-bed, that the poison which he had taken at <i>Kheebar</i> had tormented him from that time until then, notwithstanding blisters were applied to his shoulders, and every thing done in the beginning to prevent its effects. <i>Al Kodai</i> and <i>Al Janabi</i> relate, that when <i>Zeenab</i> was questioned why she did this, she answered to this effect: "I said in my heart, If he be a <i>king</i>, we shall hereby be freed from his <i>tyranny</i>; and if he be a <i>prophet</i>, he will easily <i>perceive</i> it, and consequently receive no injury." To support his credit, he pretended that the lamb spoke to him, and said that it was infected with poison! See <i>Elmakin</i>, p. 8. It was therefore policy in him not to put <i>Zeenab</i> to death. It has pleased God that this <i>fact</i> should be acknowledged by the dying breath of this scourge of the earth; and that several of even the most <i>partial</i> Mohammedan historians should relate it! And, thus attested, it stands for the complete and everlasting refutation of his pretensions to the <i>prophetic spirit</i> and <i>mission</i>. Vide <i>Specimen Hist. Arabum</i>, a POCOCKIO, p. 189, 190. Le <i>Coran</i> traduit par SAVARY, vol. i; p. 135, and 212. See also, The <i>Life</i> <i>of Mohammed</i> by PRIDEAUX, 93, 101.</p>
