Though miraculous powers are not <i>now</i> requisite, because the truth of the Gospel has been sufficiently confirmed, yet this <i>co-operation</i> of God is indispensably necessary, without which no man can be a successful preacher; and without which no soul can be saved.</p>

<p>St. Jerome mentions certain Greek copies, which have the following remarkable addition to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>, after these words - <i>and reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart,</i> <i>because they did not believe those who had seen him after he was</i> <i>raised up: Et illi satisfaciebant dicentes: seculum istud</i> <i>iniquitatis et incredulitatis substantia est, quae non sinit per</i> <i>immundos spiritus verem Dei apprehendi virtutem. Idcirco, jam</i> <i>nunc revela justitiam tuam</i>. "And they confessed the charge, saying: This age is the substance of iniquity and unbelief, which, through the influence of impure spirits, does not permit the true influence of God to be apprehended. Therefore, even now, reveal thy righteousness."</p>
<p>There are various <i>subscriptions</i> to this book in the MSS. and versions; the principal are the following: "<i>The holy Gospel</i> <i>according to Mark is ended written by him - in</i> EGYPT - <i>in</i> ROME - <i>in the</i> <i>Latin tongue-directed by Peter the 10th-12th year after the</i> <i>ascension of Christ - preached in Alexandria, and all its coasts</i>." Dr. Lardner supposes this Gospel to have been composed A. D. 64 or 65, and published before the end of the last mentioned year. See the Preface. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:1">Mark 1:1</span></p>
<p>The Gospel according to Mark, if not an <i>abridgment</i> of the Gospel according to Matthew, contains a neat, perspicuous abridgment of the <i>history of our Lord</i>; and, taken in this point of view, is very satisfactory; and is the most proper of all the four Gospels to be put into the hands of <i>young</i> persons, in order to bring them to an acquaintance with the <i>great facts</i> of evangelical history. But as a <i>substitute</i> for the Gospel by Matthew, it should never be used. It is very likely that it was written originally for the use of the <i>Gentiles</i>, and probably for those of <i>Rome</i>. Of this, there seem to be several evidences in the work itself. Of the other Gospels it is not only a grand corroborating evidence, but contains many valuable hints for completing the history of our Lord, which have been omitted by the others; and thus, in the mouths of FOUR <i>witnesses</i>, all these glorious and interesting facts are established.</p>
<p>One thing may be observed, that this Gospel has suffered more by the carelessness and inaccuracy of transcribers than any of the others: and hence the <i>various readings</i> in the MSS. are much more numerous, in proportion, than in the other evangelists. Every thing of this description, which I judged to be of real importance, I have carefully noted.</p>
<p>Though the <i>matter</i> of St. Mark's work came from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, yet the <i>language</i> seems to be entirely <i>his own</i>: it is very plain, simple, and unadorned; and sometimes appears to approach to a degree of rusticity or inelegance. Whoever reads the original must be struck with the very frequent, and often pleonastic, occurrence of ευθεως, <i>immediately</i>, and παλιν, <i>again</i>, and such like; but these detract nothing from the accuracy and fidelity of the work. The <i>Hebraisms</i> which abound in it may be naturally expected from a native of Palestine, writing in Greek. The <i>Latinisms</i> which frequently occur are accounted for on the ground of this Gospel being written for the <i>Gentiles</i>, and particularly for the Roman people: this, it must be confessed, is only <i>theory</i>, but it is a theory which stands supported by many arguments, and highly presumptive facts. However this may be, the <i>Gospel according to Mark</i> is a very important portion of Divine revelation, which God has preserved by a chain of providences, from the time of its promulgation until now; and for which no truly pious reader will hesitate to render due praise to that God whose work is ever <i>perfect</i>. Amen.</p>
