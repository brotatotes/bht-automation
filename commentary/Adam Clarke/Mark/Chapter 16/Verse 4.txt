<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:4">Mark 16:4</span>. <i><b>For it was very great</b></i> â€” This clause should be read immediately after the <i>third</i> verse, according to D, <i>three</i> copies of the <i>Itala, Syriac, Hier</i>., and <i>Eusebius</i>. "Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? for it was very great. And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away." They knew that the stone was too heavy for them to roll away; and, unless they got access to the body, they could not apply the aromatics which they had brought to finish the embalming.</p>
