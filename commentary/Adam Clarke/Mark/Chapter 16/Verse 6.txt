<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:6">Mark 16:6</span>. <i><b>Jesus of Nazareth</b></i> â€” The Jews had given this name to Christ by way of <i>reproach</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:23">Matthew 2:23</span>; but as it was under this name that he was crucified, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:19">John 19:19</span>, the angel here, and the apostles after, have given him the same name, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:10">Acts 4:10</span>, c. <i>Names</i> which the world, in derision, fixes all the followers of God, often become the general appellatives of religious bodies: thus <i>Quakers, Puritans, Pietists</i>, and <i>Methodists</i>, have in their respective times been the <i>nicknames</i>, given in derision by the world, to those who separated themselves from its corruptions. Our Lord, by continuing to bear the name of the <i>Nazarene</i>, teaches us not to be too <i>nice</i> or <i>scrupulous</i> in fixing our own <i>appellation.</i> No matter what the name may be, as long as it implies no particular <i>evil</i>, and serves sufficiently to mark us out. Let us be contented to bear it, and thus carry about with us the <i>reproach</i> of Christ always taking care to keep our garments unspotted from the world.</p>
