Verse Mark 16:7. Tell his disciples and Peter â€” Why is not Peter included among the disciples? For this plain reason,-he had forfeited his discipleship, and all right to the honour and privileges of an apostle, by denying his Lord and Master. However, he is now a penitent: - tell him that Jesus is risen from the dead, and is ready to heal his backsliding, and love him freely; so that, after being converted, he may strengthen his brethren.
