<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:7">Mark 16:7</span>. <i><b>Tell his disciples and Peter</b></i> â€” Why is not Peter included among the disciples? For this plain reason,-he had forfeited his <i>discipleship</i>, and all right to the honour and privileges of an <i>apostle</i>, by <i>denying</i> his Lord and Master. However, he is now a <i>penitent</i>: - tell him that Jesus is risen from the dead, and is ready to heal <i>his</i> backsliding, and love <i>him</i> freely; so that, after being converted, he may strengthen his brethren.</p>
