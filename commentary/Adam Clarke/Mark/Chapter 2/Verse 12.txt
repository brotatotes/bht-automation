<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:12">Mark 2:12</span>. <i><b>He - took up the bed</b></i> â€” The words of PROSPER, on this place, are worthy of notice:-</p>
<p>"What is sin but a deplorable fall, a grovelling on the earth, a repose in the creature, often followed by a universal <i>palsy</i> of the soul; namely, an utter inability to help itself, to break off its evil habits, to walk in the ways of God, to rise or to take one good step towards him? Grace can repair all in a moment: because it is nothing but the almighty will of God, who <i>commands</i> and <i>does</i> whatever he commands."</p>
