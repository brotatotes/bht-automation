<p>Verse 17. <i><b>To repentance.</b></i> — This is omitted by ABDKL, twenty-seven others; both the <i>Syriac, Persic, Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Gothic, Vulgate</i>; six copies of the <i>Itala; Euthymius</i> and <i>Augustin</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text; <i>Grotius, Mill</i>, and <i>Bengel</i> approve of the omission. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span></span>. I leave it as in the parallel place above quoted. Properly speaking, the <i>righteous</i> cannot be called to <i>repentance</i>. They have <i>already</i> forsaken sin, mourned for it, and turned to God. In the other parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:32">Luke 5:32</span>, all the MSS. and versions retain μετανοιαν, <i>repentance</i>.</p>
