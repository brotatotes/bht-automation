<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees</b></i><b> </b><i><b>fast</b></i> â€” See this largely explained on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:14">Matthew 9:14</span>, c. The following vices are very common to <i>Pharisees</i>.</p>
<p>1. They are more busied in censuring the conduct of others than in rectifying their own.</p>
<p>2. They desire that every one should regulate his piety by theirs and embrace their particular customs and forms of devotion.</p>
<p>3. They speak of and compare themselves with other people, only that they may have an opportunity of distinguishing and exalting themselves.</p>
<p>On the nature, times, and duration of fasting, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:16">Matthew 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:15">Matthew 9:15</span>.</p>
