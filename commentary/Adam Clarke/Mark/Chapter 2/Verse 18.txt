Verse 18. Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast â€” See this largely explained on Matthew 9:14, c. The following vices are very common to Pharisees.1. They are more busied in censuring the conduct of others than in rectifying their own.2. They desire that every one should regulate his piety by theirs and embrace their particular customs and forms of devotion.3. They speak of and compare themselves with other people, only that they may have an opportunity of distinguishing and exalting themselves.On the nature, times, and duration of fasting, see Matthew 6:16; Matthew 9:15.
