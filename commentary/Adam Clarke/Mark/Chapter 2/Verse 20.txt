<p>Verse 20. <i><b>In those days.</b></i> — But instead of εν εκειναις ταις ἡμεραις, many of the best MSS. and versions read, εν εκεινῃ τῃ ἡμερᾳ, in that day; viz. the day in which Jesus Christ should be delivered up to the Jews and Gentiles. <i>Mill</i> and <i>Bengel</i> approve of this reading, and <i>Griesbach</i> adopts it. The former part of the verse seems to vindicate the common reading.</p>
