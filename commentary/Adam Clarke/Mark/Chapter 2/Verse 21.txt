<p>Verse 21. <i><b>No man - seweth</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>. <i>No man seweth a piece of unscoured cloth upon an old garment</i>. In the common editions this verse begins with και, <i>and</i>, but this is omitted by almost every MS. and version of note. The construction of the whole verse is various in the MSS. The translation given here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>, is intelligible, and speaks for itself.</p>
