<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:26">Mark 2:26</span>. <i><b>The days of Abiathar the high priest</b></i> — It appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+21:1">1 Samuel 21:1</span>, which is the place referred to here, that <i>Ahimelech</i> was then high priest at <i>Nob</i>: and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+22:20">1 Samuel 22:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+23:6">1 Samuel 23:6</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+18:16">1 Chronicles 18:16</span>, it appears that <i>Abiathar</i> was the son of Ahimelech. The Persic reads <i>Abimelech</i> instead of <i>Abiathar. Theophylact</i> supposes that Abiathar was the <i>priest</i>, and Ahimelech or Abimelech the <i>high</i> <i>priest</i>, and thus endeavours to reconcile both the sacred historians. Others reconcile the accounts thus: Ahimelech was called <i>Ahimelech Abiathar</i>, אב ab, father, understood; and Abiathar was called <i>Abiathar Ahimelech</i>, בן ben, son, understood. Probably they both officiated in the <i>high priesthood</i>; and the <i>name</i> of the office was indifferently applied to either.</p>
