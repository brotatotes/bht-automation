<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:27">Mark 2:27</span>. <i><b>The Sabbath was made for man</b></i> â€” That he might have the <i>seventh</i> part of his whole time to devote to the purposes of bodily rest and spiritual exercises. And in these respects it is of infinite use to mankind. Where no Sabbath is observed, there disease, poverty, and profligacy, generally prevail. Had we no Sabbath, we should soon have no <i>religion</i>. This whole verse is wanting in the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, and in five of the <i>Itala</i>.</p>
