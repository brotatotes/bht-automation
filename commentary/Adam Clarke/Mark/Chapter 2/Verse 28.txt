<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:28">Mark 2:28</span>. <i><b>The Son of man is Lord</b></i> â€” See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:7-8">Matthew 12:7-8</span>. Some have understood this as applying to <i>men in general</i>, and not to Christ. <i>The Son of man</i>, any man <i>is Lord of the Sabbath</i>; i.e. it was made for him, for his ease, comfort, and use, and to these purposes he is to apply it. But this is a very <i>harsh</i>, and at the same time a very <i>lax</i>, mode of interpretation; for it seems to say that a man may make what use <i>he pleases</i> of the Sabbath; and, were this true, the moral obligation of the Sabbath would soon be annihilated.</p>
<p>GOD ordained the Sabbath not only to be a type of that <i>rest</i> which remains for the people of God, but to be also a mean of promoting the welfare of men in general.</p>
<p>The ordinances of religion should be regulated according to their <i>end</i>, which is the honour of God, and the salvation of men. It is the property of the <i>true religion</i> to contain nothing in it but what is beneficial to man. Hereby God plainly shows that it is neither out of indigence or interest that he requires men to worship and obey him; but only out of goodness, and to make them happy. God prohibited work on the Sabbath day, lest servants should be oppressed by their masters, that the labouring beasts might have necessary rest, and that men might have a proper opportunity to attend upon his ordinances, and get their souls saved. To the Sabbath, under God, we owe much of what is requisite and necessary as well for the <i>body</i> as the <i>soul</i>.</p>
