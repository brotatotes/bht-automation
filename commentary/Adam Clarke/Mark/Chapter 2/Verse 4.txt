<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:4">Mark 2:4</span>. <i><b>They uncovered the roof</b></i> â€” The houses in the east are generally made <i>flat-roofed</i>, that the inhabitants may have the benefit of taking the air on them; they are also furnished with battlements round about, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+22:8">Deuteronomy 22:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+16:27">Judges 16:27</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+11:2">2 Samuel 11:2</span>, to prevent persons from falling off; and have a trap door by which they descend into the house. This door, it appears, was too narrow to let down the sick man and his couch; so <i>they uncovered</i> <i>the roof</i>, removed a part of the <i>tiles</i>; and <i>having broken it up</i>, taken away the <i>laths</i> or <i>timber</i>, to which the tiles had been <i>attached</i>, they then had room to let down the afflicted man.
