<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:10">Mark 3:10</span>. <i><b>They pressed upon him</b></i> — <i>Rushed upon him</i>, επιπιπτειν - through eagerness to have their spiritual and bodily maladies immediately removed.</p>
<p><i><b>Plagues.</b></i> — Rather <i>disorders</i>, μαστιγας; properly such disorders as were inflicted by the Lord. The word <i>plague</i> also tends to mislead.</p>
