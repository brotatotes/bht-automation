<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:11">Mark 3:11</span>. <i><b>Thou art the Son of God.</b></i> — Two MSS., and the later <i>Syriac</i>, have, <i>Thou art the Christ, the Son of God</i>. One of Stephens's MSS. has, <i>Thou art the Holy One of God</i>. A MS. in the library of Leicester has, συ ει ὁ Θεος, υἱος, <i>Thou art</i> GOD, <i>the</i> <i>Son</i>. This is an uncommon reading, which is not confirmed by any MS. yet discovered.</p>
