Verse Mark 3:11. Thou art the Son of God. — Two MSS., and the later Syriac, have, Thou art the Christ, the Son of God. One of Stephens's MSS. has, Thou art the Holy One of God. A MS. in the library of Leicester has, συ ει ὁ Θεος, υἱος, Thou art GOD, the Son. This is an uncommon reading, which is not confirmed by any MS. yet discovered.
