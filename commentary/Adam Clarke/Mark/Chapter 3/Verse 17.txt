<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Sons of thunder</b></i> — A Hebraism for <i>thunderers</i>; probably so named because of their <i>zeal</i> and <i>power</i> in preaching the Gospel.</p>
<p>The term <i>Boanerges</i> is neither Hebrew nor Syriac. Calmet and others think that there is reason to believe that the Greek transcribers have not copied it exactly. בני רעם <i>beney raam</i>, which the ancient Greeks would pronounce <i>Beneregem</i>, and which means <i>sons of thunder</i>, was probably the appellative used by our Lord: or בני רעש <i>beni reges, sons of tempest</i>, which comes nearest to the <i>Boanerges</i> of the evangelist. St. Jerome, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+1:0">Daniel 1:0</span>:, gives בני רעם (which he writes <i>Benereem</i>, softening the sound of the ע <i>ain</i>) as the more likely reading, and Luther, supposing our Lord spoke in Hebrew, gives the proper Hebrew term above mentioned, which he writes <i>Bnehargem</i>. Some think that the reason why our Lord gave this appellative to the sons of Zebedee was, their desire to bring fire down from heaven, i.e. a storm of thunder and lightning, to overturn and consume a certain Samaritan village, the inhabitants of which would not receive their Master. See the account in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:53-54">Luke 9:53-54</span>. It was a very usual thing among the Jews to give surnames, which signified some particular quality or excellence, to their rabbins. See several instances in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
