<p>Verse 21. <i><b>His friends</b></i> — Or, <i>relations</i>. On this verse several MSS. differ considerably. I have followed the reading of the Syriac, because I think it the best: οιπαραυτου signify merely <i>his relatives, his brethren</i>, c., see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31">Mark 3:31</span> and the phrase is used by the best writers to signify <i>relatives, companions</i>, and <i>domestics</i>. See <i>Kypke</i> in loc.</p>
<p><i><b>They said, He is beside himself.</b></i> — It was the enemies of Christ that raised this report; and his relatives, probably thinking that it was true, went to confine him. Let a Christian but neglect the care of his body for a time, in striving to enter in at the strait gate; let a minister of Christ but impair his health by his pastoral labours; presently "he is distracted;" he has "not the least conduct nor discretion." But let a man forget his soul, let him destroy his health by debaucheries, let him expose his life through ambition, and he may, notwithstanding, pass for a very <i>prudent</i> and <i>sensible</i> man!</p>
<p><i>Schoettgen</i> contends that the <i>multitude</i>, and not <i>Christ</i>, is here intended. Christ was in the house: the multitude, οχλος, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:20">Mark 3:20</span>, pressed upon him so that he could not eat bread. His disciples, or friends, went out, κρατησαι αυτον (<i>scil</i>. οχλον,) to restrain <i>it</i>, viz. the multitude, to prevent them from rushing into the house and disturbing their Master, who was now taking some refreshment. This conjecture should not be lightly regarded.</p>
