<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31">Mark 3:31</span>. <i><b>His brethren and his mother</b></i> — Or rather, <i>his mother</i> <i>and his brethren</i>. This is the arrangement of the best and most ancient MSS.; and this clause, και αἱ αδελφαι σου, <i>and thy</i> <i>sisters</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:32">Mark 3:32</span>, should be ADDED, on the authority of ADEFGMSUV, <i>fifty-five</i> others, some editions, the margin of the later <i>Syriac,</i> <i>Slavonic, Gothic</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i> except four. <i>Griesbach</i> has received this reading into the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Calling him.</b></i> — This clause is wanting in one copy of the <i>Itala</i>. The <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> has ζητουντες αυτον, <i>seeking him</i>.</p>
