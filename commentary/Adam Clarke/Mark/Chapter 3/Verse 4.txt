<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:4">Mark 3:4</span>. <i><b>To do good - or - evil? to save life, or to kill?</b></i> — It was a maxim with the Jews, as it should be with all men, that he who neglected to preserve life when it was in his power, was to be reputed a murderer. Every principle of sound justice requires that he should be considered in this light. But, if this be the case, how many murderers are there against whom there is no law but the law of God!</p>
<p><i>To kill </i>- but instead of αποκτειναι, several MSS. and versions have απολεσαι to <i>destroy</i>. <i>Wetstein</i> and <i>Griesbach</i> quote <i>Theophylact</i> for this reading; but it is not in my copy. Paris edit. 1635.</p>
