<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>. <i><b>With anger, being grieved for the hardness of their</b></i> <i>hearts</i>] These words are not found in any of the other evangelists. For πωρωσει <i>hardness</i>, or rather <i>callousness</i>, the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, and four of the <i>Itala</i>, read νεκρωσει, <i>deadness</i>; the <i>Vulgate</i> and some of the <i>Itala, caecitate, blindness</i>. Join all these together, and they will scarcely express the fulness of this people's wretchedness. By a long resistance to the <i>grace</i> and <i>Spirit</i> of God, their hearts had become <i>callous</i>; they were past <i>feeling</i>. By a long opposition to the <i>light</i> of God, they became <i>dark</i> in their understanding, were <i>blinded</i> by the deceitfulness of sin, and thus were past <i>seeing</i>. By a long continuance in the <i>practice</i> of every evil work, they were cut off from all union with God, the fountain of spiritual life; and, becoming <i>dead</i> in trespasses and sins, they were incapable of any <i>resurrection</i> but through a miraculous power of God.</p>
<p><i>With anger</i>. What was the anger which our Lord felt? That which proceeded from excessive grief, which was occasioned by their obstinate stupidity and blindness: therefore it was no uneasy passion, but an excess of generous grief.</p>
<p><i><b>Whole as the other.</b></i> — This is omitted by the best MSS. and versions. <i>Grotius, Mill</i>, and <i>Bengel</i> approve of the omission, and <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it out of the text.</p>
