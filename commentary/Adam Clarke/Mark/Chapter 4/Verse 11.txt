<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11">Mark 4:11</span>. <i><b>Unto you it is given to know</b></i> — γνωναι, <i>to know</i>, is omitted by ABKL, ten others, the <i>Coptic</i>, and one of the <i>Itala</i>. The omission of this word makes a material alteration in the sense; for without it the passage may be read thus: - <i>To you the</i> <i>mystery of the kingdom of God is given; but all these things are</i> <i>transacted in parables to those without</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it doubtful. And Professor <i>White</i> says, <i>probabiliter</i> delendum. I should be inclined to omit it, were it not found in the parallel passages in Matthew and Luke, in neither of whom it is omitted by any MS. or version. See the dissertation on <i>parabolical writing</i> at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:58">Matthew 13:58</span>.</p>
