<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:15">Mark 4:15</span>. <b>THESE </b><i><b>are they</b></i> — Probably our Lord here refers to the people to whom he had just now preached, and who, it is likely, did not profit by the word spoken.</p>
<p><i><b>Where the word is sown</b></i> — Instead of this clause, four copies of the <i>Itala</i> read the place thus - <i>They who are sown by the way side,</i> <i>are they</i> WHO RECEIVE THE WORD NEGLIGENTLY. There are thousands of this stamp in the Christian world. Reader, art <i>thou</i> one of them?</p>
