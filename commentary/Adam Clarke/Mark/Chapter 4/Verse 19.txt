<p>Verse 19. <i><b>The deceitfulness of riches</b></i> â€” This is variously expressed in different copies of the Itala: <i>the errors - delights of</i> <i>the world - completely alienated (abolienati) by the pleasures of</i> <i>the world. The lusts of other things </i>- which have not been included in the <i>anxious cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of</i> <i>riches</i>. All, all, <i>choke the word</i>!</p>
