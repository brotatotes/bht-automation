<p>Verse 24. <i><b>And unto you that hear shall more be given.</b></i> â€” This clause is wanting in DG, <i>Coptic</i>, and four copies of the <i>Itala</i>; and in others, where it is extant, it is variously written. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text, and supposes it to be a gloss, <i>Whosoever hath, to him shall be given</i>.</p>
