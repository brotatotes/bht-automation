<p>Verse 26. <i><b>So is the kingdom of God</b></i> â€” This parable is mentioned only by Mark, a proof that Mark did not <i>abridge</i> Matthew. Whitby supposes it to refer to the good ground spoken of before, and paraphrases is thus: - "What I have said of the seed sown upon good ground, may be illustrated by this parable. The doctrine of the kingdom, received in a good and honest heart, is like seed sown by a man in his ground, properly prepared to receive it; for when he hath sown it, he sleeps and wakes day after day, and, looking on it, he sees it spring and grow up through the virtue of the earth in which it is sown, though he knows not how it doth so; and when he finds it ripe, he reaps it, and so receives the benefit of the sown seed. So is it here: the seed sown in the good and honest heart brings forth fruit with patience; and this fruit daily increaseth, though we know not how the Word and Spirit work that increase; and then Christ the husbandman, at the time of the harvest, gathers in this good seed into the kingdom of heaven." I see no necessity of inquiring how <i>Christ</i> may be said to <i>sleep</i> and <i>rise night</i> and <i>day; Christ</i> being like to this husbandman only in <i>sowing</i> and <i>reaping</i> the seed.</p>
