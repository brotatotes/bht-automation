Verse 28. Bringeth forth - of herself — αυτοματη. By its own energy, without either the influence or industry of man. Similar to this is the expression of the poet: -The full corn — πληρησιτον, FULL wheat; the perfect, full-grown, or ripe corn. Lucian uses κενος καρπος, EMPTY fruit, for imperfect, or unripe fruit. See Kypke.The kingdom of God, which is generated in the soul by the word of life, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, is first very small; there is only a blade, but this is full of promise, for a good blade shows there is a good seed at bottom, and that the soil in which it is sown is good also. Then the ear-the strong stalk grows up, and the ear is formed at the top; the faith and love of the believing soul increase abundantly; it is justified freely through the redemption that is in Christ; it has the ear which is shortly to be filled with the ripe grain, the outlines of the whole image of God. Then the full corn. The soul is purified from all unrighteousness; and, having escaped the corruption that is in the world, it is made a partaker of the Divine nature, and is filled with all the fulness of God.
