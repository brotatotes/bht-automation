<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Bringeth forth - of herself</b></i> — αυτοματη. By its own energy, without either the influence or industry of man. Similar to this is the expression of the poet: -</p>
<p><i><b>The full corn</b></i> — πληρησιτον, FULL <i>wheat</i>; the <i>perfect,</i> <i>full-grown</i>, or <i>ripe corn</i>. Lucian uses κενος καρπος, EMPTY <i>fruit</i>, for <i>imperfect</i>, or <i>unripe</i> fruit. See <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God, which is generated in the soul by the word of life, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, is first <i>very</i> <i>small</i>; there is only a <i>blade</i>, but this is full of <i>promise</i>, for a <i>good blade</i> shows there is a <i>good seed</i> at bottom, and that the <i>soil</i> in which it is sown is <i>good</i> also. <i>Then the ear</i>-the <i>strong stalk</i> grows up, and the ear is formed at the top; the faith and love of the believing soul increase abundantly; it is <i>justified</i> freely through the redemption that is in Christ; it has the <i>ear</i> which is shortly to be filled with the <i>ripe</i> grain, the <i>outlines</i> of the whole image of God. <i>Then the full corn</i>. The soul is <i>purified</i> from all unrighteousness; and, having escaped the corruption that is in the world, it is made a partaker of the Divine nature, and is filled with all the fulness of God.</p>
