<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:29">Mark 4:29</span>. <i><b>He putteth in the sickle</b></i> — αποστελλει, <i>he sendeth</i> <i>out the sickle</i>, i.e. <i>the reapers</i>; the <i>instrument</i>, by a metonomy, being put for the <i>persons</i> who use it. This is a common figure. It has been supposed that our Lord intimates here that, <i>as soon</i> as a soul is made completely holy, it is <i>taken</i> into the kingdom of God. But certainly the parable does not say so. When the corn is ripe, it is reaped for the <i>benefit</i> of him who sowed it; for it can be of little or no <i>use</i> till it be <i>ripe</i>: so when a soul is <i>saved</i> from <i>all sin</i>, it is capable of being fully employed in the work of the Lord: it is then, and not till <i>then</i>, fully fitted for the Master's use. God saves men to the uttermost, that they may <i>here</i> perfectly love him, and worthily magnify his name. To take them away the moment they are capable of doing this, would be, so far, to deprive the <i>world</i> and the <i>Church</i> of the manifestation of the <i>glory</i> of his <i>grace</i>. "But the text says, <i>he immediately sendeth</i> <i>out the sickle</i>; and this means that the person <i>dies</i>, and is taken into glory, <i>as soon</i> as he is <i>fit</i> for it." No, for there may be millions of cases, where, though to <i>die</i> would be <i>gain</i>, yet to live may be far better for the Church, and for an increase of the life of Christ to the soul. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:21">Philippians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:24">Philippians 1:24</span>. Besides, if we attempt to make the parable speak here what <i>seems</i> to be implied in the <i>letter</i>, then we may say, with equal propriety, that Christ <i>sleeps</i> and <i>wakes</i> alternately; and that his own grace grows, <i>he knows not</i> <i>how</i>, in the heart in which he has planted it.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:27">Mark 4:27</span>.</p>
<p>On these two parables we may remark: -</p>
<p>1. That a preacher is a person <i>employed by God</i>, and <i>sent</i> out to <i>sow</i> the <i>good seed</i> of his kingdom in the <i>souls</i> of men.</p>
<p>2. That it is a sin against God to <i>stay</i> in the <i>field</i> and not <i>sow</i>.</p>
<p>3. That it is a sin to <i>pretend</i> to <i>sow</i>, when a man is not furnished by the <i>keeper</i> of the granary with <i>any more seed</i>.</p>
<p>4. That it is a high offence against God to <i>change</i> the <i>Master's</i> <i>seed</i>, to <i>mix it</i>, or to sow <i>bad seed</i> in the <i>place</i> of it.</p>
<p>5. That he is not a <i>seeds-man</i> of <i>God</i> who <i>desires</i> to sow by the <i>way side</i>, c., and not on the proper ground, i.e. he who loves to preach only to <i>genteel</i> congregations, to people of <i>sense</i> and <i>fashion</i>, and feels it a <i>pain</i> and a <i>cross</i> to labour among the <i>poor</i> and the <i>ignorant</i>.</p>
<p>6. That he who sows with a simple, upright heart, the seed of his Master, shall (though some may be unfruitful) see the seed take deep root and, notwithstanding the <i>unfaithfulness</i> and <i>sloth</i> of many of his hearers, he shall doubtless <i>come with rejoicing,</i> <i>bringing his sheaves with him</i>. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
