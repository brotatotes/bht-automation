<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?</b></i> â€” How amiable is this carefulness of Jesus! How instructive to the preachers of his word! He is not solicitous to seek <i>fine turns</i> of eloquence to charm the minds of his auditors, nor to draw such <i>descriptions</i> and <i>comparisons</i> as may surprise them: but studies only to <i>make himself understood</i>; to instruct to advantage; to give true ideas of <i>faith</i> and <i>holiness</i>; and to find out such expressions as may render necessary truths <i>easy</i> and <i>intelligible</i> to the meanest capacities. The very wisdom of God seems to be at a loss to find out expressions <i>low</i> enough for the <i>slow</i> apprehensions of men. How <i>dull</i> and <i>stupid</i> is the creature! How <i>wise</i> and <i>good</i> the Creator! And how <i>foolish</i> the preacher who uses <i>fine</i> and <i>hard</i> words in his preaching, which, though admired by the <i>shallow</i>, convey no instruction to the <i>multitude</i>.</p>
