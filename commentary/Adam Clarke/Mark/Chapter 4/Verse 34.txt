<p>Verse 34. <i><b>He expounded all things to his disciples.</b></i> â€” That they might be capable of instructing others. <i>Outside hearers</i>, those who do not come into <i>close fellowship</i> with the true disciples of Christ, have seldom more than a <i>superficial</i> knowledge of Divine things.</p>
<p>In the <i>fellowship</i> of the saints, where Jesus the <i>teacher</i> is always to be found, every thing is made <i>plain</i>,-for the <i>secret</i> of the Lord is with them who fear him.</p>
