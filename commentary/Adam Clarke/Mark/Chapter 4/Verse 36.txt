<p>Verse 36. <b>THEY </b><i><b>took him even as he was in the ship.</b></i> — That is, the <i>disciples; he was now</i> εν τω πλοιω, <i>in the boat</i>, i.e. his <i>own boat</i> which usually waited on him, and out of which it appears he was then teaching the people. <i>There were</i> several <i>others there</i> which he might have gone in, had this one not been in the place. The construction of this verse is exceedingly difficult; the meaning appears to be this: - The disciples sailed off with him just as he was in the boat out of which he had been teaching the people; and they did not wait to provide any accommodations for the passage. This I believe to be the meaning of the inspired penman.</p>
