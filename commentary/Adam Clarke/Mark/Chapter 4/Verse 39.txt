<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Peace, be still.</b></i> â€” <i>Be silent! Be still</i>! There is uncommon <i>majesty</i> and <i>authority</i> in these words. Who but God could act thus? Perhaps this salvation of his disciples in the boat might be designed to show forth that <i>protection</i> and <i>deliverance</i> which Christ will give to his followers, however violently they may be persecuted by earth or hell. At least, this is a legitimate use which may be made of this transaction.</p>
