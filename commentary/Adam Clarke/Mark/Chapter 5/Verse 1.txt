Verse Mark 5:1. The Gadarenes. â€” Some of the MSS. have Gergasenes, and some of them Gerasenes. Griesbach seems to prefer the latter. Matthew 8:28; Matthew 8:28.The Gadarenes were included within the limits of the Gergasenes. Dr. Lightfoot supposes that, of the two demoniacs mentioned here, one was of Gadara, and consequently a heathen, the other was a Gergesenian, and consequently a Jew; and he thinks that Mark and Luke mention the Gadarene demoniac because his case was a singular one, being the only heathen cured by our Lord, except the daughter of the Syrophoenician woman.
