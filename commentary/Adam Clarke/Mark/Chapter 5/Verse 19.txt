<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Suffered him not</b></i> — ο δε ινσους, <i>Howbeit Jesus</i>, is omitted by ABKLM, twenty-seven others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, both the <i>Persic, Coptic, Gothic, Vulgate</i>, and one of the <i>Itala. Mill</i> and <i>Bengel</i> approve of the omission, and <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it out of the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Go home to thy friends</b></i>, &amp;c.] This was the cause why Jesus would not permit him to follow him now, because he would not have the <i>happiness</i> of his relatives deferred, who must exceedingly rejoice at seeing the wonders which the Lord had wrought.</p>
