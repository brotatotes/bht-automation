<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Had suffered many things of many physicians, - and was</b></i> <i>nothing bettered, but rather grew worse</i>] No person will wonder at this account, when he considers the <i>therapeutics</i> of the Jewish physicians in reference to hemorrhages, especially of the kind with which this woman was afflicted.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan says: "<i>Take of gum Alexandria, of alum, and of</i> <i>crocus hortensis, the weight of a zuzee each; let them be bruised</i> <i>together, and given in wine to the woman that hath an issue of</i> <i>blood</i>. But if this fail,</p>
<p>"<i>Take of Persian onions nine logs, boil them in wine, and give</i> <i>it to her to drink: and say</i>, Arise from thy flux. But should this fail,</p>
<p>"<i>Set her in a place where two ways meet, and let her hold a cup</i> <i>of wine in her hand; and let somebody come behind and affright</i> <i>her</i>, and say, Arise from thy flux. But should this do no good,</p>
<p>"<i>Take a handful of cummin and a handful of crocus, and a handful</i> <i>of faenu-greek; let these be boiled, and given her to drink, and</i> <i>say</i>, Arise from thy flux. But should this also fail,</p>
<p>"<i>Dig seven trenches, and burn in them some cuttings of vines not</i> <i>yet circumcised</i> (vines not four years old;) <i>and let her take in</i> <i>her hand a cup of wine, and let her be led from this trench and</i> <i>set down over that, and let her be removed from that, and set down</i> <i>over another</i>: and in each removal say unto her, Arise from thy flux." Dr. Lightfoot gives these as a sample, out of many others, extracted from <i>Bab. Shabb</i>. fol. 110.</p>
<p>And from some of these nostrums it is evident the woman could not be <i>bettered</i>, and from some others it is as evident that she must be made <i>worse</i>; and from all together it is indubitably certain that she must have <i>suffered many things</i>; - and from the <i>persons</i> employed, the <i>expense</i> of the medicaments, and the <i>number</i> <i>of years</i> she was afflicted, as she was not a person of great opulence, it is most perfectly credible <i>that she spent all that</i> <i>she had</i>. She was therefore a fit patient for the Great Physician.</p>
<p>The case of this woman was, a very afflicting one:</p>
<p>1. Because of the <i>nature</i> of her malady; it was such as could not be made public, without exposing her to <i>shame</i> and <i>contempt</i>.</p>
<p>2. It was an <i>inveterate</i> disorder; it had lasted <i>twelve</i> years.</p>
<p>3. It was <i>continual</i>; she appears to have had no interval of health.</p>
<p>4. Her disorder was aggravated by the medicines she used - <i>she suffered</i> <i>much</i>, c.</p>
<p>5. Her malady was ruinous both to her health and circumstances - <i>she spent all that she had</i>.</p>
<p>6. She was now brought to the last point of <i>wretchedness, want</i>, and <i>despair</i> she was growing <i>worse</i>, and had neither money nor goods to make another experiment to procure her health.</p>
<p>7. She was brought so low by her disorder as to be incapable of earning any thing to support her wretched life a little longer.</p>
<p>It has been said, and the saying is a good one, "Man's <i>extremity</i> is God's <i>opportunity</i>." Never could the power and goodness of God be shown in a more difficult and distressful case. And now Jesus comes, and she is healed.</p>
