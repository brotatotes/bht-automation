<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Thou seest the multitude thronging then</b></i>, &amp;c.] Many <i>touch</i> Jesus who are not <i>healed</i> by him: the reason is, they do it not by <i>faith</i>, through a <i>sense</i> of their <i>wants</i>, and a <i>conviction</i> of his <i>ability</i> and <i>willingness</i> to save them. Faith conveys the virtue of Christ into the soul, and <i>spiritual health</i> is the immediate consequence of this received virtue.</p>
