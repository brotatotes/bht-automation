<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:4">Mark 5:4</span>. <i><b>With fetters and chains</b></i> â€” His strength, it appears was <i>supernatural</i>, no kind of chains being strong enough to confine him. With several, this man would have passed for an <i>outrageous</i> <i>madman</i>, and diabolic influence be entirely left out of the question; but it is the prerogative of the <i>inspired</i> penman only, to enter into the <i>nature</i> and <i>causes</i> of things; and how strange is it, that because men cannot see as far as the Spirit of God does, therefore they deny his testimony. "There was no devil; there can be none." Why? "Because we have never seen one, and we think the doctrine absurd." Excellent reason! And do you think that any man who conscientiously believes his Bible will give any credit to <i>you</i>? Men <i>sent from God</i>, to bear witness to the truth, tell us there were <i>demoniacs</i> in their time; you say, "No, they were only diseases." Whom shall we credit? The men <i>sent from God</i>, or <i>you</i>?</p>
