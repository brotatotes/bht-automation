<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:40">Mark 5:40</span>. <i><b>The father and the mother</b></i> — Prudence required that <i>they</i> should be present, and be witnesses of the miracle.</p>
<p><i><b>And them that were with him</b></i> — That is, <i>Peter, James</i>, and <i>John</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:37">Mark 5:37</span>. It is remarkable that our Lord gave a particular preference to these three disciples, beyond all the rest, on <i>three</i> very important occasions:</p>
<p>1. They were present at the <i>transfiguration</i>.</p>
<p>2. At the <i>raising</i> of Jairus's daughter.</p>
<p>3. At his <i>agony</i> in the garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<p><i><b>Where the damsel was lying.</b></i> — ανακειμενον, <i>lying</i>. This word is very doubtful. BDL, one other, <i>Coptic</i>, and later <i>Arabic</i>, with five of the <i>Itala</i>, omit it. Other MSS. express the same idea in <i>five</i> different words: <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it out of the text. See his Testament.</p>
