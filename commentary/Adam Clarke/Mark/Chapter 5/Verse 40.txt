Verse Mark 5:40. The father and the mother — Prudence required that they should be present, and be witnesses of the miracle.And them that were with him — That is, Peter, James, and John, Mark 5:37. It is remarkable that our Lord gave a particular preference to these three disciples, beyond all the rest, on three very important occasions:1. They were present at the transfiguration.2. At the raising of Jairus's daughter.3. At his agony in the garden of Gethsemane.Where the damsel was lying. — ανακειμενον, lying. This word is very doubtful. BDL, one other, Coptic, and later Arabic, with five of the Itala, omit it. Other MSS. express the same idea in five different words: Griesbach leaves it out of the text. See his Testament.
