Verse Mark 5:41. Talitha cumi — [Syriac], This is mere Syriac, the proper translation of which the evangelist has given. The Codex Bezae has a very odd and unaccountable reading here, ραββι θαβιτα κουμι, My master. Damsel arise. Suidas quotes this place under the word αββακουμ thus ταληθα κουμ. κουμ is the reading of several ancient MSS., but it is certainly a faulty one.
