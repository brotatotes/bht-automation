<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:41">Mark 5:41</span>. <i><b>Talitha cumi</b></i> — [Syriac], This is mere <i>Syriac</i>, the proper translation of which the evangelist has given. The Codex Bezae has a very odd and unaccountable reading here, ραββι θαβιτα κουμι, <i>My master. Damsel arise. Suidas</i> quotes this place under the word αββακουμ thus ταληθα κουμ. κουμ is the reading of several ancient MSS., but it is certainly a faulty one.</p>
