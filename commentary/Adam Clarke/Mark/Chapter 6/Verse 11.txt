<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:11">Mark 6:11</span>. <i><b>And whosoever shall not receive you</b></i> — Ὁς αν τοπος μη δεξηται, <i>whatsoever</i> PLACE <i>will not receive you</i>: this is the reading of BL, <i>four</i> others, and the later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin.</p>
<p><i><b>Verily</b></i>, &amp;c.] All this clause is omitted in BCDL, two others, one <i>Arabic</i>, one <i>Persic, Coptic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i> but <i>three. Mill</i> and <i>Beza</i> approve of the omission, and <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it out of the text. It has probably been transferred here from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:15">Matthew 10:15</span>.
