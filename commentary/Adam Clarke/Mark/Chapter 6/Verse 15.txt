Verse Mark 6:15. OR, as one of the prophets. — η, or, is omitted by ABCEGHKLMS-BHV, and one hundred others, Syriac, all the Arabic, all the Persic, Coptic, AEthiopic, Gothic, Slavonic, Vulgate, two Itala, Origen, Victor, and Theophylact. Bengel, Wetstein, and Griesbach leave it out of the text: the omission of it mends the sense much.
