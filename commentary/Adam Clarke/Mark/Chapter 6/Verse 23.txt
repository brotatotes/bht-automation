<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Unto the half of my kingdom.</b></i> â€” A noble price for a <i>dance</i>! This <i>extravagance</i> in favour of <i>female dancers</i> has the fullest scope in the east, even to the present day. M. <i>Anquetil</i> <i>du Perron</i>, in the preliminary discourse to his <i>Zend Avesta</i>, p. 344 and 345, gives a particular account of the dancers at <i>Surat</i>. This account cannot be transcribed in a comment on the Gospel of God, however illustrative it might be of the conduct of Herodias and her daughter Salome: it is too abominable for a place here. He observes, that the <i>rich</i> vie with each other in the <i>presents</i> they make to the dancing girls of <i>money</i> and <i>jewels</i>; and that persons of <i>opulence</i> have even ruined themselves by the <i>presents</i> they made to those victims of <i>debauch</i>. He mentions a remarkable case, which may throw light on this passage: "That the <i>dancer</i> Laal-koner gained such a complete ascendancy over the Mogul Emperor <i>Maaz-eddin</i>, that he made her <i>joint governess</i> of the empire with himself."</p>
