<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:3">Mark 6:3</span>. <i><b>Is not this the carpenter</b></i> — Among the ancient Jews, every father was bound to do four things for his son.</p>
<p>1. To circumcise him.</p>
<p>2. To redeem him.</p>
<p>3. To teach him the law.</p>
<p>4. To teach him a trade.</p>
<p>And this was founded on the following just maxim: "He who teaches not his son to do some work, is as if he taught him robbery!" It is therefore likely that Joseph brought up our Lord to his own trade.</p>
<p><i><b>Joses</b></i> — Several good MSS. read ιωσητος, <i>Joset</i>, and one, with several versions, reads <i>Joseph</i>.</p>
