Verse Mark 6:3. Is not this the carpenter — Among the ancient Jews, every father was bound to do four things for his son.1. To circumcise him.2. To redeem him.3. To teach him the law.4. To teach him a trade.And this was founded on the following just maxim: "He who teaches not his son to do some work, is as if he taught him robbery!" It is therefore likely that Joseph brought up our Lord to his own trade.Joses — Several good MSS. read ιωσητος, Joset, and one, with several versions, reads Joseph.
