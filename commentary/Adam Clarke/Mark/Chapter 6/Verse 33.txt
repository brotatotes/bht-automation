<p>Verse 33. <i><b>The people</b></i> — Or, οχλοι, <i>the multitudes</i>. This is wanting in many MSS., but it seems necessary to make the sense clear. There is scarcely a verse in the whole New Testament that has suffered so much from transcribers as this verse. Amidst the abundance of various readings, one can scarcely tell what its original state was. The various readings may be seen in <i>Griesbach</i>.</p>
