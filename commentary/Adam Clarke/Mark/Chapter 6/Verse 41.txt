<p>Verse 41. <i><b>And blessed</b></i> â€” I think the word <i>God</i> should be inserted here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19">Matthew 14:19</span>. See the note there. The food we receive from God is already blessed, and does not stand in need of being blessed by man; but God, who gives it, deserves our warmest thanksgivings, as frequently as we are called to partake of his bounty.</p>
