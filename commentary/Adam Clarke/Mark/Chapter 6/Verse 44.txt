<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Were about five thousand</b></i> — ωσει, <i>about</i>, is omitted by a great majority of the best MSS. and by the principal versions. It is wanting in several <i>editions: Bengel, Wetstein</i>, and <i>Griesbach</i>, leave it out of the text. It is omitted by some in the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:21">Matthew 14:21</span>, but it stands without any variation in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:14">Luke 9:14</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:10">John 6:10</span>. This miracle is mentioned by all the four evangelists. It is one of the most astonishing that Christ has wrought. It is a miracle which could not be <i>counterfeited</i>, and a full proof of the divinity of Christ.</p>
