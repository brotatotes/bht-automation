Verse Mark 6:53. The land of Gennesaret — This country lay on the coast of the sea of Galilee: it is described by Josephus as being exceedingly pleasant and fertile. It had its name of Gennesaret from גן, gen, a garden, and סר sar, a prince, either because the king had a garden there, or because of its great fertility.
