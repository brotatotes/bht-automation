Verse Mark 6:56. Villages — Probably small towns near cities.Country — Villages at a distance from cities and large public towns. See the notes on Matthew 14:34-36.Christ went about doing good - he confined his ministry and miracles to no place - wherever he went, they stood in need of his help; and whenever they required his assistance, they had it granted immediately. Our Lord's conduct, in these respects, is a perfect pattern for every preacher of his Gospel.
