<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:56">Mark 6:56</span>. <i><b>Villages</b></i> — Probably small towns near cities.</p>
<p><i><b>Country</b></i> — Villages at a distance from cities and large public towns. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:34-36">Matthew 14:34-36</span>.</p>
<p>Christ went about doing good - he <i>confined</i> his ministry and miracles to <i>no</i> place - wherever he went, they stood in need of his help; and whenever they required his assistance, they had it granted immediately. Our Lord's conduct, in these respects, is a perfect pattern for every preacher of his Gospel.</p>
