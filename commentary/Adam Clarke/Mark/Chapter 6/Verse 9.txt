<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:9">Mark 6:9</span>. <i><b>Shod with sandals</b></i> — The <i>sandal</i> seems to have been similar to the Roman <i>solea</i>, which covered only the <i>sole</i> of the foot, and was fastened about the foot and ankle with straps. The <i>sandal</i> was originally a part of the <i>woman's</i> dress; ancient authors represent them as worn only by women. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span>, the disciples are commanded to take <i>no shoes</i>, υποδηματα, which word is nearly of the same import with σανδαλια, <i>sandals</i>; but, as our Lord intimates to them that they should be free from all useless incumbrances, that they might fulfil his orders with the utmost diligence and despatch, so we may suppose that the <i>sandal</i> was a <i>lighter</i> kind of wear than the <i>shoe</i>: and indeed the word <i>sandal</i>, which is mere Chaldee, סנדל might be properly translated a <i>light shoe</i>; as it is compounded of סין <i>sin</i>, a shoe, (see Targum, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+25:9-10">Deuteronomy 25:9-10</span>,) and דל <i>dal, thin, slender</i>, or <i>mean</i>, as being made, not only <i>lighter</i> than the <i>hypodema</i> or shoe, but (probably) also of <i>meaner</i> materials. See many excellent observations on this subject in <i>Martinius's</i> Etymolog. Lexicon, under the word <i>Sandalium</i>.</p>
