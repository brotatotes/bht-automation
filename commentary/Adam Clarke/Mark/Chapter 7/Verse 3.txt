<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</span>. <i><b>Except they wash their hands</b></i> — πυγμη, the hand to the wrist-<i>Unless they wash the hand up to the wrist, eat not</i>. Several translations are given of this word; that above is from Dr. Lightfoot, who quotes a tradition from the rabbins, stating that the hands were to be thus washed. This sort of <i>washing</i> was, and still continues to be, an act of religion in the eastern countries. It is particularly commanded in the Koran, Surat v. ver. 7, "O believers, when ye wish to pray, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows - and your feet up to the ankles." Which custom it is likely Mohammed borrowed from the Jews. The Jewish doctrine is this: "If a man neglect the washing, he shall be eradicated from this world." But instead of πυγμη, the <i>fist</i> or <i>hand</i>, the Codex Bezae has πυκνη, <i>frequently</i>: and several of the <i>Itala</i> have words of the same signification. Bathing is an indispensable prerequisite to the <i>first meal</i> of the day among the <i>Hindoos</i>; and <i>washing</i> the <i>hands</i> and the <i>feet</i> is equally so before the <i>evening meal</i>.
