<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Laid upon the bed.</b></i> â€” The demon having <i>tormented</i> her, so that her bodily strength was <i>exhausted</i>, and she was now laid upon the couch to take a little <i>rest</i>. The <i>AEthiopic</i> has a remarkable reading here, which gives a very different, and, I think, a <i>better</i> sense. <i>And she found her daughter</i> CLOTHED, SITTING <i>upon the couch, and the demon gone out</i>.</p>
