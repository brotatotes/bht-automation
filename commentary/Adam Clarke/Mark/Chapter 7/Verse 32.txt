<p>Verse 32. <i><b>They bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an</b></i><b> </b><i><b>impediment in his speech</b></i> — Though from the <i>letter</i> of the text, it does not appear that this man was absolutely deprived of speech; for μογιλαλος literally signifies, one that cannot <i>speak plainly </i>- a <i>stammerer</i>; yet it is certain also that the word means a <i>dumb</i> <i>person</i>; and it is likely that the person in question was <i>dumb</i>, because he was deaf; and it is generally found that he who is totally <i>deaf</i> is <i>dumb</i> also. Almost all the versions understand the word thus: and the concluding words seem to confirm this - <i>He maketh</i> <i>both the deaf to hear, and the</i> DUMB, κωφους, <i>to speak</i>.</p>
