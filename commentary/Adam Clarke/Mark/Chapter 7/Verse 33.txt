<p>Verse 33. <i><b>And he spit, and touched his tongue</b></i> â€” This place is exceedingly difficult. There is scarcely an action of our Lord's life but one can see an <i>evident reason</i> for, except this. Various interpretations are given of it-none of them satisfies my mind. The Abbe Giradeau spiritualizes it thus: -</p>
<p>1. <i>He took him aside from</i> <i>the multitude </i>- When Christ saves a sinner, he <i>separates</i> him from all his old evil companions, and from the spirit and maxims of an ungodly world.</p>
<p>2. <i>He put his fingers in his ears </i>- to show that they could be <i>opened</i> only by the <i>finger</i>, i.e. the <i>power</i>, of God, and that they should be <i>shut</i> to every <i>word</i> and <i>voice</i>, but what came from him.</p>
<p>3. <i>Spitting out he touched his tongue </i>- to show that his mental <i>taste</i> and <i>relish</i> should be entirely <i>changed</i>: that he should <i>detest</i> those things which he before <i>esteemed</i>, and <i>esteem</i> those which he before <i>hated</i>.</p>
<p>4. <i>Looking up to heaven </i>- to signify that all help comes from <i>God</i>, and to teach the new convert to keep continually <i>looking to</i> and <i>depending</i> upon him.</p>
<p>5. <i>He groaned </i>- to show the <i>wretched state</i> of man by sins and how <i>tenderly concerned</i> God is for his present and eternal welfare; and to intimate that men should seek the salvation of God in the spirit of genuine <i>repentance</i>, with strong <i>crying</i> and <i>tears</i>.</p>
<p>6. <i>He said, Be</i> <i>opened </i>- Sin is a <i>shutting</i> of the <i>ears</i> against the <i>words</i> of God; and a <i>tying</i> of the <i>tongue</i>, to render it incapable of giving God due <i>praise</i>. But when the all-powerful grace of Christ reaches the heart, the <i>ear</i> is <i>unstopped</i>, and the man <i>hears distinctly</i>-the <i>tongue</i> is <i>unloosed</i>, and the man speaks <i>correctly</i>.</p>
<p>After all, it is possible that what is attributed here to <i>Christ</i> belongs to the person who was cured. I will give <i>my sense</i> of the place in a short paraphrase.</p>
<p><i>And</i> Jesus <i>took him aside from the multitude: and</i> [the deaf man] <i>put his fingers into his ears</i>, intimating thereby to Christ that they were so stopped that he could not hear; <i>and having spat out</i>, that there might be nothing remaining in his mouth to offend the sight when Christ should look at his tongue, <i>he touched his</i> <i>tongue</i>, showing to Christ that it was so bound that he could not speak: <i>and he looked up to heaven</i>, as if to implore assistance from above: <i>and he groaned</i>, being distressed because of his present affliction, and thus implored relief: for, not being able to <i>speak</i>, he could only <i>groan</i> and <i>look up</i>, expressing by these signs, as well as he could, his <i>afflicted state</i>, and the <i>desire</i> he had to be relieved. <i>Then</i> Jesus, having compassion upon him, <i>said,</i> <i>Be opened: and immediately his ears were opened</i>, so that he could hear distinctly; and the <i>impediment</i> to his speaking was removed, so that <i>he spake properly</i>. The original will admit of this interpretation; and this, I am inclined to believe, is the true meaning of this otherwise (to me and many others) unaccountable passage.</p>
