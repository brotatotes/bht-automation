<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:37">Mark 7:37</span>. <i><b>He hath done all things well</b></i> â€” This has been, and ever will be, true of every part of our Lord's conduct. In <i>creation, providence</i>, and <i>redemption</i> he hath done all things <i>well.</i> The wisest philosophers are agreed that, considering <i>creation</i> as a <i>whole</i>, it would be impossible to improve it. Every thing has been made in <i>number, weight</i>, and <i>measure</i>; there really is nothing <i>deficient</i>, nothing <i>redundant</i>; and the <i>good</i> of the <i>creature</i> seems evidently more consulted than the <i>glory</i> of the <i>Creator</i>. The creature's good is every where <i>apparent</i>; but to find out <i>how</i> the Creator is glorified by these works requires the <i>eye</i> of the <i>philosopher</i>. And as he has done all things well in <i>creation</i>, so has he in <i>providence</i>: here also every thing is in <i>number, weight,</i> <i>measure</i>, and <i>time</i>. As <i>creation</i> shows his <i>majesty</i>, so <i>providence</i> shows his <i>bounty</i>. He <i>preserves</i> every thing he has made; all depend upon him; and by him are all things <i>supported</i>. But how glorious does he appear in the work of <i>redemption</i>! How magnificent, ample, and adequate the provision made for the salvation of a lost world! Here, as in providence, is <i>enough</i> for <i>all</i>, a <i>sufficiency</i> for <i>each</i>, and <i>an abundance</i> for <i>eternity.</i> He loves every man, and hates nothing that he has made; nor can <i>the God of all grace</i> be less <i>beneficent</i> than the <i>Creator</i> and <i>Preserver</i> of the universe.</p>
