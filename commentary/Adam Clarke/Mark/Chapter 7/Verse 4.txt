<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:4">Mark 7:4</span>. <i><b>And</b></i><b> when </b><i><b>they come</b></i> — This clause is added by our translators, to fill up the sense; but it was probably a part of the original: for εαν ελθωσι is the reading of the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, <i>Vulgate, Armenian</i>, and most of the <i>Itala</i>. The clause in my old MS. Bible is read thus: <i>And thei turninge agein fro chepinge</i>. The words seem essentially necessary to a proper understanding of the text; and, if not admitted on the above authority, they must be supplied in <i>italics</i>, as in our common translation.</p>
<p><i><b>Except they wash</b></i> — Or <i>dip</i>; for βαπτισωνται may mean either. But instead of the word in the text, the famous <i>Codex Vaticanus</i>; (B,) <i>eight</i> others, and <i>Euthymius</i>, have παντισωνται, <i>sprinkle</i>. However, the Jews sometimes washed their hands previously to their eating: at other times, they simply <i>dipped</i> or plunged them into the water.</p>
<p><i><b>Of cups</b></i> — ποτηριων; any kind of earthen vessels.</p>
<p><i><b>Pots</b></i> — <i>Of measures </i>- ξεστων, from the singular ξεστης, a <i>measure</i> for liquids, formed from the Latin <i>sextarius</i>, equal to a <i>pint and a half</i> English. See this proved by <i>Wetstein</i> on this place. My old MS. renders it <i>cruetis</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of brazen vessels</b></i> — χαλκιων. These, if polluted, were only to be washed, or passed through the fire; whereas the earthen vessels were to be broken.</p>
<p><i><b>And of tables.</b></i> — <i>Beds, couches </i>- και κλινων. This is wanting in BL, <i>two</i> others, and the <i>Coptic</i>. It is likely it means no more than the <i>forms</i>, or <i>seats</i>, on which they sat to eat. A bed or a couch was defiled, if any unclean person sat or leaned on it - a man with an issue - a leper - a woman with child, c. As the word βαπτισμους, <i>baptisms</i>, is applied to all these, and as it is contended that this word, and the verb whence it is derived, signify <i>dipping</i> or immersion <i>alone</i>, its use in the above cases refutes that opinion and shows that it was used, not only to express <i>dipping</i> or <i>immersion</i>, but also sprinkling and washing. The cups and pots were <i>washed</i> the beds and forms perhaps <i>sprinkled</i>; and the hands <i>dipped</i> up to the wrist.</p>
