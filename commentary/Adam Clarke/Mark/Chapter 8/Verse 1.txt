<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:1">Mark 8:1</span>. <i><b>The multitude being very great</b></i> — Or rather, <i>There was</i> <i>again a great multitude</i>. Instead of παμπολλου, <i>very great</i>, I read παλιν πολλου, <i>again a great</i>, which is the reading of BDGLM, <i>fourteen</i> others, all the <i>Arabic, Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Gothic, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, and of many <i>Evangelistaria</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> approves of this reading. There had been such a multitude gathered together <i>once before</i>, who were fed in the same way. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:34">Mark 6:34</span>, &amp;c.</p>
