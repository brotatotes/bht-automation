<p>Verse 23. <i><b>And he took the blind man by the hand</b></i> — Giving him a proof of his readiness to help him, and thus preparing him for the cure which he was about to work.</p>
<p><i><b>Led him out of the town</b></i> — Thus showing the inhabitants that he considered them unworthy of having another miracle wrought among them. He had already deeply deplored their ingratitude and obstinacy: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span>. When a people do not make a proper improvement of the light and grace which they receive from God, their <i>candlestick is removed </i>- even the <i>visible Church</i> becomes there extinct; and the <i>candle</i> is <i>put out </i>- no more means of spiritual <i>illumination</i> are afforded to the unfaithful inhabitants: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>When he had spit on his eyes</b></i> — There is a similar transaction to this mentioned by John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:6">John 9:6</span>. It is likely this was done merely to <i>separate</i> the <i>eyelids</i>; as, in certain cases of blindness, they are found always gummed together. It required a <i>miracle</i> to restore the <i>sight</i>, and this was done in consequence of Christ having laid his hands upon the blind man: it required <i>no</i> miracle to <i>separate</i> the <i>eyelids</i>, and, therefore, <i>natural means</i> only were employed - this was done by rubbing them with spittle; but whether by Christ, or by the blind man, is not absolutely certain. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:33">Mark 7:33</span>. It has always been evident that <i>false</i> miracles have been wrought without <i>reason</i> or <i>necessity</i>, and without any <i>obvious advantage</i>; and they have thereby been detected: on the contrary, <i>true</i> miracles have always vindicated themselves by their obvious <i>utility</i> and <i>importance</i>; nothing ever being effected by <i>them</i> that could be performed by <i>natural</i> means.</p>
<p><i><b>If he saw aught.</b></i> — ει, <i>if</i>, is wanting in the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Persic</i> and <i>Arabic</i>, and in the <i>AEthiopic</i>; and τιβλεπεις, <i>Dost thou see any thing</i>? is the reading of CD, <i>Coptic, AEthiopic</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i> and <i>Persic</i>.</p>
