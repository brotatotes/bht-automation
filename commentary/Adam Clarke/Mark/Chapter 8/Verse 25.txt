<p>Verse 25. <i><b>And saw every man clearly.</b></i> — But instead of απαντας, <i>all men</i>, several excellent MSS., and the principal <i>versions</i>, have απαντα, <i>all things</i>, every object; for the view he had of them before was <i>indistinct</i> and <i>confused</i>. Our Lord could have restored this man to sight in a <i>moment</i>; but he chose to do it in the way mentioned in the text, to show that he is sovereign of his own graces; and to point out that, however insignificant <i>means</i> may appear in themselves, they are divinely efficacious when he chooses to work by them; and that, however <i>small</i> the <i>first</i> manifestations of mercy may be, they are nevertheless the <i>beginnings</i> of the <i>fulness</i> of the blessings of the Gospel of peace. Reader, art thou in this man's state? Art thou <i>blind</i>? Then come to Jesus that he may restore thee. Hast thou a <i>measure</i> of light? Then pray that he may lay his hands <i>again</i> on thee, that thou mayest be enabled to read thy title <i>clear</i> to the heavenly inheritance.</p>
