<p>Verse 26. <i><b>He sent him away to his house</b></i> â€” So it appears that this person did not belong to <i>Bethsaida</i>, for, in going to <i>his</i> <i>house</i>, he was <i>not to enter into the village</i>.</p>
<p>This miracle is not mentioned by any other of the evangelists. It affords <i>another</i> proof that Mark did not <i>abridge</i> Matthew's Gospel.</p>
