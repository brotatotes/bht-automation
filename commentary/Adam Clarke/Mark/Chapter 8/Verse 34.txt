<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34">Mark 8:34</span>. <i><b>Whosoever will come after me</b></i> â€” It seems that Christ formed, on the <i>proselytism</i> of the Jews, the principal qualities which he required in the <i>proselytes</i> of <i>his covenant</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> condition of proselytism among the Jews was, that he that came to embrace their religion should come <i>voluntarily</i>, and that neither <i>force</i> nor <i>influence</i> should be employed in this business. This is also the <i>first</i> condition required by Jesus Christ, and which he considers as the <i>foundation</i> of all the rest: - If a man be willing to come after me.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> condition required in the <i>Jewish</i> proselyte was, that he should <i>perfectly renounce</i> all his prejudices, his errors, his idolatry, and every thing that concerned his false religion; and that he should entirely <i>separate</i> himself from his most <i>intimate</i> <i>friends</i> and <i>acquaintances</i>. It was on this ground that the Jews called proselytism a <i>new birth</i>, and proselytes <i>new-born</i>, and <i>new</i> <i>men</i>; and our Lord requires men to be born again, not only of water, but by the Holy Ghost. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>. All this our Lord includes in this word, <i>Let him renounce himself</i>. To this the following scriptures refer: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:33">Matthew 10:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> condition on which a person was admitted into the <i>Jewish</i> Church as a proselyte was, that he should submit to the <i>yoke</i> of the <i>Jewish law</i>, and bear patiently the inconveniences and sufferings with which a profession of the Mosaic religion might be accompanied. Christ requires the <i>same</i> condition; but, instead of the <i>yoke</i> of the <i>law</i>, he brings in <i>his own doctrine</i>, which he calls <i>his yoke</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>: and his <i>cross</i>, the <i>taking up</i> of which not only implies a <i>bold</i> <i>profession</i> of Christ <i>crucified</i>, but also a cheerful submitting to all the sufferings and persecutions to which he might be exposed, and even to death itself.</p>
<p>The <i>fourth</i> condition was, that they should solemnly engage to <i>continue</i> in the Jewish religion, faithful even unto death. This condition Christ also requires; and it is comprised in this word, <i>Let him</i> FOLLOW <i>me</i>.
