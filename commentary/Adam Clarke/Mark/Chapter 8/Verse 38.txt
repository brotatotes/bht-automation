<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:38">Mark 8:38</span>. <i><b>Whosoever - shall be ashamed of me</b></i> — Our Lord hints here at one of the principal <i>reasons</i> of the <i>incredulity</i> of the Jews,-they saw nothing in the <i>person</i> of Jesus Christ which corresponded to the <i>pompous</i> notions which they had formed of the Messiah.</p>
<p>If Jesus Christ had come into the world as a mighty and opulent man, clothed with earthly glories and honours, he would have had a multitude of partisans, and most of them <i>hypocrites</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And of my words</b></i> — This was <i>another</i> subject of offence to the Jews: the <i>doctrine</i> of the <i>cross</i> must be <i>believed</i>; a <i>suffering</i> Messiah must be <i>acknowledged</i>; and <i>poverty</i> and <i>affliction</i> must be <i>borne</i>; and <i>death</i>, perhaps, suffered in consequence of becoming his disciples.</p>
<p>Of <i>him</i>, and of <i>his words</i>, in this sense, the world is, to this day, ashamed.</p>
<p><i><b>Of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed</b></i> — As he refused to <i>acknowledge</i> me before <i>men</i>, so will I refuse to <i>acknowledge</i> him before <i>God</i> and his <i>angels</i>. Terrible consequence of the rejection of Christ! And who can help him whom the <i>only Saviour</i> eternally disowns. Reader! Lay this subject seriously to heart; and see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span>, c., and at the end of that chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>.</p>
<p>ALL the subjects contained in this chapter are very interesting but particularly:</p>
<p>1. The miraculous feeding of the multitudes, which is a full, unequivocal proof of the supreme Divinity of Jesus Christ: in this miracle he truly appears in his creative energy, with which he has associated the tenderest benevolence and humanity. The <i>subject</i> of such a <i>prince</i> must ever be safe; the <i>servant</i> of such a <i>master</i> must ever have kind usage; the <i>follower</i> of such a <i>teacher</i> can never want nor go astray.</p>
<p>2. The necessity of keeping the doctrine of the Gospel uncorrupt, is strongly inculcated in the caution to avoid the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod: the doctrine of the cross must not only be observed and held inviolate, but that doctrine must never be mixed with worldly politics. <i>Time-serving</i> is abominable in the sight of God: it shows that the person has either no <i>fixed principle</i> of religion, or that he is not under the <i>influence</i> of any.</p>
