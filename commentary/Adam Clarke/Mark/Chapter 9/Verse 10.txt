<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:10">Mark 9:10</span>. <i><b>And they kept that saying</b></i> — This verse is wanting in two MSS. and one of the <i>Itala</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>What the rising from the dead should mean.</b></i> — Ὁταν εκ νεκρων αναϚῃ, <i>When he should arise from the dead</i>, is the reading of D, six others, <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Persic, Vulgate</i>, all the <i>Itala</i>, and <i>Jerome</i>. Griesbach approves of it.</p>
<p>There is nothing that answers to this verse either in Matthew or Luke.</p>
