Verse Mark 9:10. And they kept that saying — This verse is wanting in two MSS. and one of the Itala.What the rising from the dead should mean. — Ὁταν εκ νεκρων αναϚῃ, When he should arise from the dead, is the reading of D, six others, Syriac, all the Persic, Vulgate, all the Itala, and Jerome. Griesbach approves of it.There is nothing that answers to this verse either in Matthew or Luke.
