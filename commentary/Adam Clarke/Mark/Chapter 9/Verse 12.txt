Verse Mark 9:12. And how it is written — Rather, as also it is written. Instead of και πως, AND HOW it is written, I read καθως, AS ALSO it is written of the Son of man, &c. This reading is supported by AKM, seventeen others, the later Syriac in the margin, Slavonic and Armenian. Some think the propriety of adopting this reading is self-evident.
