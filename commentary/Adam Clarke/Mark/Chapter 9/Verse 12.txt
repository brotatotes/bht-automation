<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:12">Mark 9:12</span>. <i><b>And how it is written</b></i> — Rather, <i>as also it is</i> <i>written</i>. Instead of και πως, AND HOW <i>it is written</i>, I read καθως, AS ALSO <i>it is written of the Son of man</i>, &amp;c. This reading is supported by AKM, <i>seventeen</i> others, the later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, <i>Slavonic</i> and <i>Armenian</i>. Some think the propriety of adopting this reading is self-evident.</p>
