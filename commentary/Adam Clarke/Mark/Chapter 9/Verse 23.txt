<p>Verse 23. <i><b>If</b></i><b> THOU </b><i><b>canst</b></i><b> BELIEVE</b>] This was an answer to the inquiry above. I can furnish a sufficiency of <i>power</i>, if <i>thou</i> canst but bring <i>faith</i> to receive it. Why are not our souls completely healed? Why is not every demon cast out? Why are not pride, self-will, love of the world, lust, anger, peevishness, with all the other bad tempers and dispositions which constitute the mind of Satan, entirely destroyed? Alas! it is because we do not <i>believe</i>; Jesus is <i>able</i>; more, Jesus is <i>willing</i>; but we are <i>not</i> <i>willing</i> to give up our idols; we give not credence to his word; therefore hath sin a <i>being</i> in us, and dominion over us.</p>
