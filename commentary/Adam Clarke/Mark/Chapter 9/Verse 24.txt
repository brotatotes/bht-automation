<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Lord, I believe</b></i> — The word <i>Lord</i> is omitted by ABCDL, both the <i>Syriac</i>, both the <i>Arabic</i> later <i>Persic, AEthiopic, Gothic</i>, and three copies of the <i>Itala. Griesbach</i> leaves it out. The omission, I think, is proper, because it is evident the man did not know our Lord, and therefore could not be expected to accost him with a title expressive of that <i>authority</i> which he doubted whether he possessed, unless we grant that he used the word κυριε after the <i>Roman</i> custom, for <i>Sir</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Help thou mine unbelief.</b></i> — That is, assist me against it. Give me a power to believe.</p>
