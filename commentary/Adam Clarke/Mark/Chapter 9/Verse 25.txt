<p>Verse 25. <i><b>I charge thee</b></i> â€” Considerable emphasis should be laid on the pronoun: - Thou didst resist the command of my <i>disciples</i>, now I <i>command thee to come out</i>. If this had been only a natural disease, for instance the <i>epilepsy</i>, as some have argued, could our Lord have addressed <i>it</i>, with any propriety, as he has done here: <i>Thou deaf and dumb spirit, come out of him, and enter no more into</i> <i>him</i>? Is the doctrine of demoniacal influence <i>false</i>? If so, Jesus took the most direct method to <i>perpetuate</i> the belief of that falsity, by accommodating himself so completely to the <i>deceived</i> vulgar. But this was impossible; therefore the doctrine of demoniacal influence is a true doctrine, otherwise Christ would never have given it the least countenance or support.</p>
