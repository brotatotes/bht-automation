<p>Verse 32. <i><b>But they understood not</b></i> â€” This whole verse is wanting in two MSS., in the first edition of <i>Erasmus</i>, and in that of <i>Aldus. Mill</i> approves of the omission. It does not appear likely, from Matthew's account, that three of the disciples, Peter, James, and John, could be <i>ignorant</i> of the reasons of Christ's death and resurrection, after the <i>transfiguration</i>; on the contrary, from the circumstances there related, it is very probable that from that time they must have had at least a general understanding of this important subject; but the other <i>nine</i> might have been ignorant of this matter, who were not present at the transfiguration; probably it is of these that the evangelist speaks here.
