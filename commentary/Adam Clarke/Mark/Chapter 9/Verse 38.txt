<p>Verse 38. <i><b>We saw one casting out devils in thy name</b></i> — It can scarcely be supposed that a man who knew nothing of Christ, or who was only a common <i>exorcist</i>, could be able to work a miracle in Christ's name; we may therefore safely imagine that this was either one of John the Baptist's disciples, who, at his master's command, had believed in Jesus, or one of the <i>seventy</i>, whom Christ had sent out, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1-7">Luke 10:1-7</span>, who, after he had fulfilled his commission, had retired from accompanying the other disciples; but as he still held fast his faith in Christ, and walked in good conscience, the influence of his Master still continued with him, so that he could cast out demons as well as the other disciples.</p>
<p><i><b>He followeth not us</b></i> — This first clause is omitted by BCL, <i>three</i> others, <i>Syriac, Armenian, Persic, Coptic</i>, and one of the <i>Itala</i>. Some of the MSS. and versions leave out the first; some the second clause: only one of them is necessary. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves out the first.</p>
<p><i><b>We forbade him</b></i> — I do not see that we have any right to attribute any other motive to John than that which he himself owns-<i>because he followed not us</i>-because he did not attach himself constantly to thee, as we do, we thought he could not be in a proper spirit.</p>
