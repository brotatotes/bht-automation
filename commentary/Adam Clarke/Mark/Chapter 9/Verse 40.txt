<p>Verse 40. <i><b>He that is not against us, is on our part.</b></i> — Or rather, <i>Whosoever is not against</i> YOU, <i>is for</i> YOU. Instead of ημων, <i>us</i>, I would read υμων, <i>you</i>, on the authority of ADSHV, upwards of <i>forty</i> others, <i>Syriac, Armenian, Persic, Coptic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Gothic, Slavonic, Vulgate, Itala, Victor</i>, and <i>Opt</i>. This reading is more consistent with the context - <i>He followed not</i> us-well, <i>he is not against</i> YOU; and he who is not against <i>you</i>, in such a work, may be fairly presumed to be on <i>your</i> side.</p>
<p>There is a parallel case to this mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:26-29">Numbers 11:26-29</span>, which, for the elucidation of this passage, I will transcribe. "The Spirit rested upon Eldad and Medad, and they prophesied in the camp. And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. And Joshua, the servant of Moses, said, My lord Moses, forbid them! And Moses said unto him, Enviest THOU for MY sake? Would God, that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them." The reader will easily observe that <i>Joshua</i> and <i>John</i> were of the same bigoted spirit; and that <i>Jesus</i> and <i>Moses</i> acted from the spirit of candour and benevolence. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:25-29">Numbers 11:25-29</span>.</p>
