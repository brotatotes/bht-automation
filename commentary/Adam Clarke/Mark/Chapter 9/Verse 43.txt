<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:43-48">Mark 9:43-48</span>. <i><b>Thy hand - foot - eye - cause thee to offend;</b></i> — See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29-30">Matthew 5:29-30</span>.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:43">Mark 9:43</span>. <i><b>The fire that never shall be quenched</b></i> — That is, <i>the</i> <i>inextinguishable fire</i>. This clause is wanting in L, <i>three</i> others, the <i>Syriac</i>, and later <i>Persic</i>. Some eminent critics suppose it to be a spurious reading; but the authorities which are <i>for</i> it, are by no means counterbalanced by those which are <i>against</i> it. The same clause in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:45">Mark 9:45</span>, is omitted in BCL, <i>seven</i> others, <i>Syriac</i>, later <i>Persic, Coptic</i>, and one <i>Itala</i>. <i>Eternal fire</i> is the expression of Matthew.</p>
