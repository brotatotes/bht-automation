<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:49">Mark 9:49</span>. <i><b>For every one shall be salted with fire</b></i> — Every one of those who shall live and die in sin: but there is great difficulty in this verse. The Codex Bezae, and some other MSS., have omitted the first clause; and several MSS. keep the <i>first</i>, and omit the last clause - <i>and every sacrifice shall be salted with</i> <i>salt</i>. There appears to be an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:24">Isaiah 66:24</span>. It is generally supposed that our Lord means, that as <i>salt</i> preserves the flesh with which it is connected from <i>corruption</i>, so this everlasting fire, το πυρ το ασβεστον, this <i>inconsumable fire</i>, will have the property, not only of <i>assimilating</i> all things cast into it to its own <i>nature</i>, but of making them <i>inconsumable</i> like itself.</p>
<p><i>Scaliger</i> supposes, that instead of πας πυρι, πασα πυρια, <i>every</i> <i>sacrifice</i> (of flour) should be read, "Every sacrifice (of flour) shall be salted, and every burnt offering shall be salted." This, I fear, is taking the text by <i>storm</i>. Some take the whole in a good sense, as referring to the influence of the Spirit of God in the hearts of believers, which shall answer the same end to the soul, in preserving it from the contagion that is in the world, as salt did in the sacrifices offered to God to preserve them from putrefaction. Old <i>Trapp's</i> note on the place pleases me as much as any I have seen: - "The <i>Spirit</i>, as <i>salt</i>, must dry up those bad <i>humours</i> in us which breed the never-dying worm; and, as fire, must waste our corruptions, which else will carry us on to the unquenchable fire." Perhaps the whole is an allusion to the purification of vessels, and especially such metallic vessels as were employed in the service of the sanctuary. Probably the following may be considered as a parallel text: - <i>Every thing that</i> <i>may abide the fire, ye shalt make go through the fire, and it</i> <i>shall be clean; and all that abideth not the fire, ye shall make</i> <i>go through the water</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:23">Numbers 31:23</span>. Ye, disciples, are the Lord's <i>sacrifice</i>; ye shall go through much <i>tribulation</i>, in order to enter into my <i>kingdom</i>: but ye are <i>salted</i>, ye are influenced by the Spirit of God, and are <i>immortal</i> till your work is done; and should ye be <i>offered up</i>, martyred, this shall be a means of establishing more fully the glad tidings of the kingdom: and this Spirit shall <i>preserve</i> all who believe on me from the <i>corruption</i> of sin, and from <i>eternal</i> perdition. That converts to God are represented as his offering, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:20">Isaiah 66:20</span>, the very place which our Lord appears to have here in view.</p>
<p>If this passage be taken according to the common meaning, it is awful indeed! Here may be seen the greatness, multiplicity, and eternity, of the pains of the damned. They suffer without being able to die; they are burned without being consumed; they are sacrificed without being sanctified - are <i>salted</i> with the <i>fire of</i> <i>hell</i>, as eternal victims of the Divine Justice. We must of necessity be <i>sacrificed</i> to God, after one way or other, in eternity; and we have now the choice either of the unquenchable fire of his justice, or of the everlasting flame of his love. <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
