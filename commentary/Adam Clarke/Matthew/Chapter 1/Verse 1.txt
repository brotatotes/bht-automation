<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. <i><b>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ</b></i> — I suppose these words to have been the original <i>title</i> to this Gospel; and that they signify, according to the Hebrew Phraseology, not only the <i>account</i> of the <i>genealogy</i> of Christ, as detailed below, but the history of his birth, acts, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>The phrase, <i>book of the generation</i>, ספר תולדות sepher toledoth, is frequent in the Jewish writings, and is translated by the Septuagint, βιβλος γενεσεως, as here, by the evangelist; and regularly conveys the meaning given to it above; e. g. <i>This is the</i> <i>book of the generations of Adam</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:1">Genesis 5:1</span>. That is, the account of the life of Adam and certain of his immediate descendants. Again. <i>These are the generations of Jacob</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:2">Genesis 37:2</span>. That is, the account or history of Jacob, his son Joseph, and the other remarkable branches of the family. And again. <i>These are the generations of</i> <i>Aaron and Moses</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:1">Numbers 3:1</span>. That is, the history of the life and acts of these persons, and some of their immediate descendants. The same form of expression is also used, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:4">Genesis 2:4</span>, when giving the history of the creation of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Some have translated βιβλος γενεσεως, <i>The book of the genealogy</i>; and consider it the <i>title</i> of <i>this chapter</i> only; but the former opinion seems better founded.</p>
<p><i><b>Jesus Christ</b></i> — See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:16">Matthew 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The son of David, the son of Abraham</b></i> — No person ever born could boast, in a direct line, a more illustrious ancestry than Jesus Christ. Among his progenitors, the <i>regal, sacerdotal</i>, and <i>prophetic</i> offices, existed in all their <i>glory</i> and <i>splendour</i>. DAVID, the most renowned of sovereigns, was <i>king</i> and <i>prophet</i>: ABRAHAM, the most perfect character in all antiquity, whether sacred or profane, was <i>priest</i> and <i>prophet</i>: but the <i>three</i> offices were never united except in the person of Christ; he alone was <i>prophet, priest</i>, and <i>king</i>; and possessed and executed these offices in such a supereminent degree as no human being ever did, or ever could do. As the principal business of the <i>prophet</i> was to make known the will of God to men, according to certain partial communications received from Heaven; so Jesus, who lay in the bosom of the Father, and who was intimately and thoroughly acquainted with all the mysteries of the eternal world, came to declare the Divine nature and its counsels to mankind; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>. As the business of the <i>priest</i> was to offer sacrifices to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people; so Christ was constituted a high priest, to make, by the sacrifice of himself, an atonement for the sins of the whole world; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>, and the whole Epistle to the Hebrews. As the office of <i>king</i> was to <i>reign</i> over, <i>protect</i>, and <i>defend</i> the people committed to his care by the Divine Providence; so Christ is set as a king upon Sion, having the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:6">Psalms 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:8">Psalms 2:8</span>, c. Of the righteousness, peace, and increase of whose government, there shall be no end, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span>. This <i>three-fold</i> office, Christ executes not only in a general sense, in the world at large but, in a particular sense, in every Christian soul. He is first a <i>prophet</i>, to teach the heart of man the will of God; to convict the conscience of sin, righteousness, and judgment; and fully to illustrate the way of salvation. He is next a <i>priest</i>, to apply that atonement to the guilty conscience, the necessity of which, as a <i>prophet</i>, he had previously made known. And lastly, as a <i>king</i>, he leads captivity captive, binds and casts out the strong man armed, spoils his goods, extends the sway of the sceptre of righteousness, subdues and destroys sin, and reigns Lord over all the powers and faculties of the human soul; so <i>that</i> AS <i>sin reigned unto death</i>, EVEN <i>so does grace reign through righteousness, unto eternal life</i>, <i>by Jesus Christ our Lord</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span>.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that the evangelist names <i>David</i> before <i>Abraham</i>, though the latter was many generations older: the reason seems to be this, that David was not only the most illustrious of our Lord's predecessors, as being both <i>king</i> and <i>prophet</i>; but because that promise, which at first was given to Abraham, and afterwards, through successive generations, confirmed to the Jewish people, was at last determined and restricted to the family of <i>David</i>. <i>Son of David</i>, was an epithet by which the Messiah was afterwards known among the Jews; and, under this title, they were led to expect him by prophetic authority. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:3-4">Psalms 89:3-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:10">Psalms 132:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:11">Psalms 132:11</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:23">Acts 13:23</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:5">Jeremiah 23:5</span>. Christ was prophesied of under the very name of <i>David</i>.
