<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:11">Matthew 1:11</span>. <i><b>Josias begat Jechonias, c.</b></i> — There are <i>three</i> considerable difficulties in this verse.</p>
<p>1. Josias was not the <i>father</i> of Jechonias he was only the grandfather of that prince: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:14-16">1 Chronicles 3:14-16</span>.</p>
<p>2. Jechonias had no <i>brethren</i>; at least, none are on record.</p>
<p>3. Josias died 20 years before the Babylonish captivity took place, and therefore <i>Jechonias and his brethren</i> could not have been begotten <i>about the time they were carried away to Babylon</i>.</p>
<p>To this way be added a <i>fourth</i> difficulty, viz. there are only <i>thirteen</i> in this 2nd class of generations; or <i>forty-one</i>, instead of <i>forty-two</i>, in the whole. But all these difficulties disappear, by adopting a reading found in many MSS. Ιωσιας δε εγεννησε τον Ιωακειμ· Ιωακειμ δε εγεννησε τον Ιεχονιαν. <i>And Josias begat</i> JEHOIAKIM, or <i>Joakim, and</i> JOAKIM <i>begat Jechonias</i>. For this reading, see the authorities in <i>Griesbach</i>. <i>Josiah</i> was the immediate father of <i>Jehoiakim</i> (called also <i>Eliakeim</i> and <i>Joakim</i>) and his brethren, who were <i>Johanan, Zedekiah</i>, and <i>Shallum</i>: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:15">1 Chronicles 3:15</span>. Joakim was the father of <i>Joachin</i> or <i>Jechonias</i>, about the time of the <i>first</i> Babylonish captivity: for we may reckon <i>three</i> Babylonish captivities. The <i>first</i> happened in the fourth year of Joakim, son of Josiah, about A. M. 3398. In this year, Nebuchadnezzar, having taken Jerusalem, led a great number of captives to Babylon. The <i>second</i> captivity happened under Jechoniah, son of Joakim; who, having reigned three months, was taken prisoner in 3405, and was carried to Babylon, with a great number of the Jewish nobility. The <i>third</i> captivity took place under <i>Zedekiah</i>, A. M. 3416. And thus, says Calmet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:11">Matthew 1:11</span> should be read: <i>Josias begat Joakim and his brethren: and Joakim begat Jechonias</i> <i>about the time of the</i> first <i>Babylonish captivity; and Jechonias</i> <i>begat Salathiel, after they were brought to Babylon</i>. Thus, with the necessary addition of <i>Joakim</i>, the three classes, each containing <i>fourteen</i> generations, are complete. And to make this the more evident, I shall set down each of these three generations in a separate column, with the additional <i>Joakim</i>, that the reader may have them all at one view. </p>
