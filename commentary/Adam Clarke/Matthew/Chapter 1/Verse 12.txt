<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:12">Matthew 1:12</span>. <i><b>Jechonias begat Salathiel</b></i> — After Jechonias was brought to Babylon, he was put in prison by Nebuchadnezzar, where he continued till the death of this prince, and the accession of <i>Evilmerodach</i>, who brought him out of prison, in which he had been detained thirty-seven years, and restored him to such favour that his throne (seat) was exalted above all the kings which were with him in Babylon: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+52:31-32">Jeremiah 52:31-32</span>. But though he thus became a royal favourite, he was never restored to his kingdom. And, according to the prophecy of Jeremiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+22:30">Jeremiah 22:30</span>, no man of his seed <i>sat</i> upon the throne of David; yet the regal <i>line</i> was continued through his son <i>Salathiel</i>, who died in Babylon: but <i>Zorobabel</i>, his son, returned from captivity, and by him the race of David was continued, according to Matthew, by <i>Abiud</i>; and, according to Luke, by <i>Rhesa</i>.

<p>The term carrying away to <i>Babylon</i>, μετοικεσια, from μετοικεω, to <i>change a habitation</i>, or <i>place of residence</i>, would be more properly translated by the word <i>transportation</i>, which is here peculiarly appropriate: the <i>change</i> was not <i>voluntary</i> they were <i>forced</i> away.</p>
