<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:16">Matthew 1:16</span>. <i><b>Jesus, who is called Christ.</b></i> — As the word Χριστος <i>Christ</i>, signifies the anointed or anointer, from χριω, to <i>anoint</i>, it answers exactly to the Hebrew משיח <i>mashiach</i>, which we pronounce <i>Messiah</i> or <i>Messias</i>; this word comes from the root משח <i>mashac</i>, signifying the same thing. As the same person is intended by both the Hebrew and Greek appellation, it should be regularly translated The Messiah, or The Christ; whichever is preferred, the demonstrative article should never be omitted.</p>
<p><i>Priests, prophets</i>, and <i>kings</i>, among the Jews, were <i>anointed</i> in order to the legitimate exercise of their respective offices. Hence the word Χριστος <i>Christ</i>, or משיח <i>Mashiach</i>, became a name of <i>dignity</i>, and often signified the same as <i>king</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:1">Isaiah 45:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:15">Psalms 105:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+4:3">Leviticus 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+6:20">Leviticus 6:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:10">1 Samuel 2:10</span>. The words משיח <i>Mashiach</i> and מלך <i>melec</i>, Χριστος and βασιλευς, <i>Christ</i> and <i>king</i>, are frequently interchanged. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:10">1 Samuel 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:2">Psalms 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:6">Psalms 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span>; and see the Scholia of <i>Rosenmuller</i> on this place. The reason of this may be seen in the following note, which I extract from the comment on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:7">Exodus 29:7</span>.</p>
<p>"It appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>, that <i>anointing with oil</i>, in consecrating a person to any important office, whether <i>civil</i> or <i>religious</i>, was considered as an emblem of the communication of the gifts and graces of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>. This ceremony was used on <i>three</i> occasions, viz. the installation of <i>prophets, priests</i>, and <i>kings</i>, into their respective offices. But why should such an anointing be deemed necessary? Because the common sense of men taught them that all good, whether spiritual or secular, must come from God, its origin and cause. Hence it was taken for granted,</p>
<p>1. That no man could <i>foretell events</i>, unless inspired by the Spirit of God. And therefore the <i>prophet</i> was <i>anointed</i>, to signify the communication of the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>2. That no person could offer an acceptable <i>sacrifice</i> to God for the sins of men, or profitably minister in holy things, unless enlightened, influenced, and directed, by the Spirit of grace and holiness. Hence the <i>priest</i> was anointed, to signify his being divinely qualified for the due performance of his sacred functions.</p>
<p>3. That no man could enact just and equitable <i>laws</i>, which should have the prosperity of the community and the welfare of the individual continually in view, or could use the power confided to him only for the suppression of vice and the encouragement of virtue, but that man who was ever under the inspiration of the Almighty.</p>
<p>Hence <i>kings</i> were inaugurated by anointing with oil. <i>Two</i> of these offices only exist in all civilized nations, the <i>sacerdotal</i> and <i>regal</i>; and, in some countries, the <i>priest</i> and <i>king</i> are still consecrated by <i>anointing.</i> In the Hebrew language משח <i>mashach</i> signifies to <i>anoint</i>; and משיח <i>mashiach</i>, the <i>anointed person</i>. But as no man was ever dignified by holding the <i>three</i> offices, so no person ever had the title <i>Mashiach</i>, the anointed one, but Jesus, The CHRIST. He alone is <i>King</i> of kings, and Lord of lords: the king who <i>governs</i> the universe, and <i>rules</i> in the hearts of his followers; the <i>prophet</i>, to instruct men in the way wherein they should go; and the great <i>high priest</i>, to make atonement for their sins. Hence he is called the <i>Messias</i>, a corruption of the word המשיח <i>ha-mashiach</i>, THE <i>anointed</i> ONE, in Hebrew; which gave birth to ὁ Χριστος <i>ho</i> <i>Christos</i>, which has precisely the same signification in Greek: of him, Melchisedeck, Abraham, Aaron, David, and others, were illustrious types. But none of these had the title of THE MESSIAH, or THE ANOINTED OF GOD. This does, and ever will, belong exclusively to JESUS, <i>The</i> CHRIST."</p>
