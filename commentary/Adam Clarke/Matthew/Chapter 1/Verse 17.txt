<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:17">Matthew 1:17</span>. <i><b>Fourteen generations</b></i> â€” <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:11">Matthew 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:11">Matthew 1:11</span></span>. The Jews had a sort of technical method of summing up generations in this way. In <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, p. 132, n. 18, we have the following words; "From Abraham to Solomon were fifteen generations; and then the moon was at the full. From Solomon to Zedekiah were other fifteen generations; the moon was then in the wane, and Zedekiah's eyes were put out." That is, the regal state came to its zenith of light and glory in the time of <i>Solomon</i>; but decreased gradually, till it became nearly extinct in the days of <i>Zedekiah</i>. See <i>Schoetgen</i>.</p>
