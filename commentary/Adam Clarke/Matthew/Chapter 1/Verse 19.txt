<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:19">Matthew 1:19</span>. <i><b>To make her a public example</b></i> — παραδειγματισαι, to expose her to public infamy; from παρα, <i>near</i>, and δεικνυμαι, <i>I</i> <i>show</i>, or <i>expose</i>; what is oddly, though emphatically, called in England, <i>showing up</i>-exposing a character to public view. Though Joseph was a <i>righteous</i> man, δικαιος, and knew that the law required that such persons as he supposed his wife to be should be put to death, yet, as <i>righteousness</i> is ever directed by <i>mercy</i>, he determined to put her away or divorce her <i>privately</i>, i.e. without assigning any cause, that her life might be saved; and, as the offence was against himself, he had a right to pass it by if he chose. Some have supposed that the term δικαιος should be translated <i>merciful</i>, and it certainly often has this signification; but here it is not necessary.</p>
