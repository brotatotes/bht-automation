<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>. <i><b>JESUS</b></i> — The same as Joshua, יהושע Yehoshua, from ישע <i>yasha</i>, he <i>saved, delivered, put in a state of safety</i>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:9">Exodus 13:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+13:16">Numbers 13:16</span>, and in the preface to <i>Joshua</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He shall save his people from their sins.</b></i> — This shall be his great business in the world: the great errand on which he is come, viz. to make an atonement for, and to destroy, sin: deliverance from all the <i>power, guilt</i>, and <i>pollution</i> of sin, is the privilege of every believer in Christ Jesus. Less than this is not spoken of in the Gospel; and less than this would be unbecoming the Gospel. The perfection of the Gospel system is not that it makes <i>allowances</i> for sin, but that it makes an <i>atonement</i> for it: not that it <i>tolerates</i> sin, but that it <i>destroys</i> it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>, he is called <i>Jesus Christ</i>, on which Dr. Lightfoot properly remarks, "That the name of <i>Jesus</i>, so often added to the name of <i>Christ</i> in the New Testament, is not only that Christ might be thereby pointed out as the <i>Saviour</i>, but also that Jesus might be pointed out as the true <i>Christ</i> or <i>Messiah</i>, against the unbelief of the Jews." This observation will be of great use in numberless places of the New Testament.
