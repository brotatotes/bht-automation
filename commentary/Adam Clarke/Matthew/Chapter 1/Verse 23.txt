<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:23">Matthew 1:23</span>. <i><b>Behold, a virgin shall be with child</b></i> — We have already seen, from the preceding verse, that this prophecy is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span>; but it may be necessary to consider the circumstances of the <i>original</i> promise more particularly. At the time referred to, the kingdom of Judah, under the government of Ahaz, was reduced very low. <i>Pekah</i>, king of Israel, had slain in Judea 120,000 persons in one day, and carried away captives 200,000, including women and children, together with much spoil. To add to their distress, <i>Rezin</i>, king of Syria, being confederate with <i>Pekah</i>, had taken <i>Elath</i>, a fortified city of Judah, and carried the inhabitants away captive to Damascus. In this critical conjuncture, need we wonder that Ahaz was afraid that the enemies who were now united against him must prevail, destroy Jerusalem, and the kingdom of Judah, and annihilate the family of David! To meet and remove this fear, apparently well grounded, Isaiah is sent from the Lord to Ahaz, swallowed up now both by sorrow and by unbelief, in order to assure him that the counsels of his enemies should not stand; and that they should be utterly discomfited. To encourage Ahaz, he commands him to ask <i>a sign</i> or <i>miracle</i>, which should be a pledge in hand, that God should, in due time, fulfil the predictions of his servant, as related in the context. On Ahaz humbly refusing to ask any sign, it is immediately added, <i>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a</i> <i>sign: Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son; and shall</i> <i>call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat</i>, c. Both the <i>Divine</i> and <i>human</i> nature of our Lord, as well as the miraculous conception, appear to be pointed out in the prophecy quoted here by the evangelist: - He shall be called עמנו־אל IM-MENU-EL literally, <i>The</i> STRONG GOD WITH US: similar to those words in the New Testament: - <i>The Word</i> which <i>was God-was made flesh, and dwelt</i> <i>among us, full of grace and truth</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. And, <i>God was manifested in the flesh</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>. So that we are to understand, <i>God with us</i>, to imply God <i>incarnated</i>-God in <i>human</i> <i>nature</i>. This seems farther evident from the words of the prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:15">Isaiah 7:15</span>. <i>Butter and honey shall he eat </i>- he shall be truly <i>man</i>, grow up and be nourished in a <i>human, natural way</i>; which refers to his being WITH US, i.e. incarnated. To which the prophet adds, <i>That he may</i> <i>know to refuse the evil and choose the good</i>: - or rather, <i>According</i> <i>to his knowledge</i>, לדעתו le-daato, reprobating the evil, and <i>choosing the good</i>. This refers to him as GOD; and is the same idea given by this prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span>: <i>By</i> (or in) <i>his knowledge</i> (the knowledge of Christ crucified, בדעתו <i>be-dadto</i>) <i>shall my righteous servant sanctify many; for he shall</i> <i>bear their offences</i>. Now this <i>union</i> of the Divine and human nature is termed a <i>sign</i> or <i>miracle</i>, אות oth, i.e. something which exceeds the power of nature to produce. And this <i>miraculous</i> <i>union</i> was to be brought about in a <i>miraculous way: Behold a</i> VIRGIN <i>shall conceive</i>: the word is very emphatic, העלמה <i>ha-almah</i>, THE <i>virgin</i>; the only one that ever was, or ever shall be, a <i>mother</i> in this way. But the <i>Jews</i>, and some called <i>Christians</i>, who have espoused their desperate cause, assert, that "the word עלמה <i>almah</i> does not signify a VIRGIN <i>only</i>; for it is applied, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:19">Proverbs 30:19</span>, to signify a young <i>married</i> woman." I answer, that this latter text is no proof of the contrary doctrine: the words דרך גבר בעלמה <i>derec</i> <i>geber be-almah</i>, <i>the way of a man with a maid</i>, cannot be proved to mean <i>that</i> for which it is produced: beside, one of De Rossi's MSS. reads בעלמיו <i>be-almaiu</i>, the <i>way of a strong</i>, or stout, <i>man</i> (גבר geber) IN HIS YOUTH; and in this reading the <i>Syriac</i>, <i>Septuagint, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Arabic</i> agree, which are followed by the <i>first version</i> in the English language, as it stands in a MS. in my own possession - <i>the weie of a man in his waring youthe</i>; so that this place, the only one that can with any <i>probability</i> of <i>success</i> be produced, were the interpretation contended for correct, which I am by no means disposed to admit, proves nothing. Beside, the consent of so many <i>versions</i> in the opposite meaning deprives it of much of its influence in this question.</p>
<p>The word עלמה <i>almah</i>, comes from עלם <i>alam</i>, to <i>lie hid</i>, be concealed; and we are told that "virgins were so called, because they were <i>concealed</i> or <i>closely kept up</i> in their fathers' houses, till the time of their marriage." This is not correct: see the case of Rebecca, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:43">Genesis 24:43</span>, and my note there: that of Rachel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:6">Genesis 29:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:9">Genesis 29:9</span>, and the note there also: and see the case of Miriam, the sister of Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:8">Exodus 2:8</span>, and also the Chaldee paraphrase on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="la+1:4">Lamentations 1:4</span>, where the <i>virgins</i> are represented as <i>going out</i> in the dance. And see also the whole history of <i>Ruth</i>. This being <i>concealed</i>, or <i>kept</i> <i>at home</i>, on which so much stress is laid, is purely fanciful; for we find that young <i>unmarried</i> women drew water, kept sheep, gleaned publicly in the fields, c., c., and the same works they perform among the Turcomans to the present day. This reason, therefore, does not account for the radical meaning of the word and we must seek it elsewhere. Another well known and often used root in the Hebrew tongue will cast light on this subject. This is גלה <i>galah</i>, which signifies to <i>reveal, make manifest</i>, or <i>uncover</i>, and is often applied to matrimonial connections, in different parts of the Mosaic law: עלם <i>alam</i>, therefore, may be considered as implying the <i>concealment</i> of the <i>virgin</i>, as <i>such</i>, till lawful marriage had taken place. A virgin was not called עלמה <i>almah</i>, because she was concealed by being kept at home in her father's house, which is not true, but <i>literally</i> and <i>physically</i>, because, as a woman, she had not been <i>uncovered </i>- she had not known man. This fully applies to the blessed virgin: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:34">Luke 1:34</span>. "How can this be, seeing <i>I know no man</i>?" and this text throws much light on the subject before us. This also is in perfect agreement with the ancient prophecy, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent," <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span> for the person who was to destroy the work of the devil was to be the progeny of the <i>woman</i>, without any concurrence of the <i>man</i>. And, hence, the text in Genesis speaks as fully of the <i>virgin state</i> of the person, from whom <i>Christ</i>, according to the flesh, should come, as that in the <i>prophet</i>, or this in the <i>evangelist</i>. According to the original promise, there was to be a <i>seed</i>, a <i>human being</i>, who should destroy sin; but this <i>seed</i> or <i>human being</i> must come from the <i>woman</i> ALONE; and no <i>woman</i> ALONE, could produce such a human being, without being a <i>virgin</i>. Hence, <i>A virgin shall bear a son</i>, is the very spirit and meaning of the original text, independently of the <i>illustration</i> given by the prophet; and the <i>fact</i> recorded by the evangelist is the proof of the whole. But how could that be a <i>sign</i> to <i>Ahaz</i>, which was to take place so many hundreds of years after? I answer, the meaning of the prophet is plain: not only Rezin and Pekah should be unsuccessful against Jerusalem at <i>that</i> <i>time</i>, which was the fact; but Jerusalem, Judea, and the house of David, should be both preserved, notwithstanding their depressed state, and the multitude of their adversaries, till the time should come when a VIRGIN <i>should bear a son</i>. This is a most remarkable circumstance - the house of David could never fail, till a virgin should conceive and bear a son-nor did it: but when that incredible and miraculous fact did take place, the kingdom and house of David became extinct! This is an irrefragable confutation of every argument a Jew can offer in vindication of his opposition to the Gospel of Christ. Either the prophecy in Isaiah has been fulfilled, or the kingdom and house of David are yet standing. But the kingdom of David, we know, is destroyed: and where is the man, Jew or Gentile, that can show us a single descendant of David on the face of the earth? The prophecy could not fail-the kingdom and house of David have failed; the <i>virgin</i>, therefore, must have brought forth her son-and this son is Jesus, the Christ. Thus Moses, Isaiah, and Matthew concur; and facts, the most unequivocal, have confirmed the whole! Behold the wisdom and providence of God!</p>
<p>Notwithstanding what has been said above, it may be asked, In what sense could this name <i>Immanuel</i> be applied to Jesus Christ, if he be not truly and properly GOD? Could the Spirit of truth ever design that Christians should receive him as an <i>angel</i> or a <i>mere</i> <i>man</i>, and yet, in the very beginning of the Gospel history, apply a character to him which belongs only to the most high God? Surely <i>no</i>. In what sense, then, is Christ GOD WITH US? Jesus is called Immanuel, or <i>God with us</i>, in his <i>incarnation</i>. - God united to our nature - <i>God with man </i>- God <i>in</i> man. - <i>God with us</i>, by his continual <i>protection. - God with us</i>, by the <i>influences</i> of his <i>Holy Spirit </i>- in the <i>holy sacrament </i>- in the <i>preaching</i> of his <i>word </i>- in <i>private</i> <i>prayer</i>. And <i>God with us</i>, through every <i>action</i> of our life, that we begin, continue, and end in his name. He is <i>God with us</i>, to <i>comfort, enlighten, protect</i>, and <i>defend</i> us in every time of <i>temptation</i> and <i>trial</i>, in the hour of <i>death</i>, in the day of <i>judgment</i>; and <i>God with us</i>, and <i>in</i> us, and we <i>with</i> and <i>in</i> him, to all eternity.</p>
