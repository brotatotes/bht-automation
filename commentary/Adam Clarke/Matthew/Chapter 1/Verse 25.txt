<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:25">Matthew 1:25</span>. <i><b>Her first-born son</b></i> — Τον υιον αυτης τον πρω-οτοκον. Literally, <i>That son of hers, the first-born one</i>. That Mary might have had <i>other</i> children, any person may reasonably and piously believe; that she had <i>others</i>, many think exceedingly probable, and that this text is at least an indirect proof of it. However this may be, the <i>perpetual virginity</i> of Mary should not be made an article of faith. God has not made it one: indeed it can hardly bear the light of several texts in the Gospels.</p>
<p><i><b>He knew her not</b></i> — Had no matrimonial intercourse with her - TILL <i>she had brought forth that son of hers</i>, of whom the evangelist had been just speaking, <i>the first-born</i>, the eldest of the family, to whom the <i>birthright</i> belonged, and who was miraculously born before she knew any man, being yet in a state of virginity. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span>. The virginity of Mary, previously to the birth of Christ, is an article of the utmost consequence to the Christian system; and therefore it is an article of faith: her <i>perpetual</i> virginity is of no consequence; and the learned labour spent to prove it has produced a mere castle in the air. The thing is <i>possible</i>; but it never has been, and never can be <i>proved</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He called his name</b></i> JESUS.] This name was given by the command of God, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:16">Matthew 1:16</span>, and was imposed on Christ when eight days old; for then, according to the Jewish law, he was circumcised: thus he had the name of <i>Saviour</i> given when he first began to <i>shed</i> <i>that blood</i> without which there could be no <i>remission of sins</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>goodness</i> of God is manifested, not only in his giving his Son to save a lost world, but also in the choice of the <i>persons</i> who were his progenitors: among whom we find, First, SAINTS, to excite our courage: <i>Abraham</i>, remarkable for his <i>faith; Isaac</i>, for his <i>obedience</i>; and <i>Jacob</i>, for his <i>fervour</i> and <i>constancy</i>.</p>
<p>Secondly, <i>Penitent</i> SINNERS, to excite our <i>confidence</i>: such as <i>David, Manasses</i>, c.</p>
<p>Thirdly, <i>Sinners</i>, of whose repentance and salvation we hear nothing to put us on our guard. Who can read the account of idolatrous Solomon, who, from the whole evidence of the sacred history, died In his sins, without trembling?</p>
<p><i>Four</i> WOMEN are mentioned in this genealogy: two of these were <i>adulteresses, Tamar</i> and <i>Bathsheba</i>; and two were <i>Gentiles, Rahab</i> and <i>Ruth</i>, and strangers to the covenant of promise; to teach us that Jesus Christ came to save <i>sinners</i>, and that, though <i>strangers</i> to his people, we are not on that account excluded from a salvation which God has designed for <i>all men</i>. He is not the God of the <i>Jews</i> only; he is also the God of the <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
<p>The state of the royal family of David, the circumstances of the holy virgin and her spouse Joseph, the very remarkable prophecy of Isaiah, the literal and circumstantial fulfilment of it, the names given to our blessed Lord, the genealogical scroll of the family, c., &amp;c., are all so many proofs of the wisdom, goodness, and providence of God. Every occurrence seems, at first view, to be abandoned to fortuitous influence, and yet the result of each shows that God managed the whole. These circumstances are of the greatest importance nor can the Christian reader reflect on them without an increase of his <i>faith</i> and his <i>piety</i>.</p>
