<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:8">Matthew 1:8</span>. <i><b>Joram begat Ozias</b></i> — This is the Uzziah, king of Judah, who was struck with the leprosy for his presumption in entering the temple to offer incense before the Lord. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+26:16">2 Chronicles 26:16</span>, c. <i>Ozias</i> was not the immediate son of <i>Joram</i>: there were three kings between them, <i>Ahaziah, Joash</i>, and <i>Amaziah</i>, which swell the <i>fourteen</i> generations to <i>seventeen</i>: but it is observed that omissions of this kind are not uncommon in the Jewish genealogies. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ezr+7:3">Ezra 7:3</span>, Azariah is called the son of <i>Meraioth</i>, although it is evident, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+6:7-9">1 Chronicles 6:7-9</span>, that there were <i>six</i> descendants between them. This circumstance the evangelist was probably aware of but did not see it proper to attempt to correct what he found in the public accredited genealogical tables; as he knew it to be of no consequence to his argument, which was merely to show that Jesus Christ as surely descended, in an uninterrupted line from <i>David</i>, as <i>David</i> did from <i>Abraham</i>. And this he has done in the most satisfactory manner; nor did any person in those days pretend to detect any inaccuracy in his statement; though the account was published among those very people whose interest it was to expose the fallacy, in vindication of their own obstinate rejection of the Messiah, if any such fallacy could have been proved. But as <i>they</i> were silent, modern and comparatively modern unbelievers may for ever hold their peace. The objections raised on this head are worthy of no regard; yet the following statement deserves notice.</p>
<p>St. Matthew took up the genealogies just as he found them in the public Jewish records, which, though they were in the main correct, yet were deficient in many particulars. The Jews themselves give us sufficient proof of this. The <i>Talmud</i>, title <i>Kiddushim</i>, mentions <i>ten</i> classes of persons who returned from the Babylonish captivity:</p>
<p>I. כהני COHANEY, <i>priests</i>.</p>
<p>II. לוי LEVEY, <i>Levites</i>.</p>
<p>III. ישראל YISHRAEL, <i>Israelites</i>.</p>
<p>IV. חלולי CHULULEY, <i>common persons</i>, as to the priesthood; such whose <i>fathers</i> were priests, but their mothers were such as the priests should not marry.</p>
<p>V. גירי GIREY, <i>proselytes</i>.</p>
<p>VI. חרורי CHARUREY, <i>freed-men</i>, or <i>servants</i> who had been <i>liberated</i> by their masters.</p>
<p>VII. ממזירי MAMZIREY, <i>spurious</i>, such as were born in <i>unlawful</i> <i>wedlock</i>.</p>
<p>VIII. נתיני NETHINEY, <i>Nethinim</i>.</p>
<p>IX. שתוקי SHETUKEY, <i>bastards</i>, persons whose <i>mothers</i>, though well known, could not ascertain the <i>fathers</i> of their children, because of their connections with different men.</p>
<p>X. אסופי ASUPHEY, such as were <i>gathered up</i> out of the streets, whose fathers and mothers were utterly unknown.</p>
<p>Such was the <i>heterogeneous mass</i> brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem; and although we learn from the Jews, that great care was taken to separate the spurious from the true-born Israelites, and canons were made for that purpose, yet it so happened, that sometimes a spurious family had got into high authority, and therefore must not be meddled with. See several cases in <i>Lightfoot</i>. On this account, a faithful genealogist would insert in his roll such only as were indisputable. "It is therefore easy to guess," says Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i>, "whence Matthew took the last <i>fourteen</i> generations of this genealogy, and Luke the first <i>forty</i> names of his: namely, from the genealogical rolls, at that time well known, and laid up in the public κειμηλια, repositories, and in the private also. And it was necessary indeed, in so noble and sublime a subject, and a thing that would be so much inquired into by the Jewish people, as the lineage of the Messiah would be, that the evangelists should deliver a truth, not only that could not be gainsayed, but also might be proved and established from certain and undoubted rolls of ancestors."
