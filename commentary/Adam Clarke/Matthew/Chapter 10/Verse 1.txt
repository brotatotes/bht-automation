<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:1">Matthew 10:1</span>. <i><b>Twelve disciples</b></i> — Our Lord seems to have had the <i>twelve patriarchs</i>, heads of the congregation of Israel, in view, in his choosing <i>twelve disciples</i>. That he had the plan of the ancient Jewish Church in his eye is sufficiently evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span> and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>, &amp;c., and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12-14">Revelation 21:12-14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>He gave them power</b></i><b> against </b><i><b>unclean spirits</b></i> — The word κατα, <i>against</i>, which our translators have supplied in <i>Italic</i>, is found in many MSS. of good note, and in the principal versions. Here we find the first call to the Christian ministry, and the <i>end</i> proposed by the commission given. To call persons to the ministry belongs only to <i>Him</i> who can give them <i>power to cast out unclean</i> <i>spirits</i>. He whose ministry is not accompanied with <i>healing</i> to diseased souls, was never called of God. But let it be observed, that, though the spiritual gifts requisite for the ministry must be supplied by God himself, yet this does not preclude the importance of <i>human learning</i>. No man can have his mind too well cultivated, to whom a dispensation of the Gospel is committed. The influence of the Spirit of God was no more designed to render human learning useless, than that learning should be considered as superseding the necessity of Divine inspiration.</p>
