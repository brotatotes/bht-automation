<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span>. <i><b>Nor scrip for</b></i><b> your </b><i><b>journey</b></i> — To carry provisions. This was called תורמיל <i>tormil</i>, by the rabbins; it was a leathern pouch hung about their necks, in which they put their victuals. This was properly, the <i>shepherd's bag</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither two coats</b></i>, c.] Nothing to encumber you.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor yet staves</b></i> — ραβδον, <i>a staff</i>, as in the <i>margin</i>, but, instead of ραβδον, <i>staff</i>, which is the common reading, all the following MSS. and versions have ραβδους, <i>staves</i>, and CEFGKLMPS. V. <i>ninety-three</i> others, <i>Coptic, Armenian, latter Syriac</i>, one of the <i>Itala, Chrysostom</i>, and <i>Theophylact</i>. This reading is of great importance, as it reconciles this place with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:3">Luke 9:3</span>, and removes the seeming contradiction from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:8">Mark 6:8</span> as if he had said: "Ye shall take nothing to defend yourselves with, because ye are the servants of the Lord, and are to be supported by his <i>bounty</i>, and defended by his <i>power</i>. In a word, be like men in haste, and eager to begin the important work of the ministry. The sheep are lost-ruined: Satan is devouring them: give all diligence to pluck them out of the jaws of the destroyer."</p>
<p><i><b>The workman is worthy of his meat.</b></i> — της τροφης αυτου, <i>of his</i> <i>maintenance</i>. It is a <i>maintenance</i>, and that only, which a minister of God is to expect, and <i>that</i> he has a Divine right to; but not to make a fortune, or lay up wealth: besides, it is the <i>workman</i>, he that <i>labours</i> in the word and doctrine, that is to get even this. How contrary to Christ is it for a man to have vast revenues, as a minister of the Gospel, who ministers no Gospel, and who spends the revenues of the Church to its disgrace and ruin!</p>
