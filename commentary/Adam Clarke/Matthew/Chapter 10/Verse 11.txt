<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:11">Matthew 10:11</span>. <i><b>Into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter</b></i> — In the commencement of Christianity, Christ and his preachers were all <i>itinerant</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Inquire who in it is worthy</b></i> — That is, of a good character; for a preacher of the Gospel should be careful of his reputation, and lodge only with those who are of a regular life.</p>
<p><i><b>There abide till ye go thence.</b></i> — <i>Go not about from house to</i> <i>house</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:7">Luke 10:7</span>. Acting contrary to this precept has often brought a great disgrace on the Gospel of God. Stay in your own lodging as much as possible, that you may have time for prayer and study. Seldom frequent the tables of the rich and great; if you do, it will unavoidably prove a snare to you. The unction of God will perish from your mind, and your preaching be only a dry barren repetition of <i>old things</i>; the bread of God in your hands will be like the <i>dry, mouldy, Gibeonitish crusts</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+9:5">Joshua 9:5</span>. He who knows the value of time, and will redeem it from useless chit-chat, and trifling visits, will find enough for all the purposes of his own salvation, the cultivation of his mind, and the work of the ministry. He to whom time is not precious, and who lives not <i>by rule</i>, never finds time sufficient for any thing-is always embarrassed-always in a hurry, and never capable of bringing one good purpose to proper effect.</p>
