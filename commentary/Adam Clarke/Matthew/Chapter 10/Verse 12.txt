<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:12">Matthew 10:12</span>. <i><b>Salute it</b></i> — Λεγουτες, ειρηνη εν τω οικω τουτω, <i>saying,</i> <i>"Peace be to this house."</i> This clause, which, as explanatory of the word ασπασασθε, is necessary to the connection in which it now stands, is added, by the MSS. D and L, and <i>forty-three</i> others, the <i>Armenian, Ethiopic, Slavonic, Saxon, Vulgate</i>, all the copies of the old <i>Itala, Theophylact</i>, and <i>Hilary</i>. The clause is also found in several modern versions. The <i>modern</i> Greek has λεγοντες· ειρηνη εις το σκηπρι τουτο. The Italian, by Matthew, of Erberg, and of Diodati, renders it thus: <i>Pace sia a questa casa</i>. Peace be to this house.</p>
<p>It is found also in <i>Wickliff</i>, and in my old MS. <i>Seyinge, pees be</i> <i>to this hous</i>. Some suppose it is an addition taken from <i>Luke</i>; but there is nearly as much reason to believe <i>he</i> took it from <i>Matthew</i>.</p>
<p><i>Peace</i>, שלום, among the Hebrews, had a very extensive meaning: - it comprehended all blessings, spiritual and temporal. Hence that saying of the rabbins, גדול שלום שכל הברכות כלולות בו <i>Gadal</i> <i>shalom, shecol haberacoth culoloth bo. Great is</i> PEACE, <i>for all</i> <i>other blessings are comprehended in it</i>. To wish peace to a family, in the name and by the authority of Christ, was in effect a positive <i>promise</i>, on the Lord's side, of all the good implied in the wish. This was paying largely even beforehand. Whoever receives the messengers of God into his house confers the highest honour upon <i>himself</i>, and not upon the preacher, whose honour is from God, and who comes with the blessings of life eternal to that man and his family who receives him.</p>
<p>In India, it is customary for a way-faring man, when night draws on, to enter a house, and simply say, "Sir, I am a guest with you this night." If the owner cannot lodge him, he makes an apology, and the traveller proceeds to another house.</p>
