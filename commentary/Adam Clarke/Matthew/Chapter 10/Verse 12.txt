Verse Matthew 10:12. Salute it — Λεγουτες, ειρηνη εν τω οικω τουτω, saying, "Peace be to this house." This clause, which, as explanatory of the word ασπασασθε, is necessary to the connection in which it now stands, is added, by the MSS. D and L, and forty-three others, the Armenian, Ethiopic, Slavonic, Saxon, Vulgate, all the copies of the old Itala, Theophylact, and Hilary. The clause is also found in several modern versions. The modern Greek has λεγοντες· ειρηνη εις το σκηπρι τουτο. The Italian, by Matthew, of Erberg, and of Diodati, renders it thus: Pace sia a questa casa. Peace be to this house.It is found also in Wickliff, and in my old MS. Seyinge, pees be to this hous.

This was paying largely even beforehand. Whoever receives the messengers of God into his house confers the highest honour upon himself, and not upon the preacher, whose honour is from God, and who comes with the blessings of life eternal to that man and his family who receives him.In India, it is customary for a way-faring man, when night draws on, to enter a house, and simply say, "Sir, I am a guest with you this night." If the owner cannot lodge him, he makes an apology, and the traveller proceeds to another house.
