<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:13">Matthew 10:13</span>. <i><b>If that house be worthy</b></i> — If that <i>family</i> be proper for a preacher to lodge in, and the master be ready to embrace the message of salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Your peace</b></i> — The blessings you have prayed for shall come upon the family: God will prosper them in their bodies, souls, and substance.</p>
<p><i><b>But if it be not worthy</b></i> — As above explained.</p>
<p><i><b>Let your peace</b></i> — The blessings prayed for, return to you. προς υμας επιστραφητω, <i>it shall turn back upon yourselves</i>. They shall get nothing, and <i>you</i> shall have an increase.</p>
<p>The trials, disappointments, insults, and wants of the followers of Christ become, in the hand of the all-wise God, subservient to their best interests: hence, nothing can happen to them without their deriving profit from it, unless it be their own fault.</p>
