Verse Matthew 10:14. Shake off the dust of your feet. â€” The Jews considered themselves defiled by the dust of a heathen country, when was represented by the prophets as a polluted land, Amos 7:17, when compared with the land of Israel, which was considered as a holy land, Ezekiel 45:1; therefore, to shake the dust of any city of Israel from off one's clothes or feet was an emblematical action, signifying a renunciation of all farther connection with them, and placing them on a level with the cities of the Heathen. Amos 9:7; Amos 9:7.
