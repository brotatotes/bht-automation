<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:15">Matthew 10:15</span>. <i><b>In the day of judgment</b></i> — Or, <i>punishment</i>, - κρισεως. Perhaps not meaning <i>the day</i> of <i>general judgment</i>, nor the day of the <i>destruction of the Jewish state</i> by the <i>Romans</i>; but <i>a</i> day in which God should send <i>punishment</i> on that particular city, or on that person, for their crimes. So the <i>day of judgment</i> of <i>Sodom</i> <i>and Gomorrah</i>, was the time in which the Lord destroyed them by fire and brimstone, from the Lord out of heaven.</p>
<p>If men are thus treated for not receiving the preachers of the Gospel, what will it be to despise the <i>Gospel</i> itself - to decry it - to preach the contrary - to hinder the preaching of it - to abuse those who do preach it in its purity - or to render it fruitless by calumnies and lies! Their <i>punishment</i>, our Lord intimates, shall be greater than that inflicted on the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah!</p>
