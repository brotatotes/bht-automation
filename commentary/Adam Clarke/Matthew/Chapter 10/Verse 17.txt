Verse Matthew 10:17. But beware of men — Or, be on your guard against men, των ανθρωπων THESE men; i.e. your countrymen; those from whom you might have reasonably expected comfort and support; and especially those in power, who will abuse that power to oppress you.Councils — συνεδρια, sanhedrins and synagogues. Matthew 5:22. "By synagogues we may understand here, not the places of public worship, but assemblies where three magistrates, chosen out of the principal members of the synagogue, presided to adjust differences among the people: these had power, in certain cases, to condemn to the scourge, but not to death. See Acts 22:19; 2 Corinthians 11:24, compared with Luke 12:11." See Lightfoot.
