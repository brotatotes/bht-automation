D and L, and several others, some versions, and several of the fathers: but it is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:11">Mark 13:11</span>, without any <i>various reading</i>; and in substance in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:13">Luke 11:13</span>.</p>
