Verse Matthew 10:2. Apostles — This is the first place where the word is used. αποστολος, an apostle, comes from αποστελλω, I send a message. The word was anciently used to signify a person commissioned by a king to negotiate any affair between him and any other power or people. Hence αποστολοι and κηρυκες, apostles and heralds, are of the same import in Herodotus. See the remarks at the end of chap. Matthew 3:0.It is worthy of notice, that those who were Christ's apostles were first his disciples; to intimate, that men must be first taught of God, before they be sent of God. Jesus Christ never made an apostle of any man who was not first his scholar or disciple. These twelve apostles were chosen.1. That they might be with our Lord, to see and witness his miracles, and hear his doctrine.2. That they might bear testimony of the former, and preach his truth to mankind.The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; c.] We are not to suppose that the word πρωτος, first, refers to any kind of dignity, as some have imagined it merely signifies the first in order - the person first mentioned. A pious man remarks: "God here unites by grace those who were before united by nature." Though nature cannot be deemed a step towards grace, yet it is not to be considered as always a hinderance to it. Happy the brothers who are joint envoys of Heaven, and the parents who have two or more children employed as ambassadors for God! But this is a very rare case; and family compacts in the work of the ministry are dangerous and should be avoided.
