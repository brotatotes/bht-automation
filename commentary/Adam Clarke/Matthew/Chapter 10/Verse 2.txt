<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:2">Matthew 10:2</span>. <i><b>Apostles</b></i> — This is the first place where the word is used. αποστολος, an <i>apostle</i>, comes from αποστελλω, <i>I send a</i> <i>message</i>. The word was anciently used to signify a person commissioned by a king to negotiate any affair between him and any other power or people. Hence αποστολοι and κηρυκες, <i>apostles</i> and <i>heralds</i>, are of the same import in <i>Herodotus</i>. See the remarks at the end of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:0">Matthew 3:0</span>.</p>
<p>It is worthy of notice, that those who were Christ's <i>apostles</i> were first his <i>disciples</i>; to intimate, that men must be first <i>taught</i> of God, before they be <i>sent</i> of God. Jesus Christ never made an <i>apostle</i> of any man who was not first his <i>scholar</i> or <i>disciple</i>. These twelve apostles were chosen.</p>
<p>1. That they might be with our Lord, to see and witness his miracles, and hear his doctrine.</p>
<p>2. That they might bear testimony of the former, and preach his truth to mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother;</b></i> c.] We are not to suppose that the word πρωτος, <i>first</i>, refers to any kind of dignity, as some have imagined it merely signifies the <i>first in order </i>- the person <i>first mentioned</i>. A pious man remarks: "God here unites by <i>grace</i> those who were before united by <i>nature</i>." Though nature cannot be deemed a step towards grace, yet it is not to be considered as always a hinderance to it. Happy the brothers who are joint envoys of Heaven, and the parents who have two or more children employed as ambassadors for God! But this is a very rare case; and family compacts in the work of the ministry are dangerous and should be avoided.</p>
