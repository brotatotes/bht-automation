Verse Matthew 10:21. And the brother shall deliver up the brother, c.] What an astonishing enmity is there in the soul of man against God and goodness! That men should think they did God service, in putting to death those who differ from them in their political or religious creed, is a thing that cannot be accounted for but on the principle of an indescribable depravity.  O shame to men! devil with devil damn'd Firm concord holds, men only disagree Of creatures rational though under hope Of heavenly grace; and, God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife Among themselves, and levy cruel wars, Wasting the earth, each other to destroy! PAR. Lost, b. ii. l. 496.
