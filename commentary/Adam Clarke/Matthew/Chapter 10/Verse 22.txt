<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22">Matthew 10:22</span>. <i><b>Ye shall be hated of all</b></i><b> men </b><i><b>for my name's sake</b></i> — Because ye are attached to me, and saved from the corruption that is in the world; <i>therefore</i> the world will hate you. "The laws of Christ condemn a vicious world, and gall it to revenge."</p>
<p><i><b>He that endureth to the end shall be saved</b></i> — He who holds fast faith and a good conscience <i>to the end</i>, till the punishment threatened against this wicked people be poured out, <i>he shall be</i> <i>saved</i>, preserved from the destruction that shall fall upon the workers of iniquity. This verse is commonly understood to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem. It is also true that they who do not hold fast faith and a good conscience till <i>death</i> have no room to hope for an admission into the kingdom of God.</p>
