<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span>. <i><b>But when they persecute you</b></i> — It is prudence and humility (when charity or righteousness obliges us not to the contrary) to avoid persecution. To deprive those who are disposed to do evil of the opportunities of doing it; to convey the grace which they despise to others; to accomplish God's designs of justice on the former, and of mercy on the latter, are consequences of the flight of a persecuted preacher. This <i>flight</i> is a <i>precept</i> to those who are highly necessary to the Church of Christ, an <i>advice</i> to those who might imprudently draw upon themselves persecution, and of <i>indulgence</i> for those who are weak. But this <i>flight</i> is highly criminal in those mercenary preachers who, through love to their flesh and their property, abandon the flock of Christ to the wolf. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>In this city, flee ye into another</b></i> — There is a remarkable <i>repetition</i> of this clause found in the MSS. DL and eight others; the <i>Armenian, Saxon</i>, all the <i>Italia</i> except three; <i>Athan.,</i> <i>Theodor., Tertul., August., Ambr., Hilar.,</i> and <i>Juvencus. Bengel</i>, in his <i>gnomon</i> approves of this reading. On the above authorities Griesbach has inserted it in the text. It probably made a portion of this Gospel as written by Matthew. The verse in the MSS. is as follows:-<i>But when they shall persecute you in this city, flee ye</i> <i>into another; and if they persecute in the other, flee ye unto</i> <i>another</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye shall not have gone over</b></i> (<i>ended</i> or <i>finished</i>, margin) <i>the</i> <i>cities</i>, c.] The word τελεσητε here is generally understood as implying <i>to go over</i> or <i>through</i>, intimating that there should not be time for the disciples to <i>travel over</i> the cities of Judea before the destruction predicted by Christ should take place. But this is very far from being the truth, as there were not less than forty years after this was spoken, before Jerusalem was destroyed: τελειων και μανθαναντων are used by the Septuagint. 1Co 25:8, for those who <i>teach</i> and those who <i>learn</i>. And τοις τελειοις is used by the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+2:6">1 Chronicles 2:6</span>, for those who are <i>perfectly instructed</i> in the things of God. Ovid has used the Latin <i>perficio</i>, which answers to the Greek τελειοω in exactly the same sense.</p>
<p><i>Phillyrides puerum cithara perfecit Achillem</i>.</p>
<p>"Chiron TAUGHT the young Achilles to play on the harp."</p>
<p>For these reasons some contend that the passage should be translated, <i>Ye shall not have</i> INSTRUCTED, i.e. preached the Gospel <i>in the</i> <i>cities of Israel, till the Son of man be came</i>. The Greek divines call baptism τελειωσις or <i>initiation</i>. See <i>Leigh. Crit. sacr.</i> Edit. Amst. p. 326, 328.</p>
<p>Dr. Lightfoot supposes the meaning to be: "Ye shall not have travelled over the cities of Israel, preaching the Gospel, before the Son of man is revealed by his resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span> compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:19-20">Acts 3:19-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:26">Acts 5:26</span>. To you first, God, raising up his Son, sent him to bless you, c. The epoch of the Messiah is dated from the resurrection of Christ." After all, the place may be understood literally for τελειν τας πολεις, to finish the cities, is only a concise mode of speech, for τελειν οδον δια τας πολεις, to complete the journey through the cities. To finish the survey, to preach in every one: - <i>till the Son of man be come</i>, may refer either to the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of pentecost, or to the subversion of the Jewish state. See <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
