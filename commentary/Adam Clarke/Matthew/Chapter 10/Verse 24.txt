<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:24">Matthew 10:24</span>. <i><b>The disciple is not above his master</b></i> â€” Or in plainer terms, <i>A scholar is not above his teacher</i>. The saying itself requires no comment, its truth and reasonableness are self-evident, but to the spirit and design we should carefully attend. Jesus is the great <i>teacher</i>: we profess to be his <i>scholars</i>. He who keeps the above saying in his heart will never complain of what he suffers. How many irregular thoughts and affections is this maxim capable of restraining! A man is not a scholar of Christ unless he learn his doctrine; and he does not learn it as he ought unless he put it in <i>practice</i>.</p>
