<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:25">Matthew 10:25</span>. <i><b>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his</b></i> <i>master</i>] Can any man who pretends to be a scholar or disciple of Jesus Christ, expect to be treated well by the <i>world</i>? Will not the world love its <i>own</i>, and them <i>only</i>? Why, then, so much impatience under sufferings, such an excessive sense of injuries, such delicacy? Can you expect any thing from the world better than you receive? If you want the <i>honour</i> that comes from it, abandon Jesus Christ, and it will again receive you into its bosom. But you will, no doubt, count the cost before you do this. Take the converse, abandon the love of the world, c., and God will receive you.</p>
<p><i><b>Beelzebub</b></i> — This name is variously written in the MSS. <i>Beelzebaul, Beelzeboun, Beelzebud</i>, but there is a vast majority in favour of the reading <i>Beelzebul</i>, which should, by all means, be inserted in the text instead of <i>Beelzebub</i>. See the reasons below, and see the <i>margin</i>.</p>
<p>It is supposed that this idol was the same with בעל זבוב <i>Baalzebub</i> the <i>god fly</i>, worshipped at Ekron, 2Kg 1:2, &amp;c., who had his name changed afterwards by the Jews to בעל זבול <i>Baal zebul</i>, the <i>dung god</i>, a title expressive of the utmost <i>contempt</i>. It seems probable that the worship of this vile idol continued even to the time of our Lord and the title, being applied by the Jews to our blessed Lord, affords the strongest proof of the inveteracy of their malice.</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i> has some useful observations on this subject, which I shall take the liberty to subjoin.</p>
<p>"For the searching out the sense of this horrid blasphemy, these things are worthy observing,</p>
<p>"I. Among the <i>Jews</i> it was held, in a manner, for a matter of religion, to <i>reproach idols</i>, and to give them odious names. <i>R.</i> <i>Akibah saith, Idolatry pollutes, as it is said</i>, Thou shalt cast away the (<i>idol</i>) as something that is abominable, and thou shalt say to it, Get thee hence: (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+30:22">Isaiah 30:22</span>.) R. Lazar saith, Thou shalt say to it, Get thee hence: <i>that which they call the</i> face of God, <i>let them call</i> the face of a dog. That <i>which they call</i> עין כוס ein cos, the FOUNTAIN OF A CUP, <i>let them call</i> עין קוץ ein kuts, the FOUNTAIN OF TOIL (or of <i>flails</i>.) <i>That which they</i> <i>call</i> גדיה gediyah, FORTUNE, <i>let them call</i> גלייא geliya, a STINK, c. <i>That town which sometimes was called</i> Bethel, <i>was</i> <i>afterwards</i> called Bethaven. See also the tract <i>Schabbath</i>.</p>
<p>"II. Among the ignominious names bestowed upon idols, the general and common one was זבול <i>Zebul</i>, DUNG, or a DUNGHILL. '<i>Even</i> <i>to them that have stretched out their hands</i> בזבול bezebul in a dunghill, (that is, in an <i>idol temple</i>, or in idolatry,) <i>there is</i> <i>hope. Thou canst not bring them</i> (into the Church) <i>because they</i> <i>have stretched forth their hands</i> bezebul, <i>in a dunghill. But yet</i> <i>you cannot reject them, because they have repented</i>.' And a little after, <i>He that sees them dunging</i>, בזבלין (that is, sacrificing,) <i>to an idol, let him say, Cursed be he that sacrifices to a strange</i> <i>god</i>. Let them, therefore, who dare, form this word in <i>Matthew</i> into <i>Beelzebub</i>. I am so far from doubting that the <i>Pharisees</i> pronounced the word BEELZEBUL, and that <i>Matthew</i> so wrote it, that I doubt not but the sense fails if it be writ otherwise.</p>
<p>"III. Very many names of evil spirits, or devils, occur in the <i>Talmud</i>, which it is needless here to mention. Among all the devils, they esteemed that devil the worst, the foulest, as it were, the prince of the rest, who ruled over the idols, and by whom oracles and miracles were given forth among the <i>Heathens</i> and <i>idolaters</i>. And they were of this opinion for this reason, because they held idolatry, above all other things, chiefly wicked and abominable, and to be the prince and head of evil. This demon they called בעל זבול <i>Baal-zebul</i>, not so much by a proper name, as by one more general and common as much as to say, the <i>lord of</i> <i>idolatry</i>: the worst devil, and the worst thing: and they called him the <i>prince of devils</i>, because idolatry is the prince (or <i>chief</i>) of wickedness."</p>
