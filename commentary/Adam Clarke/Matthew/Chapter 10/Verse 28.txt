<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:28">Matthew 10:28</span>. <i><b>Fear not them which kill the body</b></i> — των αποκτεινοντων. Those who slay with acts of cruelty, alluding probably to the cruelties which persecutors should exercise on his followers in their martyrdom. <i>But are not able to kill the soul</i>. Hence we find that the body and the soul are distinct principles, for the <i>body</i> may be slain and the <i>soul</i> escape; and, secondly, that the soul is immaterial, for the murderers of the body are not able, μη δυναμενων, have it not in their power, to injure it.</p>
<p><i><b>Fear him</b></i> — It is, not <i>hell-fire</i> we are to fear, but it is <i>God</i>; without the stroke of whose justice <i>hell</i> itself would be no <i>punishment</i>, and whose <i>frown</i> would render heaven itself <i>insupportable</i>. What strange blindness is it to expose our souls to endless ruin, which should enjoy God eternally; and to save and pamper the body, by which we enjoy nothing but the creatures, and them only for a moment!</p>
