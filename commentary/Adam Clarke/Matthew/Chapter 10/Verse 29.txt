<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?</b></i> — ασσαριου. A Roman AS was one-tenth of a DENARIUS, which was about <i>sevenpence-halfpenny</i>, and one-tenth of sevenpence-halfpenny makes just three <i>farthings</i>.</p>
<p>The word ασσαριον, which we translate <i>farthing</i>, is found among the rabbins in the word עיסר <i>aisar</i>, which, according to <i>Maimonides</i>, is equal to four grains of silver, but is used among them to express a thing of the <i>lowest</i>, or almost <i>no value</i>. Our Lord seems to have borrowed the expression, One of them shall not fall on the ground, c., from his own countrymen. In <i>Bereshith</i> <i>Rabba</i>, sec. 79, fol. 77, it is said: In the time in which the Jews were compelled to apostatize, Rab. Simeon, Ben. Jochai, and Eliezer his son hid themselves in a cave, and lived upon dry husks. After thirteen years they came out and, sitting at the mouth of the cave, they observed a fowler stretching his nets to catch birds; and as often as the Bath Kol said דימוס <i>dimos</i>, escape! the bird escaped; but when it said ספקולא <i>spicula</i>, a dart, the bird was taken. Then the rabbin said, <i>Even a bird is not</i> <i>taken without Heaven</i>, i.e. without the will of God, <i>how much less</i> <i>the life of man</i>! The doctrine intended to be inculcated is this: The providence of God extends to the minutest things; every thing is continually under the government and care of God, and nothing occurs without his will or permission; if then he regards <i>sparrows</i>, how much more man, and how much more still the soul that trusts in him!</p>
<p><i><b>Fall on the ground</b></i> — Instead of επι την γην, <i>Origen, Clement,</i> <i>Chrysostom, Juvencus</i>, and six MSS. of <i>Mathai</i>, read εις την παγιδα <i>into a snare</i>. <i>Bengel</i> conjectures that it might have been written at first, επι την παγην; that the first syllable πα being lost out of the word, γην, <i>the earth</i>, instead of παγην, <i>snare</i>, became the common reading.</p>
<p><i><b>Without your</b></i><b> Father.</b>] Without the will of your Father: της βουλης, the <i>will</i> or <i>counsel</i>, is added here by <i>Origen, Coptic</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, latter <i>Persic, Gothic</i>, all the <i>Itala</i> except two; <i>Tert., Iren., Cypr., Novatian</i>, and other <i>Latin</i> fathers. If the evidence be considered as insufficient to entitle it to admission into the text, let it stand there as a supplementary <i>italic</i> word, necessary to make the meaning of the place evident.</p>
<p>All things are ordered by the <i>counsel</i> of God. This is a great consolation to those who are tried and afflicted. The belief of an <i>all-wise, all-directing</i> Providence, is a powerful support under the most grievous accidents of life. Nothing escapes his merciful regards, not even the smallest things of which he may be said to be only the creator and preserver; how much less those of whom he is the Father, Saviour, and endless felicity! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:7">Luke 12:7</span>.</p>
