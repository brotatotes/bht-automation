<p>Verse 30. <i><b>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</b></i> â€” Nothing is more astonishing than the care and concern of God for his followers. The least circumstances of their life are regulated, not merely by that <i>general</i> providence which extends to all things, but by a <i>particular</i> providence, which fits and directs all things to the design of their salvation, causing them all to co-operate for their present and eternal good. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1-5">Romans 5:1-5</span>.</p>
