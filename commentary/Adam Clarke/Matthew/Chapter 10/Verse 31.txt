<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Fear ye not - ye are of more value</b></i> â€” None can estimate the value of a soul, for which Christ has given his <i>blood</i> and <i>life</i>! Have confidence in his goodness; for he who so dearly purchased thee will miraculously preserve and save thee. Did the poet intend to contradict Christ when he said: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "He sees with <i>equal</i> eye, as God of all,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> A HERO perish, or a SPARROW <i>fall</i>?" </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>How cold and meagre is this shallow deistical saying! But could the poet mean, that a <i>sparrow</i> is of as much worth in the sight of God, who regards (if we may believe him) things only in <i>general</i>, as an <i>immortal soul</i>, purchased by the sacrifice of Christ?</p>
