<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men</b></i> â€” That is, whosoever shall acknowledge me to be the Messiah, and have his heart and <i>life</i> regulated by my spirit and doctrine. It is not merely sufficient to have the <i>heart</i> right before God; there must be a firm, manly, and public profession of Christ before men. "I am no hypocrite," says one; neither should you be. "I will keep my religion to myself" i.e. you will not confess Christ before men; then he will <i>renounce</i> you before God.</p>
<p>We <i>confess</i> or <i>own</i> Christ when we own his doctrine, his ministers, his servants, and when no fear hinders us from supporting and assisting them in times of necessity.</p>
