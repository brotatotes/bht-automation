<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Think not that I am come to send peace</b></i>, c.] The meaning of this difficult passage will be plain, when we consider the import of the word <i>peace</i>, and the <i>expectation</i> of the Jews. I have already had occasion to remark, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:12">Matthew 10:12</span>,) that the word שלום <i>shalom</i>, rendered by the Greeks ειρηνη, was used among the Hebrews to express all possible blessings, temporal and spiritual but especially the <i>former</i>. The <i>expectation</i> of the Jews was, that, when the <i>Messiah</i> should come, all temporal <i>prosperity</i> should be accumulated on the land of Judea; therefore την γην, in this verse, should not be translated <i>the earth</i>, but <i>this land</i>. The import of our Lord's teaching here is this, Do not imagine, as the Jews in general vainly do, that I am come to <i>send forth</i>, (βαλλειν,) by <i>forcing</i> out the Roman power, that <i>temporal</i> <i>prosperity</i> which they long for; I am not come for this purpose, but to send forth (βαλλειν) the Roman <i>sword</i>, to cut off a disobedient and rebellious nation, the cup of whose iniquity is already full, and whose crimes cry aloud for speedy vengeance. <i>See also Clarke on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:49">Luke 12:49</span><i>"</i>. From the time they rejected the Messiah, they were a prey to the most cruel and destructive factions; they employed their time in butchering one another, till the Roman sword was unsheathed against them, and desolated the land.</p>
