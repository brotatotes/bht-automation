<p>Verse 35. <i><b>I am come to set a man at variance</b></i> â€” The spirit of Christ can have no union with the spirit of the world. Even a father, while unconverted, will oppose a godly child. Thus the spirit that is in those who sin against God is opposed to that spirit which is in the followers of the Most High. It is the <i>spirits</i> then that are in opposition, and not the <i>persons</i>.</p>
