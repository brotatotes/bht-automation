<p>Verse 37. <i><b>He that loveth father or mother more than me</b></i> â€” He whom we love the most is he whom we study most to please, and whose will and interests we prefer in all cases. If, in order to please a father or mother who are opposed to vital godliness, we abandon God's ordinances and followers, we are unworthy of any thing but hell.</p>
