<p>Verse 39. <i><b>He that findeth his life</b></i>, c.] i.e. He who, for the sake of his <i>temporal interest</i>, abandons his <i>spiritual concerns</i>, shall lose his soul and he who, in order to avoid <i>martyrdom</i>, abjures the pure religion of Christ, shall lose his <i>soul</i>, and perhaps his <i>life</i> too. <i>He that findeth his life shall lose it</i>, was literally fulfilled in Archbishop <i>Cranmer</i>. He confessed Christ against the devil, and his eldest son, the pope. He was ordered to be burnt; to <i>save his life</i> he recanted, and was, notwithstanding, <i>burnt</i>. Whatever a man sacrifices to God is never <i>lost</i>, for he finds it again in God.</p>
<p>There is a fine piece on this subject in <i>Juvenal</i>, Sat. viii. l. 80, which deserves to be recorded here. </p>
