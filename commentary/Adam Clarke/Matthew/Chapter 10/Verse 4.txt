<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:4">Matthew 10:4</span>. <i><b>Simon</b></i> — He was third son of <i>Alpheus</i>, and brother of <i>James</i> and <i>Jude</i>, or <i>Judas</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Canaanite</b></i> — This word is not put here to signify a particular <i>people</i>, as it is elsewhere used in the Sacred Writings; but it is formed from the Hebrew קנא <i>kana</i>, which signifies <i>zealous</i>, literally translated by Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:15">Luke 6:15</span>, ζηλωτης, <i>zelotes</i>, or the <i>zealous</i>, probably from his great <i>fervency</i> in preaching the Gospel of his Master. But <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:15">Luke 6:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Judas Iscariot</b></i> — Probably from the Hebrew איש קריות <i>ish kerioth,</i> a <i>man of Kerioth</i>, which was a city in the tribe of Judah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:25">Joshua 15:25</span>, where it is likely this man was born.</p>
<p>As אסכרא <i>iscara</i>, signifies the <i>quinsy</i>, or <i>strangulation</i>, and Judas <i>hanged</i> himself after he had betrayed our Lord, Dr. Lightfoot seems inclined to believe that he had his name from this circumstance, and that it was not given him till after his death.</p>
<p><i><b>Who also betrayed him</b></i> — Rather, <i>even he who betrayed him</i>, or <i>delivered him up</i>; for so, I think, ο και παραδους αυτον should be translated. The common translation, <i>who</i> ALSO <i>betrayed him</i>, is very exceptionable, as it seems to imply, he was betrayed by <i>some</i> <i>others</i>, as well as by Judas.</p>
