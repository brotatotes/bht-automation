<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41">Matthew 10:41</span>. <i><b>He that receiveth a prophet</b></i> — προφητην, a <i>teacher</i>, not a <i>foreteller of future events</i>, for this is not always the meaning of the word; but one commissioned by God to <i>teach the</i> <i>doctrines</i> of eternal life. It is no small honour to receive into one's house a minister of Jesus Christ. Every person is not admitted to exercise the sacred ministry; but none are excluded from partaking of its grace, its spirit, and its reward. If the teacher should be weak, or even if he should be found afterwards to have been worthless, yet the person who has <i>received</i> him <i>in the</i> <i>name</i>, under the sacred character, of an evangelist, shall not lose his reward; because what he did he did for the sake of Christ, and through love for his Church. Many sayings of this kind are found among the rabbins, and this one is common: "He who receives a learned man, or an elder, into his house, is the same as if he had received the <i>Shekinah</i>." And again: "He who speaks against a faithful pastor, it is the same as if he had spoken against God himself." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
