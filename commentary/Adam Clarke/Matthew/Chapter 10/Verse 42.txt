<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:42">Matthew 10:42</span>. <i><b>A cup of cold water</b></i> — υδατος, of <i>water</i>, is not in the common text, but it is found in the <i>Codex Bezae, Coptic,</i> <i>Armenian, Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, Slavonic</i>, all copies of the <i>Itala</i>, <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Origen</i>. It is necessarily understood; the ellipsis of the same <i>substantive</i> is frequent, both in the Greek and Latin writers. See <i>Wakefield</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Little ones</b></i> — My apparently mean and generally despised disciples.</p>
<p>But a cup of water in the eastern countries was not a matter of small worth. In India, the Hindoos go sometimes a great way to fetch it, and then boil it that it may do the less hurt to travellers when they are hot; and, after that, they stand from morning to night in some great road, where there is neither pit nor rivulet, and offer it, in honour of their god, to be drunk by all passengers. This necessary work of charity, in these hot countries, seems to have been practised by the more pious and humane Jews; and our Lord assures them that, if they do this in <i>his name</i>, they shall not lose their reward. See the Asiatic Miscellany, vol. ii. p. 142.</p>
<p><i><b>Verily - he shall in no wise lose his reward.</b></i> — The rabbins have a similar saying: "He that gives food to one that studies in the law, God will bless him in this world, and give him a lot in the world to come." <i>Syn. Sohar</i>.</p>
<p>Love heightens the smallest actions, and gives a worth to them which they cannot possess without it. Under a <i>just</i> and <i>merciful</i> God every sin is either punished or pardoned, and every good action rewarded. The most indigent may exercise the works of mercy and charity; seeing even a <i>cup of cold water</i>, given in the name of Jesus, shall not lose <i>its</i> reward. How astonishing is God's kindness! It is not the <i>rich</i> merely whom he calls on to be charitable; but even the poor, and the most <i>impoverished of the</i> <i>poor</i>! God gives the power and inclination to be charitable, and then rewards the work which, it may be truly said, <i>God himself</i> <i>hath wrought</i>.</p>
<p>It is the name of <i>Jesus</i> that sanctifies every thing, and renders services, in themselves comparatively contemptible, of high worth in the sight of God. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
