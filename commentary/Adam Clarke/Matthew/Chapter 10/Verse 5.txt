<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span>. <i><b>These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded</b></i> — To be properly qualified for a minister of Christ, a man must be,</p>
<p>1. filled with the spirit of holiness;</p>
<p>2. called to this particular work;</p>
<p>3. instructed in its nature, c. and,</p>
<p>4. commissioned to <i>go</i> <i>forth</i>, and testify the Gospel of the grace of God.</p>
<p>These are four different gifts which a man must receive from God by Christ Jesus. To these let him add all the human qualifications he can possibly attain; as in his arduous work he will require every gift and every grace.</p>
<p><i><b>Go not into the way of the Gentiles</b></i> — Our Lord only intended that the <i>first</i> offers of salvation should be made to the Jewish people; and that the heathen should not be noticed in this first mission, that no stumbling-block might be cast in the way of the Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>Into</b></i><b> any </b><i><b>city of the Samaritans enter ye not</b></i> — The Samaritans had afterwards the Gospel preached to them by Christ himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:4">John 4:4</span>, c., for the reason assigned above. Such as God seems at first to pass by are often those for whom he has designed his greatest benefits, (witness the Samaritans, and the Gentiles in general,) but he has his own proper time to discover and reveal them.</p>
<p>The history of the <i>Samaritans</i> is sufficiently known from the Old Testament. Properly speaking, the inhabitants of the city of Samaria should be termed Samaritans but this epithet belongs chiefly to the people sent into that part of the promised land by Salmanezer, king of Assyria, in the year of the world 3283, when he carried the Israelites that dwelt there captives beyond the Euphrates, and sent a mixed people, principally Cuthites, to dwell in their place. These were altogether heathens at first; but they afterwards incorporated the worship of the true God with that of their idols. See the whole account, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:5">2 Kings 17:5</span>, c. From this time they feared Jehovah, and served other gods till after the Babylonish captivity. From Alexander the Great, Sanballat, their governor, obtained permission to build a temple upon Mount Gerizim, which the Jews conceiving to be in opposition to their temple at Jerusalem, hated them with a perfect hatred, and would have no fellowship with them. The Samaritans acknowledge the Divine authority of the law of Moses, and carefully preserve it in their own characters, which are probably the genuine ancient Hebrew the character which is now called <i>Hebrew</i> being that of the Chaldeans. The Samaritan Pentateuch is printed in the London Polyglott, and is an undeniable record. A poor remnant of this people is found still at <i>Naplouse</i>, the ancient <i>Shechem</i>; but they exist in a state of very great poverty and distress, and probably will soon become extinct.</p>
