<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:7">Matthew 10:7</span>. <i><b>And as ye go, preach</b></i> — πορευομενοι δε κηρυσσετε, and as <i>you proceed, proclaim like heralds </i>- make this proclamation wherever ye go, and while ye are journeying. Preach and travel; and, as ye travel, preach-proclaim salvation to all you meet. Wherever the ministers of Christ go, they find lost, ruined souls; and, <i>wherever</i> they find them, they should proclaim <i>Jesus</i>, and his power to save. For an explanation of the word <i>proclaim</i> or <i>preach</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>.</p>
<p>From this commission we learn what the grand subject of apostolic preaching was - THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND! This was the great message. "They <i>preached</i>," says <i>Quesnel</i>, "to establish the faith; <i>the kingdom</i>, to animate the hope; <i>of heaven</i>, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which <i>is at hand</i>, that men may prepare for it without <i>delay</i>."</p>
