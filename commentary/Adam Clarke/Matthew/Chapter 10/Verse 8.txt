<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:8">Matthew 10:8</span>. <i><b>Raise the dead</b></i> — This is wanting in the MSS. marked EKLMS of <i>Griesbach</i>, and in those marked BHV of <i>Mathai</i>, and in upwards of <i>one hundred</i> others. It is also wanting in the <i>Syriac</i>, (Vienna edition,) latter <i>Persic, Sahidic, Armenian, Sclavonic</i>, and in one copy of the <i>Itala</i>; also in <i>Athanasius, Basil</i>, and <i>Chrysostom</i>. There is no evidence that the disciples raised any dead person previously to the resurrection of Christ. The words should certainly be omitted, unless we could suppose that the authority now given respected not only their present mission, but comprehended also their future conduct. But that our blessed Lord did not give this power to his disciples <i>at this time</i>, is, I think, pretty evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:1">Matthew 10:1</span>, and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:6">Luke 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:19-20">Luke 10:19-20</span>, where, if any such power had been <i>given</i>, or <i>exercised</i>, it would doubtless have been mentioned. <i>Wetstein</i> has rejected it, and so did <i>Griesbach</i> in his first edition; but in the second (1796) he has left it in the text, with a note of doubtfulness.</p>
<p><i><b>Freely ye have received, freely give.</b></i> — A rule very necessary, and of great extent. A minister or <i>labourer</i> in the Gospel vineyard, though worthy of his comfortable support while in the work, should never preach for hire, or make a secular traffic of a spiritual work. What a scandal is it for a man to traffic with gifts which he pretends, at least, to have received from the Holy Ghost, of which he is not the master, but the dispenser. He who preaches to get a <i>living</i>, or to make a <i>fortune</i>, is guilty of the most infamous <i>sacrilege</i>.</p>
