<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:9">Matthew 10:9</span>. <i><b>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass, in your</b></i><b> </b><i><b>purses</b></i> — εις τας ξωνας υμων, <i>in your</i> GIRDLES. It is supposed that the people of the east carry their money in a fold of their girdles. This is scarcely correct: they carry it in a purse <i>in</i> <i>their bosom, under their girdles</i>. This I have often observed.</p>
<p>In a thousand instances an apostolic preacher, who goes to the wilderness to seek the lost sheep, will be exposed to hunger and cold, and other inconveniences; he must therefore resign himself to God, depending on his providence for the necessaries of life. If God have sent him, he is bound to support him, and <i>will</i> do it: anxiety therefore, in him, is a double crime, as it insinuates a bad opinion of the Master who has employed him. Every <i>missionary</i> should make himself master of this subject.</p>
<p><i>Have no money in your purse</i>, is a command, obedience to which was secured by the narrow circumstances of most of the <i>primitive</i> genuine preachers of the Gospel. Whole herds of friars mendicants have professed the same principle, and abandoned themselves to voluntary poverty; but if the money be in the <i>heart</i> it is a worse evil. In the former case, it <i>may</i> be a temptation to sin; in the latter, it <i>must</i> be <i>ruinous</i>.</p>
