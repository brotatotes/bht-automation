<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span>. This verse properly belongs to the preceding chapter, from which it should on no account be separated; as with <i>that</i> it has the strictest connection, but with <i>this</i> it has none.</p>
<p><i><b>To teach and to preach</b></i> — <i>To teach</i>, to give <i>private</i> instructions to as many as came unto him; and <i>to preach</i>, to proclaim <i>publicly</i>, that the kingdom of God is at hand; two grand parts of the duty of a Gospel minister.</p>
<p><i><b>Their cities</b></i> — The cities of the Jews.</p>
