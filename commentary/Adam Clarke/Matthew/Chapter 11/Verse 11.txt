<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:11">Matthew 11:11</span>. <i><b>A greater than John the Baptist</b></i> — A <i>sixth excellency</i> of the Baptist-he was greater than any prophet from the beginning of the world till that time: -</p>
<p>lst. Because he was prophesied of by them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:3">Isaiah 40:3</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span>, where Jesus Christ himself seems to be the speaker.</p>
<p>2ndly. Because he had the privilege of showing the fulfilment of their predictions, by pointing out that Christ has <i>now come</i>, which they foretold <i>should come</i>. And</p>
<p>3dly. Because he saw and enjoyed that salvation which they could only <i>foretell</i>. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven</b></i> — By the kingdom of heaven in this verse is meant, the <i>fulness of the</i> <i>blessings of the Gospel of peace</i>; which fulness was not known till after Christ had been crucified, and had risen from the dead. Now the least in this kingdom, the meanest preacher of a <i>crucified,</i> <i>risen</i>, and <i>glorified</i> Saviour, was <i>greater</i> than John, who was not permitted to live to see the <i>plenitude</i> of Gospel grace, in the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. Let the reader observe,</p>
<p>1st. That the kingdom of heaven here does not mean the state of future glory. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>.</p>
<p>2dly. That it is not in holiness or devotedness to God that the <i>least in this kingdom is greater than</i> <i>John</i>; but</p>
<p>3dly. That it is merely in the <i>difference</i> of the <i>ministry</i>.</p>
<p>The prophets pointed out a Christ that was <i>coming</i>; John showed that <i>that</i> Christ was <i>then among them</i>; and the preachers of the Gospel prove that this Christ <i>has suffered</i>, and <i>entered into</i> <i>his glory</i>, and that <i>repentance</i> and <i>remission</i> of sins are <i>proclaimed through his blood</i>. There is a saying similar to this among the Jews: "Even the servant maid that passed through the Red Sea, saw what neither Ezekiel, nor any other of the prophets had seen."</p>
