<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:12">Matthew 11:12</span>. <i><b>The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence</b></i> â€” The tax-gatherers and heathens, whom the scribes and Pharisees think have no right to the kingdom of the Messiah, filled with holy zeal and earnestness, seize at once on the proffered mercy of the Gospel, and so take the kingdom as by force from those learned doctors who claimed for themselves the chiefest places in that kingdom. Christ himself said, <i>The tax-gatherers and harlots go</i> <i>before you into the kingdom of God</i>. See the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:28-30">Luke 7:28-30</span>. He that will <i>take</i>, get possession of the kingdom of righteousness, peace, and spiritual joy, must be in earnest: all hell will oppose him in every step he takes; and if a man be not absolutely determined to give up his sins and evil companions, and have his soul saved at all hazards, and at every expense, he will surely perish everlastingly. This requires a <i>violent</i> earnestness.</p>
