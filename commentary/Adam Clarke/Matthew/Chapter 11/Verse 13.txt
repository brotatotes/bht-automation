They were the instructers concerning the Christ who was to come, till John came and showed that all the <i>predictions</i> of the <i>one</i>, and the <i>types</i> and <i>ceremonies</i> of the <i>other</i> were <i>now</i> about to be fully and finally accomplished; for Christ was <i>now</i> revealed. The word is taken in this sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22">Matthew 7:22</span>.</p>
