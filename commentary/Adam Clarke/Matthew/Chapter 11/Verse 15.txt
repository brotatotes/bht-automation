<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:15">Matthew 11:15</span>. <i><b>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</b></i> â€” As if our Lord had said, These things are so clear and manifest that a man has only to hear them to be convinced and fully satisfied of their truth. But neither the Jews of that time nor of the succeeding times to the present day, have heard or considered, these things. When spoken to on these subjects, their common custom is to stop their ears, spit out, and blaspheme; this shows not only a <i>bad</i>, but a <i>ruined</i> cause. They are deeply and wilfully blind. They will not come unto the light, lest their deeds should become manifest, that they are not wrought in God. They have ears but they will not hear.</p>
