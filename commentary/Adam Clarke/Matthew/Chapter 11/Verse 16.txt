<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:16">Matthew 11:16</span>. <i><b>But whereunto shall I liken this generation?</b></i> — That is, the Jewish people - την γενεαν ταυτην, <i>this race</i>: and so the word γενεα is often to be understood in the evangelists.</p>
<p><i><b>In the markets</b></i> — Or, <i>places of concourse</i>, αγοραις, from αγειρω, <i>I gather together</i>; not a <i>market-place</i> only, but any place of public resort: probably meaning here, places of public amusement.</p>
<p><i><b>Calling unto their fellows</b></i> — Or, <i>companions</i>. Instead of εταιροις, <i>companions</i>, many of the best MSS. have ετεροις, <i>others</i>. The great similarity of the words might have easily produced this difference.</p>
<p>There are some to whom every thing is useful in leading them to God; others, to whom nothing is sufficient. Every thing is good to an upright mind, every thing bad to a vicious heart.</p>
