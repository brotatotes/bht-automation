<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:18">Matthew 11:18</span>. <i><b>For John came neither eating nor drinking</b></i> — Leading a very austere and mortified life: and yet, he did not receive him. A sinner will not be persuaded that what he has no mind to imitate can come from God. There are some who will rather blame holiness itself, than esteem it in those whom they do not like.</p>
<p><i><b>He hath a devil.</b></i> — He is a vile hypocrite, influenced by a <i>demon</i> to deceive and destroy the simple.</p>
