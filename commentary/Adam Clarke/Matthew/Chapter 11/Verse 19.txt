<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>. <i><b>The Son of man came eating and drinking</b></i> — That is, went wheresoever he was invited to eat a morsel of bread, and observed no rigid fasts: how could he, who had no corrupt appetites to mortify or subdue?</p>
<p><i><b>They say, Behold a man gluttonous,</b></i> c.] Whatever measures the followers of God may take, they will not escape the censure of the world: the best way is not to be concerned at them. Iniquity, being always ready to oppose and contradict the Divine conduct, often contradicts and exposes itself.</p>
<p><i><b>But wisdom is justified of her children.</b></i> — Those who follow the dictates of true wisdom ever justify, point out as excellent, the holy maxims by which they are guided, for they find the <i>way</i> <i>pleasantness</i>, and the <i>path, peace</i>. Of, here, and in many places of our translation, ought to be written <i>by</i> in modern English.</p>
<p>Some suppose that our blessed Lord applies the epithet of η σοφια, <i>that Wisdom</i> to himself as he does that of <i>Son of man</i>, in the first clause of the verse: and that this refers to the sublime description given of wisdom in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:0">Proverbs 8:0</span>. Others have supposed that by the <i>children</i> or <i>sons</i> (τεκνων) <i>of wisdom</i> our Lord means <i>John Baptist</i> and <i>himself</i>, who came to preach the doctrines of true wisdom to the people, and who were known to be teachers come from God by all those who seriously attended to their ministry: they recommending themselves, by the purity of their doctrines, and the holiness of their lives, to every man's conscience in the sight of God. It is likely, however, that by <i>children</i> our Lord simply means the <i>fruits</i> or <i>effects</i> of wisdom, according to the Hebrew idiom, which denominates the fruits or effects of a thing, its <i>children</i>. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+5:7">Job 5:7</span>, <i>sparks</i> emitted by coals are termed בני רשף <i>beney resheph</i>, the <i>children of the coal</i>. It was probably this well known meaning of the word, which led the <i>Codex Vaticanus</i>, one of the most ancient MSS. in the world, together with the <i>Syriac, Persic, Coptic</i>, and <i>Ethiopic</i>, to read εργων, <i>works</i>, instead of τεκνων, <i>sons</i> or <i>children</i>. Wisdom is vindicated by her works, i.e. the good effects prove that the cause is excellent.</p>
<p>The children of true wisdom can justify all God's ways in their salvation; as they know that all the dispensations of Providence work together for the good of those who love and fear God. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:35">Luke 7:35</span>.</p>
