<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:20">Matthew 11:20</span>. <i><b>Then began he to upbraid the cities</b></i> â€” The more God has done to draw men unto himself, the less excusable are they if they continue in iniquity. If our blessed Lord had not done every thing that was necessary for the salvation of these people, he could not have reproached them for their impenitence.</p>
