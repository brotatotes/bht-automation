<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span>. <i><b>Wo unto thee, Chorazin - Bethsaida!</b></i> — It would be better to translate the word ουαι σοι, <i>alas for thee</i>, than <i>wo to</i> <i>thee</i>. The former is an exclamation of pity; the latter a denunciation of wrath. It is evident that our Lord used it in the former sense. It is not known precisely where <i>Chorazin</i> was situated; but as Christ joins it in the same censure with <i>Bethsaida</i>, which was in Upper Galilee, beyond the sea, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>, it is likely that Chorazin was in the same quarter. Though the people in these cities were (generally) impenitent, yet there is little doubt that several received the word of life. Indeed, Bethsaida itself furnished not less than <i>three</i> of the <i>twelve</i> apostles, <i>Philip, Andrew</i>, and <i>Peter</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Tyre and Sidon</b></i> — Were two heathen cities, situated on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, into which it does not appear that Christ ever went, though he was often very nigh to them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:21">Matthew 15:21</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>They would have repented long ago</b></i> — παλαι, <i>formerly</i>, seems here to refer to the time of Ezekiel, who denounced destruction against <i>Tyre</i> and <i>Sidon</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+26:0">Ezekiel 26:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+27:0">Ezekiel 27:0</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+28:0">Ezekiel 28:0</span>. Our Lord, then, intimates that, if Ezekiel had done as many miracles in those cities as himself had in Chorazin and Bethsaida, the inhabitants would have repented in sackcloth and ashes, with the deepest and most genuine sorrow.</p>
<p>A <i>Hindoo</i> who renounces the secular life, and becomes a religious mendicant, often covers himself with a <i>coarse cloth</i> sprinkled over with <i>ashes</i>. This is the <i>sackcloth</i> and <i>ashes</i> which our Lord refers to; and this covering was the outward sign of deep repentance, and forsaking of sin.</p>
