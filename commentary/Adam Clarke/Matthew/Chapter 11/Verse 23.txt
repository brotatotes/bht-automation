<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span>. <i><b>Thou, Capernaum - exalted unto heaven</b></i> — A Hebrew metaphor, expressive of the utmost prosperity, and the enjoyment of the greatest privileges. This was properly spoken of this city, because that in it our Lord dwelt, and wrought many of his miraculous works.</p>
<p><i><b>Shalt be brought down to hell</b></i> — Perhaps not meaning, here, the place of torment, but rather a state of <i>desolation</i>. The original word is <i>Hades</i>, αδης, from α, <i>not</i>, and ιδειν, <i>to see</i>; the <i>invisible</i> receptacle or mansion of the dead, answering to שאול <i>sheol</i>, in Hebrew; and implying often, 1st. the <i>grave</i>; 2dly. the state of <i>separate souls</i>, or <i>unseen</i> world of spirits, whether of <i>torment</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:23">Luke 16:23</span>, or, in <i>general</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13-14">Revelation 20:13-14</span>. The word <i>hell</i>, used in the common translation, conveys <i>now</i> an improper meaning of the original word; because <i>hell</i> is only used to signify the place of the damned. But, as the word <i>hell</i> comes from the Anglo-Saxon, <i>helan, to cover</i>, or <i>hide</i>, hence the <i>tiling</i> or <i>slating</i> of a house is called, in some parts of England (particularly Cornwall) <i>heling</i>, to this day; and the <i>covers</i> of books (in Lancashire) by the same name: so the literal import of the original word αδης was formerly well expressed by it. Here it means a state of the utmost wo, and ruin, and desolation, to which these impenitent cities should be reduced. This prediction of our Lord was literally fulfilled; for, in the wars between the Romans and the Jews, these cities were totally destroyed, so that no traces are now found of <i>Bethsaida, Chorazin</i>, or <i>Capernaum</i>.
