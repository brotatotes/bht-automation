<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:24">Matthew 11:24</span>. <i><b>But - it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom</b></i> — γη σοδομων, <i>the land of the Sodomites</i>; i.e. the ancient inhabitants of that city and its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In Jude, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:7">Jude 1:7</span>, we are told that these persons are <i>suffering the vengeance of</i> <i>eternal fire</i>. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah happened A. M. 2107, which was 1897 years before the incarnation. What a terrible thought is this! It will be more tolerable for certain sinners, who have already been damned nearly four thousand years, than for those who, live and die infidels under the Gospel! There are various degrees of punishments in hell, answerable to various degrees of guilt, and the contempt manifested to, and the abuse made of; the preaching of the Gospel, will rank semi-infidel Christians in the <i>highest</i> list of transgressors, and purchase them the <i>hottest</i> place in hell! Great God! save the reader from this destruction!</p>
<p><i><b>Day of judgment</b></i> — May either refer to that <i>particular</i> time in which God visits for iniquity, or to that great day in which he will judge the world by the Lord Jesus Christ. The day of Sodom's judgment was that in which it was destroyed by fire and brimstone from heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:24">Genesis 19:24</span>; and the day of judgment to <i>Chorazin, Bethsaida</i>, and <i>Capernaum</i>, was the time in which they were destroyed by the <i>Romans</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span>. But there is a day of final judgment, when Hades itself, (sinners in a state of partial punishment in the invisible world) shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, which is the second death. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>.</p>
