Verse Matthew 11:25. I thank thee — εξομολογουμαι σοι, I fully agree with thee-I am perfectly of the same mind. Thou hast acted in all things according to the strictest holiness, justice, mercy, and truth.Wise and prudent — The scribes and Pharisees, vainly puffed up by their fleshly minds, and having their foolish hearts darkened, refusing to submit to the righteousness of God (God's method of saving man by Christ) and going about to establish their own righteousness, (their own method of saving themselves,) they rejected God's counsel, and God sent the peace and salvation of the Gospel to others, called here babes, (his disciples,) simple-hearted persons, who submitted to be instructed and saved in God's own way. Let it be observed, that our Lord does not thank the Father that he had hidden these things from the wise and prudent, but that, seeing they were hidden from them, he had revealed them to the others.There is a remarkable saying in the Talmudists, which casts light upon this: "Rab. Jochanan said: 'From the time in which the temple was destroyed, wisdom was taken away from the prophets, and give a to fools and children.' Bava Bathra, fol. 12. Again: 'In the days of the Messiah, every species of wisdom, even the most profound, shall, be revealed; and this even to children.'" Synop. Sohar. fol. 10.
