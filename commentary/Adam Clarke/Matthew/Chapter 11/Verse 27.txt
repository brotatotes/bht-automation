<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>. <i><b>All things are delivered unto me of my Father</b></i> â€” This is a great truth, and the key of the science of salvation. The man Christ Jesus <i>receives</i> from the Father, and in consequence of his union with the eternal Godhead becomes the Lord and sovereign Dispenser of all things. All the springs of the Divine favour are in the hands of Christ, as Priest of God, and atoning Sacrifice for men: all good proceeds from him, as Saviour, Mediator, Head, Pattern, Pastor, and sovereign Judge of the whole world.</p>
<p><i><b>No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man,</b></i> c.] None can fully comprehend the nature and attributes of God, but Christ and none can fully comprehend the nature, incarnation, &amp;c., of Christ, but the Father. The <i>full</i> comprehension and acknowledgment of the Godhead, and the mystery of the Trinity, belong to God alone.</p>
