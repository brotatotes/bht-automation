<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28">Matthew 11:28</span>. <i><b>Come unto me</b></i> — This phrase in the new covenant implies simply, <i>believing in Christ</i>, and <i>becoming his disciple</i>, or <i>follower</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>All ye that labour and are heavy laden</b></i> — The metaphor here appears to be taken from a man who has a great load laid upon him, which he must carry to a certain place: every step he takes reduces his strength, and renders his load the more oppressive. However, it must be carried on; and he <i>labours</i>, uses his utmost exertions, to reach the place where it is to be laid down. A kind person passing by, and, seeing his distress, offers to ease him of his load, that he may enjoy rest.</p>
<p>The <i>Jews</i>, heavily laden with the burdensome rites of the Mosaic institution, rendered still more oppressive by the <i>additions</i> made by the scribes and Pharisees, who, our Lord says, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>,) <i>bound on heavy burdens</i>; and labouring, by their observance of the law, to make themselves pleasing to God, are here invited to lay down their load, and receive the salvation procured for them by Christ.</p>
<p><i>Sinners</i>, wearied in the ways of iniquity, are also invited to come to this Christ, and find speedy relief.</p>
<p><i>Penitents</i>, burdened with the guilt of their crimes, may come to this Sacrifice, and find instant pardon.</p>
<p><i>Believers</i>, sorely tempted, and oppressed by the remains of the carnal mind, may come to this blood, that cleanseth from all unrighteousness; and, purified from all sin, and powerfully succoured in every temptation, they shall find uninterrupted <i>rest</i> in this complete Saviour.</p>
<p><i>All</i> are invited to come, and all are promised <i>rest</i>. If <i>few</i> find <i>rest</i> from sin and vile affections, it is because few <i>come to</i> <i>Christ</i> to receive it.</p>
