<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>. <i><b>Take my yoke upon you</b></i> — Strange paradox! that a man already weary and overloaded must take a new <i>weight</i> upon him, in order to be eased and find <i>rest</i>! But this advice is similar to that saying, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:22">Psalms 55:22</span>. <i>Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain thee</i>; i.e. trust thy soul and concerns to him, and he will carry both <i>thyself</i> and <i>thy load</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>I am meek and lowly in heart</b></i> — Wherever <i>pride</i> and <i>anger</i> dwell, there is nothing but <i>mental labour</i> and <i>agony</i>; but, where the <i>meekness</i> and <i>humility</i> of Christ dwell, all is <i>smooth, even,</i> <i>peaceable</i>, and <i>quiet</i>; for the work of righteousness is peace, and the effect of righteousness, <i>quietness</i> and <i>assurance</i> for ever. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+32:17">Isaiah 32:17</span>.</p>
