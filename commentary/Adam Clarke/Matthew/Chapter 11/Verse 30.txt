<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>. <i><b>For my yoke is easy</b></i> — My Gospel imposes nothing that is difficult; on the contrary, it provides for the complete removal of all that which oppresses and renders man miserable, viz. <i>sin</i>. The commandments of Christ are not grievous. Hear the whole: <i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and</i> <i>thy neighbour as thyself</i>. Can any thing be more congenial to the nature of man than <i>love</i>?-such a love as is inspired by God, and in which the soul rests supremely satisfied and infinitely happy? <i>Taste</i>, and know, by experience, how good the Lord is, and how worthy his <i>yoke</i> is to be <i>taken, borne</i>, and <i>loved</i>. This most tender invitation of the compassionate Jesus is sufficient to inspire the most diffident soul with confidence. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34">Mark 8:34</span>.</p>
<p><i>Creeshna</i>, the incarnate God of the Hindoos, is represented in the Geeta addressing one of his beloved disciples thus: "I am the creator of all things, and all things proceed from me. Those who are endued with spiritual wisdom, believe this, and worship me: their very hearts and minds are in me; they rejoice among themselves, and delight in speaking of my name, and teaching one another my doctrine. I gladly inspire those who are constantly employed in my service with that use of reason by which <i>they come</i> <i>unto me</i>; and, in compassion, I stand in my own nature, and dissipate the darkness of their ignorance with the light of the lamp of wisdom." <i>Bhagvat Geeta</i>, p. 84.</p>
<p>The word עול <i>aval</i>, among the Jews, which we properly enough translate <i>yoke</i>, signified not only that sort of <i>neck-harness</i> by which bullocks drew in wagons, carts, or in the plough; but also any kind of <i>bond</i>, or <i>obligation</i>, to do some <i>particular thing</i>, or to do some <i>particular work</i>. By them it is applied to the following things: -</p>
<p>1. The <i>yoke</i> of the KINGDOM <i>of heaven</i>, עול מלכות השמים - obedience to the revealed will of God.</p>
<p>2. The <i>yoke</i> of the LAW, עול הורה - the necessity of obeying all the rites, ceremonies, c., of the Mosaic institution.</p>
<p>3. The <i>yoke</i> of the PRECEPT, עול מצוה - the necessity of performing that particular obligation by which any person had bound himself, such as that of the Nazarite, &amp;c.</p>
<p>4. The <i>yoke</i> of REPENTANCE, עול של השוכה - without which, they knew, they could not enter into the kingdom of heaven. With the Jews, <i>repentance</i> not only implied <i>forsaking sin</i>, but <i>fasting,</i> <i>mortification</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>5. The <i>yoke</i> of FAITH, עול אמונה - the necessity of believing in the promised Messiah.</p>
<p>6. The DIVINE <i>yoke</i>, עול רלעילא - the obligation to live a spiritual life a life of thanksgiving and gratitude unto God.</p>
<p>In <i>Shemoth Rabba</i> it is said: "Because the ten tribes did not <i>take the yoke of the holy and blessed God</i> upon them, therefore Sennacherib led them into captivity."</p>
<p>CHRIST's <i>yoke</i> means, the obligation to receive him as the MESSIAH, to believe his <i>doctrine</i>, and to be in all things conformed to his <i>Word</i> and to his <i>Spirit</i>.</p>
