Verse Matthew 11:4. Go and show John the things - ye do hear and see â€” Christ would have men to judge only of him and of others by their works. This is the only safe way of judging. A man is not to be credited because he professes to know such and such things; but because he demonstrates by his conduct that his pretensions are not vain.
