<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:4">Matthew 11:4</span>. <i><b>Go and show John the things - ye do hear and see</b></i> â€” Christ would have men to judge only of him and of others by their works. This is the only safe way of judging. A man is not to be credited because he professes to know such and such things; but because he demonstrates by his conduct that his pretensions are not vain.</p>
