<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span>. <i><b>The blind receive their sight,</b></i> c.] αναβλεπωσι, <i>look</i> <i>upwards</i>, contemplating the heavens which their Lord hath made.</p>
<p><i><b>The lame walk</b></i> — περιπατωσι, <i>they walk about</i> to give the fullest proof to the multitude that their cure was real. These miracles were not only the most convincing proofs of the supreme power of Christ, but were also emblematic of that work of salvation which he effects in the souls of men.</p>
<p>1. Sinners are <i>blind</i>; their understanding is so darkened by sin that they <i>see not</i> the way of truth and salvation.</p>
<p>2. They are <i>lame </i>- not able to walk in the path of righteousness.</p>
<p>3. They are <i>leprous</i>, their souls are defiled with sin, the most loathsome and inveterate disease; <i>deepening</i> in themselves, and <i>infecting</i> others.</p>
<p>4. They are <i>deaf</i> to the voice of God, his word, and their own conscience.</p>
<p>5. They are <i>dead</i> in trespasses and sins; God, who is the life of the soul, being separated from it by iniquity.</p>
<p>Nothing less than the power of Christ can redeem from all this; and, from <i>all this</i>, that power of Christ actually does redeem every penitent believing soul. Giving sight to the blind, and raising the dead, are allowed by the ancient rabbins to be works which the Messiah should perform, when he should manifest himself in Israel.</p>
<p><i><b>The poor have the Gospel preached to them.</b></i> — And what was this Gospel? Why, the glad tidings that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners: that he <i>opens</i> the <i>eyes of the blind</i>; enables the <i>lame</i> to <i>walk</i> with an even, steady, and constant pace in the way of holiness; <i>cleanses</i> the <i>lepers</i> from all the <i>defilement</i> of their <i>sins; opens</i> the <i>ears</i> of the <i>deaf</i> to hear his <i>pardoning words</i>; and <i>raises</i> those who were <i>dead</i> in trespasses and sins to <i>live</i> in <i>union</i> with himself to all eternity.</p>
