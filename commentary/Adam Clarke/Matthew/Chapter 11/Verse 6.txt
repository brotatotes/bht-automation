<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:6">Matthew 11:6</span>. <i><b>Blessed is</b></i><b> he </b><i><b>whosoever shall not be offended in me.</b></i> — Or, <i>Happy is he who will not be stumbled at me</i>; for the word σκανδαλιζεσθαι, in its root, signifies to <i>hit against</i> or <i>stumble</i> <i>over</i> a thing, which one may meet with in the way. The Jews, as was before remarked, expected a <i>temporal deliverer</i>. Many might he tempted to reject Christ, because of his mean appearance, c., and so lose the benefit of salvation through him. To <i>instruct</i> and <i>caution</i> such, our blessed Lord spoke these words. By his <i>poverty</i> and <i>meanness</i> he condemns the <i>pride</i> and <i>pomp</i> of this world. He who will not <i>humble</i> himself, and become <i>base</i>, and <i>poor</i>, and <i>vile</i> in his own eyes, cannot enter into the kingdom of God. It is the <i>poor</i>, in general, who hear the Gospel the rich and the great are either too busy, or too much gratified with temporal things, to pay any attention to the voice of God.</p>
