Verse Matthew 11:6. Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me. — Or, Happy is he who will not be stumbled at me; for the word σκανδαλιζεσθαι, in its root, signifies to hit against or stumble over a thing, which one may meet with in the way. The Jews, as was before remarked, expected a temporal deliverer. Many might he tempted to reject Christ, because of his mean appearance, c., and so lose the benefit of salvation through him. To instruct and caution such, our blessed Lord spoke these words. By his poverty and meanness he condemns the pride and pomp of this world. He who will not humble himself, and become base, and poor, and vile in his own eyes, cannot enter into the kingdom of God. It is the poor, in general, who hear the Gospel the rich and the great are either too busy, or too much gratified with temporal things, to pay any attention to the voice of God.
