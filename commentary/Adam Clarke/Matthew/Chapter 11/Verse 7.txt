<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7">Matthew 11:7</span>. <i><b>What went ye out into the wilderness to see?</b></i> — The purport of our Lord's design, in this and the following verses, is to convince the scribes and Pharisees of the inconsistency of their conduct in acknowledging John Baptist for a divinely authorized teacher, and not believing in the very Christ which he pointed out to them. He also shows, from the <i>excellencies</i> of John's character, that their confidence in him was not misplaced, and that this was a farther argument why they should have believed in him, whom the Baptist proclaimed as being far superior to himself.</p>
<p><i><b>A reed shaken with the wind?</b></i> — An emblem of an irresolute, unsteady mind, which believes and speaks one thing to-day, and another to-morrow. Christ asks these Jews if they had ever found any thing in John like this: Was he not ever steady and uniform in the testimony he bore to me? The <i>first excellency</i> which Christ notices in John was his <i>steadiness</i>; convinced once of the truth, he continued to believe and assert it. This is essentially necessary to every <i>preacher</i>, and to every private Christian. He who changes about from opinion to opinion, and from one sect or party to another, is never to be depended on; there is much reason to believe that such a person is either mentally weak, or has never been rationally and divinely convinced of the truth.</p>
