<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:8">Matthew 11:8</span>. <i><b>A man clothed in soft raiment?</b></i> — A <i>second excellency</i> in John was, his sober and mortified life. A preacher of the Gospel should have nothing about him which savours of <i>effeminacy</i> and <i>worldly pomp</i>: he is awfully mistaken who thinks to prevail on the world to hear him and receive the truth, by conforming himself to its <i>fashions</i> and <i>manners</i>. Excepting the mere colour of his clothes, we can scarcely now distinguish a preacher of the Gospel, whether in the establishment of the country, or out of it, from the merest worldly man. Ruffles, powder, and fribble seem universally to prevail. Thus the Church and the world begin to shake hands, the latter still retaining its enmity to God. How can those who profess to preach the doctrine of the cross act in this way? Is not a worldly-minded preacher, in the most peculiar sense, an abomination in the eyes of the Lord?</p>
<p><i><b>Are in kings' houses.</b></i> — A <i>third excellency</i> in John was, he did not affect high things. He was contented to live in the desert, and to announce the solemn and severe truths of his doctrine to the simple inhabitants of the country. Let it be well observed, that the preacher who conforms to the world in his <i>clothing</i>, is never in his element but when he is frequenting the <i>houses</i> and <i>tables</i> of the <i>rich</i> and <i>great</i>.</p>
