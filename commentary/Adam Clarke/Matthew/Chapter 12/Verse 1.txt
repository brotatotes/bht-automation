<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1">Matthew 12:1</span>. <i><b>At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath-day through</b></i><b> </b><i><b>the corn</b></i> — "The time is determined by Luke in these words, εν σαββατω δευτεροπρωτω, that is, <i>on the Sabbath from the</i> <i>second-first</i>.</p>
<p>"1. Provision was made by the <i>Divine</i> law that the sheaf of first-fruits should be offered on the <i>second</i> day of the pass-over week, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:10-11">Leviticus 23:10-11</span>. <i>On the morrow after the Sabbath, the priest shall shake</i> (or <i>wave</i>) <i>it</i>. Not on the morrow after the <i>ordinary</i> Sabbath of the <i>week</i>, but the morrow after the <i>first</i> of the <i>pass-over</i> week, which was a <i>Sabbatic</i> day, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:16">Exodus 12:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:7">Leviticus 23:7</span>. Hence the <i>seventy</i>, επαυριον της πρωτης, <i>the morrow of the first</i> <i>day</i>; the Chaldee, <i>the morrow after the holy day</i>. The rabbins, <i>Solomon</i> and <i>Menachen</i>, have it, <i>On the morrow after the first day</i> <i>of the pass-over feast</i>; of which mention had been made in the verses foregoing.</p>
<p>"But now, from the second day of the <i>pass-over</i> solemnity, wherein the sheaf was offered, were numbered <i>seven weeks</i> to <i>pentecost</i>: for the day of the <i>sheaf</i>, and the day of <i>pentecost</i> did mutually respect each other; for on this second day of the <i>pass-over</i>, the offering of the sheaf was supplicatory, and by way of prayer, beseeching a blessing upon the new corn, and leave to eat it, and to pot in the sickle into the standing corn. Now, the offering of the first-fruit <i>loaves</i> on the day of <i>pentecost</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:15-17">Leviticus 23:15-17</span>,) did respect the giving of thanks for the finishing and housing of the barley-harvest. Therefore, in regard of this relation, these two solemnities were linked together, that both might respect the harvest; <i>that</i>, the harvest beginning; <i>this</i>, the harvest ended: <i>this</i> depended on <i>that</i>, and was numbered <i>seven</i> <i>weeks</i> after it. Therefore, the computation of the time coming between could not but carry with it the memory of that second day of the <i>pass-over week</i>; and hence <i>pentecost</i> is called the <i>feast of</i> <i>weeks</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+16:10">Deuteronomy 16:10</span>. The true calculation of the time between could not otherwise be retained, as to <i>Sabbaths</i>, but by numbering thus: this is σαββατων δευτεροπρωτον, <i>the first Sabbath after</i> <i>the second</i> day of the pass-over. This is δευτεροδευρερον, <i>the</i> <i>second</i> Sabbath after that second day. And so of the rest. In the <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i>, the word שבת פרוטוגמייא <i>shebeth protogamiya,</i> <i>the Sabbath</i>, προτογαμιας, <i>of the first marriage</i>, is a composition not very unlike." <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>His disciples were an hungered</b></i> — Were hungry. The former is a mode of expression totally obsolete. How <i>near</i> does the translation of this verse come to our ancient mother-tongue, the Anglo-Saxon! - [Anglo-Saxon] - <i>The Healer went on rest-day over acres:</i> <i>truly his learning knights hungred, and they began to pluck the</i> <i>ear and eaten</i>. We may well wonder at the extreme poverty of Christ and his disciples. He was himself present with them, and yet permitted them to lack bread! A man, therefore, is not forsaken of God because he is in <i>want</i>. It is more honourable to suffer the want of all temporal things in fellowship with Christ and his followers, than to have all things in abundance in connection with the world.</p>
