<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:10">Matthew 12:10</span>. <i><b>A man which had</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>hand withered.</b></i> â€” Probably through a partial <i>paralysis</i>. The man's hand was withered; but God's mercy had still preserved to him the use of his feet: He uses them to bring him to the public worship of God, and Jesus meets and heals him there. How true is the proverb - <i>It is never so ill with us,</i> <i>but it might be much worse</i>!</p>
