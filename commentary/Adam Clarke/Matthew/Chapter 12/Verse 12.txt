<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:12">Matthew 12:12</span>. <i><b>How much then is a man better than a sheep?</b></i> â€” Our Lord's argument is what is called <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>; they are taken on their own ground, and confuted on their own maxims and conduct. There are many persons who call themselves <i>Christians</i>, who do more for a <i>beast</i> of burden or pleasure than they do for a man for whom Christ died! Many spend that on <i>coursers, spaniels</i>, and <i>hounds</i>, of which multitudes of the followers of Christ are destitute:-but this also shall come to judgment.</p>
<p><i><b>Wherefore, it is lawful to do well</b></i>, &amp;c.] This was allowed by a multitude of Jewish canons. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
