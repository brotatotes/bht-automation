<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:13">Matthew 12:13</span>. <i><b>Stretch forth thine hand.</b></i> â€” The bare command of God is a sufficient reason of obedience. This man might have reasoned thus: "Lord, my hand is <i>withered</i>; how then can I stretch it out? Make it whole first, and afterwards I will do as thou commandest." This may appear <i>reasonable</i>, but in his case it would have been <i>foolishness</i>. At the command of the Lord he made the effort, and in making it the cure was effected! Faith disregards apparent impossibilities, where there is a command and promise of God. The <i>effort</i> to believe is, often, that <i>faith</i> by which the soul is <i>healed</i>.</p>
<p>A little before (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:6">Matthew 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:8">Matthew 12:8</span>) Jesus Christ had <i>asserted</i> his Godhead, in this verse he <i>proves</i> it. What but the omnipotence of the living God could have, in a moment, restored this withered hand? There could be no collusion here; the man who had a <i>real</i> disease was instantaneously and therefore miraculously cured; and the mercy and power of God were both amply manifested in this business.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that as the man was healed with a <i>word</i>, without even a <i>touch</i>, the Sabbath was unbroken, even according to their most rigid interpretation of the letter of the law.</p>
