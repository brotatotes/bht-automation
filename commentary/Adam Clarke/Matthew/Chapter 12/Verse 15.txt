<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:15">Matthew 12:15</span>. <i><b>Jesus - withdrew himself from thence</b></i> — It is the part of prudence and Christian charity not to provoke, if possible, the blind and the hardened; and to take from them the occasion of sin. A man of God is not afraid of persecution; but, as his aim is only to do good, by proclaiming every where the grace of the Lord Jesus, he departs from any place when he finds the obstacles to the accomplishment of his end are, humanly speaking, <i>invincible</i>, and that he can not do good without being the means of much evil. Yield to the stream when you cannot stem it.</p>
<p><i><b>Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all</b></i> — The rejection of the Gospel in one place has often been the means of sending it to and establishing it in another. Jesus <i>healed all</i> that <i>followed</i> him, i.e. all who had <i>need</i> of healing, and who <i>desired</i> to be healed; for thus the passage must be understood: - and is he not still the <i>same</i>? No soul shall ever implore his healing power in vain; but let it be remembered, that only those who <i>follow</i> Christ, and apply to him, are healed of their spiritual maladies.</p>
