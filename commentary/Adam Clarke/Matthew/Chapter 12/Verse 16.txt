<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:16">Matthew 12:16</span>. <i><b>Charged them that they should not make him known</b></i> â€” See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:4">Matthew 8:4</span>. Jesus Christ, as GOD, could have easily concealed himself, but he chooses to do it as <i>man</i>, and to use no other than human means, as these were quite sufficient for the purpose, to teach us not to neglect them in our necessity. Indeed, he always used his power less on his <i>own</i> account, than on that of <i>men</i>.</p>
