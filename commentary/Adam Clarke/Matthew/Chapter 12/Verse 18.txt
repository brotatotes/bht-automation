Verse Matthew 12:18. Behold my servant — This title was given to our blessed Lord in several prophecies. See Isaiah 42:1; Isaiah 53:2. Christ assumes it, Psalms 40:7-9. Compare these with John 17:4, and Philippians 2:7. God required an acceptable and perfect service from man; but man, being sinful, could not perform it. Jesus, taking upon him the nature of man, fully performed the whole will of God, and communicates grace to all his followers, to enable them perfectly to love and worthily to magnify their Maker.And he shall show judgment to the Gentiles. — That is, He will publish the Gospel to the heathens; for the word κρισιν here answers to the word משפט mishpat of the prophet, and it is used among the Hebrews to signify laws, precepts, and a whole system or body of doctrine. See Psalms 19:9; Psalms 119:30; Psalms 119:39; Isaiah 58:2.
