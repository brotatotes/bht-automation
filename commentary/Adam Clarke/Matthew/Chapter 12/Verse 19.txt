<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:19">Matthew 12:19</span>. <i><b>He shall not strive, nor cry</b></i> â€” The spirit of Christ is not a spirit of contention, murmuring, clamour, or litigiousness. He who loves these does not belong to him. Christ therefore fulfilled a prophecy by withdrawing from this place, on account of the rage of the Pharisees.</p>
