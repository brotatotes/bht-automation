<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:2">Matthew 12:2</span>. <i><b>Thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do</b></i> â€” The Jews were so superstitious, concerning the observance of the Sabbath, that in their wars with <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i>, and the <i>Romans</i>, they thought it a crime even to attempt to defend themselves on the Sabbath: when their enemies observed this, they deterred their operations to that day. It was through this, that <i>Pompey</i> was enabled to take Jerusalem. <i>Dion. Cass</i>. lib. xxxvi.</p>
<p>Those who know not the spirit and design of the divine law are often <i>superstitious</i> to <i>inhumanity</i>, and <i>indulgent</i> to <i>impiety</i>. An intolerant and censorious spirit in religion is one of the greatest curses a man can well fall under.</p>
