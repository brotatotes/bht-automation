<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:20">Matthew 12:20</span>. <i><b>A bruised reed shall he not break</b></i> — A <i>reed</i> is, in Scripture, the emblem of <i>weakness</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+29:6">Ezekiel 29:6</span>; and a <i>bruised</i> reed must signify that state of weakness that borders on dissolution and death.</p>
<p><i><b>And smoking flax shall he not quench</b></i> — λινον τυφομενον. λινος means the <i>wick</i> of a lamp, and τυφομενον is intended to point out its <i>expiring state</i>, when the oil has been all burnt away from it, and nothing is left but a mere <i>snuff, emitting smoke</i>. Some suppose the Jewish state, as to ecclesiastical matters, is here intended, the prophecy declaring that Christ would not destroy it, but leave it to expire of itself, as it already contained the principles of its own destruction. Others have considered it as implying that great tenderness with which the blessed Jesus should treat the weak and the ignorant, whose good desires must not be stifled, but encouraged. The <i>bruised reed</i> may recover itself, if permitted to vegetate under the genial influences of heaven; and the <i>life</i> and <i>light</i> of the <i>expiring lamp</i> may be supported by the addition of fresh oil. Jesus therefore quenches not faint desires after salvation, even in the worst and most undeserving of men; for even such desires may lead to the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of peace.</p>
<p><i><b>Judgment unto victory.</b></i> — See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:18">Matthew 12:18</span>. By <i>judgment</i>, understand the <i>Gospel</i>, and by <i>victory</i> its complete triumph over Jewish opposition, and Gentile impiety. He will continue by these mild and gentle means to work till the whole world is Christianized, and the universe filled with his glory.</p>
