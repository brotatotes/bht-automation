<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:21">Matthew 12:21</span>. <i><b>And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</b></i> — ελπιουσι, <i>they shall hope</i>. Jesus Christ is the sole <i>hope</i> and <i>trust</i> of mankind; <i>to trust</i> and <i>hope in his name</i>, JESUS, is to expect salvation and all things necessary from <i>him alone</i>, to despise, comparatively, all earthly promises, to esteem, love, and desire heavenly things only, and to bear with patience and tranquillity all the losses and evils of this life, upon the prospect and <i>hope</i> of that felicity which he has purchased for us.</p>
