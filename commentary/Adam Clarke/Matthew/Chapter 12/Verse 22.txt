<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:22">Matthew 12:22</span>. <i><b>One possessed with a devil, blind and dumb</b></i> â€” A person from whom the indwelling demon took away both <i>sight</i> and <i>hearing</i>. Satan makes himself master of the <i>heart</i>, the <i>eyes</i>, and the <i>tongue</i> of the sinner. His <i>heart</i> he fills with the love of sin; his <i>eyes</i> he blinds that he may not see his guilt, and the perdition which awaits him; and his <i>tongue</i> he hinders from prayer and supplication, though he gives it increasing liberty in blasphemies, lies, slanders, &amp;c. None but Jesus can redeem from this threefold captivity.</p>
