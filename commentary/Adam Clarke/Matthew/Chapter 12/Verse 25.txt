<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:25">Matthew 12:25</span>. <i><b>Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to</b></i><b> </b><i><b>desolation</b></i> â€” Our Lord's argument was thus:-"The welfare of any <i>kingdom, city</i>, or <i>family</i>, depends on its <i>concord</i> and <i>unanimity;</i> Satan, like every other potentate, must wish to rule his empire in <i>peace</i> and <i>security</i>; how then can he be in league with me, who <i>oppose</i> his authority, and am <i>destroying</i> his kingdom?"</p>
<p>The reasoning of the Pharisees, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>, was not <i>expressed</i>, and Jesus, <i>knowing their thoughts</i>, gave them ample proof or his <i>omniscience</i>. This, with our Lord's masterly confutation of their reasonings, by a conclusion drawn from their own premises, one would have supposed might have humbled and convinced these men; but the most conclusive reasoning, and the most astonishing miracles, were lost upon a people who were obstinately determined to disbelieve every thing good, relative to Christ. How true the saying-<i>He came unto his own, and his own</i> <i>received him not</i>!</p>
