<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:26">Matthew 12:26</span>. <i><b>If Satan cast out Satan</b></i> â€” A good cause will produce a good effect, and an evil cause an evil effect. Were I on Satan's side, I would act for his interest and confirm his influence among you; but I oppose his maxims by my <i>doctrine</i>, and his <i>influence</i> by my <i>power</i>.</p>
