<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:27">Matthew 12:27</span>. <i><b>By whom do your children cast</b></i><b> them </b><i><b>out?</b></i> â€” <i>Children</i>, or <i>sons of the prophets</i>, means the <i>disciples</i> of the prophets; and <i>children</i> or sons of the Pharisees, <i>disciples</i> of the <i>Pharisees</i>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:13">Acts 19:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:14">Acts 19:14</span>, it is evident there were <i>exorcists</i> among the Jews, and, from our Lord's saying here, it is also evident that the disciples of the Pharisees did cast out demons, or, at least, those who educated them wished to have it believed that they had such a power. Our Lord's argument here is extremely conclusive: If the man who casts out demons proves himself thereby to be in league with and influenced by Satan, then <i>your disciples</i>, and <i>you</i> who taught them, are all of you in league with the devil: ye must either give up your assertion, that I cast out demons by Beelzebul, or else admit this conclusion, in its fullest force and latitude, that <i>ye</i> are all children of the devil, and leagued with him against God.</p>
<p>Envy causes persons often to <i>condemn</i> in <i>one</i>, what they <i>approve</i> in <i>another</i>.</p>
