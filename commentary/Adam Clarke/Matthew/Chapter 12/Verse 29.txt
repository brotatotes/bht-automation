<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Else how can one enter into a strong man's house</b></i> â€” Men, through sin, are become the very <i>house</i> and dwelling place of Satan, having of their own accord surrendered themselves to this unjust possessor; for whoever gives up his soul to sin gives it up to the devil. It is Jesus, and Jesus <i>alone</i>, who can deliver from the power of this bondage. When Satan is cast out, Jesus <i>purifies</i> and <i>dwells</i> in the heart.</p>
