<p><i><b>When he was an hungered</b></i> — Here hearken to <i>Kimchi</i>, producing the opinion of the ancients concerning this story in these words: <i>"Our</i> <i>rabbins of blessed memory say, that he gave him the shew-bread,</i> <i>c.</i> The interpretation also of the clause, <i>Yea, though it were</i> <i>sanctified this day in the vessel</i>, is this: <i>It is a small thing to</i> <i>say, that it is lawful for us to eat</i> THESE LOAVES, <i>taken from</i> <i>before the Lord, when we are hungry for it would be lawful to eat</i> <i>this very loaf which is now set on, which is also sanctified in</i> <i>the vessel, (for the table sanctifieth), it would be lawful to eat</i> <i>even this, when another loaf is not present with you to give us,</i> <i>and we are so hunger-bitten</i>. And a little after, <i>There is nothing</i> <i>which may hinder taking care of life, beside idolatry, adultery,</i> <i>and murder</i>. That is, a man, according to them, should do any thing but these in order to preserve life." See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He entered into the house of God</b></i> — Viz. the house of <i>Ahimelech</i> the priest, who dwelt at Nob, with whom the tabernacle then was, in which the Divine presence was manifested.</p>
