<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Neither in this world, neither in the</b></i><b> world </b><i><b>to come.</b></i> — Though I follow the common translation, yet I am fully satisfied the meaning of the words is, neither in this dispensation, (viz. the Jewish,) nor in that which is to come, viz. the Christian. עולם הבא <i>olam ha-ba</i>, the world to come, is a constant phrase for the times of the Messiah in the Jewish writers. See below. The sin here spoken of by our Lord ranks high in the catalogue of <i>presumptuous sins</i>, for which there was no forgiveness under the Mosaic dispensation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:30">Numbers 15:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:31">Numbers 15:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+35:31">Numbers 35:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+20:10">Leviticus 20:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:25">1 Samuel 2:25</span>. When our Lord says that such a sin hath no forgiveness, is he not to be understood as meaning that the crime shall be punished under the Christian dispensation as it was under the Jewish, viz. by the destruction of the body? And is not this the same mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>, called there <i>the sin unto death</i>; i.e. a sin that was to be punished by the death of the body, while mercy might be extended to the soul? The punishment for presumptuous sins, under the Jewish law, to which our Lord evidently alludes, certainly did not extend to the <i>damnation of the soul</i>, though the body was destroyed: therefore I think that, though there was no such forgiveness to be extended to this crime as to absolve the man from the punishment of <i>temporal</i> death, yet, <i>on repentance</i>, mercy might be extended to the soul; and every sin may be repented of under the Gospel dispensation.</p>
<p>Dr. Lightfoot has sufficiently vindicated this passage from all false interpretation. "They that endeavour hence to prove the remission of some sins after death, seem little to understand to what Christ had respect when he spake these words. Weigh well this common and, most known doctrine of the <i>Jewish</i> schools, and judge.</p>
<p><i>"He that transgresses an affirmative precept, if he presently</i> <i>repent, is not moved until the Lord pardon him; and of such it is</i> <i>said</i>, Be ye converted, O back sliding children! and I will heal your backslidings. <i>He that transgresses a negative precept, and</i> <i>repents, his repentance suspends judgment, and the day of</i> <i>expiation expiates him; as it is said</i>, This day shall all your uncleannesses be expiated to you. <i>He that transgresses to cutting</i> <i>off</i> (by the stroke of God) <i>or to death by the Sanhedrin, and</i> <i>repents, repentance and the day of expiation do suspend judgment,</i> <i>and the strokes that are laid upon him wipe off sin, as it is</i> <i>said</i>, And I will visit their transgression with a rod, and their iniquity with scourges. <i>But he by whom the name of God is</i> <i>profaned (or blasphemed) repentance is of no avail to him to</i> <i>suspend judgment, nor the day of expiation to expiate it, nor</i> <i>scourges (or corrections inflicted) to wipe it off, but all</i> <i>suspend judgment, and death wipes it off</i>. Thus the <i>Babylonian</i> <i>Gemara</i> writes; but the <i>Jerusalem</i> thus: <i>Repentance and the day of</i> <i>expiation expiate as to the third part, and corrections as to the</i> <i>third part, and death wipes it off, as it is said, And your</i> <i>iniquities shall not be expiated to you until ye die: behold, we</i> <i>learn that death wipes off</i>. Note this, which <i>Christ</i> contradicts, concerning blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. <i>It shall not be</i> <i>forgiven</i>, saith he, <i>neither in this world, nor in the world to</i> <i>come</i>; that is, neither <i>before death</i>, nor, as you dream, <i>by death</i>. Jerus. Sanhed. fol. 37. and Bab. Yoma, fol. 86.</p>
<p>"<i>In the world to come</i>. - I. Some phrases were received into common use, by which, in common speech, they opposed the heresy of the <i>Sadducces</i>, who denied immortality, Of that sort were עולם הבא <i>olam ha-ba</i>, Αιων ὁ μελλων, <i>The world to come</i>. גן עדן gan <i>aden</i>, Παραδεισος, <i>paradise</i>: גו הנום gei hinnom, Γεεννα, <i>hell</i>, c.</p>
<p>"<i>At the end of all the prayers in the temple</i> (as we observed before) <i>they said</i> עד עולם ad olam, for ever. <i>But when the</i> <i>heretics</i> (i.e. the Sadducees) <i>brake in, and said there was</i> NO AGE <i>but one, then it was appointed to be said for ever and ever</i>. מן העולם ועד העולם min ha-olam, vead ha-olam. Bab. Beracoth, fol. 54. This distinction of עולם הזה <i>olam hazeh, this world</i>, and of עולם הבא <i>olam ha-ba, the world to come</i>, you may find almost in every page of the <i>rabbins</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>The Lord recompense thee a good reward for this thy good work</i> in this world, <i>and let thy reward be perfected</i> in the world to come. Targum on Ruth.</p>
<p>"<i>It</i> (that is, the history of the creation and of the Bible) <i>therefore begins with the letter</i> ב beth, (in the word ברישית <i>bereshith</i>,) <i>because two worlds were created, this world and a</i> <i>world to come</i>. Baal Turim.</p>
<p>"The <i>world to come</i> hints two things especially, (of which see <i>Rambam</i>, in Sanhed. cap. ii. Chelek.) I. The times of the <i>Messiah</i>: '<i>Be mindful of the day wherein thou camest out of Egypt, all the</i> <i>days of thy life: the wise men say</i>, by the days of thy life <i>is</i> <i>intimated</i> this world: by <i>all</i> the days of thy life, <i>the days of the</i> <i>Messiah are superinduced</i>.' In this sense the apostle seems to speak, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5">Hebrews 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:5">Hebrews 6:5</span>. II. The state after death: thus Rab. <i>Tancum</i>, The world to come, is when a man has departed out of this world."</p>
