<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Either make the tree good</b></i> â€” That is, the <i>effect</i> will be always similar to the <i>cause</i>; a <i>bad tree</i> will produce <i>bad fruit,</i> and a <i>good tree, good fruit</i>.</p>
<p>The works will resemble the heart: nothing good can proceed from an evil spirit; no good fruit can proceed from a corrupt heart. Before the heart of man can produce any good, it must be renewed and influenced by the Spirit of God.</p>
