Verse 33. Either make the tree good â€” That is, the effect will be always similar to the cause; a bad tree will produce bad fruit, and a good tree, good fruit.The works will resemble the heart: nothing good can proceed from an evil spirit; no good fruit can proceed from a corrupt heart. Before the heart of man can produce any good, it must be renewed and influenced by the Spirit of God.
