<p>Verse 34. <i><b>O generation of vipers</b></i> — These are apparently severe words; but they were extremely proper in reference to that execrable people to whom they were addressed: the whole verse is an inference from what was spoken before.</p>
<p><i><b>Out of the abundance</b></i> (περισσευματος, <i>the overflowings</i>)<b> </b><i><b>of the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>heart</b></i> — Wicked words and sinful actions may be considered as the <i>overflowings</i> of a heart that is <i>more than full</i> of the spirit of wickedness; and holy words and righteous deeds may be considered as the <i>overflowings</i> of a heart that is filled with the Holy Spirit, and <i>running over</i> with love to God and man.</p>
