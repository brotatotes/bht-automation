<p>Verse 35. <i><b>A good man out of the good treasure of the heart</b></i> — της καρδιας, <i>of the heart</i>, is omitted by upwards of one hundred MSS., many of them of the greatest antiquity and authority; by all the <i>Syriac, Arabic</i>, and <i>Persic</i>; by the <i>Slavonic, Saxon, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, (except four,) and by several of the <i>primitive</i> <i>fathers</i>. It seems to have been added here by some copyist, merely to explain. The good heart is the good <i>treasury</i>, and the treasure that is in it is the love of God, and of all mankind. The bad heart is the bad treasury, and its treasure is the <i>carnal mind</i>, which is <i>enmity</i> against God, and <i>ill-will</i> to man.</p>
