<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Every idle word</b></i> — ρημα αργον, a word that <i>does</i> <i>nothing</i>, that neither ministers <i>grace</i> nor <i>instruction</i> to them who hear it. The word αργον corresponds to the Hebrew שוא <i>shave</i>, which signifies not only <i>vain</i> or <i>empty</i>, but also <i>wicked</i> and <i>injurious</i>, such as <i>a false testimony against a neighbour</i>, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+5:11">Deuteronomy 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+5:20">Deuteronomy 5:20</span>. Add to this, that Symmachus translates <i>piggul, polluted</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+19:7">Leviticus 19:7</span>, by the very Greek word in the text. It was to explain this ambiguous meaning of the word, that <i>ten</i> MSS. have changed αργον Into πονηρον, <i>evil</i>. Our Lord must be understood here as condemning all <i>false</i> and <i>injurious</i> words: the scope of the place necessarily requires this meaning.</p>
