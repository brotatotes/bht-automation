<p>Verse 37. <i><b>By thy words thou shalt be justified</b></i> â€” That is, the whole tenor of thy <i>conversation</i> will be an evidence <i>for</i> or <i>against</i> thee, in the great day. How many are there who count <i>words</i> for nothing! and yet eternity often depends on them. <i>Lord, put a</i> <i>watch before the door of my lips</i>! is a prayer proper for all men.</p>
