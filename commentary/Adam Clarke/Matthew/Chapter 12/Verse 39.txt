<p>Verse 39. <i><b>An evil and adulterous generation</b></i> — Or, <i>race of</i> <i>people</i>; for so γενεα should be translated here, and in most other places in the Gospels; for our Lord, in general, uses it to point out the <i>Jewish people</i>. This translation is a key to unlock some very obscure passages in the evangelists.</p>
<p><i><b>Seeketh after a sign</b></i> — Or, <i>seeketh another sign</i>, (επιζητει,) so I think this word should be translated. Our Lord had <i>already</i> given the Jews several signs; and here they desire <i>sign upon sign</i>.</p>
<p>Our Lord terms the Jews an adulterous race. Under the old covenant, the Jewish nation was represented as in a <i>marriage</i> <i>contract</i> with the Lord of hosts; as believers, in the new covenant, are represented as the <i>spouse of Christ</i>. All unfaithfulness and disobedience was considered as a <i>breach</i> of this <i>marriage contract</i>; hence the persons who were thus guilty are denominated <i>adulterers</i> and <i>adulteresses</i>. But, independently of this, there is the utmost proof, from their own writings, that in the time of our Lord they were most literally an <i>adulterous</i> race of people: for, at this very time, R. Jochanan ben Zacchai abrogated the trial by the bitter waters of jealousy, because so many were found to be thus criminal.
