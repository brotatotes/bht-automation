<p>Verse 40. <i><b>Three days and three nights</b></i> — Our Lord rose from the grave on the day but <i>one</i> after his crucifixion: so that, in the computation in this verse, the part of the day on which he was crucified, and the part of that on which he rose again, are severally estimated as an <i>entire day</i>; and this, no doubt, exactly corresponded to the time in which Jonah was in the belly of the fish. Our Lord says, As Jonah was, so shall the Son of man be, c. <i>Evening and morning</i>, or <i>night and day</i>, is the Hebrew phrase for a <i>natural day</i>, which the Greeks termed νυξθημερον, <i>nuchthemeron</i>. The very same quantity of time which is here termed three days and three nights, and which, in reality, was only <i>one</i> <i>whole day</i>, a <i>part</i> of <i>two others</i>, and <i>two whole nights</i>, is termed <i>three days and three nights</i>, in the book of <i>Esther: Go</i> <i>neither eat nor drink</i> THREE DAYS, NIGHT <i>or</i> DAY, <i>and so I will go</i> <i>in unto the king</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="es+4:16">Esther 4:16</span>. Afterwards it follows, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="es+5:1">Esther 5:1</span>. <i>On the</i> THIRD DAY, <i>Esther stood in the inner court of the king's</i> <i>house</i>. Many examples might be produced, from both the sacred and profane writers, in vindication of the propriety of the expression in the text. For farther satisfaction, the reader, if he please, may consult <i>Whitby</i> and <i>Wakefield</i>, and take the following from <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>"I. The Jewish writers extend that memorable station of the unmoving sun, at <i>Joshua's</i> prayer, to six and thirty hours; for so <i>Kimchi</i> upon that place: '<i>According to more exact interpretation,</i> <i>the sun and moon stood still for six and thirty hours: for when</i> <i>the fight was on the eve of the Sabbath, Joshua feared lest the</i> <i>Israelites might break the Sabbath; therefore he spread abroad his</i> <i>hands, that the sun might stand still on the sixth day, according</i> <i>to the measure of the day of the Sabbath, and the moon according</i> <i>to the measure of the night of the Sabbath, and of the going out</i> <i>of the Sabbath, which amounts to six and thirty hours</i>.'</p>
<p>"II. If you number the hours that pass from our Saviour's giving up the ghost upon the cross to his resurrection, you shall find almost the same number of hours; and yet that space is called by him <i>three days and three nights</i>, whereas two nights only came between, and one complete day. Nevertheless, while he speaks these words, he is not without the consent both of the <i>Jewish</i> schools and their computation. Weigh well that which is disputed in the tract <i>Scabbath</i>, concerning the separation of a woman for three days; where many things are discussed by the <i>Gemarists</i>, concerning the computation of this space of <i>three days</i>. Among other things these words occur: <i>R. Ismael</i> saith, <i>Sometimes it</i> <i>contains four</i> אונות onoth, sometimes five, sometimes six. But how <i>much is the space of an</i> אונה onah? R. Jochanan saith, <i>Either a</i> <i>day or a night</i>. And so also the <i>Jerusalem Talmud: 'R. Akiba fixed</i> <i>a</i> DAY <i>for an onah, and a</i> NIGHT <i>for an onah</i>.' But the tradition is, that <i>R. Eliazar ben Azariah</i> said, <i>A day and a night make an</i> <i>onah: and a</i> PART <i>of an onah is as the</i> WHOLE. And a little after, <i>R. Ismael computed a part of the onah for the whole</i>." Thus, then, three days and three nights, according to this Jewish method of reckoning, included any part of the first day; the whole of the following night; the next day and its night; and any part of the succeeding or third day.</p>
<p><i><b>In the whale's belly</b></i> — That a fish of the <i>shark</i> kind, and not a <i>whale</i>, is here meant, <i>Bochart</i> has abundantly proved, vol. iii. col. 742, c., edit. Leyd. 1692. It is well known that the throat of a <i>whale</i> is capable of admitting little more than the <i>arm</i> of an ordinary man but many of the shark species can swallow a man whole, and men have been found whole in the stomachs of several. Every natural history abounds with facts of this kind. Besides, the shark is a native of the <i>Mediterranean</i> Sea, in which Jonah was sailing when swallowed by what the Hebrew terms דג גדול <i>dag gadol,</i> <i>a great fish</i>; but every body knows that <i>whales</i> are no produce of the <i>Mediterranean</i> Sea, thought some have been by <i>accident</i> found there, as in most other parts of the maritime world: but, let them be found where they may, there is none of them capable of swallowing a man. Instead of either <i>whale</i> or <i>shark</i>, some have translated דג גדול <i>dag gadol</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jon+1:17">Jonah 1:17</span>, by a fishing cove, or something of this nature; but this is merely to get rid of the miracle: for, according to some, the whole of Divine revelation is a forgery - or it is a system of metaphor or allegory, that has no miraculous interferences in it. But, independently of all this, the criticism is contemptible. Others say, that the great fish means a vessel so called, into which Jonah went, and into the <i>hold</i> of which he was thrown, where he continued three days and three nights. In short, it must be any thing but a real miracle, the existence of which the wise men, so called, of the present day, cannot admit. Perhaps these very men are not aware that they have scarcely any belief even in the existence of God himself!</p>
