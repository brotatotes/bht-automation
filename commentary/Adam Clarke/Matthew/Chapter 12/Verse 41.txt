<p>Verse 41. <i><b>The men of Nineveh shell rise in judgment</b></i> — The voice of God, threatening temporal judgments, caused a whole people to repent, who had neither Moses nor Christ, neither the law nor the prophets; and who perhaps never had but this one preacher among them. What judgment may not we expect, if we continue impenitent, after all that God has bestowed upon <i>us</i>?</p>
<p><i><b>A greater than Jonas is here.</b></i> — πλειον, for τιπλειον, <i>something more</i>. The <i>evidence</i> offered by Jonah sufficed to convince and lead the Ninevites to repentance; but here was <i>more</i> evidence, and a greater person; and yet so obstinate are the Jews that all is ineffectual.</p>
<p>1. Christ, who preached to the Jews, was infinitely greater than Jonah, in his nature, person, and mission.</p>
<p>2. Jonah preached repentance in Nineveh only <i>forty</i> days, and Christ preached among the Jews for several years.</p>
<p>3. Jonah wrought no miracles to authorize his preaching; but Christ wrought miracles every day, in every place where he went, and of every kind. And</p>
<p>4. Notwithstanding all this, the people of Judea did not repent, though the people of Nineveh did.</p>
