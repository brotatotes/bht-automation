<p>Verse 44. <i><b>Into my house</b></i> — The soul of that person from whom he had been expelled by the power of Christ, and out of which he was to have been kept by continual prayer, faith, and watchfulness.</p>
<p><i><b>He findeth</b></i><b> it </b><i><b>empty</b></i> — <i>Unoccupied</i>, σχολαζοντα, <i>empty</i> of the former inhabitant, and <i>ready</i> to receive a new one: denoting a soul that has lost the life and power of godliness, and the testimony of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>Swept and garnished.</b></i> — As σχολαζω signifies to be <i>idle</i>, or <i>unemployed</i>, it may refer here to the <i>person</i>, as well as to his <i>state</i>. His affections and desires are no longer <i>busied</i> with the things of God, but <i>gad about</i>, like an <i>idle</i> person, among the vanities of a perishing world. <i>Swept</i>, from love, meekness, and all the fruits of the Spirit; and <i>garnished</i>, or <i>adorned</i>, κεκοσμημενον, <i>decorated</i>, with the vain showy trifles of folly and fashion. This may comprise also <i>smart speeches, cunning</i> <i>repartees</i>, &amp;c., for which many who have lost the life of God are very remarkable.</p>
