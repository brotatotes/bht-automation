<p>Verse 45. <i><b>Seven other spirits more wicked</b></i> — <i>Seven</i> was a favourite number with the Jews, implying frequently, with them, something <i>perfect, completed, filled up</i>, for such is the proper import of the Hebrew word <i>sheva</i> or <i>shevang</i>: nearly allied in sound to our <i>seven</i>. And perhaps this meaning of it refers to the <i>seventh day</i>, when God rested from his work, having <i>filled up</i>, or <i>completed</i> the whole of his creative design. <i>Seven demons</i>-as many as could occupy his soul, harassing it with pride, anger, self-will, lust, c., and torturing the body with disease.</p>
<p><i><b>The last</b></i><b> state </b><i><b>of that man is worse than the first.</b></i> — His soul, before influenced by the Spirit of God, dilated and expanded under its heavenly influences, becomes more capable of refinement in iniquity, as its powers are more capacious than formerly. Evil habits are formed and strengthened by relapses and relapses are multiplied, and become more incurable, through new habits.</p>
<p><i><b>So shall it be also unto this wicked generation.</b></i> — And so it was: for they grew worse and worse, as if totally abandoned to diabolic influence; till at last the besom of destruction swept them and their privileges, national and religious, utterly away. What a terrible description of a state of apostasy is contained in these verses! May he who readeth understand!</p>
