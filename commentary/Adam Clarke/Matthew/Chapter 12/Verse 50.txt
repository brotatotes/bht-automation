<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:50">Matthew 12:50</span>. <i><b>Whosoever shall do the will of my Father</b></i>, c.] Those are the best acknowledged relatives of Christ who are united to him by spiritual ties, and who are become <i>one</i> with him by the indwelling of his Spirit. We generally suppose that Christ's relatives must have shared much of his affectionate attention and doubtless they did: but here we find that whosoever does the will of God is equally esteemed by Christ, as his <i>brother, sister</i>, or even his <i>virgin mother</i>. What an encouragement for fervent attachment to God!</p>
<p>1. From various facts related in this chapter, we see the nature and design of the revelation of God, and of all the ordinances and precepts contained in it-they are all calculated to do man <i>good</i>: to improve his understanding, to soften and change his nature, that he may love his neighbour as himself. That religion that does not inculcate and produce <i>humanity</i> never came from heaven.</p>
<p>2. We have already seen what the sin against the Holy Ghost is: no soul that <i>fears</i> God <i>can</i> commit it: perhaps it would be impossible for any but <i>Jews</i> to be guilty of it, and they only in the circumstances mentioned in the text; and in such circumstances, it is impossible that any person should <i>now</i> be found.</p>
