<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:8">Matthew 12:8</span>. <i><b>The Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath-day.</b></i> â€” The change of the Jewish into the Christian Sabbath, called the <i>Lord's</i> <i>day</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>, shows that Christ is not only the <i>Lord</i>, but also the <i>truth</i> and <i>completion</i> of it. For it seems to have been by an especial providence that this change has been made and acknowledged all over the Christian world.</p>
