<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1">Matthew 13:1</span>. <i><b>The same day</b></i> — Our Lord scarcely ever appears to take any rest: he is incessant in his labours, and instant in season and out of season; and in this he has left all his successors in the ministry an example, that they should follow his steps: for he who wishes to save souls will find few opportunities to rest. As Satan is going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour, the messenger of God should imitate his diligence, that he may counteract his work. The gospels are journals of our Lord's life.</p>
<p><i><b>Went Jesus out of the house</b></i> — This was the house of Peter. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:24">Matthew 17:24</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Sat by the sea side.</b></i> — The sea of Galilee, on the borders of which the city of Capernaum was situated.</p>
