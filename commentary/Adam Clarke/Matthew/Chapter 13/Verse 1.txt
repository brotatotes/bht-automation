Verse Matthew 13:1. The same day — Our Lord scarcely ever appears to take any rest: he is incessant in his labours, and instant in season and out of season; and in this he has left all his successors in the ministry an example, that they should follow his steps: for he who wishes to save souls will find few opportunities to rest. As Satan is going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour, the messenger of God should imitate his diligence, that he may counteract his work. The gospels are journals of our Lord's life.Went Jesus out of the house — This was the house of Peter. See Matthew 17:24.Sat by the sea side. — The sea of Galilee, on the borders of which the city of Capernaum was situated.
