<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11">Matthew 13:11</span>. <i><b>It is given unto you to know the mysteries</b></i>, c.] By <i>mysteries</i>, here, we may understand not only things concerning the scheme of salvation, which had not yet been revealed but also the <i>prophetic</i> declarations concerning the <i>future</i> state of the Christian Church, expressed in the ensuing parables. <i>It is not</i> <i>given to them</i> to know the purport and design of these things - they are <i>gross of heart</i>, earthly and sensual, and do not improve the light they have received: <i>but to you it is given</i>, because I have appointed you not only to be the <i>first preachers</i> of my Gospel to sinners, but also the persons who shall transmit accounts of all these things to posterity. The knowledge of these mysteries, in the first instance, can be given only to a few; but when these faithfully <i>write</i> and <i>publish</i> what they have <i>heard</i> and <i>seen</i>, unto the world, then the science of salvation is <i>revealed</i> and addressed to <i>all</i>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:17">Matthew 13:17</span>, we learn, that many prophets and righteous men had desired to see and hear these things, but had not that privilege - <i>to them it was not given</i>; not because God designed to exclude them from salvation, but because HE who knew all things knew, either that they were not proper <i>persons</i>, or that that was not the proper <i>time</i>: for the choice of the PERSONS <i>by</i> <i>whom</i>, and the choice of the TIME <i>in which</i> it is most proper to reveal Divine things, must ever rest with the all-wise God.</p>
