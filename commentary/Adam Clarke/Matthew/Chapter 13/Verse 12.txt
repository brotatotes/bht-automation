<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:12">Matthew 13:12</span>. <i><b>Whosoever hath, to him shall be given</b></i> — This is an allusion to a common custom in all countries: he who possesses <i>much</i> or is <i>rich</i>, to such a person, <i>presents</i> are ordinarily given.</p>
<p><i><b>Whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he</b></i><b> </b><i><b>hath.</b></i> — That is, the <i>poor man</i>: he that has <i>little</i> may be easily made a prey of, and so lose his little. This is a proper sense of the word εχειν in sacred and profane writers. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:22">1 Corinthians 11:22</span>, τους μη εχοντας, <i>those who have not</i>, means simply THE POOR: and <i>Aristophanes</i> uses τους εξοντας, <i>those that have</i>, for the RICH or OPULENT. See a variety of pertinent examples in <i>Kypke</i> on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>. There is one example in <i>Juvenal</i>, Sat. iii. l. 208, 209, that expresses the whole of our Lords meaning, and is a beautiful illustration of this apparently difficult passage.</p>
<p>NIL habuit <i>Codrus: quis enim negat? et tamen illud</i> Perdidit <i>infelix</i> TOTUM NIL. </p>

<p>He had <i>one small bed, six little pitchers</i>, the <i>ornament</i> of a <i>side-board</i>; a <i>small jug</i> or <i>tankard</i>, the <i>image</i> of a <i>centaur,</i> and an <i>old chest</i> with some <i>Greek books</i> in it, on which the mice had already begun to make depredations. And <i>all</i> this he <i>lost</i>; probably by continuing, in spite of his destiny, to be a <i>poet</i>. So those who devote not the light and power which God has given them to the purposes for which he has granted these gifts, from them shall be taken away these unemployed or prostituted blessings. This seems to have been a proverbial mode of speech, which our Lord here uses to inform his disciples, that he who does not improve the <i>first</i> operations of grace, howsoever <i>small</i>, is in danger of losing not only all the possible product, but even the principal; for God delights to heap benefits on those who properly improve them. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>.</p>
