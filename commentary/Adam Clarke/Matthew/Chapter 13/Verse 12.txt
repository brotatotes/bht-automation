Verse Matthew 13:12. Whosoever hath, to him shall be given — This is an allusion to a common custom in all countries: he who possesses much or is rich, to such a person, presents are ordinarily given.Whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. — That is, the poor man: he that has little may be easily made a prey of, and so lose his little. This is a proper sense of the word εχειν in sacred and profane writers. In 1 Corinthians 11:22, τους μη εχοντας, those who have not, means simply THE POOR: and Aristophanes uses τους εξοντας, those that have, for the RICH or OPULENT. See a variety of pertinent examples in Kypke on Luke 8:18. There is one example in Juvenal, Sat. iii. l. 208, 209, that expresses the whole of our Lords meaning, and is a beautiful illustration of this apparently difficult passage.NIL habuit Codrus: quis enim negat? et tamen illud Perdidit infelix TOTUM NIL.  Et divina Opici rodebant carmina mures.  He had one small bed, six little pitchers, the ornament of a side-board; a small jug or tankard, the image of a centaur, and an old chest with some Greek books in it, on which the mice had already begun to make depredations. And all this he lost; probably by continuing, in spite of his destiny, to be a poet. So those who devote not the light and power which God has given them to the purposes for which he has granted these gifts, from them shall be taken away these unemployed or prostituted blessings. This seems to have been a proverbial mode of speech, which our Lord here uses to inform his disciples, that he who does not improve the first operations of grace, howsoever small, is in danger of losing not only all the possible product, but even the principal; for God delights to heap benefits on those who properly improve them. Luke 8:18.
