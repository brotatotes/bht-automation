<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:13">Matthew 13:13</span>. <i><b>Therefore speak I to them in parables</b></i> — On this account, viz. to lead them into a proper knowledge of God. I speak to them in parables, <i>natural</i> representations of <i>spiritual</i> truths, that they may be allured to <i>inquire</i>, and to find out the <i>spirit</i>, which is hidden under the <i>letter; because, seeing</i> the miracles which I have wrought, <i>they see not</i>, i.e. the end for which I have wrought them; <i>and hearing</i> my doctrines, <i>they hear</i> <i>not</i>, so as to profit by what is spoken; <i>neither do they</i> <i>understand</i>, ουδεσυνιουσι, they do not lay their hearts to it. Is not this obviously our Lord's meaning? Who can suppose that he would employ his time in speaking enigmatically to them, on purpose that they might not understand what was spoken? Could the God of truth and sincerity act thus? If he had designed to act otherwise, he might have saved his time and labour, and not spoken <i>at all</i>, which would have answered the same end, viz. to leave them in gross ignorance.</p>
