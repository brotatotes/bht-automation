<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:14">Matthew 13:14</span>. <i><b>In them is fulfilled</b></i> — αναπληρουται, <i>Is</i> AGAIN <i>fulfilled</i>: this proper meaning of the Greek word has been generally overlooked. The evangelist means, that as these words were fulfilled in the Jews, in the time of the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, so they are now <i>again</i> fulfilled in these their posterity, who exactly copy their fathers example. These awful words may be again fulfilled in <i>us</i>, if we take not warning by the things which these disobedient people have suffered.</p>
<p><i><b>By hearing ye shall hear</b></i> — Jesus Christ shall be sent to you, his miracles ye shall fully see, and his doctrines ye shall distinctly hear; but God will not <i>force</i> you to receive the salvation which is offered.</p>
