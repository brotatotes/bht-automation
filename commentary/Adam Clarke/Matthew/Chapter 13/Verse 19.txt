<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:19">Matthew 13:19</span>. <i><b>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom</b></i> — Viz. the preaching of the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>And understandeth it not</b></i> — μη συνιεντος, perhaps more properly, <i>regardeth it not</i>, does not lay his heart to it.</p>
<p><i><b>The wicked one</b></i> — ο πονηρος, from πονος, <i>labour, toil</i>, he who distresses and torments the soul. Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:15">Mark 4:15</span>, calls him οσατανας, the <i>adversary</i> or <i>opposer</i>, because he <i>resists</i> men in all their purposes of amendment, and, to the utmost of his power <i>opposes</i>, in order to frustrate, the influences of Divine grace upon the heart. In the parallel place in Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:12">Luke 8:12</span>, he is called ο διαβολος, <i>the devil</i>, from διαβαλλειν, <i>to shoot</i>, or dart through. In allusion to this meaning of the name, St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>, speaks of <i>the fiery</i> DARTS <i>of the wicked one</i>. It is worthy of remark, that the <i>three</i> evangelists should use each a different appellative of this mortal enemy of mankind; probably to show that the devil, with all his <i>powers</i> and <i>properties</i>, opposes every thing that tends to the salvation of the soul.</p>
<p><i><b>Catcheth away</b></i> — Makes the utmost <i>haste</i> to pick up the good seed, lest it should take root in the heart.</p>
<p>A careless inattentive hearer is compared to the <i>way side</i>-his heart is an <i>open road</i>, where evil affections, and foolish and hurtful desires, continually <i>pass</i> and <i>repass</i>, without either <i>notice</i> or <i>restraint</i>. "A heart where Satan has" (as one terms it) "<i>ingress, egress, regress</i>, and <i>progress</i>: in a word, the devil's <i>thoroughfare</i>."</p>
