<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:2">Matthew 13:2</span>. <i><b>Into a ship</b></i> — το πλοιον, THE <i>vessel</i> or <i>boat</i>. Mr. Wakefield supposes (which is very likely) that a particular vessel is uniformly specified, which seems to have been kept on the lake for the use of Christ and his apostles: it probably belonged to some of the <i>fishermen</i>, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:22">Matthew 4:22</span>), who, he thinks, occasionally, at least, followed their former occupation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:3">John 21:3</span>.</p>
<p>The thought of pious <i>Quesnel</i> on this verse should not be neglected. We see here a representation of the Church, which consists of the people united to their pastors. <i>These</i>, being more exposed to violent tossings and storms, are, as it were, in a <i>ship</i>, while <i>those</i> continue at ease <i>on the shore</i>.</p>
