<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</span>. <i><b>He also that received seed among the thorns</b></i> — In land <i>ploughed</i>, but not properly <i>cleared</i> and <i>seeded</i>. <i>Is he </i>- represents that person <i>who heareth the word, but the cares</i>, rather <i>the anxiety</i>, η μεριμνα, the whole system of anxious carking cares. Lexicographers derive the word μεριμνα from μεριζειν τον νουν, <i>dividing</i>, or <i>distracting the mind</i>. Thus a poet, </p>
<p><i><b>Choke the word</b></i> — Or, <i>together choke the word</i>, συμπνιγει meaning, either that these <i>grow up together</i> with the word, overtop, and choke it; or that these <i>united</i> together, viz. carking worldly cares, with the delusive hopes and promises of riches, cause the man to abandon the great concerns of his soul, and seek, in their place, what he shall <i>eat, drink</i>, and wherewithal he shall be <i>clothed</i>. Dreadful stupidity of man, thus to barter spiritual for temporal good-a heavenly inheritance for an earthly portion! The seed of the kingdom can never produce much fruit in any heart, till the thorns and thistles of vicious affections and impure desires be plucked up by the roots and burned. The Persic translator renders it [Persic] <i>asle kalme-ra khube kund, chokes</i> <i>the root of the word</i>: for it appears the seed had taken <i>root</i>, and that these cares, &amp;c., choked it in the <i>root</i>, before even the <i>blade</i> could show itself.</p>
