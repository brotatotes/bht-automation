<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:23">Matthew 13:23</span>. <i><b>Good ground</b></i> — That which had <i>depth of mould</i>, was <i>well</i> <i>ploughed</i>, and <i>well weeded</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Is he that heareth</b></i> — Who diligently attends the ministry of the <i>word</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And understandeth it</b></i> — Lays the subject to heart, deeply weighing its <i>nature, design</i>, and <i>importance</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which also beareth fruit</b></i> — His fruitfulness being an almost necessary consequence of his thus laying the Divine message to heart. Let it be observed, that to <i>hear</i>, to <i>understand</i>, and to <i>bring forth fruit</i>, are the <i>three</i> grand evidences of a genuine believer. He who does not <i>hear</i> the word of wisdom cannot <i>understand</i> what makes for his peace; and he who does not <i>understand</i> what the Gospel requires him to <i>be</i> and to <i>perform</i>, cannot bring <i>forth fruit</i>; and he who is not <i>fruitful, very</i> <i>fruitful</i>, cannot be a <i>disciple</i> of Christ - see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:8">John 15:8</span>; and he who is not Christ's <i>disciple</i> cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>From the different portions of fruit produced by the good ground, a <i>hundred, sixty</i>, and <i>thirty</i>, we may learn that all sound believers are not equally fruitful; all hear, understand, and bring forth fruit, but not in the same degrees-occasioned, partly, by their situation and circumstances not allowing them such extensive opportunities of receiving and doing good; and, partly, by lack of mental capacity-for every mind is not equally improvable.</p>
<p>Let it be farther observed that the unfruitfulness of the different lands was not owing to <i>bad seed</i> or an <i>unskilful</i> <i>sower </i>- the <i>same sower</i> sows the <i>same seed</i> in all, and with the same gracious design-but it is unfruitful in many because they are <i>careless, inattentive</i>, and <i>worldly-minded</i>.</p>
<p>But is not the ground naturally bad in every heart? Undoubtedly. And can any but God make it good? None. But it is your business, when you hear of the <i>justice</i> and <i>mercy</i> of God, to implore him to work in you that which is pleasing in his sight. No man shall be condemned because he did not change his own heart, but because he did not cry to God to change it, who gave him his Holy Spirit for this very purpose, and which he, by his worldly-mindedness and impiety, quenched. <i>Whoso hath ears to hear let him hear</i>: and may the Lord save the reader from an impenitent and unfruitful heart!</p>
