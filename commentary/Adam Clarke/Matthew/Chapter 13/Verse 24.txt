Verse Matthew 13:24. The kingdom of heaven — God's method of managing the affairs of the world, and the concerns of his Church.Is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field — In general, the world may be termed the field of God; and in particular, those who profess to believe in God through Christ are his field or farm; among whom God sows nothing but the pure unadulterated word of his truth.
