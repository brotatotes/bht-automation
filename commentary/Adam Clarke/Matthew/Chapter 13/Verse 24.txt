<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:24">Matthew 13:24</span>. <i><b>The kingdom of heaven</b></i> — God's method of managing the affairs of the world, and the concerns of his Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field</b></i> — In general, the world may be termed the field of God; and in particular, those who profess to believe in God through Christ are his field or farm; among whom God sows nothing but the pure unadulterated word of his truth.</p>
