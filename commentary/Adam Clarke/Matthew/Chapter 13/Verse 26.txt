<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:26">Matthew 13:26</span>. <i><b>When the blade was sprung up - then appeared the tares</b></i><b> </b><i><b>also.</b></i> â€” Satan has a shoot of iniquity for every shoot of grace; and, when God revives his work, Satan revives his also. No marvel, therefore, if we find scandals arising suddenly to discredit a work of grace, where God has begun to pour out his Spirit.</p>
