<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3">Matthew 13:3</span>. <i><b>He spake many things unto them in parables</b></i> — <i>Parable</i>, from παρα, <i>near</i>, and βαλλω, <i>I cast</i>, or <i>put</i>. A comparison or similitude, in which one thing is compared with another, especially spiritual things with natural, by which means these spiritual things are better understood, and make a deeper impression on an attentive mind. Or, a parable is a representation of any matter accommodated, in the way of similitude, to the <i>real subject</i>, in order to delineate it with the greater <i>force</i> and <i>perspicuity</i>. See more on this subject at the conclusion of this chapter. No scheme, says Dr. Lightfoot, of Jewish rhetoric was more familiarly used than that of parables; which, perhaps, creeping in from thence among the heathens, ended in fables.</p>
<p>It is said in the tract <i>Sotah</i>, chap. 9. "From the time that Rabbi Meri died, those that spake in parables ceased." Not that this figure of rhetoric perished in the nation from that time; but because he surpassed all others in these flowers, as the gloss there from the tract Sanhedrin speaks. "A third part of his discourses was tradition; a third part allegory; and a third part parable." The Jewish books every where abound with these figures, the nation inclining by a kind of natural genius to this kind of rhetoric. Their very religion might be called parabolical, folded up within the covering of ceremonies; and their oratory in their sermons was like to it. But is it not indeed a wonder, that they who were so much given to and delighted in parables, and so dexterous in unfolding them, should stick in the outward shell of ceremonies, and should not have brought out the parabolical and spiritual sense of them? Our Saviour, who always spoke with the common people, uses the same kind of speech, and very often the same preface which they used, <i>To what is it likened</i>? See <i>Lightfoot</i> in loco. Though we find the basis of many of our Lord's parables in the Jewish writings, yet not one of them comes through his hands without being astonishingly improved. In this respect also, <i>Surely never man spoke like this man</i>.</p>
<p>Under the parable of the <i>sower</i>, our Lord intimates,</p>
<p>1. That of all the multitudes then attending his ministry, few would bring forth fruit to perfection. And</p>
<p>2. That this would be a general case in preaching the Gospel among men.</p>
