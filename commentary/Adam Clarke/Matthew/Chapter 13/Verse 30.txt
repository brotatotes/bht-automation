<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Let both grow together</b></i> â€” Though every minister of God should separate from the Church of Christ every incorrigible sinner, yet he should proceed no farther: the man is not to be <i>persecuted</i> in his body or goods, because he is not sound in the faith - GOD <i>tolerates</i> him; so should <i>men</i>. False doctrines are against God - he alone is the judge and punisher of them-man has no right to interfere in this matter. They who burnt <i>Vanini</i> for <i>atheism</i> usurped the seat of judgment, and thus proved themselves to be not less a diabolical seed than the person they thus, without God's leave, hurried into eternity. MARY, Queen of England, of execrable memory, and the inquisitorial tormentors she employed, were all of this diabolical sowing.
