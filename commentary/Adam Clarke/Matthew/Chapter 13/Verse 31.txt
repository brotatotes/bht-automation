<p>Verse 31. <i><b>The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard</b></i><b> </b><i><b>seed</b></i> â€” This parable is a representation of the progress of the Gospel in the world; and of the growth of grace in the soul. That grace which leads the soul to the fulness of glory may begin, and often does, in a <i>single good desire </i>- a <i>wish</i> to escape <i>hell</i>, or a <i>desire</i> to <i>enjoy God</i> in <i>heaven</i>.</p>
