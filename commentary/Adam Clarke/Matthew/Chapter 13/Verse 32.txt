<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Which indeed is the least of all seeds</b></i> — That is, of all those seeds which produce plants, whose stems and branches, according to the saying of the botanists, are apt δενδριζειν, <i>arborescere</i>, to grow into a ligneous or <i>woody</i> substance.</p>
<p><i><b>Becometh a tree</b></i> — That is, it is not only the largest of plants which are produced from such small seeds, but partakes, in its <i>substance</i>, the close <i>woody texture</i>, especially in warm climates, where we are informed it grows to an almost incredible size. The Jerusalem Talmud, tract <i>Peah</i>. fol. 20, says, "There was a stalk of mustard in Sichin, from which sprang out three boughs; one of which, being broken off, served to cover the tent of a potter, and produced three cabes of mustard seed. Rabbi Simeon ben Chalapha said, A stalk of mustard seed was in my field, into which I was want to climb, as men are wont to climb into a fig tree." See Lightfoot and Schoettgen. This may appear to be extravagant; and it is probable that, in the case of the <i>three cabes of seed</i>, there is considerable exaggeration; but, if it had not been usual for this plant to grow to a very large size, such relations as these would not have appeared even in the Talmud; and the parable of our Lord sufficiently attests the fact. Some soils being more luxuriant than others, and the climate much warmer, raise the same plant to a size and perfection far beyond what a poorer soil, or a colder climate, can possibly do. Herodotus says, he has seen wheat and barley in the country about Babylon which carried a blade full four fingers-breadth: and that the <i>millet</i> and <i>sesamum</i> grew to an incredible size. I have myself seen a field of common cabbages, in one of the Norman isles, each of which was from <i>seven</i> to <i>nine</i> feet in height; and one in the garden of a friend, which grew beside an apple-tree, though the latitude of the place is only about 48 deg. 13 min. north, was <i>fifteen</i> feet high, the stem of which is yet remaining, (September, 1798.) These facts, and several others which might be added, confirm fully the possibility of what our Lord says of the <i>mustard-tree</i>, however incredible such things may appear to those who are acquainted only with the productions of northern regions and cold climates.</p>
