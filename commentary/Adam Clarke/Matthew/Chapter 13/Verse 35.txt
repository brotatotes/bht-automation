<p>Verse 35. <i><b>By the prophet</b></i> — As the quotation is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:2">Psalms 78:2</span>, which is attributed to <i>Asaph</i>, he must be the <i>prophet</i> who is meant in the text; and, indeed, he is expressly called a prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+25:2">1 Chronicles 25:2</span>. Several MSS. have ησαιου, <i>Isaiah</i>; but this is a manifest error. Jerome supposes that <i>Asaph</i> was first in the text, and that some ignorant transcriber, not knowing who this <i>Asaph</i> was, inserted the word <i>Isaiah</i>; and thus, by attempting to remove an <i>imaginary</i> error, made a <i>real</i> one.</p>
