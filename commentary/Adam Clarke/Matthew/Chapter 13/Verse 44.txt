<p>Verse 44. <i><b>The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a</b></i> <i>field</i>] θησαυρω κεκρυμμενω, <i>to a hidden treasure</i>. We are not to imagine that the <i>treasure</i> here mentioned, and to which the Gospel salvation is likened, means a <i>pot</i> or <i>chest</i> of money hidden in the field, but rather a gold or silver <i>mine</i>, which he who found out could not get at, or work, without turning up the field, and for this purpose he bought it. Mr. Wakefield's observation is very just: "There is no sense in the <i>purchase</i> of a field for a <i>pot</i> of <i>money</i>, which he might have carried away with him very <i>readily</i>, and as <i>honestly</i>, too, as by overreaching the owner by an unjust purchase."</p>
<p><i>He hideth </i>- i.e. <i>he kept secret</i>, told the discovery to no person, till he had bought the field. From this view of the subject, the translation of this verse, given above, will appear proper - a <i>hidden treasture</i>, when applied to a <i>rich mine</i>, is more proper than a <i>treasure hid</i>, which applies better to a <i>pot of money</i> deposited there, which I suppose was our translators' opinion; and <i>kept</i> <i>secret</i>, or <i>concealed</i>, will apply better to the subject of his discovery till he made the purchase, than <i>hideth</i>, for which there could be no occasion, when the pot was already <i>hidden</i>, and the place known only to himself.</p>
<p>Our Lord's meaning seems to be this: -</p>
<p><i>The kingdom of heaven </i>- the salvation provided by the Gospel - <i>is</i> <i>like a treasure</i>-something of inestimable worth - <i>hidden in a field</i>; it is a rich mine, the veins of which run in all directions in the sacred Scriptures; therefore, the <i>field</i> must be <i>dug up</i>, the records of salvation diligently and carefully turned over, and searched. <i>Which, when a man hath found </i>- when a sinner is convinced that the promise of life eternal is to him, <i>he kept secret </i>- pondered the matter deeply in his heart; he examines the preciousness of the treasure, and counts the cost of purchase; <i>for joy thereof </i>- finding that this salvation is just what his needy soul requires, and what will make him presently and eternally happy, <i>went and sold all</i> <i>that he had </i>- renounces his sins, abandons his evil companions, and relinquishes all hope of salvation through his own righteousness; <i>and purchased that field </i>- not merely bought the book for the sake of the salvation it described, but, by the blood of the covenant, buys gold tried in the fire, white raiment, c. in a word, pardon and purity, which he receives from God for the <i>sake</i> of Jesus. We should consider the salvation of God,</p>
<p>1. As our only <i>treasure</i>, and value it above all the riches in the world.</p>
<p>2. Search for it in the Scriptures, till we fully understand its worth and excellence.</p>
<p>3. Deeply ponder it in the secret of our souls.</p>
<p>4. Part with all we have in order to get it.</p>
<p>5. Place our whole joy and felicity in it; and</p>
<p>6. Be always convinced that it must be <i>bought</i>, and that no price is accepted for it but the blood of the covenant; the sufferings and death of our only Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
