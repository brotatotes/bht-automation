<p>Verse 47. <i><b>Is like unto a net</b></i> — <i>A drag-net</i>. This is the proper meaning of σαγηνη, which the Latins translate <i>verriculum</i>, a <i>sweep</i> <i>net; Quod in aquam jacitur ad pisces comprehendendos; imprimis,</i> <i>cujus usus est extrahendis iis a fundo</i>. MARTINIUS. "Which is cast into the water to catch fish, and the particular use of which is to <i>drag them up from the bottom</i>." As this is dragged along it keeps gathering all in its way, both good and bad, small and great; and, when it is brought to the shore, those which are proper for use are preserved, and those which are not are either destroyed or thrown back into the water.</p>
<p>By the <i>net</i> may be understood the preaching of the Gospel of the kingdom, which keeps drawing men into the profession of Christianity, and into the fellowship of the visible Church of Christ. By the <i>sea</i> may be represented that <i>abyss</i> of sin, error, ignorance, and wickedness in which men live, and out of which they are drawn, by the truth and Spirit of God, who cordially close in with the offers of salvation made to them in the preaching of the Gospel.</p>
<p>By <i>drawing to shore</i>, may be represented the consummation of all things, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:49">Matthew 13:49</span>, when a proper distinction shall be made between those who served God, and those who served him not; for many shall doubtless be found who shall bear the name without the <i>nature</i> of Christ. By <i>picking out the good, and throwing away the</i> <i>bad</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:48">Matthew 13:48</span>, is meant that separation which God shall make between false and true professors, casting the former into hell, and bringing the latter to heaven.</p>
<p>Instead of τα καλα <i>the good</i>, the Cod. Bezae, and five copies of the old <i>Antehieronymian</i>, or <i>Itala</i> version, read τα καλλιστα, <i>the best</i>, the <i>very best</i>. Every reader would naturally hope that this is not the <i>true</i> reading, or that it is not to be understood <i>literally</i>, as it seems to intimate that only the <i>very best</i> shall be at last <i>saved</i>.</p>
<p>It is probable that this parable also refers, in its primary meaning, to the Jewish state, and that, when Christ should come to judge and destroy them by the Roman power, the genuine followers of Christ only should escape, and the rest be overwhelmed by the general destruction. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>, &amp;c.</p>
