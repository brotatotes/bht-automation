<p>Verse 52. <i><b>Every scribe</b></i> â€” Minister of Christ: <i>who is</i> <i>instructed </i>- taught of God; <i>in the kingdom of heaven </i>- in the mysteries of the Gospel of Christ: <i>out of his treasury </i>- his granary or store-house; <i>things new and old </i>- a Jewish phrase for <i>great</i> <i>plenty</i>. A small degree of knowledge is not sufficient for a preacher of the Gospel. The sacred writings should be his <i>treasure</i>, and he should properly understand them. His knowledge does not consist in being furnished with a great variety of human learning, (though of this he should acquire as much as he can;) but his knowledge consists in being <i>well instructed</i> in the things concerning the kingdom of heaven, and the art of conducting men thither. Again, it is not enough for a man to have these advantages in possession: he must <i>bring them forth</i>, and distribute them abroad. A good pastor will not, like a <i>miser</i>, keep these things to himself to please his fancy; nor, like a <i>merchant</i>, traffic with them, to enrich himself; but, like a bountiful <i>father</i> or <i>householder</i>, distribute them with a <i>liberal</i> through <i>judicious</i> hand, for the comfort and support of the whole heavenly family.</p>
<p>A preacher whose mind is well stored with Divine truths, and who has a sound judgment, will suit his discourses to the circumstances and states of his hearers. He who preaches the <i>same</i> sermon to <i>every</i> congregation, gives the fullest proof that, however well he may speak, he is not a <i>scribe</i> who is <i>instructed in</i> <i>the kingdom of heaven</i>. Some have thought that <i>old and new things</i> here, which imply the produce of the <i>past</i> and the produce of the <i>present</i> year, may also refer to the <i>old</i> and <i>new</i> covenants-a proper knowledge of the <i>Old Testament</i> Scriptures, and of the doctrines of Christ as contained in the <i>New</i>. No man can properly understand the Old Testament but through the medium of the <i>New</i>, nor can the <i>New</i> be so forcibly or successfully applied to the conscience of a sinner as through the medium of the <i>Old</i>. The <i>law</i> is still a schoolmaster to lead men to Christ-by it is the <i>knowledge</i> of sin, and, without it, there can be no <i>conviction</i>- where it <i>ends</i>, the Gospel <i>begins</i>, as by the Gospel alone is <i>salvation</i> from sin. See the whole of the comment on the Pentateuch.</p>
