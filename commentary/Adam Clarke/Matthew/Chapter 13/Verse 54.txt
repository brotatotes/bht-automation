<p>Verse 54. <i><b>And when he was come into his own country</b></i> — Probably <i>Nazareth</i>, where his parents lived, and where he had continued till his thirtieth year, though it appears he had a lodging in Peter's house at <i>Capernaum</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>They were astonished</b></i> — It appears, hence, that our blessed Lord had lived in obscurity all the time above specified; for his countrymen appear not to have heard his doctrines, nor seen his miracles, until now. It is a melancholy truth, that those who should know Christ best are often the most ignorant of himself, the doctrines of his word, and the operations of his Spirit.</p>
