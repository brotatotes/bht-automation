<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span>. <i><b>Is not this the carpenter's son?</b></i> â€” Seven copies of the old <i>Itala</i> have, <i>Is not this the son of</i> JOSEPH <i>the carpenter</i>? But it is likely our Lord, during the thirty years of his abode at Nazareth, wrought at the same trade with Joseph; and perhaps this is what is intended, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:51">Luke 2:51</span>. <i>He went down with them</i> (his parents) <i>to Nazareth, and was</i> SUBJECT <i>unto them</i>. An honest trade is no discredit to any man. He who spends his time in idleness is fit for any business in which the devil chooses to employ him.</p>
<p><i><b>Is not his mother - Mary, and his brethren, James</b></i>, c.] This insulting question seems to intimate that our Lord's family was a very <i>obscure one</i> and that they were of small <i>repute</i> among their neighbours, except for their <i>piety</i>.</p>
<p>It is <i>possible</i> that <i>brethren</i> and <i>sisters</i> may mean here <i>near</i> <i>relations</i>, as the words are used among the Hebrews in this latitude of meaning; but I confess it does not appear to me likely. Why should the children of <i>another</i> family be brought in here to share a reproach which it is evident was designed for <i>Joseph</i> the <i>carpenter</i>, <i>Mary</i> his wife, <i>Jesus</i> their son, and their <i>other children</i>? Prejudice apart, would not any person of plain common sense suppose, from this account, that these were the <i>children</i> of Joseph and Mary, and the <i>brothers</i> and <i>sisters</i> of our Lord, <i>according to the flesh</i>? It seems odd that this should be doubted; but, through an unaccountable prejudice, <i>Papists</i> and <i>Protestants</i> are determined to maintain as a doctrine, that on which the Scriptures are totally silent, viz. the <i>perpetual</i> <i>virginity</i> of the mother of our Lord. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:25">Matthew 1:25</span>.</p>
