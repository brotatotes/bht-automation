<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:57">Matthew 13:57</span>. <i><b>And they were offended in him.</b></i> — They took offence at him, εσκανδαλιζοντο εν αυτω, making the meanness of his family the reason why they would not receive him as a prophet, though they were astonished at his wisdom, and at his miracles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:54">Matthew 13:54</span>. So their <i>pride</i> and their <i>envy</i> were the causes of their destruction.</p>
<p><i><b>A prophet is not without honour</b></i> — This seems to have been a proverbial mode of speech, generally true, but not without some exceptions. The apparent meanness of our Lord was one pretence why they rejected him; and yet, <i>God</i> manifested <i>in the flesh, humbling</i> himself to the <i>condition</i> of a <i>servant</i>, and to the <i>death</i> of the <i>cross</i>, is the <i>only foundation</i> for the salvation of a lost world. Perhaps our Lord means, by prophet, in this place, himself alone, as if he had said, My ministry is more generally reputed, and my doctrine better received, in any other part of the land than in my own country, among my own relatives; because, knowing the obscurity of my birth, they can scarcely suppose that I have these things from heaven.</p>
