<p><i><b>Some a hundred-fold.</b></i> — For the elucidation of this text, I beg leave to introduce the following experiment. In 1816 I sowed, for a third crop, a field with oats, at Millbrook, in Lancashire the grains weighed, on an average, 3/4 of a grain each. One grain produced <i>three stalks</i> with <i>three ears</i>: the largest had 68 <i>grains</i> in it, the second 26, and the third 25. </p>
<p>The power of grain to multiply itself, even in the same year, is a subject as much of curiosity and astonishment as of importance and general utility. For the farther elucidation of this text, I shall give the following example from a practice in agriculture, or rural economy, which is termed <i>filtering</i>.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of June, 1766, Mr. C. Miller, of Cambridge, sowed some grains of the common, <i>red wheat</i>; and on the 8th of August a single plant was taken up, and separated into 18 parts, and each planted separately: these plants having pushed out several <i>side</i> <i>shoots</i>, about the middle of September some of them were taken up and divided; and the rest between that time and October. This second division produced 67 plants. These plants remained through the winter, and another division of them, made between the middle of March and the 12th of April, produced 500 plants. They were divided no farther, but permitted to remain in the field. These plants were in general stronger than any of the wheat in the field. Some of them produced upwards of 100 ears from a single root and many of the ears measured <i>seven inches</i> in length, and contained between <i>sixty</i> and <i>seventy</i> grains. The whole number of ears produced from the single plant was 21,109, which yielded <i>three</i> pecks and <i>three-quarters</i> of clear corn, weighing 47lbs. 7oz., and, from a calculation made by counting the grains in an ounce, the whole number of grains was about 576,840. Mr. Miller thinks that, had he made a <i>second</i> division in the <i>spring</i>, the number of plants would have amounted to 2000. Who can help admiring the wisdom and providence of God in this single grain of corn! He has, in some sort, impressed on it an idea of his own infinity; and an idea which, like the subject to which it refers, confounds our imagination and reason. How infinitely <i>great</i> is God, even in his <i>minor</i> works.</p>
