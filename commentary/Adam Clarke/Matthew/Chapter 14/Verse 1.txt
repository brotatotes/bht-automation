<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1">Matthew 14:1</span>. <i><b>Herod the tetrarch</b></i> â€” This was Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span></span>, where an account is given of the Herod family. The word <i>tetrarch</i> properly signifies a person who rules over the <i>fourth part</i> of a country; but it is taken in a more general sense by the Jewish writers, meaning sometimes a <i>governor</i> simply, or a <i>king</i>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:9">Matthew 14:9</span>. The estates of Herod the Great were not, at his death, divided into <i>four</i> tetrarchies, but only into <i>three</i>: one was given by the Emperor <i>Augustus</i> to <i>Archelaus</i>; the second to <i>Herod Antipas</i>, the person in the text; and the third to <i>Philip</i>: all three, sons of <i>Herod the Great</i>.</p>
