<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:12">Matthew 14:12</span>. <i><b>His disciples came, and took up the</b></i><b> BODY</b>] The HEAD was in the possession of <i>Herodias</i>, who, 'tis probable, took a diabolic pleasure in viewing that speechless mouth which had often been the cause of planting thorns in her criminal bed; and in offering indignities to that <i>tongue</i> from which she could no longer dread a reproof.

How many on such occasions have sacrificed their chastity, and then, to hide their shame, have stifled the feelings of the human being and the parent, and, by direct or indirect means, have put a period to the innocent offspring of their connections! Unhappy mother, who exposes her daughter to the same shipwreck herself has suffered, and makes her own child the instrument of her lust and revenge!

Fix your eyes on that <i>vicious mother</i>, that <i>prostituted daughter</i>, and especially on that <i>murdered ambassador of God</i>, and then send your children to genteel boarding-schools, to learn the <i>accomplishment</i> of DANCING! where the fear of God makes no part of the education.</p>
