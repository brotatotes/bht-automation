Verse Matthew 14:14. Jesus-was moved with compassion — εσπλαγχνισθε, he was moved with tender compassion, so I think the word should in general be translated: Matthew 9:36; Matthew 9:36. As a verb, it does not appear to have been used by any but ecclesiastical writers. It always intimates that motion of the bowels, accompanied with extreme tenderness and concern, which is felt at the sight of the miseries of another.
