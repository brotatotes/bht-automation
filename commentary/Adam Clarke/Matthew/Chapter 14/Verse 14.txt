<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:14">Matthew 14:14</span>. <i><b>Jesus-was moved with compassion</b></i> — εσπλαγχνισθε, he was moved with <i>tender compassion</i>, so I think the word should in general be translated: <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:36">Matthew 9:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:36">Matthew 9:36</span></span>. As a <i>verb</i>, it does not appear to have been used by any but <i>ecclesiastical</i> writers. It always intimates <i>that motion of the</i> <i>bowels, accompanied with extreme tenderness and concern, which is</i> <i>felt at the sight of the miseries of another</i>.</p>
