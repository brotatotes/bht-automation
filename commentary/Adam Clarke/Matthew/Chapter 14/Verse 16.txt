<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:16">Matthew 14:16</span>. <i><b>They need not depart</b></i> — He that seeks first the kingdom of heaven is sure to have every temporal requisite. When a man ensures the first, God always takes care to throw the other into the bargain. He who has an interest in Jesus has in him an inexhaustible treasure of spiritual and temporal good. Though the means by which man may help his fellows have failed, we are not to suppose that the bounty of God is exhausted. When we are about to give up all hope of farther supply, the gracious word of Christ still holds good - <i>They need not depart; give ye them to eat</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Give ye them to eat.</b></i> — Should we say, Lord, how shall thy poor, feeble ministering servants feed so many hungry souls as attend thy word! Begin at the command of Jesus - make the attempt - divide what you have-and the bread of God shall be multiplied in your hands, and all shall eat and be satisfied.</p>
