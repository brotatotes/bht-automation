<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:17">Matthew 14:17</span>. <i><b>We have here but five loaves and two fishes.</b></i> â€” When we are deeply conscious of our own necessities, we shall be led to depend on Jesus with a firmer faith. God often permits his servants to be brought <i>low</i>, that they may have repeated opportunities of proving the kindness and mercy of their gracious Lord and Master.</p>
