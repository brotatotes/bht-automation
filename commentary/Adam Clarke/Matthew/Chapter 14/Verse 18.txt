<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:18">Matthew 14:18</span>. <i><b>Bring them hither to me.</b></i> â€” No creature of God should be considered as good or safe without the blessing of God in it. If thou have but even a handful of meal and a few herbs, bring them to Christ by prayer and faith, and he will make them a <i>sufficiency</i> for thy <i>body</i>, and a <i>sacrament</i> to thy <i>soul</i>. Let the minister of the Gospel attend also to this-let him bring all his <i>gifts</i> and <i>graces</i> to his Maker - let him ever know that his word can be of no use, unless the blessing of Christ be in it.</p>
