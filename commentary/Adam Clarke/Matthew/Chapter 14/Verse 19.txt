<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19">Matthew 14:19</span>. <i><b>And took the five loaves</b></i>, c.] This was the act of the father of a family among the Jews-his business it was to take the bread into his hands, and render thanks to God, before any of the family was permitted to taste of it.</p>
<p><i><b>Looking up to heaven</b></i> — To teach us to acknowledge GOD as the Supreme Good, and fountain of all excellence.</p>
<p><i><b>He blessed</b></i> — The word <i>God</i> should, I think, be rather inserted here than the word <i>them</i>, because it does not appear that it was the <i>loaves</i> which Christ blessed, but <i>that</i> God who had provided them and this indeed was the Jewish custom, not to bless the food, but the God who gave it. However, there are others who believe the <i>loaves</i> are meant, and that he blessed <i>them</i> in order to multiply them. The Jewish form of <i>blessing</i>, or what we term <i>grace</i>, before and after meat, was as follows:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>of the fruit of the vine!</i> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p><i><b>And brake</b></i> — We read often in the Scriptures of <i>breaking</i> bread, never of <i>cutting</i> it: because the Jews made their bread broad and thin like cakes, and to divide such, being very <i>brittle</i>, there was no need of a knife.</p>
