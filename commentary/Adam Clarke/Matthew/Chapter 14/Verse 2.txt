<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:2">Matthew 14:2</span>. <i><b>This is John the Baptist</b></i> — ον εγω απεκεφαλισα, <i>Whom</i> <i>I beheaded</i>. These words are added here by the Codex Bezae and several others, by the Saxon, and five copies of the Itala. - See the power of conscience! He is miserable because he is guilty; being continually under the dominion of self-accusation, reproach, and remorse. No need for the Baptist now: <i>conscience</i> performs the office of ten thousand accusers! But, to complete the misery, a guilty conscience offers no relief from God - points out no salvation from sin.</p>
<p><i><b>He is risen from the dead</b></i> — From this we may observe:</p>
<p>1. That the <i>resurrection</i> of the dead was a common opinion among the Jews; and</p>
<p>2. That the <i>materiality</i> of the soul made no part of Herod's creed.</p>
<p>Bad and profligate as he was, it was not deemed by him a thing impossible with God to raise the dead; and the spirit of the murdered Baptist had a permanent resurrection in his guilty conscience.</p>
