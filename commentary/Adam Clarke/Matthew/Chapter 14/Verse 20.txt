<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:20">Matthew 14:20</span>. <i><b>They did all eat, and were filled</b></i> — Little or much is the same in the hands of Jesus Christ. Here was an incontestable miracle - <i>five thousand</i> men, besides women and children, fed with <i>five cakes</i> and <i>two fishes</i>! Here must have been a manifest <i>creation</i> of <i>substance </i>- the parts of the bread were not dilated to make them appear large, nor was there any delusion in the eating-for they all <i>ate</i>, and were all <i>filled</i>. Here then is one miracle of our Lord attested by at least <i>five thousand persons</i>! But did not this creation of bread prove the unlimited power of Jesus? Undoubtedly: and nothing less than eternal power and Godhead could have effected it.</p>
<p><i><b>They took up - twelve baskets</b></i> — It was customary for many of the Jews to carry a basket with them at all times: and Mr. Wakefield's conjecture here is very reasonable: - "By the number here particularized, it should seem that each apostle filled <i>his own</i> <i>bread basket</i>." Some think that the Jews carried baskets in commemoration of their Egyptian bondage, when they were accustomed to carry the clay and stubble to make the bricks, in a basket that was hung about their necks. This seems to be what Sidonius Apollinaris refers to in the following words, Epist. vii. 6. <i>Ordinis res est, ut, (dum in allegorica versamur AEgypto) Pharao</i> <i>incedat cum diademate, Israelita cum</i> COPHINO.</p>
<p>These words of <i>Alcimus Avitus</i>, lib. v. 30, are to the same effect:- </p>
<p>After <i>five thousand</i> were fed, <i>twelve times</i> as much, at least, remained, as the whole multitude at first sat down to! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:16">Luke 9:16</span>.</p>
