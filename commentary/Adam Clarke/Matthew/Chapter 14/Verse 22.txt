Verse Matthew 14:22. Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship — Either they were afraid to return into the jurisdiction of Herod, or they were unwilling to embark without their Lord and Protector, and would not enter their boat till Christ had commanded them to embark.From this verse it appears that Christ gave some advices to the multitudes after the departure of his disciples, which he did not wish them to hear.Unto the other side — Towards Capernaum, Matthew 14:34.John 6:16-17, or Bethsaida, see on Mark 6:45.
