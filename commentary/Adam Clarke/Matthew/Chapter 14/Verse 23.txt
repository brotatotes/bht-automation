<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:23">Matthew 14:23</span>. <i><b>He went up into a mountain apart, to pray</b></i> â€” He whom God has employed in a work of mercy had need to return, by prayer, as speedily, to his Maker, as he can, lest he should be tempted to value himself on account of that in which he has no merit-for the good that is done upon earth, the Lord doth it alone. Some make this part of our Lord's conduct emblematic of the spirit and practice of prayer, and observe that the proper dispositions and circumstances for praying well are:</p>
<p>1. <i>Retirement</i> from the world.</p>
<p>2. <i>Elevation</i> of the heart to God.</p>
<p>3. <i>Solitude</i>.</p>
<p>4. The <i>silence</i> and <i>quiet</i> of the night.</p>
<p>It Is certain that in this also Christ has left us an example that we should follow his steps. Retirement from the world is often a means of animating, supporting, and spiritualizing prayer. Other <i>society</i> should be shut out, when a soul comes to converse with God.</p>
