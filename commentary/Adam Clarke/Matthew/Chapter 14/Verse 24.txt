<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:24">Matthew 14:24</span>. <i><b>Tossed with waves</b></i> — <i>Grievously agitated</i>. This is the proper meaning of the word βασανιζομενον: but one MS. reads βαπτιζομενον, <i>plunged</i> under the waves, frequently covered with them; the waves often breaking over the vessel.</p>
