<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:25">Matthew 14:25</span>. <i><b>The fourth watch</b></i> — Anciently the Jews divided the night into <i>three</i> watches, consisting of <i>four</i> hours each. The <i>first</i> watch is mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="la+2:19">Lamentations 2:19</span>: the <i>second</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+7:19">Judges 7:19</span>; and the <i>third</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:24">Exodus 14:24</span>; but a <i>fourth</i> watch is not mentioned in any part of the OLD Testament. This division the Romans had introduced in Judea, as also the custom of dividing the day into <i>twelve</i> hours: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:9">John 11:9</span>. The <i>first watch</i> began at <i>six</i> o'clock in the evening, and continued till <i>nine</i>; the <i>second</i> began at <i>nine</i>, and continued till <i>twelve;</i> the <i>third</i> began at <i>twelve</i>, and continued till <i>three</i> next morning; and the <i>fourth</i> began at <i>three</i>, and continued till <i>six</i>. It was therefore between the hours of <i>three</i> and <i>six</i> in the <i>morning</i> that Jesus made his appearance to his disciples.</p>
<p><i><b>Walking on the sea.</b></i> — Thus suspending the laws of gravitation was a proper manifestation of unlimited power. Jesus did this by his own power; therefore Jesus showed forth his Godhead. In this one miracle we may discover <i>three</i>:-</p>
<p>1. Though at a distance from his disciples, he <i>knew</i> their distress.</p>
<p>2. He found them out on the lake, and probably in the midst of darkness.</p>
<p>3. He <i>walked</i> upon the water.</p>
<p>Job, speaking of those things whereby the omnipotence of God was demonstrated, says particularly, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+9:8">Job 9:8</span>, <i>He walketh upon the waves of the sea</i>: intimating that this was impossible to any thing but <i>Omnipotence</i>.</p>
