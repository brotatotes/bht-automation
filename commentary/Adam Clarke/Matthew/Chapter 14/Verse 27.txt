<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:27">Matthew 14:27</span>. <i><b>It is I; be not afraid</b></i> â€” Nothing but this voice of Christ could, in such circumstances, have given courage and comfort to his disciples: those who are grievously tossed with difficulties and temptations require a similar manifestation of his power and goodness. When he proclaims himself in the soul, all sorrow, and fear, and sin are at an end.</p>
