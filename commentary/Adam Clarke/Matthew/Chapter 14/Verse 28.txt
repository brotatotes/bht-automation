<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:28">Matthew 14:28</span>. <i><b>Bid me come unto thee on the water.</b></i> â€” A weak faith is always wishing for signs and miracles. To <i>take Christ at his</i> <i>word</i>, argues not only the perfection of faith, but also the highest exercise of sound reason. He is to be credited on his <i>own</i> <i>word</i>, because he is the TRUTH, and therefore can neither <i>lie</i> nor <i>deceive</i>.</p>
