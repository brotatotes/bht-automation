<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Peter - walked on the water</b></i> â€” However impossible the thing commanded by Christ may appear, it is certain he will give power to accomplish it to those who receive his word by faith; but we must take care never to put Christ's power to the proof for the gratification of a vain curiosity; or even for the strengthening of our faith, when the <i>ordinary</i> means for doing that are within our reach.</p>
