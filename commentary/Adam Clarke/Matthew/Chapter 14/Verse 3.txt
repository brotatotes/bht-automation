<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3">Matthew 14:3</span>. <i><b>For Herodias' sake</b></i> â€” This infamous woman was the daughter of <i>Aristobulus</i> and <i>Bernice</i>, and grand-daughter of Herod the Great. Her first marriage was with Herod Philip, her <i>uncle</i>, by whom she had <i>Salome</i>: some time after, she left her husband, and lived publicly with Herod Antipas, her brother-in-law, who had been before married to the daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia Petraea. As soon as Aretas understood that Herod had determined to put away his daughter, he prepared to make war on him: the two armies met, and that of Herod was cut to pieces by the Arabians; and this, Josephus says, was supposed to be a judgment of God on him for the murder of John the Baptist. See the account in Josephus, Antiq. lib. xviii. c. 7.</p>
