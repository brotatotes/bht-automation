<p>Verse 30. <i><b>When he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid</b></i> â€” It was by faith in the power of Christ he was upheld; when that faith failed, by which the laws of gravitation were suspended, no wonder that those laws returned to their wonted action, and that he began to sink. It was not the violence of the winds, nor the raging of the waves, which endangered his life, but his <i>littleness of faith</i>.</p>
