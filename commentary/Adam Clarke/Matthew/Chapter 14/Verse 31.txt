<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Jesus stretched forth his hand</b></i> â€” Every moment we stand in need of Christ: while we <i>stand</i>-we are upheld by his power only; and when we are <i>falling</i>, or have <i>fallen</i>, we can be saved only by his mercy. Let us always take care that we do not consider so much the danger to which we are exposed, as the power of Christ by which we are to be upheld; and then our mountain is likely to stand strong.</p>
