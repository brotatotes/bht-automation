<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:33">Matthew 14:33</span>. <i><b>Thou art the Son of God.</b></i> — It is probable that these words were spoken either by the <i>sailors</i> or <i>passengers</i>, and not by the <i>disciples</i>. Critics have remarked that, when this phrase is used to denominate the MESSIAH, both the articles are used, ε υιος του Θεου, and that the words without the articles mean, in the common Jewish phrase, <i>a Divine person</i>. It would have been a strange thing indeed, if the disciples, after all the miracles they had seen Jesus work - after their having left all to follow him, c., were only now persuaded that he was the promised <i>Messiah</i>. That they had not as yet <i>clear</i> conceptions concerning his <i>kingdom</i>, is evident enough but that they had any doubts concerning his being the <i>promised Messiah</i> is far from being clear.</p>
