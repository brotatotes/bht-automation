<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:35">Matthew 14:35</span>. <i><b>The men of that place had knowledge of him</b></i> — i.e. <i>They knew him again</i>. They had already seen his miracles; and now they collect all the diseased people they can find, that <i>he</i> may have the same opportunity of showing forth his marvellous power, and <i>they</i> of being the instruments of relieving their friends and neighbours.</p>
<p><i><b>They brought unto him all that were diseased</b></i> — And Jesus received and healed every man and woman of them. And is not the soul, in the sight of God, of more value than the body? and will he withhold his healing power from the former, and grant it so freely to the latter? This cannot be. Let a man come himself to Jesus, and he shall be saved and afterwards let him recommend this Christ to the whole circle of his acquaintance, and they, if they come, shall also find mercy.</p>
