<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:36">Matthew 14:36</span>. <i><b>That they might only touch the hem of his garment</b></i> â€” What mighty influence must the grace and Spirit of Christ have in the soul, when even the <i>border</i> or <i>hem of his garment</i> produced such wonders in the bodies of those who touched it! Here is a man who has turned from sin to God through Christ, and the healing hand of Jesus is laid upon him. Then, no wonder that he knows and feels his sins forgiven, his soul purified, and his heart filled with the fulness of his Maker. Lord, increase our faith! and we shall see greater manifestations of thy power and glory! Amen.</p>
