<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:5">Matthew 14:5</span>. <i><b>He feared the multitude</b></i> â€” Miserable prince! who fears more to offend his people, than to sin against his God, by shedding innocent blood. When a man resists sin only by the help of human motives, he cannot long defend himself.</p>
