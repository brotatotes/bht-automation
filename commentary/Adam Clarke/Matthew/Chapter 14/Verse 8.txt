<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:8">Matthew 14:8</span>. <i><b>Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.</b></i> â€” The word charger formerly signified a large dish, bowl, or drinking cup: the Saxon has [Anglo-Saxon], a <i>dish</i>, Tindal, a <i>platter</i>; any thing is better than <i>charger</i>, which never conveyed much meaning, and now conveys none. The evangelist says she was instructed before, by her mother, to ask the Baptist's head! What a most infernal mother, to give such instructions to her child! and what a promising daughter to receive them! What a <i>present</i> for a young lady!-the bloody head of the murdered forerunner of Jesus! and what a gratification for an adulterous wife, and incestuous mother! The disturber of her illicit pleasures, and the troubler of her <i>brother-husband's</i> conscience, is no more! Short, however, was their glorying! <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3">Matthew 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3">Matthew 14:3</span></span>.</p>
