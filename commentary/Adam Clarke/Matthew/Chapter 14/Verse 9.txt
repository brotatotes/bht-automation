Verse Matthew 14:9. The king was sorry — He knew John to be a righteous man, and at first did many things gladly which John told him it was his duty to perform: Mark 6:20.Nevertheless, for the oath's sake — The OATHS, ορκους - he had probably sworn again and again-one sin begets many.And them which sat with him at meat — Who were probably such as himself, and would have considered it a breach of honour if he had not fulfilled his sworn promise: he therefore commanded it to be given!
