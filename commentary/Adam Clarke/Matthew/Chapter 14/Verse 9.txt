<p><i><b>Nevertheless, for the oath's sake</b></i> — <i>The</i> OATHS, ορκους - he had probably sworn again and again-one sin begets many.</p>
<p><i><b>And them which sat with him at meat</b></i> — Who were probably such as himself, and would have considered it a breach of <i>honour</i> if he had not fulfilled his sworn promise: <i>he therefore commanded it to be</i> <i>given</i>!</p>
