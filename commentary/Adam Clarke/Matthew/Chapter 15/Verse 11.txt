<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:11">Matthew 15:11</span>. <i><b>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth</b></i> — This is an answer to the carping question of the Pharisees, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:2">Matthew 15:2</span>, <i>Why do thy disciples eat with unwashed hands</i>? To which our Lord here replies, <i>That what goes into the mouth defiles not the man</i>; i.e. that if, in eating with unwashed hands, any particles of dust, c., cleaving to the hands, might happen to be taken into the mouth with the food, this did not <i>defile</i>, did not constitute a man <i>a sinner</i> for it is on this alone the question hinges: <i>thy</i> <i>disciples eat with unwashed hands</i>; therefore they are <i>sinners</i>; for they transgress the tradition of the elders, i.e. the <i>oral law</i>, which they considered equal in authority to the <i>written law</i>; and, indeed, often preferred the former to the latter, so as to make it of <i>none effect</i>, totally to destroy its nature and design, as we have often seen in the preceding notes.</p>
<p><i><b>That which cometh out of the mouth</b></i> — That is, what springs from a corrupt unregenerate heart - a perverse will and impure passions- <i>these defile</i>, i.e. make him a sinner.</p>
