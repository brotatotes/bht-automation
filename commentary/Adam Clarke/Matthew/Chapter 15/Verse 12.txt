<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:12">Matthew 15:12</span>. <i><b>The Pharisees were offended</b></i> â€” None so liable to take offence as <i>formalists</i> and <i>hypocrites</i>, when you attempt to take away the false props from the one, and question the sincerity of the other. Besides, a Pharisee must never be suspected of <i>ignorance</i>, for they are the men, and wisdom must die with them!</p>
