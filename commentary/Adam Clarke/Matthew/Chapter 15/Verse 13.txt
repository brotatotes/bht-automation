<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:13">Matthew 15:13</span>. <i><b>Every plant</b></i> — <i>Every plantation</i>. So I render φυτεια, and so it is translated in the <i>Itala</i> version which accompanies the Greek text in the <i>Codex Bezae, omnis plantatio</i>, and so the word is rendered by Suidas. This gives a different turn to the text. The Pharisees, as a <i>religious body</i>, were <i>now</i> a <i>plantation</i> of trees, which God did not plant, water, nor own: therefore, they should be rooted up, not left to <i>wither and die</i>, but the <i>fellers</i>, and those who <i>root up</i>, (the Roman armies,) should come against and destroy them, and the Christian Church was to be planted in their place. Since the general dispersion of the Jews, this <i>sect</i>, I believe, has ceased to exist as a separate body, among the descendants of Jacob. The first of the apostolical constitutions begins thus: Θεου φυτεια η καθολικη εκκλησια, και αμπελων αυτου εκλεκτος. The Catholic Church is the <i>plantation</i> of God, and his chosen <i>vineyard</i>.</p>
