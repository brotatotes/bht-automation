<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:14">Matthew 15:14</span>. <i><b>Let them alone</b></i> — αφετε αυτους, <i>give them up</i>, or <i>leave them</i>. These words have been sadly misunderstood. Some have quoted them to prove that blind and deceitful teachers should not be pointed out to the people, nor the people warned against them; and that men should abide in the communion of a corrupt Church, because that Church had once been the Church of God, and in it they had been brought up; and to prove this they bring Scripture, for, in our present translation, the words are rendered, <i>let them alone</i>: but the whole connection of the place evidently proves that our blessed Lord meant, <i>give them up</i>, have no kind of religious connection with them, and the strong reason for which he immediately adds, because they are <i>blind leaders</i>. This passage does not at all mean that blind leaders should not be pointed out to the people, that they may avoid being deceived by them; for this our Lord does frequently, and warns his disciples, and the people in general, against all such false teachers as the scribes and Pharisees were; and though he bids men <i>do that they</i> <i>heard those say, while they sat in the chair of Moses</i>, yet he certainly meant no more than that they should be observant of the moral law when read to them out of the sacred book: yet neither does he tell them to <i>do all</i> these false teachers said; for he testifies in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:6">Matthew 15:6</span>, that they had put such false glosses on the law, that, if followed, would endanger the salvation of their souls. The Codex Bezae, for αφετε αυτους, has αφετε τους τυφλους, <i>give up these blind men</i>. Amen! A literal attention to these words of our Lord produced the <i>Reformation</i>.</p>
<p>Probably the words may be understood as a sort of proverbial expression for - <i>Don't mind them: pay no regard to them</i>. - "They are altogether unworthy of notice."</p>
<p><i><b>And if the blind lead the blind</b></i> — This was so self-evident a case that an apter parallel could nut be found - <i>if the blind lead</i> <i>the blind, both must fall into the ditch</i>. Alas, for the blind teachers, who not only destroy their own souls, but those also of their flocks! Like priest, like people. If the minister be ignorant, he cannot teach what he does not know; and the people cannot become wise unto salvation under such a ministry - he is ignorant and wicked, and they are profligate. They who even wish such God speed; are partakers of their evil deeds. But shall not the poor deceived people escape? No: both shall fall into the pit of perdition together; for they should have searched the Scriptures, and not trusted to the ignorant sayings of corrupt men, no matter of what sect or party. He who has the Bible in his hand, or within his reach, and can read it, has no excuse.</p>
