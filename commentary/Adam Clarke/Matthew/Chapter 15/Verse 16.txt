<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:16">Matthew 15:16</span>. <i><b>Are ye also yet without understanding?</b></i> — The word ακμη, which we translate <i>yet</i>, should be here rendered <i>still</i>: Are ye still void of understanding? and the word is used in this sense by several Greek writers. The authorities which have induced me to prefer this translation may be seen in <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
