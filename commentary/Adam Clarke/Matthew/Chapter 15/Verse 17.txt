<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:17">Matthew 15:17</span>. <i><b>Cast out into the draught</b></i> — εις αφεδωνα, [Anglo-Saxon]. <i>And beeth into the forthgoing a sent </i>- what is not fit for nourishment is evacuated; is thrown into the sink. This I believe to be the <i>meaning</i> of this difficult and variously translated word, αφεδρων. Diodati translates it properly, <i>nella</i> <i>latrina, into the privy</i>. And the Persian translator has given a good paraphrase, and appears to have collected the general meaning [Persian] <i>her teche der dehen ander ayeed, az nusheeb beeroon</i> <i>rood, we ber zemeen aftad</i>: "Whatsoever enters into the mouth goes downward, and falls upon the ground." Michaelis, and his annotator, Dr. Marsh, have been much perplexed with this perplexing passage. See <i>Michaelis's Introduction</i>, vol. i. note 35. p. 458.</p>
