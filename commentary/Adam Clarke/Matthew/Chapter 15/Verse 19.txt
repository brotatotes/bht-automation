<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:19">Matthew 15:19</span>. <i><b>Out of the heart</b></i> — In the heart of an unregenerate man, the <i>principles</i> and <i>seeds</i> of all sin are found. And iniquity is always conceived in the heart before it be <i>spoken</i> or <i>acted</i>. Is there any hope that a man <i>can</i> abstain from <i>outward</i> sin till his <i>heart</i>, that abominable fountain of corruption, be thoroughly cleansed? <i>I trow not</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Evil thoughts</b></i> — διαλογισμοι πονηροι, wicked dialogues - for in all evil surmisings the heart holds a conversation, or dialogue, with itself. For φονοι, <i>murders</i>, two MSS. have φθονοι, <i>envyings</i>, and three others have both. <i>Envy</i> and <i>murder</i> are nearly allied: the <i>former</i> has often led to the <i>latter</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Blasphemies</b></i> — I have already observed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:3">Matthew 9:3</span>, that the verb βλασφημεω, when applied to men, signifies <i>to speak</i> INJURIOUSLY <i>of their persons, characters</i>, &amp;c., and, when applied to God, it means to <i>speak</i> IMPIOUSLY <i>of his nature, works</i>, &amp;c.</p>
