<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:2">Matthew 15:2</span>. <i><b>Elders</b></i> — Rulers and magistrates among the Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>For they wash not their hands</b></i> — What frivolous nonsense! These Pharisees had nothing which their malice could fasten on in the conduct or doctrine of our blessed Lord and his disciples, and therefore they must dispute about washing of hands! All sorts of Pharisees are troublesome people in religious society; and the reason is, they take more pleasure in blaming others than in amending themselves.</p>
<p><i><b>The tradition of the elders</b></i> — The word παραδοσις, <i>tradition</i>, has occupied a most distinguished place, both in the Jewish and Christian Church. Man is ever fond of mending the work of his Maker; and hence he has been led to put his finishing hand even to Divine revelation! This supplementary matter has been called παραδοσις, from παραδιδομαι, <i>to deliver from hand to hand - to</i> <i>transmit</i>; and hence the Latin term, <i>tradition</i>, from <i>trado</i>, to <i>deliver</i>, especially <i>from one to another; - to hand down</i>. Among the Jews TRADITION signifies what is also called the <i>oral</i> law, which they distinguish from the <i>written</i> law: this last contains the Mosaic precepts, as found in the Pentateuch: the former, the traditions of the elders, i.e. traditions, or doctrines, that had been successively handed down from Moses through every generation, but not committed to <i>writing</i>. The Jews feign that, when GOD gave <i>Moses</i> the <i>written</i> law, he gave him also the oral law, which is the interpretation of the former. This law, Moses at first delivered to Aaron then to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar; and, after these to the seventy-two elders, who were six of the most eminent men chosen out of each of the twelve tribes. These seventy-two, with Moses and Aaron, delivered it again to all the heads of the people, and afterwards to the congregation at large. They say also that, before Moses died, he delivered this oral law, or system of traditions, to JOSHUA, and <i>Joshua</i> to the ELDERS which succeeded him-THEY to the <i>Prophets</i>, and the PROPHETS to each other, till it came to JEREMIAH, who delivered it to BARUCH his scribe, who repeated it to EZRA, who delivered it to the <i>men</i> of the <i>great synagogue</i>, the last of whom was SIMON <i>the Just</i>. By <i>Simon</i> the <i>Just</i> it was delivered to ANTIGONUS of <i>Socho</i>; by <i>him</i> to JOSE the son of <i>Jochanan</i>; by him to JOSE, the son of <i>Joezer</i>; by him to NATHAN the <i>Arbelite</i>, and <i>Joshua</i> the son of <i>Perachiah</i>; and by them to JUDAH the son of <i>Tabbai</i>, and Simeon, the son of Shatah; and by them to SHEMAIAH and ABTALION; and by them to HILLEL; and by <i>Hillel</i> to SIMEON his son, the same who took Christ in his arms when brought to the temple to be presented to the Lord: by SIMEON it was delivered to GAMALIEL his son, the preceptor of St. Paul, who delivered it to SIMEON his son, and he to <i>Rab</i>. JUDAH HAKKODESH his son, who compiled and digested it into the book which is called the MISHNA; to explain which the two <i>Talmuds</i>, called the <i>Jerusalem</i> and <i>Babylyonish</i> Talmuds, were compiled, which are also called the <i>Gemera</i> or complement, because by these the <i>oral law</i> or <i>Mishnah</i> is fully explained. The <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i> was completed about A. D. 300; and the <i>Babylonish Talmud</i> about the beginning of the sixth century. This Talmud was printed at Amsterdam in 12 vols. folio. These contain the whole of the <i>traditions of the</i> <i>elders</i>, and have so explained, or rather frittered away, the words of God, that our Lord might well say, <i>Ye have made the word of God</i> <i>of no effect by your traditions</i>. In what estimation these are held by the Jews, the following examples will prove: "The words of the scribes are lovely beyond the words of the law: for the words of the law are <i>weighty</i> and <i>light</i>, but the words of the scribes are <i>all</i> weighty." <i>Hierus. Berac</i>. fol. 3.</p>
<p>"He that shall say, There are no <i>phylacteries</i>, though he thus transgress the words of the law, he is not guilty; but he that shall say, There are <i>five</i> Totaphot, thus adding to the words of the scribes, he is guilty."</p>
<p>"A <i>prophet</i> and an <i>elder</i>, to what are they likened! To a king sending two of his servants into a province; of one he writes thus: Unless he show you my seal, believe him not; for thus it is written of the prophet: <i>He shall show thee a sign</i>; but of the elders thus: <i>According to the law which they shall teach thee, for</i> <i>I will confirm their words</i>." - See <i>Prideaux. Con</i>. vol. ii. p. 465, and <i>Lightfoot's</i> Hor. Talmud.</p>
<p><i><b>They wash not their hands</b></i> — On washing of hands, before and after meat, the Jews laid great stress: they considered eating with unwashed hands to be no ordinary crime; and therefore, to induce men to do it, they feigned that an evil spirit, called <i>Shibta</i> שיבתא, who sits on the hands by night, has a right to sit on the food of him who eats without washing his hands, and make it hurtful to him! They consider the person who undervalues this rite to be no better than a heathen, and consequently excommunicate him. See many examples of this doctrine in Schoettgen and Lightfoot.</p>
