<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:20">Matthew 15:20</span>. <i><b>These - defile a man</b></i> â€” Our Lord's argument is very plain. What goes into the mouth descends into the stomach and other intestines; - part is retained for the nourishment of the body, and part is ejected, as being improper to afford nourishment. Nothing of this kind defiles the soul, because it does not enter into it; but the evil principles that are in it, producing evil thoughts, murders, &amp;c., these defile the soul, because they have their seat and operation in it.</p>
