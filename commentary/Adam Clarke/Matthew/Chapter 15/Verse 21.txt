<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:21">Matthew 15:21</span>. <i><b>Departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</b></i> — εις τα μερη, <i>towards</i> the coasts or confines. It is not clear that our Lord ever left the land of the Hebrews; he was, as the apostle observes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>, <i>the minister of the circumcision according to the truth of God</i>. Tyre and Sidon are usually joined together, principally because they are but a few miles distant from each other.</p>
