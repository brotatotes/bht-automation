Verse Matthew 15:22. A woman of Canaan — Matthew gives her this name because of the people from whom she sprung-the descendants of Canaan, Judges 1:31-32; but Mark calls her a Syrophenician, because of the country where she dwelt. The Canaanites and Phoenicians have been often confounded. This is frequently the case in the Septuagint. Compare Genesis 46:10, with Exodus 6:15, where the same person is called a Phoenician in the one place, and a Canaanite in the other. See also the same version in Exodus 16:35; Joshua 5:12.The state of this woman is a proper emblem of the state of a sinner, deeply conscious of the misery of his soul.Have mercy an me, c.] How proper is this prayer for a penitent!
