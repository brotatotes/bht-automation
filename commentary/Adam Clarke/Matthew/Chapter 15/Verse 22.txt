<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:22">Matthew 15:22</span>. <i><b>A woman of Canaan</b></i> — Matthew gives her this name because of the <i>people</i> from whom she sprung-the descendants of Canaan, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:31-32">Judges 1:31-32</span>; but Mark calls her a <i>Syrophenician</i>, because of the <i>country</i> where she dwelt. The <i>Canaanites</i> and <i>Phoenicians</i> have been often confounded. This is frequently the case in the Septuagint. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:10">Genesis 46:10</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:15">Exodus 6:15</span>, where the same person is called a <i>Phoenician</i> in the one place, and a <i>Canaanite</i> in the other. See also the same version in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:35">Exodus 16:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+5:12">Joshua 5:12</span>.</p>
