<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:24">Matthew 15:24</span>. <i><b>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep</b></i> â€” By the Divine appointment, I am come to preach the Gospel to the Jews only. There are certain preachers who should learn a lesson of important instruction from this part of our Lord's conduct. As soon as they hear of a lost sheep being found by <i>other ministers</i>, they give all diligence to get that one into <i>their</i> fold: but display little earnestness in seeking in the wilderness for those that are lost. This conduct, perhaps, proceeds from a consciousness of their inability to perform the work of an evangelist; and leads them to sit down in the labours of others, rather than submit to the reproach of presiding over empty chapels. Such persons should either <i>dig</i> or <i>beg</i> immediately, as they are a reproach to the pastoral office; for, not being sent of God, they cannot profit the people.</p>
<p>The wilderness of this world is sufficiently wide and uncultivated. Sinners abound every where; and there is ample room for all truly religious people, who have zeal for God, and love for their perishing follow creatures, to put forth all their strength, employ all their time, and exercise all their talents, in proclaiming the Gospel of God; not only to the <i>lost sheep of</i> <i>the house of Israel</i>, but to a <i>lost</i> WORLD. Nor can such exertions be unsuccessful. There the pure truth of God is preached, <i>many</i> will be converted. Where that truth is preached, though with a mixture of error, <i>some</i> will be converted, for God will bless his own truth. But where nothing but <i>false doctrine</i> is preached, no soul is converted: for God will never sanction error by a miracle of his mercy.</p>
