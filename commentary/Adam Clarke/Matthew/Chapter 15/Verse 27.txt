<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:27">Matthew 15:27</span>. <i><b>Truth, Lord</b></i> — ναικυριε, <i>Yes, Lord</i>. This appears to be not so much an assent, as a bold reply to our Lord's reason for apparently rejecting her suit.</p>
<p>The little dogs share with the children, for they eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. I do not desire what is provided for these highly favoured children, only what they <i>leave</i>: a single exertion of thy almighty power, in the healing of my afflicted daughter, is all that I wish for; and this the highly favoured Jews can well spare, without lessening the provision made for themselves. Is not this the sense of this noble woman's reply?</p>
