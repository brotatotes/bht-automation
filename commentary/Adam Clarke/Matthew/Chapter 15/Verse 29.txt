Verse 29. Went up into a mountain — το ορος, THE mountain. "Meaning," says Wakefield, "some particular mountain which he was accustomed to frequent; for, whenever it is spoken of at a time when Jesus is in Galilee, it is always discriminated by the article. Compare Matthew 4:18, with Matthew 5:1; and Matthew 13:54, with Matthew 14:23; and Matthew 28:16. I suppose it was mount Tabor."
