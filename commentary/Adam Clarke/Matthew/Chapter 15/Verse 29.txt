"Meaning," says Wakefield, "some <i>particular</i> mountain which he was accustomed to frequent; for, whenever it is spoken of at a time when Jesus is in <i>Galilee</i>, it is always discriminated by the <i>article</i>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:54">Matthew 13:54</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:23">Matthew 14:23</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16">Matthew 28:16</span>. I suppose it was mount <i>Tabor</i>."</p>
