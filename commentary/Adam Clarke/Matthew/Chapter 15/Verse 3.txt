<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:3">Matthew 15:3</span>. <i><b>Why do ye - transgress the commandment</b></i> â€” Ye accuse my disciples of transgressing the <i>traditions</i> of the <i>elders </i>- I accuse you of transgressing the <i>commands</i> of God, and that too in favour of your own tradition; thus preferring the inventions of men to the positive precepts of God. Pretenders to zeal often prefer superstitious usages to the Divine law, and human inventions to the positive duties of Christianity.</p>
