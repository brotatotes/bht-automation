<p>Verse 30. <b>Those that were - </b><i><b>maimed</b></i> — κυλλους. Wetstein has fully proved that those who had lost a hand, foot, c., were termed κυλλοι by the Greeks. Kypke has shown, from <i>Hippocrates</i>, that the word was also used to signify those who had distorted or dislocated legs, knees, hands, c. Mr. Wakefield is fully of opinion that it means here those who <i>had lost a limb</i>, and brings an incontestable proof from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:8">Matthew 18:8</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:43">Mark 9:43</span>. "If thy hand cause thee to offend, CUT IT OFF it is better for thee to enter into life (κυλλος) WITHOUT A LIMB, than, having thy TWO hands, to go away into hell." What an astonishing manifestation of <i>omnific</i> and <i>creative</i> energy must the <i>reproduction</i> of a hand, foot, c., be at the <i>word</i> or <i>touch</i> of Jesus! As this was a mere act of <i>creative</i> power, like that of multiplying the bread, those who allow that the above is the meaning of the word will hardly attempt to doubt the proper Divinity of Christ. <i>Creation</i>, in any sense of the word, i.e. causing something to exist that had no existence before, can belong only to God, because it is an effect of an unlimited power to say that such power could be delegated to a person is to say that the person to whom it is delegated becomes, for the time being, the <i>omnipotent God</i>; and that God, who has thus clothed a creature with his omnipotence, ceases to be omnipotent himself; for there cannot be <i>two omnipotents</i>, nor can the Supreme Being <i>delegate</i> his omnipotence to another, and <i>have it</i> at the <i>same</i> <i>time</i>. I confess, then, that this is to <i>me</i> an unanswerable argument for the Divinity of our blessed Lord. Others may <i>doubt</i>; I can't help <i>believing</i>.</p>
