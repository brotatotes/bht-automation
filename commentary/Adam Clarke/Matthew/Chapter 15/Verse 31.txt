<p>Verse 31. <i><b>The multitude wondered</b></i> â€” And well they might, when they had such proofs of the miraculous power and love of God before their eyes. Blessed be God! the same miracles are continued in their <i>spiritual</i> reference. All the disorders of the soul are still cured by the power of Jesus.</p>
