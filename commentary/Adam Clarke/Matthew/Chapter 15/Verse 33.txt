<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Whence should we have so much bread in the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>wilderness</b></i><b>, &amp;c.</b>] Human <i>foresight</i>, even in the followers of Christ, is very short. In a thousand instances, if we supply not its deficiency by <i>faith</i>, we shall be always embarrassed, and often miserable. This world is a <i>desert</i>, where nothing can be found to satisfy the soul of man, but the salvation which Christ has procured.</p>
