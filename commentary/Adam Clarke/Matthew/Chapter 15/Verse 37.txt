<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:37">Matthew 15:37</span>. <i><b>They did all eat, and were filled</b></i> — εχορτασθησαν - <i>they</i> <i>were satisfied</i>. The husks of worldly pleasures may <i>fill</i> the man, but cannot <i>satisfy</i> the soul. A man may eat, and not be satisfied: it is the interest therefore of every follower of Christ to follow him till he be <i>fed</i>, and to feed on him till he be <i>satisfied</i>.</p>
