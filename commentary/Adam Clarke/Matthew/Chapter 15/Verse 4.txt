<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:4">Matthew 15:4</span>. <i><b>Honour thy father and mother</b></i> â€” This word was taken in great latitude of meaning among the Jews: it not only meant <i>respect</i> and <i>submission</i>, but also <i>to take care of a person, to</i> <i>nourish and support him, to enrich</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:17">Numbers 22:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:17">Judges 13:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>. And that this was the sense of the law, as it respected parents, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+27:16">Deuteronomy 27:16</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:12">Exodus 20:12</span>.</p>
