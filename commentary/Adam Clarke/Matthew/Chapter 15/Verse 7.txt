<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:7">Matthew 15:7</span>. <i><b>Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you</b></i> â€” In every place where the proper names of the Old Testament occur, in the New, the same mode of orthography should be followed: I therefore write <i>Isaiah</i> with the Hebrew, not <i>Esaias</i>, with the Greek. This prophecy is found <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:13">Isaiah 29:13</span>. Our blessed Lord unmasks these hypocrites; and we may observe that, when a hypocrite is found out, he should be exposed to all; this may lead to his salvation: if he be permitted to retain his falsely acquired character, how can he escape perdition!</p>
