<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:8">Matthew 15:8</span>. <i><b>Their heart is far from me.</b></i> — The true worship of God consists in the <i>union</i> of the heart to him - where this exists not, a particle of the spirit of devotion cannot be found.</p>
<p><i><b>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth</b></i> — This clause, which is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:13">Isaiah 29:13</span>, is omitted by several excellent MSS., and by several versions and fathers. Erasmus, Mill, Drusius, and Bengel, approve of the omission, and Griesbach has left it out of the text; but as I find it in the prophet, the place from which it is quoted, I dare not omit it, howsoever respectable the above authorities may appear.</p>
