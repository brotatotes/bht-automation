<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>. <i><b>The Pharisees also with the Sadducees</b></i> — Though a short account of these has been already given in a note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>, yet, as one more detailed may be judged necessary, I think it proper to introduce it in this place.</p>
<p>The PHARISEES were the most considerable sect among the Jews, for they had not only the scribes, and all the learned men of the law of their party, but they also drew after them the bulk of the people. When this sect arose is uncertain. Josephus, Antiq. lib. v. c. xiii. s. 9, speaks of them as existing about 144 years before the Christian era. They had their appellation of <i>Pharisees</i>, from פרש <i>parash, to separate</i>, and were probably, in their rise, the most holy people among the Jews, having <i>separated</i> themselves from the national corruption, with a design to restore and practice the pure worship of the most High. That they were greatly <i>degenerated</i> in our Lord's time is sufficiently evident; but still we may learn, from their external purity and exactness, that their principles in the beginning were holy. Our Lord testifies that they had cleansed the <i>outside</i> of the cup and the platter, but within they were full of abomination. They still kept up the <i>outward</i> regulations of the <i>institution</i>, but they had utterly lost its <i>spirit</i>; and hypocrisy was the only substitute now in their power for that <i>spirit of piety</i> which I suppose, and not unreasonably, characterized the origin of this sect.</p>
<p>As to their religious opinions, they still continued to credit the being of a God; they received the <i>five books of Moses</i>, the writings of the <i>prophets</i>, and the <i>hagiographa</i>. The <i>hagiographa</i> or <i>holy writings</i>, from αγιος <i>holy</i>, and γραφω <i>I write</i>, included the twelve following books - Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles. These, among the Jews, occupied a middle place between the <i>law</i> and the <i>prophets</i>, as divinely inspired. The Pharisees believed, in a confused way, in the resurrection, though they received the Pythagorean doctrine of the <i>metempsychosis</i>, or transmigration of souls. Those, however, who were notoriously wicked, they consigned, on their death, immediately to hell, without the benefit of transmigration, or the hope of future redemption. They held also the predestinarian doctrine of necessity, and the government of the world by <i>fate</i>; and yet, inconsistently, allowed some degree of liberty to the human will. See <i>Prideaux</i>.</p>
<p>The SADDUCEES had their origin and name from one <i>Sadoc</i>, a disciple of <i>Antigonus</i> of <i>Socho</i>, president of the Sanhedrin, and teacher of the <i>law</i> in one of the great divinity schools in Jerusalem, about 264 years before the incarnation.</p>
<p>This <i>Antigonus</i> having often in his lectures informed his scholars, that they should not serve God through expectation of a <i>reward</i>, but through <i>love</i> and <i>filial</i> reverence only, <i>Sadoc</i> inferred from this teaching that there were neither rewards nor punishments after this life, and, by consequence, that there was no resurrection of the dead, nor angel, nor spirit, in the invisible world; and that man is to be rewarded or punished <i>here</i> for the good or evil he does.</p>
<p>They received only the five books of Moses, and rejected all unwritten traditions. From every account we have of this sect, it plainly appears they were a kind of mongrel deists, and professed <i>materialists</i>. See Prideaux, and the authors he quotes, Connex. vol. iii. p. 95, and 471, c., and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>.</p>
<p>In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>, we shall meet with a third sect, called HERODIANS, of whom a few words may be spoken here, It is allowed on all hands that these did not exist before the time of <i>Herod</i> the <i>Great</i>, who died only three years after the incarnation of our Lord. What the opinions of these were is not agreed among the learned. Many of the primitive fathers believed that their distinguishing doctrine was, that they held Herod to be the <i>Messiah</i> but it is not likely that such an opinion could prevail in our Saviour's time, <i>thirty</i> years <i>after</i> Herod's <i>death</i>, when not one characteristic of Messiahship had appeared in him during his life. Others suppose that they were Herod's <i>courtiers</i>, who flattered the passions of their master, and, being endowed with a <i>convenient</i> conscience, changed with the <i>times</i>; but, as <i>Herod</i> was now dead upwards of thirty years, such a sect could not exist in reference to <i>him</i>; and yet all allow that they derived their origin from <i>Herod</i> the <i>Great</i>.</p>
<p>Our Lord says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span>, that they had the <i>leaven of Herod</i>, i.e. a bad doctrine, which they received from him. What this was may be easily discovered:</p>
<p>1. Herod subjected himself and his people to the dominion of the Romans, in opposition to that law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+17:15">Deuteronomy 17:15</span>, <i>Thou shalt not set a king over thee - which is not thy brother</i>, i.e. one out of the twelve tribes.</p>
<p>2. He built temples, sat up images, and joined in heathenish worship, though he professed the Jewish religion; and this was in opposition to all the law and the prophets.</p>
<p>From this we may learn that the <i>Herodians</i> were such as, first, held it lawful to transfer the Divine government to a heathen ruler; and, secondly, to conform occasionally to heathenish rites in their religious worship. In short, they appear to have been persons who <i>trimmed</i> between God and the world - who endeavoured to reconcile his service with that of mammon - and who were religious just as far as it tended to secure their secular interests. It is probable that this sect was at last so blended with, that it became lost in, the sect of the Sadducees; for the persons who art called Herodians, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span>, are styled <i>Sadducees</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span>. See <i>Prideaux</i>, Con. vol. iii. p. 516, c., and <i>Josephus</i>, Antiq. b. xv. c. viii. s. i. and x. s. iii. But it is very likely that the Herodians, mentioned c. xxii. 10, were <i>courtiers</i> or <i>servants</i> of Herod king of Galilee. See the note there.</p>
<p><i><b>Show them a sign</b></i> — These sects, however opposed among themselves, most cordially unite in their opposition to Christ and his truth. That the kingdom of Satan may not fall, all his subjects must fight against the doctrine and maxims of the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Tempting - him</b></i> — Feigning a desire to have his doctrine fully proved to them, that they might credit it, and become his disciples but having no other design than to betray and ruin him.</p>
