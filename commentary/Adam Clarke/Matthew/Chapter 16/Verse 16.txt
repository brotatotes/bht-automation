<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span>. <i><b>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</b></i> — Every word here is emphatic - a most <i>concise</i>, and yet <i>comprehensive</i>, confession of faith.</p>
<p><i>The Christ</i>, or <i>Messiah</i>, points out his divinity, and shows his <i>office; the Son </i>- designates his person: on this account it is that both are joined together so frequently in the new covenant. <i>Of</i> <i>the living God</i> Του Θεου, του ζωντος, literally, of God the Living One. The C. Bezae has for του ζωντος <i>the Living One</i>, του σωζοντος, <i>the Saviour</i>, and the <i>Cant. Dei Salvatoris</i>, of God the Saviour.</p>
<p><i>Living</i>-a character applied to the Supreme Being, not only to distinguish him from the <i>dead</i> idols of paganism, but also to point him out as the source of life, <i>present, spiritual</i>, and <i>eternal</i>. Probably there is an allusion here to the great name יהוה <i>Yeve</i>, or <i>Yehovah</i>, which properly signifies <i>being</i> or <i>existence</i>.</p>
