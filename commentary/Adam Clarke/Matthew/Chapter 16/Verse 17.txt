<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>. <i><b>Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona</b></i> â€” Or <i>Simon, son of</i> <i>Jonah</i>; so <i>Bar-jonah</i> should be translated, and so it is rendered by our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>. <i>Flesh and blood </i>- i.e. MAN; - <i>no human being</i> hath revealed this; and though the text is literal enough, yet every body should know that this is a Hebrew <i>periphrasis</i> for <i>man</i>; and the literal translation of it here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>, has misled thousands, who suppose that <i>flesh and blood</i> signify <i>carnal reason</i>, as it is termed, or the <i>unregenerate principle</i> in man. Is it not evident, from our Lord's observation, that it requires an express revelation of God in a man's soul, to give him a saving acquaintance with Jesus Christ; and that not even the miracles of our Lord, wrought before the eyes, will effect this? The <i>darkness</i> must be removed from the heart by the Holy Spirit, before a man can become wise unto salvation.</p>
