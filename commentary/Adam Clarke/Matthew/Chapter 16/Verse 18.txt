<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>. <i><b>Thou art Peter</b></i> — This was the same as if he had said, <i>I acknowledge thee for one of my disciples</i>-for this name was given him by our Lord when he first called him to the apostleship. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>.</p>
<p><i>Peter</i>, πετρος, signifies a stone, or fragment of a <i>rock</i>; and our Lord, whose constant custom it was to rise to <i>heavenly</i> things through the medium of <i>earthly</i>, takes occasion from the name, the <i>metaphorical</i> meaning of which was <i>strength</i> and <i>stability</i>, to point out the solidity of the confession, and the <i>stability</i> of that cause which should be founded on THE CHRIST, <i>the</i> SON <i>of the</i> LIVING GOD. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:62">Luke 9:62</span>.</p>
<p><i>Upon this very rock</i>, επι ταυτη τη πετρα - this true confession of thine - that I am THE MESSIAH, that am come to reveal and communicate THE LIVING GOD, that the <i>dead, lost</i> world may be saved - upon this very rock, myself, thus confessed (alluding probably to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>, <i>The</i> STONE <i>which the builders rejected is become the</i> HEAD-STONE <i>of</i> <i>the</i> CORNER: and to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, <i>Behold I lay a</i> STONE <i>in Zion for a</i> FOUNDATION) - will I build my Church, μον την εκκλησιαν, <i>my assembly</i>, or <i>congregation</i>, i.e. of persons who are made partakers of this precious <i>faith</i>. That <i>Peter</i> is not designed in our Lord's words must be evident to all who are not blinded by prejudice. Peter was only <i>one</i> of the builders in this sacred edifice, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span> who himself tells us, (with the rest of the believers,) was built on this living foundation stone: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4-5">1 Peter 2:4-5</span>, therefore Jesus Christ did not say, <i>on thee, Peter</i>, will I build my Church, but <i>changes</i> immediately the expression, and says, <i>upon that very rock</i>, επι ταυτη τη πετρα, to show that he neither addressed <i>Peter</i>, nor any other of the <i>apostles</i>. So, the supremacy of Peter, and the infallibility of the Church of Rome, must be sought in some other scripture, for they certainly are not to be found in this. On the meaning of the word <i>Church</i>, see at the conclusion of this chapter.</p>
<p><i>The gates of hell</i>, πυλαι αδου i. e, the <i>machinations</i> and <i>powers</i> of the invisible world. In ancient times the gates of fortified cities were used to hold councils in, and were usually places of great strength. Our Lord's expression means, that neither the <i>plots, stratagems</i>, nor <i>strength</i> of Satan and his angels, should ever so far prevail as to destroy the sacred truths in the above confession. Sometimes the <i>gates</i> are taken for the <i>troops</i> which issue out from them: we may firmly believe, that though hell should open her gates, and vomit out her devil and all his angels, to fight against Christ and his saints, ruin and discomfiture must be the consequence on their part; as the arm of the Omnipotent <i>must</i> prevail.</p>
