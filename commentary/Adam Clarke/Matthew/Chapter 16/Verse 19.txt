<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>. <i><b>The keys of the kingdom</b></i> — By the <i>kingdom of heaven</i>, we may consider the true Church, that house of God, to be meant; and by the <i>keys</i>, the power of admitting into that house, or of preventing any improper person from coming in. In other words, the doctrine of salvation, and the full declaration of the way in which God will save sinners; and who they are that shall be finally excluded from heaven; and on what account. When the Jews made a man a <i>doctor</i> of the <i>law</i>, they put into his hand the key of the closet in the temple where the sacred books were kept, and also tablets to write upon; signifying, by this, that they gave him authority to teach, and to explain the Scriptures to the people. - <i>Martin</i>. This prophetic declaration of our Lord was literally fulfilled to Peter, as he was made the <i>first</i> instrument of <i>opening</i>, i.e. preaching the doctrines of the kingdom of heaven to the <i>Jews</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:41">Acts 2:41</span>; and to the <i>Gentiles</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44-47">Acts 10:44-47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth</b></i> — This mode of expression was frequent among the Jews: they considered that every thing that was done upon earth, according to the order of God, was at the same time done in heaven: hence they were accustomed to say, that when the priest, on the day of atonement, offered the two goats upon earth, the same were offered in heaven. As one goat therefore is permitted to escape on earth, one is permitted to escape in heaven; and when the priests cast the lots on earth, the priest also casts the lots in heaven. See <i>Sohar. Lev</i>. fol. 26; and see Lightfoot and Schoettgen. These words will receive considerable light from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+13:3">Leviticus 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+13:23">Leviticus 13:23</span>: <i>The priest shall look upon him</i> (the leper) <i>and pronounce him</i> <i>unclean</i>. Hebrew וטמא אתו vetime otho, <i>he shall pollute him</i>, i.e. shall declare him polluted, from the evidences mentioned before. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+13:23">Leviticus 13:23</span>: The priest shall pronounce him clean, וטהרו הכה <i>vetiharo hacohen</i>, the priest shall cleanse him, i.e. <i>declare he is clean</i>, from the evidences mentioned in the verse. In the one case the priest <i>declared</i> the person infected with the leprosy, and <i>unfit</i> for <i>civil society</i>; and, in the other, that the suspected person was <i>clean</i>, and might safely associate with his fellows in civil or religious assemblies. The disciples of our Lord, from having the <i>keys</i>, i.e. the true knowledge of the doctrine of the kingdom of heaven, should be able at all times to distinguish between the clean and the unclean, and pronounce infallible judgment; and this <i>binding</i> and <i>loosing</i>, or pronouncing <i>fit</i> or <i>unfit</i> for <i>fellowship</i> with the <i>members</i> of Christ, being always according to the doctrine of the Gospel of God, should be considered as proceeding immediately from heaven, and consequently as <i>Divinely ratified</i>.</p>
<p>That <i>binding</i> and <i>loosing</i> were terms in frequent use among the Jews, and that they meant <i>bidding</i> and <i>forbidding, granting</i> and <i>refusing</i>, declaring <i>lawful</i> or <i>unlawful</i>, c., Dr. Lightfoot, after having given <i>numerous instances</i>, thus concludes: -</p>
<p>"To these may be added, if need were, the frequent (shall I say?) or infinite use of the phrases, אסור ומותר <i>bound</i> and <i>loosed,</i> which we meet with <i>thousands</i> of times over. But from these allegations the reader sees, abundantly enough, both the <i>frequency</i> and the common use of this phrase, and the <i>sense</i> of it also namely, first, that it is used in <i>doctrine</i>, and in <i>judgments</i>, concerning things <i>allowed</i> or <i>not allowed</i> in the law. Secondly, that <i>to bind</i> is the same with, <i>to forbid</i>, or to <i>declare forbidden.</i> To think that <i>Christ</i>, when he used the common phrase, was not understood by his hearers in the <i>common</i> and <i>vulgar sense</i>, shall I call it a matter of laughter, or of madness?</p>
<p>To this, therefore, do these words amount: When the time was come wherein the <i>Mosaic</i> law, as to some part of it, was to be abolished, and left off, and, as to another part of it, was to be continued and to last for ever, he granted <i>Peter</i> here, and to the rest of the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span>, a power to <i>abolish</i> or <i>confirm</i> what they thought good, and as they thought good; being taught this, and led by the Holy Spirit: as if he should say, Whatsoever ye shall <i>bind</i> in the law of Moses, that is, <i>forbid</i>, it shall be <i>forbidden</i>, the Divine authority confirming it; and whatsoever ye shall <i>loose</i>, that is, <i>permit</i>, or shall <i>teach</i> that it is <i>permitted</i> and <i>lawful</i>, shall be <i>lawful</i> and <i>permitted.</i> Hence they <i>bound</i>, that is <i>forbade</i>, circumcision to the believers; eating of things offered to idols, of things strangled, and of blood, for a time, to the <i>Gentiles</i>; and that which they <i>bound on</i> <i>earth</i> was <i>confirmed in heaven</i>. They <i>loosed</i>, that is, allowed purification to <i>Paul</i>, and to four other <i>brethren</i>, for the shunning of scandal; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span> and, in a word, by these words of <i>Christ</i> it was committed to them, the Holy Spirit directing, that they should make decrees concerning religion, as to the use or rejection of <i>Mosaic</i> rites and judgments, and that either for a time, or for ever.</p>
<p>"Let the words be applied by way of paraphrase to the matter that was transacted at present with Peter: 'I am about to build a <i>Gentile</i> Church,' saith <i>Christ</i>, and to thee, O Peter, do I give the <i>keys</i> of the kingdom of heaven, that thou mayest <i>first open the</i> <i>door of faith to them</i>; but if thou askest by what rule that Church is to be governed, when the <i>Mosaic</i> rule may seem so improper for it, thou shalt be so guided by the Holy Spirit, that whatsoever of the law of <i>Moses</i> thou shalt <i>forbid</i> them shall be <i>forbidden</i>; whatsoever thou <i>grantest</i> them shall be <i>granted</i>; and that under a sanction made in heaven.' Hence, in that instant, when he should use his <i>keys</i>, that is, when he was now ready to open the gate of the Gospel to the <i>Gentiles</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:0">Acts 10:0</span>, he was taught from heaven that the consorting of the <i>Jew</i> with the <i>Gentile</i>, which before had been <i>bound</i>, was now <i>loosed</i>; and the eating of any creature convenient for food was now <i>loosed</i>, which before had been <i>bound</i>; and he in like manner <i>looses</i> both these.</p>
<p>"Those words of our Saviour, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:23">John 20:23</span>, <i>Whose sins ye remit, they are remitted to them</i>, for the most part are forced to the same sense with these before us, when they carry quite another sense. Here the business is of <i>doctrine</i> only, not of <i>persons</i>; there of <i>persons</i>, not of <i>doctrine</i>. Here of <i>things</i> <i>lawful</i> or <i>unlawful</i> in religion, to be determined by the apostles; there of <i>persons obstinate</i> or <i>not obstinate</i>, to be <i>punished</i> by them, or <i>not</i> to be <i>punished</i>.</p>
<p>"As to <i>doctrine</i>, the apostles were doubly instructed. 1. So long sitting at the feet of their Master, they had imbibed the evangelical doctrine.</p>
<p>"2. The Holy Spirit directing them, they were to determine concerning the legal doctrine and practice, being completely instructed and enabled in both by the Holy Spirit descending upon them. As to the <i>persons</i>, they were endowed with a peculiar gift, so that, the same Spirit directing them, if they would retain and punish the sins of any, a power was delivered into their hands of <i>delivering to Satan</i>, of punishing with <i>diseases, plagues</i>, yea, <i>death</i> itself, which <i>Peter</i> did to <i>Ananias</i> and <i>Sapphira; Paul</i> to <i>Elymas, Hymeneus</i>, and <i>Philetus</i>, c."</p>
<p>After all these evidences and proofs of the proper use of these terms, to attempt to press the word, into the service long assigned them by the Church of Rome, would, to use the words of Dr. Lightfoot, be "a matter of laughter or of madness." No Church can use them <i>in the sense thus imposed upon them</i>, which was done merely to serve secular ends and least of all can that very Church that thus abuses them.</p>
