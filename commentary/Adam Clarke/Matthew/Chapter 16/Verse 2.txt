<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:2">Matthew 16:2</span>. <i><b>When it is evening</b></i> â€” There are certain signs of fair and foul weather, which ye are in the constant habit of observing, and which do not fail. - <i>The signs of the times</i>: the doctrine which I preach, and the miracles which I work among you, are as sure signs that the day-spring from on high has visited you for your salvation; but if ye refute to hear, and continue in darkness, the red and gloomy cloud of vindictive justice shall pour out such a storm of wrath upon you as shalt sweep you from the face of the earth.</p>
