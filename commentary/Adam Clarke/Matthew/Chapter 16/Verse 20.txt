<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:20">Matthew 16:20</span>. <i><b>Then charged he his disciples</b></i> — διεστειλατο, <i>he</i> <i>strictly charged them</i>. Some very good MSS. have επετιμησεν, <i>he</i> <i>severely charged-comminatus est,-he threatened</i>. These are the readings of the <i>Cod. Bezae</i>, both in the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Christ.</b></i> — The common text has <i>Jesus the Christ</i>; but the word <i>Jesus</i> is omitted by fifty-four MSS., some of which are not only of the greatest <i>authority</i>, but also of the greatest <i>antiquity</i>. It is omitted also by the <i>Syriac</i>, later <i>Persic</i>, later <i>Arabic, Slavonic</i>, six copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and several of the fathers. The most eminent critics approve of this omission, and Griesbach has left it out of the text in both his editions. I believe the insertion of it here to be wholly superfluous and improper; for the question is, Who is this <i>Jesus</i>? Peter answers, He is, ὁ ΧριϚος, the <i>Messiah</i>. The word <i>Jesus</i> is obviously improper. What our Lord says here refers to Peter's testimony in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span>: <i>Thou art the Christ </i>- Jesus here says, Tell no man that <i>I am the</i> <i>Christ</i>, i.e. the MESSIAH; as the time for his full manifestation was not yet come; and he was not willing to provoke the Jewish malice, or the Roman envy, by permitting his disciples to announce him as the Saviour of a lost world. He chose rather to wait, till his resurrection and ascension had set this truth in the clearest light, and beyond the power of successful contradiction.</p>
