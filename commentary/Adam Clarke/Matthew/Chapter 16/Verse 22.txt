<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:22">Matthew 16:22</span>. <i><b>Then Peter took him</b></i> — προσλαβομενος - <i>took him</i> <i>up </i>- suddenly interrupted him, as it were calling him to order - see <i>Wakefield</i>. Some versions give προσλαβομενος the sense of <i>calling</i> <i>him aside</i>. The word signifies also to <i>receive in a friendly</i> <i>manner - to embrace</i>; but Mr. Wakefield's translation agrees better with the scope of the place. A man like Peter, who is of an impetuous spirit, and decides without consideration upon every subject, must of necessity be often in the <i>wrong</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Be it far from thee Lord</b></i> — Ιλεως σοι Κυριε. <i>Be merciful to</i> <i>thyself Lord</i>: see the <i>margin</i>. Pity thyself So I think the original should be rendered. Peter knew that Christ had power sufficient to preserve himself from all the power and malice of the Jews; and wished him to exert that in his <i>own behalf</i> which he had often exorted in the behalf of <i>others</i>. Some critics of great note think the expression elliptical, and that the word Θεος, <i>God</i>, is necessarily understood, as if Peter had said, <i>God be merciful</i> <i>to thee</i>! but I think the <i>marginal</i> reading is the sense of the passage. The French, Italian, and Spanish, render it the same way. Blind and ignorant man is ever finding fault with the conduct of God. Human reason cannot comprehend the incarnation of the <i>Almighty's fellow</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:7">Zechariah 13:7</span>,) nor reconcile the belief of his divinity with his sufferings and death. How many <i>Peters</i> are there now in the world, who are in effect saying, <i>This cannot be done</i> <i>unto thee </i>- thou didst not give thy life for the sin of the world - it would be injustice to cause the innocent to suffer thus for the guilty. But what saith God? <i>His soul shall be made an offering</i> <i>for sin</i>-he shall <i>taste death for every man-the iniquities of us</i> <i>all were laid upon him</i>. Glorious truth! May the God who published it have eternal praises!</p>
