<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span>. <i><b>Get thee behind me, Satan</b></i> — υπαγεοπισω μου σατανα. <i>Get behind me, thou adversary</i>. This is the proper translation of the Hebrew word <i>Satan</i>, from which the Greek word is taken. Our blessed Lord certainly never designed that men should believe he called Peter, DEVIL, because he, through erring <i>affection</i>, had wished him to avoid that death which he predicted to himself. This translation, which is literal, takes away that <i>harshness</i> which before appeared in our Lord's words.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou art an offence unto me</b></i> — σκανδαλον μου ει <i>Thou art a</i> <i>stumbling-block</i> in my way, to impede me in the accomplishment of the great design.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou savourest not</b></i> — That is, <i>dost not relish</i>, ου φρονεις, or, thou dost not <i>understand</i> or <i>discern</i> the things of God - thou art wholly taken up with the vain thought that my kingdom is of this world. He who opposes the doctrine of the <i>atonement</i> is an adversary and offence to Christ, though he be as sincere in his profession as <i>Peter</i> himself was. Let us beware of false friendships. Carnal relatives, when listened to, may prove the ruin of those whom, through their mistaken tenderness, they wish to save. When a man is intent on saving his own soul, his <i>adversaries</i> are often those of his own household.</p>
