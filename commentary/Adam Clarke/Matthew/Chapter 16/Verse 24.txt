Verse Matthew 16:24. Will come after me — i.e. to be my disciple. This discourse was intended to show Peter and the rest of the disciples the nature of his kingdom; and that the honour that cometh from the world was not to be expected by those who followed Christ.The principles of the Christian life are: First. To have a sincere desire to belong to Christ-If any man be WILLING to be my disciple, &c. Secondly. To renounce self-dependence, and selfish pursuits - Let him deny HIMSELF. Thirdly. To embrace the condition which God has appointed, and bear the troubles and difficulties he may meet with in walking the Christian road-Let him take up HIS CROSS. Fourthly. To imitate Jesus, and do and suffer all in his spirit-Let him FOLLOW ME.Let him deny himself — απαρνησασθω may well be interpreted, Let him deny, or renounce, himself fully - in all respects - perseveringly. It is a compounded word, and the preposition απο abundantly increases the meaning. A follower of Christ will need to observe it in its utmost latitude of meaning, in order to be happy here, and glorious hereafter. A man's self is to him the prime cause of most of his miseries. Mark 8:34.
