<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span>. <i><b>Will come after me</b></i> — i.e. to be my disciple. This discourse was intended to show Peter and the rest of the disciples the nature of his kingdom; and that the honour that cometh from the world was not to be expected by those who followed Christ.</p>
<p>The principles of the Christian life are: First. To have a sincere desire to belong to Christ-<i>If any man be</i> WILLING <i>to be my</i> <i>disciple</i>, &amp;c. Secondly. To renounce self-dependence, and selfish pursuits - <i>Let him deny</i> HIMSELF. Thirdly. To embrace the condition which God has appointed, and bear the troubles and difficulties he may meet with in walking the Christian road-<i>Let him take up</i> HIS CROSS. Fourthly. To imitate Jesus, and do and suffer all in his spirit-<i>Let him</i> FOLLOW ME.</p>
<p><i><b>Let him deny himself</b></i> — απαρνησασθω may well be interpreted, <i>Let</i> <i>him deny</i>, or <i>renounce, himself fully </i>- in all respects - <i>perseveringly</i>. It is a compounded word, and the preposition απο abundantly increases the meaning. A follower of Christ will need to observe it in its utmost latitude of meaning, in order to be happy <i>here</i>, and glorious <i>hereafter</i>. A man's <i>self</i> is to him the prime cause of most of his miseries. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34">Mark 8:34</span>.</p>
