<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>. <i><b>For whosoever will save his life</b></i> â€” That is, <i>shall</i> <i>wish to save his life</i>-at the expense of his conscience, and casting aside the cross, <i>he shall lose it </i>- the very evil he wishes to avoid shall overtake him; and he shall lose his soul into the bargain. See then how necessary it is to renounce one's self! But whatsoever a man loses in this world, for his steady attachment to Christ and his cause, he shall have amply made up to him in the eternal world.</p>
