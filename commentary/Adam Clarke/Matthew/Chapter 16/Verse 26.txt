<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>. <i><b>Lose his own soul</b></i> — Or, <i>lose his life</i>, την ψυχην αυτου. On what authority many have translated the word ψυχη, in the 25th verse, <i>life</i>, and in this verse, <i>soul</i>, I know not, but am certain it means <i>life</i> in both places. If a man should gain the whole world, its riches, honours, and pleasures, and lose his <i>life</i>, what would all these profit him, seeing they can only be enjoyed during <i>life</i>? But if the words be applied to the <i>soul</i>, they show the <i>difficulty </i>- the <i>necessity</i>-and <i>importance</i> of salvation. The world, the devil, and a man's own heart are opposed to his salvation; therefore it is <i>difficult</i>. The soul was made for God, and can never be united to him, nor be happy, till saved from sin: therefore it is <i>necessary</i>. He who is saved from his sin, and united to God, possesses the utmost felicity that the human soul can enjoy, either in this or the coming world: therefore, this salvation is <i>important</i>. <i>See also Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:25">Luke 9:25</span><i>"</i>.</p>
