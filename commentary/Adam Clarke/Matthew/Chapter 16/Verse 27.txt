<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>. <i><b>For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Father</b></i> â€” This seems to refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</span>. "Behold, one like the Son of man came - to the ancient of Days - and there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, and nations, and languages should serve him." This was the glorious Mediatorial kingdom which Jesus Christ was now about to set up, by the destruction of the Jewish nation and polity, and the diffusion of his Gospel through the whole world. If the words be taken in this sense, the <i>angels</i> or messengers may signify the apostles and their successors in the sacred ministry, preaching the Gospel in the power of the Holy Ghost. It is very likely that the words do not apply to the final judgment, to which they are generally referred; but to the wonderful display of God's grace and power after the day of pentecost.</p>
