Verse Matthew 16:3. The sky is red and lowering. â€” The signs of fair and foul weather were observed in a similar manner among the Romans, and indeed among most other people. Many treatises have been written on the subject: thus a poet: - High winds and furious tempests he portends: But if his cheeks are swoll'n with livid blue, He bodes wet weather, by his watery hue If dusky spots are varied on his brow, And streak'd with red a troubled colour show, That sullen mixture shall at once declare, Wind, rain, and storms, and elemental war." Dryden.
