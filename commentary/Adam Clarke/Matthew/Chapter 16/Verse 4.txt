<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:4">Matthew 16:4</span>. <i><b>Wicked and adulterous generation</b></i> — The Jewish people are represented in the Sacred Writings as <i>married</i> to the Most High; but, like a disloyal wife, forsaking their true husband, and uniting themselves to Satan and sin. <i>Seeketh after a sign</i>, σημειον επιζητει, <i>seeketh sign upon sign</i>, or, still <i>another</i> <i>sign</i>. Our blessed Lord had already wrought miracles sufficient to demonstrate both his Divine mission and his divinity; only <i>one</i> was farther necessary to take away the scandal of his cross and death, to fulfil the Scriptures, and to establish the Christian religion; and that was, his <i>resurrection from the dead</i>, which, he here states, was typified in the case of <i>Jonah</i>.</p>
