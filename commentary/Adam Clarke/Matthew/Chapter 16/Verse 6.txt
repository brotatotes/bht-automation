<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span>. <i><b>Beware of the leaven</b></i> â€” What the leaven of Pharisees and Sadducees was has been already explained, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>. Bad doctrines act in the soul as leaven does in meal; they <i>assimulate</i> the whole Spirit to their own nature. A man's particular <i>creed</i> has a greater influence on his <i>tempers</i> and <i>conduct</i> than most are aware of. <i>Pride, hypocrisy</i>, and <i>worldly-mindedness</i>, which constituted the <i>leaven</i> of the Pharisees and Sadducees, ruin the major part of the world.</p>
