<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:8">Matthew 16:8</span>. <i><b>When Jesus perceived, he said</b></i> — αυτοις, <i>unto them</i>, is wanting in BDKLMS, and twenty others; one of the Syriac, the Armenian, Ethiopic, Vulgate, and most of the Itala; also in Origen, Theophylact, and Lucifer Calaritanus. Mill approves of the omission, and Griesbach has left it out of the text.</p>
<p><i><b>O ye of little faith</b></i> — There are degrees in <i>faith</i>, as well as in the other graces of the Spirit. <i>Little faith</i> may be the seed of <i>great faith</i>, and therefore is not to be despised. But many who should be strong in faith have but a small measure of it, because they either give way to sin, or are not careful to improve what God has already given.</p>
