<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:11">Matthew 17:11</span>. <i><b>Elias - shall first come, and restore all things.</b></i> — Or <i>will reform</i>, αποκαταστησει; this word our Lord quotes from the Septuagint; who render the Hebrew והשוב לב אבות על בנים <i>vehesheb</i> <i>leb aboth al banim, he will cause the heart of the fathers to turn</i> <i>to the children</i>, by, ος αποκαταστησει καρδιαν πατρος προς υιον, who will convert, or restore, the heart of the father to the son. We are not therefore to understand the version of the Septuagint quoted by our Lord in any other sense than the Hebrew will allow. No fanciful restoration of all men, devils and damned spirits, is spoken of as either being done, or begun, by the ministry of John; but merely that he should preach a doctrine tending to universal reformation of manners, and should be greatly successful: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1-7">Matthew 3:1-7</span>, and especially <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:3-15">Luke 3:3-15</span>, where we find that a general <i>reformation</i> had taken place,</p>
<p>1. among the common people;</p>
<p>2. among the tax-gatherers; and</p>
<p>3. among the soldiers.</p>
<p>And as John announced the coming Christ, who was to baptize with the Holy Ghost, i.e. to enlighten, change, and purify the heart, that the reform might be complete, both outward and inward, he may be said, in the strictest sense of the word, to have fulfilled the prophecy: and that he was the Elijah mentioned by Malachi, the words of Gabriel to the virgin Mary prove; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span>. <i>And he</i> (John) <i>shall go before him</i> (Christ) <i>in the spirit and power</i> <i>of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and</i> <i>the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, c.</i> and that his ministry was powerfully effectual for this purpose, we have already seen.</p>
