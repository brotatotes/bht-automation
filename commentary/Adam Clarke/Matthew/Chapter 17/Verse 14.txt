<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:14">Matthew 17:14</span>. <i><b>When they were come to the multitude</b></i> — It appears that a congregation had been collected during our Lord's stay on the mount: how great must have been the desire of these people to hear the words of Christ! The assembly is <i>self-collected</i>, and no delay on the preacher's side discourages them-they continue to wait for him. In the present day how rare is this zeal! How few by the most pathetic invitation can be brought together, even at the most convenient times, to hear the same doctrines, and to get their souls healed by the same wonder-working Christ!</p>
<p><i><b>Kneeling down to him</b></i> — Or falling at his knees, γονυπετων. The ancients consecrated the EAR to <i>memory</i>; the FOREHEAD to <i>genius</i>; the RIGHT HAND to <i>faith</i>; and the KNEES to <i>mercy</i>: hence those who entreated favour <i>fell at</i> and <i>touched</i> the <i>knees</i> of the person whose kindness they supplicated. See Wakefield's Commentary; and see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:29">Exodus 9:29</span>; where the subject is largely explained.</p>
