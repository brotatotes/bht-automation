<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:15">Matthew 17:15</span>. <i><b>My son - is lunatic</b></i> — σεληνιαζεται. One who was most affected with this disorder at the <i>change</i> and <i>full</i> of the moon. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>. But this lunacy was occasioned by a demon, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:18">Matthew 17:18</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:17">Mark 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:38">Luke 9:38</span>. In this case, the devil intended to <i>hide</i> himself under the appearance of a natural disorder, that no supernatural means might be resorted to for his expulsion. See a remarkable account on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:39">Luke 9:39</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Falleth ofttimes into the fire, and oft into the water.</b></i> — The paroxysms of his disorder frequently recurred; and among his numerous falls, some were into the fire and some into the water: so that, on this account, his life was in continual danger. Those who are under the influence of the devil are often driven to <i>extremes</i> in every thing. Such are often driven into the <i>fire</i> of <i>presumption</i>, or the <i>waters</i> of <i>despair</i>. Satan takes advantage of our natural temper, state of health, and outward circumstances, to plague and ruin our souls.</p>
