Verse Matthew 17:16. Thy disciples could not cure him. â€” No wonder, when the cure must be effected by supernatural agency, and they had not faith enough to interest the power of God in their behalf, Matthew 17:20. A spiritual disorder must have a spiritual remedy: natural means, in such cases, signify just - nothing.
