<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:17">Matthew 17:17</span>. <i><b>O faithless and perverse generation!</b></i> — These and the following words may be considered as spoken:</p>
<p>1. To the disciples, because of their unbelief, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span>.</p>
<p>2. To the father of the possessed, who should have brought his son to Christ.</p>
<p>3. To the whole multitude, who were slow of heart to believe in him as the Messiah, notwithstanding the miracles which he wrought.</p>
<p>See KYPKE.</p>
<p><i>Perverse</i>, διεστραμμενη, signifies -</p>
<p>1. Such as are influenced by perverse <i>opinions</i>, which hinder them from receiving the truth: and,</p>
<p>2. Such as are <i>profligate in their manners</i>. KYPKE.</p>
<p>This last expression could not have been addressed to the <i>disciples</i>, who were certainly saved from the corruption of the world, and whose minds had been lately divinely <i>illuminated</i> by what passed at and after the transfiguration: but at all times the expression was applicable to the <i>Jewish</i> people.</p>
