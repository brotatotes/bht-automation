Verse Matthew 17:17. O faithless and perverse generation! — These and the following words may be considered as spoken:1. To the disciples, because of their unbelief, Matthew 17:20.2. To the father of the possessed, who should have brought his son to Christ.3. To the whole multitude, who were slow of heart to believe in him as the Messiah, notwithstanding the miracles which he wrought.See KYPKE.Perverse, διεστραμμενη, signifies -1. Such as are influenced by perverse opinions, which hinder them from receiving the truth: and,2. Such as are profligate in their manners. KYPKE.This last expression could not have been addressed to the disciples, who were certainly saved from the corruption of the world, and whose minds had been lately divinely illuminated by what passed at and after the transfiguration: but at all times the expression was applicable to the Jewish people.
