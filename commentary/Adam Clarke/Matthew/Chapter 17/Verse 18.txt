Verse Matthew 17:18. Jesus rebuked the devil â€” Deprived him of all power to torment the child; and obliged him to abandon his present usurped habitation.There are some souls whose cure God reserves to himself alone, and to whom all the applications of his ministers appear to be utterly ineffectual. He sometimes does all without them, that they may know they can never do any good without him. QUESNEL.
