<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:19">Matthew 17:19</span>. <i><b>Why could not we cast him out?</b></i> â€” They were confounded at their want of success-but not at their want of faith, which was the cause of their miscarriage! When the ministers of the Gospel find their endeavours, with respect to some places or persons, ineffectual, they should come, by <i>private</i> prayer, to Christ, humble themselves before him, and beg to be informed whether some evil in <i>themselves</i> have not been the cause of the unfruitfulness of their labours.</p>
