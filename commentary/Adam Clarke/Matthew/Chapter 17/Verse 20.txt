<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span>. <i><b>Because of your unbelief</b></i> — Are we preachers of the Gospel? Do the things of God rest upon our minds with a deep and steady conviction? Can we expect that a doctrine which we do not, from conviction, credit ourselves, can be instrumental in our hands of begetting faith in others? <i>So we preached, end so ye</i> <i>believed</i>. The word <i>preached</i> generally begets in the people the <i>same</i> spirit which the preacher possesses. Instead of απιστιαν, <i>unbelief</i>, the famous Vatican MS. and Cod. Cyprius, six others, Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, and Arabic, Origen, and Chrysostom, read ολιγοπιστιαν, <i>littleness of faith</i>. The disciples had some faith, but not enough-they believed, but not fully.</p>
<p><i><b>As a grain of mustard seed</b></i> — Some eminent critics think this a proverbial expression, intimating a GREAT DEGREE of faith, because <i>removing mountains</i>, which St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span>, attributes to ALL FAITH; i.e. the greatest possible degree of faith, is attributed here, by our Lord, to that faith which is as <i>a grain of mustard</i> <i>seed</i>. However this may be, there can be no doubt that our Lord means, as BISHOP PEARCE well remarks, a <i>thriving</i> and <i>increasing</i> <i>faith</i>; which like the grain of mustard seed, from being the <i>least</i> of seeds, becomes the greatest of all herbs; even a tree in whose branches the fowls of the air take shelter.
