<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:21">Matthew 17:21</span>. <i><b>This kind goeth not out but by prayer</b></i>, c.] τουτο το γενος, <i>this kind</i>, some apply to the <i>faith</i> which should be exercised on the occasion, which goeth not out, <i>doth not exert</i> <i>itself</i>, but by prayer and fasting but this interpretation is, in my opinion, far from <i>solid</i>. However, there is great difficulty in the text. The whole verse is wanting in the famous <i>Vatican</i> MS., one of the most ancient and most authentic perhaps in the world; and in another one of <i>Colbert's</i>, written in the 11th or 12th century. It is wanting also in the <i>Coptic, Ethiopic, Syriac,</i> <i>Hieros.</i>, and in one copy of the <i>Itala</i>. But all the MSS. acknowledge it in the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:29">Mark 9:29</span>, only the <i>Vatican</i> MS. leaves out νηστεια, <i>fasting</i>. I strongly suspect it to be an interpolation; but, if it be, it is very <i>ancient</i>, as Origen, Chrysostom, and others of the primitive fathers, acknowledged it. But while candour obliges me to acknowledge that I cannot account for the fact here alleged, that a certain class or genus of demons cannot be expelled but by prayer and fasting, while others may be ejected without them, I can give a sense to the passage which all my readers will easily understand: viz. that there are certain evil <i>propensities</i>, in some persons, which <i>pampering the flesh</i> tends to nourish and strengthen; and that <i>self-denial</i> and <i>fasting</i>, accompanied by <i>prayer</i> to God, are the most likely means, not only to <i>mortify</i> such propensities, but also to <i>destroy</i> them. For other remarkable circumstances relative to this case, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:17">Mark 9:17</span>, &amp;c.</p>
