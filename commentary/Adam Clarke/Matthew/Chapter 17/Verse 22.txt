Verse Matthew 17:22. They abode in Galilee — Lower Galilee, where the city of Capernaum was.The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men — Μελλει - παραδιδοσθαι εις χειρας - The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands, c. I am fully of the mind of two eminent critics, Grotius and Wakefield, that παραδιδοσθαι should be here translated delivered, or delivered up, not betrayed and that the agency, in this case, should be referred to God, not to Judas. Jesus was delivered up, by the counsel of God, to be an atonement for the sin of the world. See Acts 4:27-28. Against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed to do what thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done, Herod and Pontius Pilate-were gathered together.
