<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:24">Matthew 17:24</span>. <i><b>They that received tribute</b></i> — This was not a tax to be paid to the <i>Roman government</i>; but a tax for the support of the <i>temple</i>. The law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:13">Exodus 30:13</span>, obliged every male among the Jews to pay half a shekel yearly; for the support of the temple; and this was continued by them wherever dispersed, till after the time of Vespasian, see Josephus, WAR, book 7. c. 6, who ordered it afterwards to be paid into the Roman treasury. The word in the text, which is generally translated <i>tribute </i>- τα διδραχμα, signifies the <i>didrachma</i>, or <i>two drachms</i>. This piece of money was about the value of two <i>Attic</i> drachms, each equal to <i>fifteen pence</i> of our money. The didrachma of the Septuagint, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:13">Exodus 30:13</span>, was twice as heavy as the Attic, for it was equal to a whole <i>shekel</i>, this being the value of that piece of money at <i>Alexandrina</i>, the place where the Septuagint translation was made; for the <i>half</i> <i>shekel</i> mentioned in the above passage, they render ημισυτου ημισυ του διδαχμου, <i>the half of a didrachma</i>.</p>
