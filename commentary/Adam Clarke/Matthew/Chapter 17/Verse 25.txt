Verse Matthew 17:25. He saith, Yes. â€” From this reply of Peter, it is evident that our Lord customarily paid all taxes, tributes, c., which were common among the people wherever he came. The children of God are subject to all civil laws in the places where they live - and should pay the taxes levied on them by public authority and though any of these should be found unjust, THEY rebel not, as their business is not to reform the politics of nations, but the morals of the world.
