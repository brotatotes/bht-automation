<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:3">Matthew 17:3</span>. <i><b>Moses and Elias</b></i> — Elijah came from heaven in the same body which he had upon earth, for he was <i>translated</i>, and did not see death, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:11">2 Kings 2:11</span>. And the body of Moses was probably raised again, as a pledge of the <i>resurrection</i>; and as Christ is to come to judge the <i>quick</i> and the <i>dead</i>, for we shall not all <i>die</i>, but all shall be <i>changed</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>, he probably gave the full representation of this in the person of Moses, who <i>died</i>, and was thus raised to life, (or appeared now as he shall appear when raised from the dead in the last day), and in the person of Elijah, who never <i>tasted death</i>. Both their bodies exhibit the same appearance, to show that the bodies of glorified saints are the same, whether the person had been <i>translated</i>, or whether he had <i>died</i>. It was a constant and prevalent tradition among the Jews, that both Moses and Elijah should appear in the times of the Messiah, and to this very tradition the disciples refer, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:10">Matthew 17:10</span>.</p>
<p>We may conceive that the <i>law</i> in the person of <i>Moses</i>, the great Jewish legislator, and the <i>prophets</i> in the person of <i>Elijah</i>, the chief of the prophets, came now to do homage to Jesus Christ, and to render up their authority into his hands; as he was the END of the law, and the grand <i>subject</i> of the predictions of the prophets. This appears more particularly from what St. Luke says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:31">Luke 9:31</span>, that <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elijah</i> conversed with our Lord on his <i>death</i>, which he was about to <i>accomplish</i>, (πληρουν to <i>fulfil</i>,) because in it, all the <i>rites, ceremonies</i>, and <i>sacrifices</i> of the law, as well as the <i>predictions</i> of the prophets, were <i>fulfilled</i>.</p>
