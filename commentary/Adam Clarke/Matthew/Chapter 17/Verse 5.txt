<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>. <i><b>A bright cloud overshadowed them</b></i> — Or as six MSS. and <i>Ephraim</i> read it, <i>a cloud of light</i>, νεφεληφωτος; which reading GRIESBACH has admitted into the text. As a <i>bright</i> cloud, or a cloud of <i>light</i> could not <i>overshadow</i>, or cast any kind of <i>shade</i>, the word επεσκιασεν should be translated, <i>surrounded</i> them. A <i>cloud</i> was frequently the symbol of the Divine presence; but such a cloud had always something very remarkable in its appearance. <i>Ezekiel</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</span>, represents it as a <i>great cloud</i>, and a <i>fire unfolding itself</i>, and a <i>brightness</i> about it, and out of the midst thereof, as the <i>colour</i> of <i>amber</i> out of the midst of the <i>fire</i>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:28">Ezekiel 1:28</span>, he tells us that this was the <i>appearance</i> of the <i>likeness</i> of the <i>glory</i> of the Lord. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:10">Exodus 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:33">Exodus 40:33</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+43:2">Ezekiel 43:2</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+5:14">1 Chronicles 5:14</span>. But it was generally in a <i>thick, dark</i> cloud, that God manifested himself under the law; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:9">Exodus 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:21">Exodus 20:21</span>. This might be designed as emblematical of the <i>old covenant</i>, which was but the <i>shadow</i> of the good things which were to come, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>; and the <i>cloud of light</i> mentioned here, the emblem of that <i>glorious</i> <i>display of God</i>, in his Gospel, by which life and immortality were brought to <i>light</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>This is my beloved Son</b></i> — Ουτος εϚιν ο υιος μου ο αγαπητος, εν ω ευδοκησα, <i>This is my Son, the beloved one, in who I have</i> <i>delighted, or, been well pleased</i>. God adds his testimony of approbation to what was spoken of the sufferings of Christ by <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elijah</i>; thus showing that the sacrificial economy of the old covenant was in itself of no worth, but as it <i>referred</i> to the grand atonement which Jesus was about to make; therefore he says, <i>In him</i> HAVE <i>I delighted</i>, (ευδοκησα,) intimating that it was in <i>him alone</i>, as typified by those sacrifices, that he HAD <i>delighted</i> through the whole course of the legal administration; and that it was only in <i>reference</i> to the death of his Son that he accepted the offerings and oblations made to him under the old covenant. <i>Hear</i> HIM. The disciples wished to detain Moses and Elijah that they might hear <i>them</i>: but God shows that the <i>law</i> which had been in <i>force</i>, and the <i>prophets</i> which had <i>prophesied</i>, until now, must all give place to Jesus; and he alone must now be attended to, as the <i>way</i>, the <i>truth, and the life</i>; for no man could now come unto the Father but <i>through him</i>. This voice seems also to refer to that prediction in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>. The Lord shall raise up a Prophet like unto me: HIM SHALL YE HEAR. Go no more to the law, nor to the prophets, to seek for a <i>coming</i> Messiah; for behold he IS <i>come</i>! Hear and obey him, and <i>him</i> only.</p>
<p>This transfiguration must have greatly confirmed the disciples in the belief of a <i>future state</i>, and in the doctrine of the <i>resurrection</i>; they saw <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elijah still</i> EXISTING, though the former had been gathered to his fathers upwards of 1400 years, and the latter had been <i>translated</i> nearly 900.</p>
