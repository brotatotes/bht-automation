<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:7">Matthew 17:7</span>. <i><b>Jesus came and touched them</b></i> â€” Exactly parallel to this account is <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+8:18">Daniel 8:18</span>, <i>I was in a deep sleep</i>, i, e. (a trance) <i>on my face towards the</i> <i>ground; but he</i> TOUCHED <i>me, and set me upright</i>. From Jesus alone are we to expect Divine communications, and by his <i>power</i> only are we able to <i>bear</i> and <i>improve</i> them. It is very likely that this transfiguration took place in the <i>night</i>, which was a more proper season to show forth its <i>glory</i> than the <i>day</i> time, in which a part of the <i>splendour</i> must necessarily be lost by the presence of the <i>solar light</i>. Besides, St. Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:37">Luke 9:37</span>, expressly says, that it was on the <i>next day</i> after the transfiguration that our Lord came down from the mount.</p>
