<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:9">Matthew 17:9</span>. <i><b>Tell the vision to no man</b></i> â€” See the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:20">Matthew 16:20</span>; and farther observe, that as this transfiguration was intended to show forth the final abolition of the whole ceremonial law, it was necessary that a matter which could not fail to irritate the Jewish rulers and people should be kept secret, till Jesus had accomplished vision and prophecy by his death and resurrection.</p>
<p>The whole of this emblematic transaction appears to me to be intended to prove,</p>
<p>1st. The <i>reality</i> of the <i>world</i> of <i>spirits</i>, and the <i>immortality</i> of the <i>soul</i>.</p>
<p>2dly. The <i>resurrection</i> of the body, and the doctrine of <i>future rewards</i> and <i>punishments</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>.</p>
<p>3dly. The <i>abolition</i> of the <i>Mosaic institutions</i>, and, the <i>fulfilment</i> of the <i>predictions</i> of the <i>prophets</i> relative to the <i>person, nature, sufferings, death</i>, and <i>resurrection</i> of Christ, and the <i>glory</i> that should <i>follow</i>.</p>
<p>4thly. The establishment of the <i>mild, light-bringing</i>, and <i>life-giving</i> Gospel of the Son of God. And</p>
<p>5thly. That as the old Jewish covenant and Mediatorship had ended, Jesus was now to be considered as the sole <i>Teacher</i>, the only availing <i>offering</i> for <i>sin</i>, and the grand <i>Mediator</i> between God and man.</p>
<p>There are many very useful remarks on this transaction, by the late venerable <i>Bp. Porteus</i>.</p>
