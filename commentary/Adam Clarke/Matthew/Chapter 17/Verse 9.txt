Verse Matthew 17:9. Tell the vision to no man â€” See the note on Matthew 16:20; and farther observe, that as this transfiguration was intended to show forth the final abolition of the whole ceremonial law, it was necessary that a matter which could not fail to irritate the Jewish rulers and people should be kept secret, till Jesus had accomplished vision and prophecy by his death and resurrection.The whole of this emblematic transaction appears to me to be intended to prove,1st. The reality of the world of spirits, and the immortality of the soul.2dly. The resurrection of the body, and the doctrine of future rewards and punishments, see Matthew 16:27.3dly. The abolition of the Mosaic institutions, and, the fulfilment of the predictions of the prophets relative to the person, nature, sufferings, death, and resurrection of Christ, and the glory that should follow.4thly. The establishment of the mild, light-bringing, and life-giving Gospel of the Son of God. And5thly. That as the old Jewish covenant and Mediatorship had ended, Jesus was now to be considered as the sole Teacher, the only availing offering for sin, and the grand Mediator between God and man.There are many very useful remarks on this transaction, by the late venerable Bp. Porteus.
