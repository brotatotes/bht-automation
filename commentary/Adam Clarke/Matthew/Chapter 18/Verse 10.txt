<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</span>. <i><b>One of these little ones</b></i> — One of my simple, loving, humble disciples.</p>
<p><i><b>Their angels - always behold</b></i> — Our Lord here not only alludes to, but, in my opinion, establishes the notion received by almost all nations, viz. That every person has a <i>guardian angel</i>; and that these have always access to God, to receive orders relative to the management of their charge. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+34:8">Psalms 34:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Always behold the face</b></i> — Hence, among the Jews, the angels were styled מלכי פנים, <i>malakey panim</i>, angels of the face, and Michael is said to be סר הפנים, <i>sar ha-panim</i> the prince of the face. This is an allusion to the privilege granted by eastern monarchs to their chief favourites; a privilege which others were never permitted to enjoy. The seven princes of Media and Persia, who were the <i>chief favourites</i> and <i>privy-counsellors</i> of <i>Ahasuerus</i>, are said to <i>see the king's face</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="es+1:14">Esther 1:14</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+25:19">2 Kings 25:19</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:25">Jeremiah 51:25</span>. Our Lord's words give us to understand that humble-hearted, child-like disciples, are objects of his peculiar care, and constant attention. The clause, εν ουρανοις, <i>in the heavens</i>, is wanting in several MSS., versions, and fathers.</p>
