<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:11">Matthew 18:11</span>. <i><b>For the Son of man</b></i>, c.] This is added as a second reason, why no injury should be done to his followers. "The Son of man has so loved them as to come into the world to lay down his life for them."</p>
<p><i><b>That which was lost.</b></i> — απολωλος. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</span>, Satan is called απολλυων, <i>Apolluon</i>, the destroyer, or <i>him who lays waste</i>. This name bears a near relation to that state in which our Lord tells us he finds all mankind - <i>lost, desolated, ruined</i>. So it appears that Satan and men have the nearest affinity to each other - as the <i>destroyer</i> and the <i>destroyed </i>- the <i>desolator</i> and the <i>desolated </i>- the <i>loser</i> and the <i>lost</i>. But the Son of man came to save the lost. Glorious news! May every lost soul feel it! This verse is omitted by five MSS., two versions, and three of the fathers but of its authenticity there can be no doubt, as it is found in the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:10">Luke 19:10</span>, on which verse there is not a single various reading found in any of the MSS. that have ever been discovered, nor in any of the ancient versions.</p>
