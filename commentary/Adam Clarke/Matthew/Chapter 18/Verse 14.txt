<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:14">Matthew 18:14</span>. <i><b>It is not the will of your Father</b></i> â€” If any soul be finally lost, it is not because God's <i>will</i> or <i>counsel</i> was against its salvation, or that a proper provision had not been made for it; but that, though light came into the world, it preferred darkness to light, because of its attachment to its evil deeds.</p>
