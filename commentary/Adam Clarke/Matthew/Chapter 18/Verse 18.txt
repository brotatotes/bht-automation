<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span>. <i><b>Whatsoever ye shall bind</b></i>, c.] Whatever determinations ye make, in conformity to these directions for your conduct to an offending brother, will be accounted just, and ratified by the Lord. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span> and, to what is there said, the following observations may be profitably added.</p>
<p>Οσα εαν δησητε - και οσα εαν λυσητε. <i>Binding</i> and <i>loosing</i>, in this place, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>, is generally restrained, by Christian interpreters, to matters of discipline and authority. But it is as plain as the sun, by what occurs in numberless places dispersed throughout the <i>Mishna</i>, and from thence commonly used by the later <i>rabbins</i> when they treat of ritual subjects, that <i>binding</i> signified, and was commonly understood by the <i>Jews</i> at that time to be, a <i>declaration that any thing was unlawful to be done</i>; and <i>loosing</i> signified, on the contrary, <i>a declaration that any thing</i> <i>may be lawfully done</i>. Our Saviour spoke to his disciples in a language which they understood, so that they were not in the least at a loss to comprehend his meaning; and its being obsolete to us is no manner of reason why we should conclude that it was obscure to them. The words, <i>bind</i> and <i>loose</i>, are used in both places in a declaratory sense, of <i>things</i>, not of <i>persons</i>. It is ὁ and ὃσα, in the neuter gender, both in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:0">Matthew 16:0</span>, and here in this: i.e. <i>Whatsoever thing or things ye shall bind or loose</i>. Consequently, the same commission which was given at first to St. <i>Peter</i> alone, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>), was afterwards enlarged to all the apostles. St. <i>Peter</i> had made a confession that <i>Jesus</i> was the <i>Christ</i>, the Son of God. His confession of the Divinity of our Lord was the first that ever was made by man; to him, therefore, were given the keys of the kingdom of heaven: i.e. God made choice of him among all the apostles, that the <i>Gentiles</i> should <i>first</i>, by his mouth, hear the word of the Gospel, and believe. He first <i>opened</i> the kingdom of heaven to the Gentiles, when he preached to <i>Cornelius</i>. It was <i>open</i> to the <i>Jews</i> all along before; but if we should suppose that it was not, yet to them also did St. <i>Peter open</i> the kingdom of heaven, in his sermon at the great <i>pentecost</i>. Thus, then, St. <i>Peter</i> exercised his two keys: that for the <i>Jews</i> at the great <i>pentecost</i>; and that for the <i>Gentiles</i>, when he admitted <i>Cornelius</i> into the Church. And this was the reward of his first confession, in which he owned <i>Jesus</i> to be the promised <i>Messiah</i>. And what St. <i>Peter loosed</i>, i.e. declared as <i>necessary</i> to be believed and practised by the disciples here, was ratified above. And what he declared <i>unlawful</i> to be believed and practised, (i.e. what he <i>bound</i>,) was actually forbidden by God himself.</p>
<p>I own myself obliged to Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i> for this interpretation of the true notion of <i>binding</i> and <i>loosing</i>. It is a noble one, and perfectly agrees with the ways of speaking then in use among the <i>Jews</i>. It is observable that these <i>phrases</i>, of <i>binding</i> and <i>loosing</i>, occur no where in the New Testament but in St. <i>Matthew</i>, who is supposed to have written his Gospel first in <i>Hebrew</i>, from whence it was translated into <i>Greek</i>, and then the force and use of the expression will better appear.

<p>"The phrases to <i>bind</i> and to <i>loose</i> were <i>Jewish</i>, and most frequent in their writers. It belonged only to the teachers among the <i>Jews to bind</i> and <i>to loose</i>. When the Jews set any apart to be a preacher, they used these words, '<i>Take thou liberty to</i> <i>teach what is</i> BOUND <i>and what is</i> LOOSE.'" <i>Strype's</i> preface to the Posthumous Remains of Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i>, p. 38.</p>
