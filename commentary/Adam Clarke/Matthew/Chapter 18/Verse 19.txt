<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:19">Matthew 18:19</span>. <i><b>Again I say unto you</b></i> — The word αμην, <i>verily</i>, is <i>added</i> here, in ninety-eight MSS., (many of which are of the greatest antiquity and importance,) seven editions, all the Arabic, the Slavonic, and several of the <i>Itala</i>. The taking in or leaving out such a word may appear to some a matter of indifference; but, as I am fully convinced Jesus Christ never spoke a useless or a needless word, my maxim is, to omit not one syllable that I am convinced (from such authority as the above) he has ever used, and to take in nothing that he did not speak. It makes the passage much more emphatic - <i>Again</i>, VERILY <i>I say unto you</i>,</p>
<p><i><b>If two of you shall agree</b></i> — συμφωνηστωσιν, <i>symphonize</i>, or <i>harmonize</i>. It is a metaphor taken from a number of musical instruments set to the same <i>key</i>, and playing the same <i>tune</i>: here, it means a perfect agreement of the hearts, desires, wishes, and voices, of <i>two</i> or more persons praying to God. It also intimates that as a number of musical instruments, skilfully played, in a good concert, are pleasing to the ears of men, so a number of persons united together in warm, earnest, cordial prayer, is highly pleasing in the sight and ears of the Lord. Now this conjoint prayer refers, in all probability, to the <i>binding</i> and <i>loosing</i> in the preceding verse; and thus we see what power faithful prayer has with God!</p>
<p><i><b>It shall be done for them</b></i> — What an encouragement to pray! even to <i>two</i>, if there be no more disposed to join in this heavenly work.</p>
