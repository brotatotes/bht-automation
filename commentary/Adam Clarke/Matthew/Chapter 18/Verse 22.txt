<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:22">Matthew 18:22</span>. <i><b>Seventy times seven.</b></i> â€” There is something very remarkable in these words, especially if collated with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:24">Genesis 4:24</span>, where the very same words are used-"If any man kill LAMECH, he shall be avenged <i>seventy times seven</i>." The just God punishes sin in an exemplary manner. <i>Sinful</i> man, who is exposed to the stroke of Divine justice, should be <i>abundant</i> in forgiveness, especially as the merciful only shall find mercy. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:7">Matthew 5:7</span>, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:15">Matthew 6:15</span>. The sum <i>seventy times seven</i> makes four hundred and ninety. Now an <i>offence</i>, properly such, is that which is given <i>wantonly,</i> <i>maliciously</i>, and without ANY PROVOCATION. It is my opinion, that, let a man search ever so accurately, he will not find that he has received, during the whole course of his life, four hundred and ninety such offences. If the man who receives the offence has given any <i>cause</i> for it, in that case, the <i>half</i> of the offence, at least, towards his brother, ceases.</p>
