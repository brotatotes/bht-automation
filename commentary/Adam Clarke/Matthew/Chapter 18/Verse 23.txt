<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:23">Matthew 18:23</span>. <i><b>Therefore is the kingdom</b></i> â€” In respect to <i>sin,</i> <i>cruelty</i>, and <i>oppression</i>, God will proceed in the kingdom of heaven (the dispensation of the Gospel) as he did in former times; and every person shall give an account of himself to God. Every sin is a <i>debt</i> contracted with the justice of God; men are all God's own servants; and the day is at hand in which their Master will <i>settle accounts</i> with them, inquire into their work, and pay them their wages. Great Judge! what an awful time must this be, when with multitudes nothing shall be found but <i>sin</i> and <i>insolvency</i>!</p>
<p>By <i>servant</i>, in the text, we are to understand, a petty king, or tributary prince; for no <i>hired</i> servant could possibly owe such a sum as is here mentioned.</p>
