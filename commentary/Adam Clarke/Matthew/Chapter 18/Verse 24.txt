<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:24">Matthew 18:24</span>. <i><b>Ten thousand talents</b></i> — μυριων ταλαντων, a myriad of talents, the highest number known in Greek arithmetical notation. An immense sum, which, if the <i>silver</i> talent be designed, amounts to 4,500,000 sterling; but if the gold talent be meant which is by far the most likely, then the amount is 67,500,000 sterling, a sum equal to the annual revenue of the British empire! See the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:39">Exodus 25:39</span>. The <i>margin</i> above is incorrect.</p>
