<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:25">Matthew 18:25</span>. <i><b>He had not to pay</b></i> â€” That is <i>not being able to pay</i>. As there could not be the smallest probability that a servant, wholly <i>dependent</i> on his master, who was now absolutely insolvent, could ever pay a debt he had contracted of more than 67 millions! - so is it impossible for a sinner, infinitely indebted to Divine justice, ever to pay a mite out of the talent.</p>
<p><i><b>Commanded him to be sold - his wife - children</b></i>, c.] Our Lord here alludes to an ancient custom among the Hebrews, of selling a man and his family to make payment of contracted debts. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:3">Exodus 22:3</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+25:30">Leviticus 25:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+25:47">Leviticus 25:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:1">2 Kings 4:1</span>. This custom passed from among the <i>Jews</i> to the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>. I have already remarked (see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:19">Genesis 47:19</span>) that in the Burman empire the sale of whole families, to discharge debts, is very common.</p>
