<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:26">Matthew 18:26</span>. <i><b>Fell down and worshipped him</b></i> — προσεκυνει αυτω, <i>crouched as a dog before him</i>, with the greatest deference, submission, and anxiety.</p>
<p><i><b>Have patience with me</b></i> — μακροθυμησον επ' εμοι, <i>be long-minded</i> <i>towards me </i>- give me longer space.</p>
<p>The means which a sinner should use to be saved, are,</p>
<p>1. Deep <i>humiliation</i> of heart - <i>he fell down</i>.</p>
<p>2. <i>Fervent prayer</i>.</p>
<p>3. <i>Confidence</i> in the <i>mercy of God - have patience</i>.</p>
<p>4. A <i>firm purpose</i> to devote his soul and body to his Maker - <i>I will pay thee all</i>.</p>
<p>A sinner may be said, according to the economy of grace, to <i>pay all</i>, when he brings the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus to the throne of justice, by faith; thus offering an <i>equivalent</i> for the pardon he seeks, and <i>paying all</i> he owes to Divine justice, by presenting the blood of the Lamb.</p>
