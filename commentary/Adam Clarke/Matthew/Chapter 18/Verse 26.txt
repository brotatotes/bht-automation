Verse Matthew 18:26. Fell down and worshipped him — προσεκυνει αυτω, crouched as a dog before him, with the greatest deference, submission, and anxiety.Have patience with me — μακροθυμησον επ' εμοι, be long-minded towards me - give me longer space.The means which a sinner should use to be saved, are,1. Deep humiliation of heart - he fell down.2. Fervent prayer.3. Confidence in the mercy of God - have patience.4. A firm purpose to devote his soul and body to his Maker - I will pay thee all.A sinner may be said, according to the economy of grace, to pay all, when he brings the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus to the throne of justice, by faith; thus offering an equivalent for the pardon he seeks, and paying all he owes to Divine justice, by presenting the blood of the Lamb.
