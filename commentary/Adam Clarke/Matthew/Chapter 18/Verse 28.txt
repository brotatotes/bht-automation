<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:28">Matthew 18:28</span>. <i><b>A hundred pence</b></i> — Rather <i>denarii</i>. The <i>denarius</i> was a Roman coin, worth about <i>seven-pence halfpenny</i> English. The original word should be retained, as our word <i>penny</i> does not convey the <i>seventh part</i> of the meaning. A hundred denarii would amount to about 3<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. British, or, if reckoned as some do, at <i>seven-pence three farthings</i>, the sum would be 3<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Took him by the throat</b></i> — κρατησας αυτον επνιγε. There is no word I am acquainted with, which so fully expresses the meaning of the original, επνιγε, as the <i>Anglo-saxon</i> term <i>throttle</i>: it signified (like the Greek) to <i>half choke</i> a person, by <i>seizing his</i> <i>throat</i>.</p>
