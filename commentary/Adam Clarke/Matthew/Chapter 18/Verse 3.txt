<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:3">Matthew 18:3</span>. <i><b>Except ye be converted</b></i> — Unless ye be saved from those prejudices which are at present so baneful to your nation, (seeking a temporal and not a spiritual kingdom,) unless ye be clothed with the spirit of humility, ye cannot enter into the spirit, design, and privileges of my spiritual and eternal kingdom.

"The hearts of infants being free from <i>avarice</i>, what care they for a handful of <i>silver</i> more than for a handful of <i>dust</i>?"</p>
