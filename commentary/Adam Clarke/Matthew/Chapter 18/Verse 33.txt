<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:33">Matthew 18:33</span>. <i><b>Shouldest not thou also have had compassion</b></i> — ουκ εδει και σε, <i>Did it not become thee also</i>? What a cutting reproach! It became ME to show mercy, when thou didst earnestly entreat me, because <i>I am</i> MERCIFUL, It became thee also to have <i>shown mercy</i>, because thou wert so deep in debt thyself, and hadst obtained mercy.</p>
