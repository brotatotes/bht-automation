Verse Matthew 18:33. Shouldest not thou also have had compassion — ουκ εδει και σε, Did it not become thee also? What a cutting reproach! It became ME to show mercy, when thou didst earnestly entreat me, because I am MERCIFUL, It became thee also to have shown mercy, because thou wert so deep in debt thyself, and hadst obtained mercy.
