<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:34">Matthew 18:34</span>. <i><b>Delivered him to the tormentors</b></i> â€” Not only continued captivity is here intended, but the tortures to be endured in it. If a person was suspected of fraud, as there was reason for in such a case as that mentioned here, he was put to very cruel tortures among the Asiatics, to induce him to confess. In the punishments of China, a great variety of these appear; and probably there is an allusion to such torments in this place. Before, he and all that he had, were only to be <i>sold</i>. Now, as he has increased his debt, so he has increased his punishment; he is delivered to the tormentors, to the horrors of a guilty conscience, and to a fearful looking for of fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. But if this refers to the day of judgment, then the <i>worm that dieth not</i>, and the <i>fire that is</i> <i>not quenched</i>, are the <i>tormentors</i>.</p>
