<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:35">Matthew 18:35</span>. <i><b>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto</b></i><b> </b><i><b>you</b></i> — The goodness and indulgence of God towards us is the pattern we should follow in our dealings with others. If we take man for our exemplar we shall err, because our copy is a bad one; and our lives are not likely to be better than the copy we imitate. Follow Christ; be merciful as your Father who is in heaven is merciful. You cannot complain of the <i>fairness</i> of your copy. Reader, hast thou a <i>child</i>, or <i>servant</i> who has <i>offended</i> thee, and humbly asks forgiveness? Hast thou a <i>debtor</i>, or a <i>tenant</i>, who is <i>insolvent</i>, and asks for a little longer time? And hast thou not <i>forgiven</i> that child or servant? Hast thou not given <i>time</i> to that <i>debtor</i> or <i>tenant</i>? How, then, canst thou ever expect to see the face of the <i>just</i> and <i>merciful</i> God? Thy child is <i>banished</i>, or <i>kept at a distance</i>; thy <i>debtor</i> is thrown into <i>prison</i>, or thy <i>tenant sold up</i>: yet the child offered to <i>fall at</i> <i>thy feet</i>; and the <i>debtor</i> or <i>tenant</i>, utterly insolvent, prayed for a <i>little longer time</i>, hoping God would enable him <i>to pay thee all</i>; but to these things thy <i>stony</i> heart and <i>seared</i> conscience paid no regard! O monster of ingratitude! Scandal to human nature, and reproach to God! If thou canst, go hide thyself - even in <i>hell</i>, from the face of the Lord!</p>
<p><i><b>Their trespasses.</b></i> — These words are properly left out by GREISBACH, and other eminent critics, because they are wanting in some of the <i>very best</i> MSS. most of the versions, and in some of the chief of the fathers. The words are evidently an interpolation; the construction of them is utterly improper, and the concord false.</p>
<p>In our common method of dealing with insolvent debtors, we in some sort imitate the Asiatic customs: we put them in prison, and all their circumstances there are so many <i>tormentors</i>; the <i>place</i>, the <i>air</i>, the <i>company</i>, the <i>provision</i>, the <i>accommodation</i>, all destructive to comfort, to peace, to health, and to every thing that <i>humanity</i> can devise. If the person be <i>poor</i>, or <i>comparatively</i> <i>poor</i>, is his imprisonment likely to lead him to discharge his <i>debt</i>? His <i>creditor</i> may rest assured that he is now farther from his object than ever: the man had no other way of discharging the debt but by his <i>labour</i>; that is now impossible, through his <i>confinement</i>, and the creditor is put to a <i>certain</i> expense towards his maintenance. How foolish is this policy! And how much do such laws stand in need of <i>revision</i> and <i>amendment</i>! Imprisonment for debt, in such a case as that supposed above, can answer no other end than the gratification of the malice, revenge, or inhumanity of the creditor. Better sell all that he has, and, with his hands and feet untied, let him begin the world afresh. Dr. <i>Dodd</i> very feelingly inquires here, "Whether rigour in exacting temporal debts, in treating without mercy such as are <i>unable</i> to satisfy them - whether this can be allowed to a <i>Christian</i>, who is bound to imitate his God and Father? To a <i>debtor</i>, who can expect forgiveness only on the condition of forgiving others? To a <i>servant</i>, who should obey his Master? - and to a <i>criminal</i>, who is in daily expectation of his <i>Judge</i> and final <i>sentence</i>?" Little did he think, when he wrote this sentence, that himself should be a melancholy proof, not only of human weakness, but of the relentless nature of those laws by which <i>property</i>, or rather <i>money</i>, is guarded. The unfortunate Dr. Dodd was hanged for forgery, in 1777, and the above note was written only seven years before!</p>
<p>The unbridled and extravagant appetites of men sometimes require <i>a rigour even beyond the law</i> to suppress them. While, then, we learn lessons of <i>humanity</i> from what is before us, let us also learn lessons of <i>prudence, sobriety</i>, and <i>moderation</i>. The parable of the two debtors is blessedly calculated to give this information.</p>
