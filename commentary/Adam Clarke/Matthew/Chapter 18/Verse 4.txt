<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:4">Matthew 18:4</span>. <i><b>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself</b></i> — So great is the disparity between the kingdom of Christ and the kingdoms of this world, that there is no way of rising to honours in the former, but by humility of mind, and continual self-abasement.</p>
<p><i><b>The same is greatest</b></i> — Thus our Lord shows them that they were all <i>equal</i>, and that there could be no superiority among them, but what must come from the deepest humility; he intimates also, that wherever this principle should be found, it would save its possessor from seeking worldly honours or earthly profits, and from seeking to be a <i>ruler</i> over his <i>brethren</i>, or a <i>lord</i> in God's <i>heritage</i>.</p>
