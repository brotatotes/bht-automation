<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:5">Matthew 18:5</span>. <i><b>One such little child</b></i> â€” As our Lord in the preceding verses considers a little child an emblem of a genuine disciple, so by the term in this verse he means a disciple only. "Whosoever will receive, <i>i.e.</i> show unto such a child-like, unambitious disciple of mine, any act of kindness for my sake, I will consider it as done to myself."</p>
