<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:6">Matthew 18:6</span>. <i><b>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones</b></i> — But, on the contrary, whosoever shall cause one of the least of those who believe in me to be stumbled-to go into the spirit of the world, or give way to sin - such a one shall meet with the most exemplary punishment.</p>
<p>Let those who act the part of the devil, in tempting others to sin, hear this declaration of our Lord, and tremble.</p>
<p><i><b>A millstone</b></i> — μυλος ονικος, <i>an ass's millstone</i>, because in ancient times, before the invention of <i>wind</i> and <i>water mills</i>, the stones were turned sometimes by <i>slaves</i>, but commonly by <i>asses</i> or <i>mules</i>. The most ancient kind of mills among the inhabitants of the northern nations, was the <i>quern</i>, or hand-mill. In some places in Ireland, Scotland, and the Zetland Isles, these still exist.</p>
<p><i><b>Drowned in the depth of the sea.</b></i> — It is supposed that in Syria, as well as in Greece, this mode of punishing criminals was practised; especially in cases of parricide; and when a person was devoted to destruction for the public safety, as in cases of plague, famine, &amp;c. That this was the custom in Greece, we learn from the Scholiast on the <i>Equites</i> of Aristophanes, Οταν γαρ κατεποντουν τινας, βαρος απο των τραχηλων εκρεμων. When a person was drowned, they hung a weight, (υπερβολον λιθον, Suidas,) a vast stone about his neck. See the ancient Scholia upon the <i>Equites</i>, lin. 1360, and Suidas, in υπερβολον λιθον. We find also that it was a positive institute of the ancient Hindoo law. "If a woman," says the precept, "causes any person to take poison, sets fire to any person's house, or murders a man, then the magistrate, having <i>bound a stone to her neck, shall drown her</i>." Halhead's Code of Gentoo Laws, 4to. edition, page 306.</p>
