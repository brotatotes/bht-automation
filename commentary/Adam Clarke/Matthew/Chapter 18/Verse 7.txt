<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:7">Matthew 18:7</span>. <i><b>Wo!</b></i> — Or, <i>alas</i>! ουαι. It is the opinion of some eminent critics, that this word is ever used by our Lord to express <i>sympathy</i> and <i>concern</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Because of offences</b></i> — Scandals, stumbling-blocks, persecutions, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>For it must needs be that offences come</b></i> — Αναγκε γαρ εϚιν ελθειν τα σκανδαλα, <i>for the coming of offences is unavoidable</i>. Such is the wickedness of men, such their obstinacy, that they will not come unto Christ that they may have life, but desperately continue <i>deceiving</i> and being <i>deceived</i>. In such a state of things, offences, stumbling-blocks, persecutions, &amp;c., are unavoidable.</p>
<p><i><b>Wo to that man</b></i> — He who <i>gives</i> the offence, and he who <i>receives</i> it, are both exposed to ruin.</p>
