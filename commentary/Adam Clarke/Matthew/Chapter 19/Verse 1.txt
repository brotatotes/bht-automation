<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span>. <i><b>Beyond Jordan</b></i> — Or, <i>by the side of Jordan</i>. Matthew begins here to give an account of Christ's journey (the only one he mentions) to Jerusalem, a little before the passover, at which he was crucified. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1">Mark 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span>.</p>
<p>Jesus came from Galilee (which lay to the north of Judea) into the coasts of Judea; and from thence, in his way to Jerusalem, he went through Jericho, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:17">Matthew 20:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:29">Matthew 20:29</span>,) which lay at the distance of sixty furlongs, or seven miles and a half from Jordan, to the western side of it. See Joseph. WAR, book iv. chap. 8. sect. 3. It seems, therefore, most probable, that the course of Christ's journey led him <i>by the side</i> of the river Jordan, not <i>beyond</i> it. That the Greek word περαν, especially with a <i>genitive</i> case as here, has sometimes this signification, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:22">John 6:22</span>; see also Bp. Pearce.</p>
