<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:10">Matthew 19:10</span>. <i><b>If the case of the man</b></i> — του ανθρωπου, <i>of a husband</i>, so I think the word should be translated here. The <i>Codex Bezae,</i> <i>Armenian</i>, and most of the <i>Itala</i>, have του ανδρος, which, perhaps, more properly signifies a <i>husband</i>, though both words are used in this sense.</p>
<p>Our word <i>husband</i> comes from the Anglo-Saxon, <i>hus</i> and <i>band</i>: the <i>bond</i> of the <i>house</i>, anciently spelt <i>housebond</i>, - so in my old MS. Bible. It is a lamentable case when the husband, instead of being the <i>bond</i> and <i>union</i> of the family, <i>scatters</i> and <i>ruins</i> it by <i>dissipation, riot</i>, and <i>excess</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>It is not good to marry.</b></i> — That is, if a man have not the liberty to put away his wife when she is displeasing to him. God had said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:18">Genesis 2:18</span>, It is not good for man to be alone, i.e. unmarried. The disciples seem to say, that if the husband have not the power to divorce his wife when she is displeasing to him, <i>it is not good for him to marry</i>. Here was a flat contradiction to the decision of the Creator. There are difficulties and trials in all states; but let marriage and celibacy be weighed fairly, and I am persuaded the former will be found to have fewer than the latter. However, before we enter into an engagement which nothing but <i>death</i> can <i>dissolve</i>, we had need to act cautiously, carefully consulting the <i>will</i> and <i>word</i> of God. Where an unbridled <i>passion</i>, or a <i>base love of money</i>, lead the way, marriage is sure to be miserable.</p>
