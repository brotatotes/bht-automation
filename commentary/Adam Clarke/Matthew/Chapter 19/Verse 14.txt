<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:14">Matthew 19:14</span>. <i><b>Of such is the kingdom of heaven.</b></i> â€” Or, <i>the kingdom</i> <i>of heaven is composed of such</i>. This appears to be the best sense of the passage, and utterly ruins the whole inhuman diabolic system of what is called non-elect infants' damnation; a doctrine which must have sprung from Moloch, and can only be defended by a heart in which he dwells. A great part of God's kingdom is composed of such <i>literally</i>; and those only who resemble little children shall be received into it: see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:3">Matthew 18:3</span>. Christ loves little children because he loves simplicity and innocence; he has sanctified their very age by passing through it himself - the holy Jesus was once a <i>little child</i>.</p>
