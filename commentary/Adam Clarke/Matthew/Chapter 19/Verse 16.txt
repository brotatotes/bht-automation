Verse Matthew 19:16. One came — Instead of εις one, several MSS., the Slavonic version, and Hilary, read νεανισκος τις, a certain young man.Good, c.] Much instruction may be had from seriously attending to the conduct, spirit, and question of this person.1. He came running, (Mark 10:17,) for he was deeply convinced of the importance of his business, and seriously determined to seek so as to find.2. He kneeled, or caught him by the knees, thus evidencing his humility, and addressing himself only to mercy. See Matthew 17:14.3. He came in the spirit of a disciple, or scholar, desiring to be taught a matter of the utmost importance to him - Good teacher.4. He came in the spirit of obedience he had worked hard to no purpose, and he is still willing to work, provided he can have a prospect of succeeding - What good thing shall I do?5. His question was the most interesting and important that any soul can ask of God - How shall I be saved?
