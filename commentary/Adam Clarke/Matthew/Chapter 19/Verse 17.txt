<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:17">Matthew 19:17</span>. <i><b>Why callest thou me good?</b></i> — Or, <i>Why dost thou</i> <i>question me concerning that good thing</i>? τι με ερωτας περι του αγαθου. This important reading is found in BDL, three others, <i>the</i> <i>Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, Ethiopic</i>, latter <i>Syriac, Vulgate,</i> <i>Saxon</i>, all the <i>Itala</i> but one, <i>Origen, Eusebius, Cyril, Dionysius</i> <i>Areop., Antiochus, Novatian, Jerome, Augustin</i>, and <i>Juvencus.</i> <i>Erasmus, Grotius, Mill</i>, and <i>Bengel</i> approve of this reading. This authority appears so decisive to <i>Griesbach</i> that he has received this reading into the text of his second edition, which in the <i>first</i> he had <i>interlined</i>. And instead of, <i>None is good but the one</i> <i>God</i>, he goes on to read, on nearly the same respectable authorities, εις εϚιν ο αγαθος. <i>There is one who is good</i>. Let it be observed also that, in the 16th verse, instead of διδασκαλε αγαθε, <i>good teacher</i>, διδασκαλε only is read by BDL, one other, one Evangelistarium, the <i>Ethiopic</i>, three of the <i>Itala, Origen</i>, and <i>Hilary</i>. The whole passage therefore may be read thus: <i>O teacher!</i> <i>what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? And he</i> <i>said unto him, Why dost thou question me concerning that good</i> <i>thing? There is one that is good.</i> (Or <i>he who is good is one</i>.) <i>But If thou art willing to enter into that life, keep the</i> <i>commandments</i>. This passage, as it stood in the common editions, has been considered by some writers as an incontrovertible proof against the Divinity or Godhead of Christ. A very learned person, in his note on this place, thus concludes concerning it: "Therefore our Saviour cannot be GOD: and the notion of, I know not what, a <i>trinity</i> in <i>unity</i>, THREE <i>Gods</i> in ONE, is here proved beyond all controversy, by the unequivocal declaration of JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF, to be ERRONEOUS and IMPOSSIBLE." Not so. One of the greatest critics in Europe, not at all <i>partial</i> to the <i>Godhead</i> of Christ, has admitted the above readings into his text, on evidence which he judged to be unexceptionable. If they be the true readings, they destroy the whole doctrine built on this text; and indeed the utmost that the enemies of the trinitarian doctrine can now expect from their formidable opponents, concerning this text, is to leave it <i>neuter</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Keep the commandments.</b></i> — From this we may learn that God's great design, in giving his law to the Jews, was to lead them to the expectation and enjoyment of eternal life. But as all the law referred to Christ, and he became the end of the law for righteousness (justification) to all that believe, so he is to be received, in order to have the <i>end</i> accomplished which the law proposed.</p>
