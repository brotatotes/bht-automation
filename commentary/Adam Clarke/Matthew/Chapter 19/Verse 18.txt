<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:18">Matthew 19:18</span>. <i><b>Thou shalt do no murder</b></i>, &amp;c.] But some say these commandments are not binding on <i>us</i>. Vain, deceived men! Can a murderer, an adulterer, a thief, and a liar enter into eternal life? No. The God of purity and justice has forbidden it. But we are not to keep these commandments in order to <i>purchase</i> eternal life. Right. Neither Jesus Christ, nor his genuine messengers, say you are. To save your souls, Christ must save you <i>from</i> your sins, and enable you to walk before him in <i>newness of life</i>.</p>
