<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:19">Matthew 19:19</span>. <i><b>Honour thy father and</b></i><b> thy </b><i><b>mother</b></i> — σου <i>thy</i>, is omitted by almost every MS. of respectability.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</b></i> — <i>Self-love</i>, as it is generally called, has been grievously declaimed against, even by religious people, as a most pernicious and dreadful evil. But they have not understood the subject on which they spoke. They have denominated that intense <i>propensity</i> which unregenerate men feel to gratify their carnal appetites and vicious passions, <i>self-love</i>; whereas it might be more properly termed <i>self-hatred</i> or <i>self-murder</i>. If I am to love my neighbour as <i>myself</i> and this "love worketh no ill to its neighbour," then <i>self-love</i>, in the sense in which our Lord uses it, is something excellent. It is properly a disposition essential to our nature, and inseparable from our being, by which we <i>desire</i> to be happy, by which we <i>seek</i> the happiness we have not, and rejoice in it when we possess it. In a word, it is a uniform wish of the soul to avoid all evil, and to enjoy all good. Therefore, he who is wholly governed by <i>self-love</i>, properly and Scripturally speaking, will devote his whole soul to God, and earnestly and constantly seek all his peace, happiness, and salvation in the enjoyment of God. But <i>self-love</i> cannot make me happy. I am only the <i>subject</i> which receives the happiness, but am not the <i>object</i> that constitutes this happiness; for it is that <i>object</i>, properly speaking, that I love, and love not only for its own sake, but also for the sake of the happiness which I enjoy through it. "No man," saith the apostle, "ever hated his own flesh." But he that sinneth against God wrongeth his own soul, both of present and eternal salvation, and is so far from being governed by <i>self-love</i> that he is the implacable enemy of his best and dearest interests in both worlds.</p>
