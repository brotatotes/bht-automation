<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:20">Matthew 19:20</span>. <i><b>All these have I kept</b></i> — I have made these precepts the rule of my life. There is a difference worthy of notice between this and our Lord's word. He says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:17">Matthew 19:17</span>, τηρησον, <i>keep</i>, earnestly, diligently, as with watch and ward; probably referring not only to the <i>letter</i> but to the <i>spirit</i>. The young man modestly says, all these (εφυλαξα) have I <i>observed</i>; I have paid attention to, and endeavoured to regulate my conduct by them. I have <i>kept</i> them in <i>custody</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>From my youth</b></i> — Several MSS., versions, and fathers, leave out these words. <i>Grotius</i> and <i>Mill</i> approve of the omission, and <i>Griesbach</i> leaves them in the text with a note of suspicion. Perhaps the young man meant no more than that he had in general observed them, and considered them of continual obligation.</p>
<p><i><b>What lack I yet?</b></i> — He felt a troubled conscience, and a mind unassured of the approbation of God; and he clearly perceived that something was wanting to make him truly happy.</p>
