<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:22">Matthew 19:22</span>. <i><b>Went away sorrowful</b></i> — Men undergo great agony of mind while they are in suspense between the love of the world and the love of their souls. When the first absolutely predominates, then they enjoy a factitious rest through a false peace: when the latter has the upper hand, then they possess true tranquillity of mind, through that peace of God that passeth knowledge.</p>
<p><i><b>He had great possessions.</b></i> — And what were these in comparison of peace of conscience, and mental rest? Besides, he had unequivocal proof that these contributed nothing to his comfort, for he is now miserable even <i>while</i> he possesses them! And so will every soul be, who puts worldly goods in the place of the supreme God. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:22">Mark 10:22</span>.</p>
