<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:23">Matthew 19:23</span>. <i><b>A rich man shall hardly enter</b></i> â€” That is, into the <i>spirit</i> and <i>privileges</i> of the <i>Gospel</i> in <i>this world</i>, and through them into the <i>kingdom of glory</i>. Earthly riches are a great obstacle to salvation; because it is almost impossible to possess them, and not to set the heart upon them; and they who love the world have not the love of the Father in them. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15">1 John 2:15</span>. To be rich, therefore, is in general a great misfortune: but what rich man can be convinced of this? It is only God himself who, by a miracle of mercy, can do this. Christ himself affirms the difficulty of the salvation of a rich man, with an oath, <i>verily</i>; but who of the rich either hears or believes him!</p>
