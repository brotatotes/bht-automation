<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:24">Matthew 19:24</span>. <i><b>A camel</b></i> — Instead of καμηλον, <i>camel</i>, six MSS. read καμιλον, <i>cable</i>, a mere gloss inserted by some who did not know that the other was a proverb common enough among the people of the east.</p>
<p>There is an expression similar to this in the <i>Koran</i>. "The impious, who in his arrogance shall accuse our doctrine of falsity, shall find the gates of heaven shut: nor shall he enter there <i>till a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle</i>. It is thus that we shall recompense the wicked." <i>Al</i> KORAN. <i>Surat</i> vii. ver. 37.</p>
<p>It was also a mode of expression common among the Jews, and signified a thing impossible. Hence this proverb: <i>A camel in</i> <i>Media dances in a cabe</i>; a measure which held about three pints. Again, <i>No man sees a palm tree of gold, nor an elephant passing</i> <i>through the eye of a needle</i>. Because these are impossible things. "Rabbi <i>Shesheth</i> answered Rabbi <i>Amram</i>, who had advanced an absurdity, <i>Perhaps thou art one of the Pembidithians who can make</i> <i>an elephant pass through the eye of a needle</i>; that is, says the <i>Aruch</i>, 'who speak things <i>impossible</i>.'" See <i>Lightfoot</i> and <i>Schoettgen</i> on this place.</p>
<p><i><b>Go through</b></i> — But instead of διελθειν, about eighty MSS. with several versions and fathers, have εισελθειν, <i>to enter in</i>; but the difference is of little importance in an English translation, though of some consequence to the elegance of the Greek text.</p>
