<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:25">Matthew 19:25</span>. <i><b>Who can be saved?</b></i> â€” The question of the disciples seemed to intimate that most people were <i>rich</i>, and that therefore scarcely any could be saved. They certainly must have attached a different meaning to what constitutes a <i>rich man</i>, to what we in general do. Who is a <i>rich man</i> in our Lord's sense of the word? This is a very important question, and has not, that I know of, been explicitly answered. A <i>rich man</i>, in my opinion, is not one who has so many <i>hundreds</i> or <i>thousands more</i> than some of his neighbours; but is one who <i>gets more</i> than is necessary to supply all his own wants, and those of his household, and <i>keeps</i> the residue still to himself, though the poor are starving through lack of the necessaries of life. In a word, he is a man who <i>gets</i> all he can, <i>saves</i> all he can, and <i>keeps</i> all he has gotten. Speak, <i>reason</i>! Speak, <i>conscience</i>! (for <i>God</i> has already spoken) Can such a person enter into the kingdom of God? ALL, NO!!!</p>
