<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:27">Matthew 19:27</span>. <i><b>We have forsaken all</b></i> — "A poor <i>all</i>," says one, "a parcel of rotten nets." No matter - they were <i>their</i> ALL, whether <i>rotten</i> or <i>sound</i>; besides, they were the <i>all</i> they got their bread by; and such an <i>all</i> as was quite sufficient for that purpose: and let it be observed, that that man forsakes <i>much</i> who reserves <i>nothing</i> to himself, and renounces all expectations from this world, taking God alone for his <i>portion</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:20">Matthew 4:20</span>.</p>
<p>To <i>forsake all</i>, without <i>following Christ</i>, is the virtue of a <i>philosopher</i>. To <i>follow Christ</i> in profession, without <i>forsaking</i> <i>all</i>, is the <i>state</i> of the <i>generality</i> of <i>Christians</i>. But to <i>follow Christ</i> and <i>forsake all</i>, is the <i>perfection</i> of a <i>Christian.</i></p>
<p><i><b>What shall we have therefore?</b></i> — τι αρα εσται ημιν, <i>What</i> REWARD <i>shall we get</i>? This <i>Kypke</i> proves to be the meaning of the words from some of the best Greek writers.</p>
