<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>. <i><b>Ye which have followed me, in the regeneration, when</b></i><b> </b><i><b>the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory</b></i><b>, c.</b>] The punctuation which I have observed here, is that which is followed by the most eminent critics: the <i>regeneration</i> is thus referred to the <i>time</i> when Jesus <i>shall sit</i> on the <i>throne</i> of his <i>glory</i>, and not to the <i>time</i> of <i>following</i> him, which is utterly improper.</p>
<p>The <i>regeneration</i>, παλιγγενεσια. Some refer this to the time in which <i>the new heavens and the new earth</i> shall be created, and the <i>soul and body united</i>. The Pythagoreans termed that παλιγγενεσια, when, according to their doctrine of the transmigration or metempsychosis, the soul entered into a <i>new body</i>, and got into a <i>new state of being</i>. <i>Clement</i>, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, calls the restoration of the world, after the deluge, by the same name.</p>
<p><i><b>Judging the twelve tribes</b></i> — From the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:28-30">Luke 22:28-30</span>, it is evident that <i>sitting on thrones</i>, and <i>judging the twelve</i> <i>tribes</i>, means simply obtaining eternal salvation, and the <i>distinguishing</i> privileges of the kingdom of glory, by those who continued faithful to Christ in his sufferings and death.</p>
<p><i>Judging</i>, κρινοντες. <i>Kypke</i> has shown that κρινεσθαι is to be understood in the sense of <i>governing, presiding, holding</i> the <i>first</i> or most <i>distinguished place</i>. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:16">Genesis 49:16</span>, <i>Dan shall</i> JUDGE <i>his people</i>, i.e. shall <i>preside</i> in, or <i>rule</i> over them shall occupy a <i>chief place</i> among the tribes. It is well known that the <i>Judges</i> among the Jews were <i>moderators,</i> <i>captains, chief</i>, or <i>head</i> men. The sense therefore of our Lord's words appears to be, that these disciples should have those <i>distinguished</i> seats in glory which seem to belong peculiarly to the first confessors and martyrs. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:14">1 Thessalonians 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>, and particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4-6">Revelation 20:4-6</span>.</p>
<p>The last-quoted passage brings into view the doctrine of the <i>Millennium</i>, when Jesus, after having formed the new heavens and the new earth, shall reign here gloriously among his ancients 365,000 years; for the <i>thousand</i> years referred to above are certainly <i>prophetical</i> years, in which, it is well known, each <i>day</i> stands for a <i>year</i>.</p>
<p>Others, of no mean note, are of opinion that the <i>regeneration</i> means the <i>conversion of men</i> by the <i>preaching of the Gospel </i>- that <i>sitting on twelve thrones</i> signifies the <i>state</i> of <i>eminent dignity</i> to which the apostles should be raised - and that <i>judging the twelve</i> <i>tribes of Israel</i>, means no more than exercising <i>authority</i> in the Church, and dispensing <i>laws</i> to the people of God. But I confess I do not see the propriety of this application of the terms, as the following verse seems to fix the meaning mentioned above.</p>
