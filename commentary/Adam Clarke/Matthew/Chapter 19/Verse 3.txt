<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:3">Matthew 19:3</span>. <i><b>Tempting him</b></i> — Trying what answer he would give to a question, which, however decided by him, would expose him to censure.</p>
<p><i><b>Is it lawful - for every cause?</b></i> — Instead of αιτιαν, <i>fault, cause,</i> <i>reason</i>, three MSS. and the <i>Coptic</i> version read αμαρτιαν, <i>sin</i> or <i>transgression</i>: this was probably the original reading-the first syllable being lost, αρτιαν alone would remain, which a subsequent transcriber would suppose to be a mistake for αιτιαν, and so wrote it; hence this various reading. What made our Lord's situation at present so critical in respect to this question was: At this time there were two famous divinity and philosophical <i>schools</i> among the Jews, that of SHAMMAI, and that of HILLEL. On the question of <i>divorce</i>, the school of <i>Shammai</i> maintained, that a man could not legally put away his wife, except for <i>whoredom</i>. The school of <i>Hillel</i> taught that a man might put away his wife for a multitude of other causes, and when she did not <i>find grace in his sight</i>; i.e. when he saw any other woman that pleased him better. See the case of <i>Josephus</i>, mentioned in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:31">Matthew 5:31</span><i>"</i>, and Calmet's Comment, vol. i. part ii. p. 379. By answering the question, not from <i>Shammai</i> or <i>Hillel</i>, but from <i>Moses</i>, our blessed Lord defeated their malice, and confounded their devices.</p>
