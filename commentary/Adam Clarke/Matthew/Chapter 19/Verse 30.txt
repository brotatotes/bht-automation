<p>Verse 30. <i><b>But many</b></i><b> that are </b><i><b>first</b></i><b>, &amp;c.</b>] The <i>Jews</i>, who have been the <i>first</i> and most <i>distinguished</i> people of God, will in general reject the Gospel of my grace, and be consequently rejected by me. The <i>Gentiles</i>, who have had no name among the living, shall be brought to the <i>knowledge</i> of the <i>truth</i>, and become the <i>first</i>, the <i>chief</i>, and most <i>exalted</i> people of God. That this prediction of our Lord has been <i>literally</i> fulfilled, the present state of the Christian and Jewish Churches sufficiently proves. To illustrate this fully, and to demonstrate that the Jews and Gentiles were now put on an <i>equal</i> footing by the Gospel, our Lord speaks the following parable, which has been unhappily divided from its <i>connection</i> by making it the beginning of a new chapter.</p>
