<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:4">Matthew 19:4</span>. <i><b>He which made them at the beginning</b></i> — When Adam and Eve were the first of human kind.</p>
<p><i><b>Made them male and female</b></i> — Merely through the design of matrimonial union, that the earth might be thus peopled. To answer a case of conscience, a man should act as Christ does here; pay no regard to that which the corruption of manners has introduced into Divine ordinances, but go back to the original <i>will, purpose</i>, and <i>institution</i> of God. Christ will never accommodate his morality to the <i>times</i>, nor to the inclinations of men. What was done at the <i>beginning</i> is what God judged most worthy of his <i>glory</i>, most profitable for <i>man</i>, and most suitable to <i>nature</i>.</p>
