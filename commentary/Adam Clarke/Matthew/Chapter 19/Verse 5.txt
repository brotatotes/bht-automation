<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:5">Matthew 19:5</span>. <i><b>For this cause</b></i> — Being created for this very purpose; that they might glorify their Maker in a matrimonial connection. <i>A man shall leave</i> (καταλειψαι, <i>wholly give up</i>) both <i>father and</i> <i>mother </i>- the matrimonial union being more <i>intimate</i> and binding than even paternal or filial affection;-and shall be <i>closely united</i>, προσκολληθησεται, <i>shall be firmly cemented</i> to his wife. A beautiful metaphor, which most forcibly intimates that nothing but <i>death</i> can separate them: as a <i>well-glued board</i> will break sooner in the <i>whole</i> wood, than in the <i>glued</i> joint. So also the Hebrew word דבק <i>debak</i> implies.</p>
<p><i><b>And they twain shall be one flesh?</b></i> — Not only meaning, that they should be considered as <i>one</i> body, but also as two souls in one body, with a complete union of interests, and an indissoluble partnership of life and fortune, comfort and support, desires and inclinations, joys and sorrows. Farther, it appears to me, that the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>, לבסר אחד lebasar achad, for one flesh, which our Lord literally translates, mean also, that <i>children</i>, compounded as it were of both, should be the product of the matrimonial connection. Thus, <i>they two</i> (man and woman) <i>shall be</i> for the producing of <i>one flesh,</i> the very same kind of human creature with themselves.
