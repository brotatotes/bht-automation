<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:6">Matthew 19:6</span>. <i><b>What therefore God hath joined together</b></i> — συνεζευξεν, <i>yoked together</i>, as <i>oxen in the plough</i>, where each must pull <i>equally</i>, in order to bring it on. Among the ancients, when persons were newly married, they put a <i>yoke</i> upon their necks, or <i>chains</i> upon their arms, to show that they were to be <i>one</i>, closely united, and pulling equally together in all the concerns of life. See KYPKE in loco.</p>
<p>The finest allegorical representation of the marriage union I have met with, is that antique gem representing the marriage of <i>Cupid</i> and <i>Psyche</i>, in the collection of the duke of Marlborough: it may be seen also among Baron <i>Stoch's</i> gems, and casts or copies of it in various other collections.</p>
<p>1. <i>Both</i> are represented as <i>winged</i>, to show the <i>alacrity</i> with which the husband and wife should help, comfort and support each ether; <i>preventing</i>, as much as possible, the <i>expressing</i> of a wish or want on either side, by fulfilling it <i>before</i> it can be expressed.</p>
<p>2. <i>Both</i> are <i>veiled</i>, to show that <i>modesty</i> is an inseparable attendant on <i>pure</i> matrimonial connections.</p>
<p>3. Hymen or Marriage goes before them with a lighted torch, leading them by a chain, of which each has a hold, to show that they are united together, and are <i>bound</i> to each other, and that they are led to this by the pure flame of love, which at the same instant both enlightens and warms them.</p>
<p>4. This <i>chain</i> is not <i>iron</i> nor <i>brass</i>, (to intimate that the marriage union is a state of <i>thraldom</i> or <i>slavery</i>,) but it is a chain of <i>pearls</i>, to show that the union is <i>precious, beautiful</i>, and <i>delightful</i>.</p>
<p>5. They hold a dove, the emblem of conjugal fidelity, which they appear to embrace affectionately, to show that they are faithful to each other, not merely through <i>duty</i>, but by affection, and that this fidelity contributes to the happiness of their lives.</p>
<p>6. A <i>winged</i> <i>Cupid</i>, or <i>Love</i>, is represented as having gone <i>before</i> them, preparing the <i>nuptial feast</i>; to intimate that <i>active affections,</i> <i>warm</i> and <i>cordial love</i>, are to be to them a continual source of <i>comfort</i> and <i>enjoyment</i>; and that this is the <i>entertainment</i> they are to meet with at every <i>step</i> of their affectionate lives.</p>
<p>7. <i>Another Cupid</i>, or genius of love comes <i>behind</i>, and places on their heads a <i>basket of ripe fruits</i>; to intimate that a matrimonial union of <i>this kind</i> will generally be blessed with <i>children</i>, who shall be as pleasing to all their <i>senses</i> as <i>ripe</i> and <i>delicious</i> <i>fruits</i> to the <i>smell</i> and <i>taste</i>.</p>
<p>8. The genius of love that <i>follows them</i> has his <i>wings shrivelled up</i>, or the <i>feathers all</i> <i>curled</i>, so as to render them utterly <i>unfit for flight</i>; to intimate that <i>love</i> is to <i>abide</i> with them, that there is to be no separation in affection, but that they are to continue to love one another with pure hearts fervently. Thus <i>love begins</i> and <i>continues</i> this sacred union; as to <i>end</i>, there can be none, for God hath yoked them together.</p>
<p>A finer or more expressive set of emblems has never, I believe, been produced, even by <i>modern</i> refined taste and ingenuity. This group of emblematical figures is engraved upon an onyx by Tryphon, an ancient Grecian artist. A fine drawing was made of this by Cypriani, and was engraved both by <i>Bartolozzi</i> and <i>Sherwin</i>. See one of these plates in the second volume of Bryant's Analysis of Ancient Mythology, page 392.</p>
