<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:8">Matthew 19:8</span>. <i><b>Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts</b></i> — It is dangerous to tolerate the least evil, though prudence itself may require it: because toleration, in this case, raises itself insensibly into permission, and permission soon sets up for command. Moses perceived that if divorce were not permitted, in many cases, the women would be exposed to great hardships through the <i>cruelty</i> of their husbands: for so the word σκληροκαρδια, is understood in this place by some learned men.</p>
<p><i><b>From the beginning it was not so</b></i> — The Jews named the books of the law from the <i>first</i> word in each. <i>Genesis</i> they always term <i>Bereshith</i>, בראשית, which is the <i>first</i> word in it, and signifies, <i>In the beginning</i>. It is probable that our Lord speaks in this way here, <i>In Bereshith it was not so</i>, intimating that the account given in <i>Genesis</i> is widely different. There was no <i>divorce</i> between Eve and Adam; nor did <i>he</i> or his family practise <i>polygamy</i>. But our Lord, by <i>the beginning</i>, may mean the original intention or design.</p>
