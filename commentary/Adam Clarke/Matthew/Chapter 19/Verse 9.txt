<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:9">Matthew 19:9</span>. <i><b>Except</b></i><b> it be </b><i><b>for fornication</b></i> — See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>. The decision of our Lord must be very unpleasant to these men: the reason why they wished to put away their wives was, that they might take others whom they liked better; but our Lord here declares that they could not be remarried while the divorced person was alive, and that those who did marry, during the life of the divorced, were <i>adulterers</i>; and heavy judgments were, denounced, in their law, against such: and as the question was not settled by the schools of <i>Shammai</i> and <i>Hillel</i>, so as to ground national practice on it therefore they were obliged to abide by the <i>positive declaration</i> of the law, as it was <i>popularly</i> understood, till these eminent schools had proved the word had another meaning. The grand subject of dispute between the two schools, mentioned above, was the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span>, <i>When a man hath taken a wife-and she find no grace in his sight,</i> <i>because of some</i> UNCLEANNESS, ערות <i>eruath</i>: - this the school of <i>Shammai</i> held to mean <i>whoredom</i> or <i>adultery</i>; but the school of <i>Hillel</i> maintained that it signified <i>any corporeal defect</i>, which rendered the person <i>deformed</i>, or any <i>bad temper</i> which made the husband's life uncomfortable. Any of the latter a good man might bear with; but it appears that Moses permitted the offended husband to put away the wife on <i>these</i> accounts, merely to save <i>her</i> from cruel usage.</p>
<p>In this discourse, our Lord shows that marriage, (except in one case,) is <i>indissoluble</i>, and should be so: -</p>
<p>1st, By Divine <i>institution</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:4">Matthew 19:4</span>.</p>
<p>2dly, By express <i>commandment</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:5">Matthew 19:5</span>.</p>
<p>3dly, Because the married couple become <i>one</i> and the <i>same person</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:6">Matthew 19:6</span>.</p>
<p>4thly, By the <i>example</i> of the <i>first pair</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:8">Matthew 19:8</span>; and</p>
<p>5thly, Because of the <i>evil</i> consequent on <i>separation</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:9">Matthew 19:9</span>. The <i>importance</i> of this subject will, I hope, <i>vindicate</i> or <i>excuse</i>, the <i>length</i> of these notes.</p>
