<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span>. <i><b>Bethlehem of Judea</b></i> — This city is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+17:7">Judges 17:7</span>, and must be distinguished from another of the same name in the tribe of Zebulon, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:15">Joshua 19:15</span>. It is likewise called <i>Ephrath</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:7">Genesis 48:7</span>, or <i>Ephratah</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>, and its inhabitants Ephrathites, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ru+1:2">Ruth 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:12">1 Samuel 17:12</span>. It is situated on the declivity of a hill, about six miles from Jerusalem. בית לחם <i>Beth-lechem</i>, in Hebrew, signifies <i>the house of bread</i>. And the name may be considered as very properly applied to that <i>place</i> where Jesus, the Messiah, the true bread that came down from heaven, was manifested, to give life to the world. But לחם <i>lehem</i> also signifies <i>flesh</i>, and is applied to that part of the sacrifice which was burnt upon the altar. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+3:11-16">Leviticus 3:11-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+21:6">Leviticus 21:6</span>. The word is also used to signify a <i>carcass</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:17">Zephaniah 1:17</span>. The Arabic version has [Arabic] <i>Beet lehem</i>, and the Persic [Persic] <i>Beet allehem</i>: but [Arabic] <i>lehem</i>, in Arabic, never signifies <i>bread</i>, but always means <i>flesh</i>. Hence it is more proper to consider the name as signifying <i>the house of flesh</i>, or, as some might suppose, <i>the house of the incarnation</i>, i.e. the place where <i>God was manifested in the flesh</i> for the salvation of a lost world.</p>
<p><i><b>In the days of Herod the king</b></i> — This was HEROD, improperly denominated the GREAT, the son of Antipater, an Idumean: he reigned 37 years in Judea, reckoning from the-time he was created-king of that country by the Romans. Our blessed Lord was born in the last year of his reign; and, at this time, the sceptre had literally departed from Judah, a <i>foreigner</i> being now upon the throne.</p>
<p>As there are several princes of this name mentioned in the New Testament, it may be well to give a list of them here, together with their genealogy.</p>
<p><i>Herod</i>, the <i>Great</i>, married ten wives, by whom he had several children, Euseb. l. i. c. 9. p. 27. The first was <i>Doris</i>, thought to be an Idumean, whom he married when but a private individual; by her he had <i>Antipater</i>, the eldest of all his sons, whom he caused to be executed five days before his own death.</p>
<p>His second wife was <i>Mariamne</i>, daughter to <i>Hircanus</i>, the sole surviving person of the <i>Asmonean</i>, or Maccabean, race. Herod put her to death. She was the mother of <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Aristobulus</i>, whom Herod had executed at Sebastia, (Joseph. Antiq. l. xvi. c. 13.-De Bello, l. i. c. 17,) on an accusation of having entered into a conspiracy against him. <i>Aristobulus</i> left three children, whom I shall notice hereafter.</p>
<p>His third wife was <i>Mariamne</i>, the daughter of <i>Simon</i>, a person of some note in Jerusalem, whom Herod made high priest, in order to obtain his daughter. She was the mother of <i>Herod Philippus</i>, or Herod Philip, and Salome. Herod or Philip married <i>Herodias</i>, mother to <i>Salome</i>, the famous dancer, who demanded the head of John the Baptist, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:22">Mark 6:22</span>. Salome had been placed, in the will of Herod the Great, as second heir after Antipater; but her name was erased, when it was discovered that Mariamne, her mother, was an accomplice in the crimes of Antipater, son of Herod the Great. Joseph de Bello, lib. i. c. 18,19,20.</p>
<p>His fourth wife was <i>Malthake</i>, a Samaritan, whose sons were <i>Archelaus</i> and <i>Philip</i>. The first enjoyed half his father's kingdom under the name of <i>tetrarch</i>, viz. Idumea, Judea, and Samaria: Joseph. Antiq. l. xvii. c. 11. He reigned nine years; but, being accused and arraigned before the Emperor Augustus, he was banished to Vienna, where he died: Joseph. Antiq. l. xvii. c. 15. This is the Archelaus mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:22">Matthew 2:22</span>.</p>
<p>His brother <i>Philip</i> married <i>Salome</i>, the famous dancer, the daughter of Herodias; he died without children, and she was afterwards married to Aristobulus.</p>
<p>The fifth wife of Herod the Great was <i>Cleopatra</i> of Jerusalem. She was the mother of Herod surnamed Antipas, who married Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, while he was still living. Being reproved for this act by John the Baptist, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3">Matthew 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:17">Mark 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:19">Luke 3:19</span>, and having imprisoned this holy man, he caused him to be beheaded, agreeable to the promise he had rashly made to the daughter of his wife Herodias, who had pleased him with her dancing. He attempted to seize the person of Jesus Christ, and to put him to death. It was to this prince that Pilate sent our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:31-32">Luke 13:31-32</span>. He was banished to Lyons, and then to Spain, where both he and his wife Herodias died. Joseph. Antiq. l. xv. c. 14.-De Bello, l. ii. c. 8.</p>
<p>The sixth wife of Herod the Great was <i>Pallas</i>, by whom he had Phasaelus: his history is no ways connected with the New Testament.</p>
<p>The seventh was named <i>Phoedra</i>, the mother of <i>Roxana</i>, who married the son of <i>Pheroras</i>.</p>
<p>The eighth was <i>Elpida</i>, mother of <i>Salome</i>, who married another son of <i>Pheroras</i>.</p>
<p>With the names of two other wives of Herod we are not acquainted; but they are not connected with our history, any more than are <i>Pallas, Phoedra</i>, and <i>Elpida</i>, whose names I merely notice to avoid the accusation of inaccuracy.</p>
<p>ARISTOBULUS, the son of Herod the Great by Mariamne, a descendant of the Asmoneans, left two sons and a daughter, viz. <i>Agrippa, Herod</i>, and <i>Herodias</i>, so famous for her incestuous marriage with <i>Antipas</i>, in the life-time of his brother <i>Philip</i>.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA, otherwise named <i>Herod</i>, who was imprisoned by Tiberius for something he had inconsiderately said against him, was released from prison by Caligula, who made him king of Judea: Joseph. Antiq. l. xviii. c. 8. It was this prince who put St. James to death, and imprisoned Peter, as mentioned in xii. of Acts. He died at Caesarea, in the way mentioned in the Acts, as well as by Josephus, Antiq. l. xix. c. 7. He left a son named Agrippa, who is mentioned below.</p>
<p>HEROD, the <i>second</i> son of Aristobulus, was king of Chalcis, and, after the death of his brother, obtained permission of the emperor to keep the ornaments belonging to the high priest, and to nominate whom he pleased to that office: Joseph. Antiq. l. xx. c. 1. He had a son named Aristobulus, to whom Nero gave Armenia the lesser, and who married <i>Salome</i>, the famous dancer, daughter to Herodias.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA, son of Herod Agrippa, king of Judea, and grandson to Aristobulus and Mariamne; he was at first king of Chalcis, and afterwards tetrarch of Galilee, in the room of his uncle Philip: Joseph. Antiq. l. xx. c. 5. It was before him, his sister <i>Berenice</i>, and <i>Felix</i>, who had married <i>Drusilla</i>, Agrippa's second daughter, that St. Paul pleaded his cause, as mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:0">Acts 26:0</span>.</p>
<p>HERODIAS, the daughter of Mariamne and Aristobulus, is the person of whom we have already spoken, who married successively the two brothers <i>Philip</i> and <i>Antipas</i>, her uncles, and who occasioned the death of John the Baptist. By her first husband she had <i>Salome</i>, the dancer, who was married to <i>Philip</i>, tetrarch of the Trachonitis, the son of Herod the Great. Salome having had no children by him, she was married to Aristobulus, her cousin-german, son of Herod, king of Chalcis, and brother to Agrippa and Herodias: she had by this husband several children.</p>
<p>This is nearly all that is necessary to be known relative to the race of the Herods, in order to distinguish the particular persons of this family mentioned in the New Testament. See <i>Basnage</i>, <i>Calmet</i>, and <i>Josephus</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>There came wise men from the east</b></i> — Or, <i>Magi came from the</i> <i>eastern countries</i>. "The Jews believed that there were prophets in the kingdom of <i>Saba</i> and <i>Arabia</i>, who were of the posterity of <i>Abraham</i> by <i>Keturah</i>; and that they taught in the name of God, what they had received in tradition from the mouth of <i>Abraham</i>." - WHITBY. That many Jews were mixed with this people there is little doubt; and that these eastern <i>magi</i>, or philosophers, astrologers, or whatever else they were, might have been <i>originally</i> of that class, there is room to believe. These, knowing the promise of the Messiah, were now, probably, like other believing Jews, waiting for the consolation of Israel. The Persic translator renders the Greek μαγοι by [Persic] <i>mejooseean</i>, which properly signifies a <i>worshipper of fire</i>; and from which we have our word <i>magician</i>. It is very probable that the ancient Persians, who were considered as <i>worshippers of fire</i>, only honoured it as the symbolical representation of the Deity; and, seeing this unusual appearance, might consider it as a sign that the God they worshipped was about to manifest himself among men. Therefore they say, We have seen his <i>star </i>- and are come to worship <i>him</i>; but it is most likely that the Greeks made their μαγοι <i>magi</i>, which we translate <i>wise men</i>, from the Persian [Persian] <i>mogh</i>, and [Persian] <i>moghan</i>, which the <i>Kushuf ul Loghat</i>, a very eminent Persian lexicon, explains by [Persian] <i>atush perest</i>, <i>a worshipper of fire</i>; which the Persians suppose all the inhabitants of <i>Ur</i> in Chaldea were, among whom the Prophet Abraham was brought up. The Mohammedans apply this title by way of <i>derision</i> to <i>Christian monks</i> in their <i>associate</i> capacity; and by a yet stronger <i>catachresis</i>, they apply it to a <i>tavern</i>, and the <i>people that frequent it</i>. Also, to ridicule in the most forcible manner the Christian <i>priesthood</i>, they call the <i>tavern-keeper</i> [Arabic], <i>peeri Mughan</i>, the <i>priest</i>, or <i>chief of</i> <i>the idolaters</i>. It is very probable that the persons mentioned by the evangelist were a sort of astrologers, probably of Jewish extraction, that they lived in Arabia-Felix, and, for the reasons above given, came to worship their new-born sovereign. It is worthy of remark, that the Anglo-saxon translates the word μαγοι by [Anglo-Saxon], which signifies <i>astrologers</i>, from [Anglo-Saxon] a <i>star</i> or <i>planet</i>, and [Anglo-Saxon], to <i>know</i> or <i>understand</i>.</p>
