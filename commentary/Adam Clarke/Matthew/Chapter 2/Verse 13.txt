<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:13">Matthew 2:13</span>. <i><b>Flee into Egypt</b></i> â€” Many Jews had settled in Egypt; not only those who had fled thither in the time of Jeremiah, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+48:0">Jeremiah 48:0</span>; but many others who had settled there also, on account of the temple which <i>Onias</i> IV. had built at <i>Heliopolis</i>. Those who could speak the Greek tongue enjoyed many advantages in that country: besides, they had the Greek version of the Septuagint, which had been translated nearly 300 years before this time. Egypt was now a Roman province, and the rage of Herod could not pursue the holy family to this place. There is an apocryphal work in Arabic, called <i>the Gospel of the infancy</i>, which pretends to relate all the acts of Jesus and Mary while in Egypt. I have taken the pains to read this through, and have found it to be a piece of gross superstition, having nothing to entitle it to a shadow of credibility.</p>
