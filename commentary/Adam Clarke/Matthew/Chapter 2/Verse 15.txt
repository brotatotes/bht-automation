<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:15">Matthew 2:15</span>. <i><b>Out of Egypt have I called my son.</b></i> â€” This is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+11:1">Hosea 11:1</span>, where the deliverance of Israel, and that only, is referred to. But as that deliverance was extraordinary, it is very likely that it had passed into a proverb, so that "Out of Egypt have I called my son," might have been used to express any signal deliverance. I confess, I can see no other reference it can have to the case in hand, unless we suppose, which is possible, that God might have referred to this <i>future</i> bringing up of his son Jesus from Egypt, under the type of the past deliverance of Israel from the same land. <i>Midrash Tehillin</i>, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>, has these remarkable words: <i>I will publish a decree</i>: this decree has been published in the <i>Law</i>, in the <i>Prophets</i>, and in the <i>Hagiographia</i>. In the <i>Law, Israel is my first-born son</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:22">Exodus 4:22</span>. In the <i>Prophets, Behold, my servant shall deal prudently</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:13">Isaiah 52:13</span>. In the <i>Hagiographia, The Lord said unto my lord</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span>. All these passages the Jews refer to the Messiah. See <i>Schoetgen</i>.</p>
