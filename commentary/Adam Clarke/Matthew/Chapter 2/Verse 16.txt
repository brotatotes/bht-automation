<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span>. <i><b>Slew all the children</b></i> â€” This cruelty of Herod seems alluded to in very decisive terms by <i>Macrobius</i>, who flourished toward the conclusion of the fourth Century. In his chapter <i>De</i> <i>jocis Augusti in alios, et aliorum rursus in ipsum</i>, he says, <i>Cum</i> <i>audisset inter pueros, quos in Syria Herodes, rex Judeorum, intra</i> <i>bimatum jussit interfici, filium quoque ejus occisum, ait, Melius</i> <i>est Herodis</i> PORCUM <i>esse, quam</i> FILIUM. "When he heard that among those male infants about two years old, which Herod, the king of the Jews, ordered to be slain in Syria, one of his sons was also murdered, he said: 'It is better to be Herod's HOG than his SON.'" Saturn. lib. ii. c. 4. The <i>point</i> of this saying consists in this, that Herod, professing Judaism, his religion forbade his killing <i>swine</i>, or having any thing to do with their flesh; therefore his <i>hog</i> would have been safe, where his <i>son</i> lost his life.</p>
