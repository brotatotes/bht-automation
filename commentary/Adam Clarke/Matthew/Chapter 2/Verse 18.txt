<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:18">Matthew 2:18</span>. <i><b>In Rama was there a voice heard</b></i> — These words, quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:15">Jeremiah 31:15</span>, were originally spoken concerning the captivity of the ten tribes; but are here elegantly applied to the murder of the innocents at Bethlehem. As if he had said, Bethlehem at this time resembled Rama; for as Rachel might be said to weep over her children, which were slaughtered or gone into captivity; so in Bethlehem, the mothers lamented bitterly their children, because they were slain. The word θρηνος, <i>lamentation</i> is omitted by the Codd. <i>Vatic. Cypr</i>. one of <i>Selden's</i> MSS. the <i>Syriac, Arabic</i>, <i>Persic, AEthiopic</i>, all the <i>Itala</i>, (except that in the Cod. Bezae,) <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Saxon</i>, several of the fathers, and above all <i>Jeremiah</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:15">Jeremiah 31:15</span>, from which it is quoted. Griesbach leaves it in the text with a note of doubtfulness. This mourning may refer to cases far from uncommon in the <i>east</i>, where all the children have been massacred. The lamentations of a Hindoo mother for her child are loud and piercing; and it is almost impossible to conceive of a scene more truly heart-rending than that of a whole town of such mothers wailing over their massacred children.
