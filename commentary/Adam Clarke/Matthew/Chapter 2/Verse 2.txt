<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:2">Matthew 2:2</span>. <i><b>We have seen his star</b></i> — Having discovered an unusual luminous appearance or meteor in the heavens, supposing these persons to have been Jews, and knowing the prophecies relative to the redemption of Israel, they probably considered this to be the <i>star</i> mentioned by Balaam, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:17">Numbers 24:17</span>. See the note there.</p>
<p><i><b>In the east</b></i> — εν τη ανατολη, At its rise. ανατολη and δυσην are used in the New Testament for <i>east</i> and <i>west</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To worship him.</b></i> — Or, <i>To do him homage</i>; προσκυνησαι αυτω. The word προσκυνεω, which is compounded of προς, <i>to</i>, and κυων, <i>a dog</i>, signifies to <i>crouch</i> and <i>fawn</i> like a dog at his master's feet. It means, to prostrate oneself to another, according to the eastern custom, which is still in use. In this act, <i>the person</i> <i>kneels, and puts his head between his knees, his forehead at the</i> <i>same time touching the ground</i>. It was used to express both civil and religious reverence. In Hindostan, religious homage is paid by prostrating the body at full length, so that the two knees, the two hands, forehead, nose, and cheeks all touch the earth at the same time. This kind of homage is paid also to great men. AYEEN AKBERY, vol. iii. p. 227.</p>
<p>As to what is here called a <i>star</i>, some make it a <i>meteor</i>, others a luminous appearance like an <i>Aurora Borealis</i>; others a <i>comet</i>! There is no doubt, the appearance was very striking: but it seems to have been a simple meteor provided for the occasion. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:9">Matthew 2:9</span>.</p>
