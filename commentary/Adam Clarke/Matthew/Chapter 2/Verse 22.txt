<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:22">Matthew 2:22</span>. <i><b>When he heard that Archelaus did reign</b></i> — Herod, having put Antipater his eldest son to death, altered his will, and thus disposed of his dominions: he gave the tetrarchy of Galilee and Petrea to his son Antipas; the tetrarchy of Gaulonitis, Trachonitis, Batanea, and Paneadis, to his son Philip; and left the kingdom of Judea to his eldest remaining son, Archelaus. This son partook of the cruel and blood-thirsty disposition of his father: at one of the passovers, he caused three thousand of the people to be put to death in the temple and city. For his tyranny and cruelty, Augustus deprived him of the government, and banished him. His character considered, Joseph, with great propriety, forbore to settle under his jurisdiction.</p>
<p><i><b>He turned aside into the parts of Galilee</b></i> — Here <i>Antipas</i> governed, who is allowed to have been of a comparatively mild disposition: and, being intent on building two cities, <i>Julias</i> and <i>Tiberias</i>, he endeavoured, by a mild carriage and promises of considerable immunities, to entice people from other provinces to come and settle in them. He was besides in a state of enmity with his brother Archelaus: this was a most favourable circumstance to the holy family; and though God did not permit them to go to any of the new cities, yet they dwelt in peace, safety, and comfort at Nazareth.</p>
