<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:23">Matthew 2:23</span>. <i><b>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>prophets</b></i> — It is difficult to ascertain by what prophets this was spoken. The margin usually refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:5">Judges 13:5</span>, where the angel, foretelling the birth of Samson, says, <i>No razor shall come</i> <i>upon his head; for the child shall be a</i> NAZARITE (נזיר <i>nezir</i>) <i>unto God from the womb</i>. The second passage usually referred to is <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span>: <i>There shall come forth a rod from the stem of Jesse, and a</i> BRANCH (נצר <i>netser</i>) <i>shall grow out of his roots</i>. That this refers to Christ, there is no doubt. Jeremiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:5">Jeremiah 23:5</span>, is supposed to speak in the same language - <i>I will raise unto David a righteous</i> BRANCH: but here the word is צמח <i>tsemach</i>, not נצר <i>netser</i>; and it is the same in the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:8">Zechariah 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:12">Zechariah 6:12</span>; therefore, these two prophets cannot be referred to; but the passages in <i>Judges</i> and <i>Isaiah</i> may have been in the eye of the evangelist, as well as the whole <i>institution</i> relative to the <i>Nazarite</i> (נזיר nezir) delivered at large, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:0">Numbers 6:0</span>:, where see the notes. As the Nazarite was the most <i>pure</i> and <i>perfect institution</i> under the law, it is possible that God intended to point out by it, not only the perfection of our Lord, but also the purity of his followers. And it is likely that, before St. Matthew wrote this Gospel, those afterwards called <i>Christians</i> bore the appellation of <i>Nazarites</i>, or <i>Nazoreans</i>, for so the Greek word, ναζωραιος, should be written. Leaving the spiritual reference out of the question, the <i>Nazarene</i> or <i>Nazorean</i> here may mean simply an <i>inhabitant</i> or person of <i>Nazareth</i>; as <i>Galilean</i> does a <i>person</i> or inhabitant of <i>Galilee</i>. The evangelist evidently designed to state, that neither the sojourning at Nazareth, nor our Lord being called a Nazarene, were <i>fortuitous</i> events, but were wisely determined and provided for in the providence of God; and therefore <i>foretold</i> by <i>inspired</i> men, or <i>fore-represented</i> by significant <i>institutions</i>.</p>
<p>But how shall we account for the manner in which St. Matthew and others apply this, and various other circumstances, to the fulfilment of ancient traditions? This question has greatly agitated divines and critics for more than a century. <i>Surenhusius</i>, Hebrew professor at Amsterdam, and editor of a very splendid and useful edition of the <i>Mishna</i>, in six vols. fol. published an express treatise on this subject, in 1713, full of deep research and sound criticism. He remarks great difference in the mode of <i>quoting</i> used in the Sacred Writings: as, <i>It hath been said </i>- <i>it is</i> <i>written </i>- <i>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the</i> <i>prophets </i>- <i>the Scripture says</i>-<i>see what is said </i>- <i>the Scripture</i> <i>foreseeing </i>- <i>he saith </i>- <i>is it not written? </i>- <i>the saying that is</i> <i>written</i>, c., c. With great pains and industry, he has collected <i>ten</i> rules out of the <i>Talmud</i> and the <i>rabbins</i>, to explain and justify all the quotations made from the Old Testament in the New.</p>
<p>RULE I. <i>Reading the words, not according to the regular vowel</i> <i>points, but to others substituted for them</i>. He thinks this is done by <i>Peter</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22-23">Acts 3:22-23</span> by <i>Stephen</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:42">Acts 7:42</span>, c. and by <i>Paul</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:54">1 Corinthians 15:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:15">2 Corinthians 8:15</span>.</p>
<p>RULE II. <i>Changing the letters</i>, as done by St. <i>Paul</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:9">Hebrews 8:9</span>., c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>.</p>
<p>RULE III. <i>Changing</i> both <i>letters</i> and <i>vowel points</i>, as he supposes is done by St. <i>Paul</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:40-41">Acts 13:40-41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:15">2 Corinthians 8:15</span>.</p>
<p>RULE IV. <i>Adding</i> some <i>letters</i>, and <i>retrenching</i> others.</p>
<p>RULE V. <i>Transposing words</i> and <i>letters</i>.</p>
<p>RULE VI. <i>Dividing</i> one word into <i>two</i>.</p>
<p>RULE VII. <i>Adding other words</i> to make the sense more <i>clear</i>.</p>
<p>RULE VIII. <i>Changing</i> the original <i>order</i> of the words.</p>
<p>RULE IX. <i>Changing the original order</i>, and <i>adding other words</i>.</p>
<p>RULE X. <i>Changing the original order</i>, and <i>adding</i> and <i>retrenching</i> words, which he maintains is a method often used by St. <i>Paul</i>.</p>
<p>Let it be observed, that although all these rules are used by the rabbins, yet, as far as they are employed by the sacred writers of the New Testament, they never, in any case, contradict what they quote from the Old, which cannot be said of the rabbins: they only <i>explain</i> what they quote, or <i>accommodate</i> the passage to the <i>facts</i> then in question. And who will venture to say that the Holy Spirit has not a right, in any subsequent period, to <i>explain</i> and <i>illustrate</i> his own meaning, by showing that it had a <i>greater</i> <i>extension</i> in the Divine mind than could have been then perceived by men? And has HE not a right to <i>add</i> to what he has formerly said, if it seem right in his own sight? Is not the whole of the New Testament, an <i>addition</i> to the <i>Old</i>, as the <i>apostolic</i> epistles are to the <i>narrative</i> of our Lord's <i>life</i> and <i>acts</i>, as given by the <i>evangelists</i>?</p>
<p><i>Gusset, Wolf, Rosenmuller</i>, and others, give <i>four</i> rules, according to which, the phrase, <i>that it might be fulfilled</i>, may be applied in the New Testament.</p>
<p>RULE I. When the thing predicted is <i>literally</i> accomplished.</p>
<p>RULE II. When that is done, of which the Scripture has spoken, not in a <i>literal</i> sense, but in a <i>spiritual</i> sense.</p>
<p>RULE III. When a thing is done neither in a <i>literal</i> nor <i>spiritual</i> sense, according to the fact referred to in the Scripture; but is <i>similar</i> to that fact.</p>
<p>RULE IV. When that which has been mentioned in the Old Testament as formerly done, is accomplished in a <i>larger</i> and more <i>extensive</i> <i>sense</i> in the New Testament.</p>
<p>St. Matthew seems to quote according to all these rules; and it will be useful to the reader to keep them constantly in view. I may add here, that the writers of the <i>New</i> Testament seem often to differ from those of the <i>Old</i>, because they appear uniformly to quote from some copy of the Septuagint version; and most of their quotations agree verbally, and often even <i>literally</i>, with <i>one</i> or <i>other</i> of the <i>copies</i> of that <i>version</i> which <i>subsist to the</i> <i>present day</i>. Want of attention to the difference of <i>copies</i>, in the <i>Septuagint</i> version, has led some divines and critics into strange and even ridiculous mistakes, as they have taken that for THE SEPTUAGINT which existed in the printed copy before them; which sometimes happened not to be the most correct.</p>
<p>ON the birth-place of our Lord, a pious and sensible man has made the following observations: -</p>
<p>"At the first sight, it seems of little consequence to know the <i>place</i> of Christ's nativity; for we should consider him as our Redeemer, whatever the circumstances might be which attended his mortal life. But, seeing it has pleased God to announce, beforehand, the place where the Saviour of the world should be born, it became necessary that it should happen precisely in that place; and that this should be one of the characteristics whereby Jesus Christ should be known to be the true Messiah.</p>
<p>"It is also a matter of small importance to us where we may live, provided we find genuine happiness. There is no place on earth, however poor and despicable, but may have better and more happy inhabitants than many of those are who dwell in the largest and most celebrated cities. Do we know a single place on the whole globe where the works of God do not appear under a thousand different forms, and where a person may not feel that blessed satisfaction which arises from a holy and Christian life? For an individual, that place is preferable to all others where he can <i>get</i> and <i>do</i> most good. For a number of people, that place is best where they can find the greatest number of wise and pious men. Every nation declines, in proportion as virtue and religion lose their influence on the minds of the inhabitants. The place where a young man first beheld the dawn and the beauty of renewed nature, and with most lively sensations of joy and gratitude adored his God, with all the veneration and love his heart was capable of; the place where a virtuous couple first met, and got acquainted; or where two friends gave each other the noblest proofs of their most tender affection; the village where one may have given, or seen, the most remarkable example of goodness, uprightness, and patience; such places, I say, must be dear to their hearts.</p>
<p>"Bethlehem was, according to this rule, notwithstanding its smallness, a most venerable place; seeing that there so many pious people had their abode, and that acts of peculiar piety had often been performed in it. First, the patriarch <i>Jacob</i> stopped some time in it, to erect a monument to his well-beloved <i>Rachel</i>. It was at Bethlehem that honest <i>Naomi</i>, and her modest daughter-in-law, <i>Ruth</i>, gave such proofs of their faith and holiness; and in it <i>Boaz</i>, the generous benefactor, had his abode and his possessions.</p>
<p>At Bethlehem the humble <i>Jesse</i> sojourned, the happy father of so many sons; the youngest of whom rose from the pastoral life to the throne of Israel. It was in this country that <i>David</i> formed the resolution of building a house for the Lord, and in which he showed himself the true shepherd and father of his subjects, when, at the sight of the destroying angel, whose sword spread consternation and death on all hands, he made intercession for his people. It was in Bethlehem that <i>Zerubbabel</i> the prince was born, this descendant of <i>David</i>, who was the type of that Ruler and Shepherd under whose empire Israel is one day to assemble, in order to enjoy uninterrupted happiness. Lastly, in this city the <i>Son of God</i> appeared; who, by his birth, laid the foundation of that salvation, which, as Redeemer, he was to purchase by his death for the whole world. Thus, in places which from their smallness are entitled to little notice, men sometimes spring, who become the benefactors of the human race. Often, an inconsiderable village has given birth to a man, who, by his wisdom, uprightness, and heroism, has been a blessing to whole kingdoms."</p>
