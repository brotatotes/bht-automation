<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4">Matthew 2:4</span>. <i><b>The chief priests</b></i> — Not only the <i>high priest</i> for the time being, called כהן הראש <i>cohen ha-rosh</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+25:18">2 Kings 25:18</span>, and his <i>deputy</i>, called כהן משנה <i>cohen mishneh</i>, with those who had formerly borne <i>the high priest's office</i>; but also, <i>the chiefs or</i> <i>heads of the twenty four sacerdotal families</i>, which David distributed into so many <i>courses</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+24:0">1 Chronicles 24:0</span>. These latter are styled סרי הכהנים <i>sarey ha-cohanim, chief of the priests</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+36:14">2 Chronicles 36:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ezr+8:24">Ezra 8:24</span>; and ראשי הכהנים <i>roshey ha-cohanim, heads of the priests</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ne+12:7">Nehemiah 12:7</span>. Josephus calls them by the same name as the writers of the New Testament. In his Life, sect. 8, he mentions πολλους - των αρχιερεων, MANY <i>of the chief priests</i>. The word is used in the singular in this last sense, for <i>a chief of the priests</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:14">Acts 19:14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Scribes</b></i> — The word γραμματευς, in the Septuagint, is used for a <i>political</i> officer, whose business it was to assist kings and civil magistrates, and to keep <i>an account in writing</i> of public acts and occurrences. Such an officer is called in Hebrew ספר המלך <i>seper</i> <i>hamelech</i>, ὁ γραμματευς του βασιλεως, <i>the king's scribe</i>, or <i>secretary</i>. See LXX. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+12:10">2 Kings 12:10</span>.</p>
<p>The word is often used by the LXX. for a <i>man of learning</i>, especially for one skilled in the <i>Mosaic law</i>: and, in the same sense, it is used by the New Testament writers. γραμματευς is therefore to be understood as always implying a <i>man of letters</i>, or <i>learning</i>, capable of instructing the people. The derivation of the names proves this to be the genuine meaning of the word γραμμα: a <i>letter</i>, or <i>character</i>, in writing: or γραμματα, <i>letters, learning, erudition</i>, and especially that gained from <i>books</i>. The Hebrew ספר or סופר <i>sopher</i>, from <i>saphar</i>, to <i>tell, count, cypher</i>, signifies both a book, volume, roll, c., and a notary, recorder, or historian and always signifies a <i>man of</i> <i>learning</i>. We often term such a person a man of letters.</p>
<p>The word is used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:35">Acts 19:35</span>, for a <i>civil magistrate</i> at Ephesus, probably such a one as we would term <i>recorder</i>. It appears that Herod at this time gathered the whole Sanhedrin, in order to get the fullest information on a subject by which all his jealous fears had been alarmed.</p>
