<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:5">Matthew 2:5</span>. <i><b>In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written by the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>prophet</b></i> — As there have been several confused notions among the Jews, relative not only to the Messiah, and his character, but also to the time of his birth, it may be necessary to add, to what has already been said on this subject, the following extracts from the Talmudists and Gemarists, quoted by LIGHTFOOT. At the close of a long dissertation on the year of our Lord's birth, (which he places in the 35th of the reign of Herod, not the last or 37th as above,) he says: "It will not be improper here to produce the <i>Gemarists</i> themselves openly confessing that the <i>Messias</i> had been born, a good while ago before their times. For so they write: <i>After this the children of Israel shall be converted, and shall</i> <i>inquire after the Lord their God, and David their king</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+3:5">Hosea 3:5</span>. <i>Our rabbins say, That is King Messias, If he be among the living,</i> <i>his name is David, or if dead, David is his name</i>. <i>R. Tanchum</i> <i>said, Thus I prove it</i>: He showeth mercy to <i>David</i> his Messiah. (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:50">Psalms 18:50</span>.) <i>R. Joshua ben Levi saith, His name is</i> <i>tsemach</i>, a Branch. (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:8">Zechariah 3:8</span>.) <i>R. Juban bar Arbu saith, His name is Menahem</i>. (That is, παρακλητος, the Comforter.) '<i>And that which happened to a certain</i> <i>Jew, as he was ploughing, agreeth with this business. A certain</i> <i>Arabian travelling, and hearing the ox bellow, said to the Jew at</i> <i>plough, O Jew, loose thy oxen, and loose thy ploughs,</i> והא יליר מלכא משיחא<i> </i>for behold! <i>The temple is laid waste. The ox belloweth the second time; the</i> <i>Arabian saith to him, O Jew, Jew, yoke thy oxen, and fit thy</i> <i>ploughs</i>: <i>For behold! King Messiah is born</i>. <i>But, saith the Jew, What is his name? Menahem, saith he</i> (i.e. the <i>Comforter</i>.) <i>And what is the name of his Father? Hezekiah,</i> <i>saith the Arabian. To whom the Jew, But whence is He? The other</i> <i>answered, From the palace of the king of Bethlehem Judah. Away he</i> <i>went, and sold his oxen and his ploughs, and became a seller of</i> <i>infants' swaddling clothes, going about from town to town. When</i> <i>he came to that city</i>, (Bethlehem,) <i>all the women bought of him,</i> <i>but the mother of Menahem bought nothing. He heard the voice of</i> <i>the women saying, O thou mother of Menahem, thou mother of</i> <i>Menahem, carry thy son the things that are here sold. But she</i> <i>replied, May the enemies of Israel be strangled, because on the</i> <i>day that he was born, the temple was laid waste. To whom he said,</i> <i>But we hoped, that as it was laid waste at his feet, so at his</i> <i>feet it would be built again. She saith, I have no money. To</i> <i>whom he replied, But why should this be prejudicial to him? Carry</i> <i>him what you buy here, and if you have no money today, after some</i> <i>days I will come back and receive it. After some days, he</i> <i>returned to that city, and saith to her, How does the little</i> <i>infant? And she said, From the time you saw me last, spirits and</i> <i>tempests came, and snatched him away out of my hands. R. Bon</i> <i>saith, What need have we to learn from an Arabian? Is it not</i> <i>plainly written</i>, And Lebanon shall fall before the powerful one? (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:34">Isaiah 10:34</span>.) <i>And what follows after</i>? A branch shall come out of the root of <i>Jesse</i>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span>.)</p>
<p>"The <i>Babylonian</i> doctors yield us a confession not very unlike the former. <i>R. Charinah saith: After four hundred years are</i> <i>passed from the destruction of the temple, if any one shall say to</i> <i>you, Take to thyself for one penny a field worth a thousand pence,</i> <i>do not take it</i>. And again, <i>After four thousand two hundred thirty</i> <i>and one years from the creation of the world, if any shall say to</i> <i>you, Take for a penny a field worth a thousand pence, take it not</i>. The gloss is, <i>For that is the time of redemption, and you shall be</i> <i>brought back to the holy mountain, to the inheritance of your</i> <i>fathers; why, therefore, should you misspend your penny</i>?</p>
<p>"You may fetch the reason of this calculation, if you have leisure, out of the tract <i>Sanhedrin</i>. <i>The tradition of the school</i> <i>of Elias, the world is to last six thousand years</i>, c. And a little after, <i>Elias said to Rabh Judah, The world shall last not</i> <i>less than eighty-five jubilees: and in the last jubilee shall the</i> <i>Son of David come. He saith to him, Whether in the beginning of</i> <i>it, or in the end? He answered him, I know not. Whether is this</i> <i>whole time to be finished first, or not? He answered him, I know</i> <i>not. But Rabh Asher asserted, that he answered thus, Until then,</i> <i>expect him not, but from thence expect him</i>. Hear your own countrymen, O Jew! How many centuries of years are passed by and gone from the eighty-fifth jubilee of the world, that is, the year MMMMCCL, and yet the Messias of your expectation is not yet come!</p>
<p>"<i>Daniel's</i> weeks had so clearly defined the time of the true Messias, his coming, that the minds of the whole nation were raised into the expectation of him. Hence, it was doubted of the <i>Baptist</i>, whether he were not the Messias, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</span>. Hence it was, that the <i>Jews</i> are gathered together from all countries unto <i>Jerusalem</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span>:, expecting and coming to see, because at that time the term of revealing the Messias, that had been prefixed by <i>Daniel</i>, was come. Hence it was that there was so great a number of false Christs, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>, c., taking the occasion of their impostures hence, that now the time of that great expectation was at hand, and fulfilled: and in one word, <i>They thought the kingdom</i> <i>of God should presently appear</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:11">Luke 19:11</span>.</p>
<p>"But when those times of expectation were past, nor did such a Messias appear as they expected, (for when they saw the true Messias, they would not see him,) they first broke out into various, and those wild, conjectures of the time and at length, all those conjectures coming to nothing, all ended in this curse (the just cause of their eternal blindness) של מתשכי קצי הפת רות, <i>May their soul be confounded who compute the times</i>!" They were fully aware that the time foretold by the prophets must be long since fulfilled and that their obstinacy must be confounded by their own history, and the chronology of their own Scriptures; and therefore they have pronounced an anathema on those who shall attempt to examine, by chronological computations, the prophecies that predict his coming. Who can conceive a state of wilful blindness or determined obstinacy superior to this!</p>
