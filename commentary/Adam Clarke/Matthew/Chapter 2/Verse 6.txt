<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:6">Matthew 2:6</span>. <i><b>And thou Bethlehem</b></i><b>, in </b><i><b>the land of Juda</b></i> — To distinguish it from Bethlehem, in the tribe of Zebulon. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:15">Joshua 19:15</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Art not the least</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>, it is read, <i>Though thou be little </i>- צעיר להיות tsair lehayoth, <i>little to be</i>. <i>Houbigant</i>, struck with the oddness of the construction of the Hebrew, by dividing the last word, and making a small change in two of the letters, makes the prophet agree with the evangelist, צעיר לא היית <i>tsair lo hayita</i>, <i>thou art not the</i> <i>least</i>. Several learned men are of opinion, that the copy from which St. Matthew quoted, had the text in this way. However, some MSS. of very good note, among which is the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, have μη ελαχιστη ει, for ουδαμως ελαχιστη ει, <i>Art thou not the least</i>? This reconciles the prophet and evangelist without farther trouble. See the authorities for this reading in <i>Griesbach</i> and <i>Wetstein</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Among the princes of Juda</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>, it is, <i>the thousands of Judah</i>. There is much reason to believe that each tribe was divided into small portions called <i>thousands</i>, as in England certain small divisions of counties are called <i>hundreds</i>. For the proof of the first, the reader is referred to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+6:15">Judges 6:15</span>, where, instead of <i>my</i> FAMILY <i>is poor in Manasseh</i>, the Hebrew is, <i>my</i> THOUSAND (אלפי) <i>is the meanest in Manasseh</i>: and to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+10:19">1 Samuel 10:19</span>, Present yourselves before the Lord by your TRIBES and by your THOUSANDS: and to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+12:20">1 Chronicles 12:20</span>, Captains of the THOUSANDS of Manasseh. Now these THOUSANDS being petty <i>governments</i>, Matthew renders them by the word ηγεμοσις, because the word <i>princes</i> or <i>governors</i> was more intelligible in the Greek tongue than <i>thousands</i>, though, in this case, they both signify the same. See <i>Wakefield</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That shall rule my people Israel.</b></i> — οστις ποιμανει, <i>Who shall</i> FEED <i>my people</i>. That is as a shepherd feeds his flock. Among the Greeks, kings are called, by <i>Homer</i>, λαων ποιμενες, <i>shepherds of</i> <i>the people</i>. This appellation probably originated from the <i>pastoral</i> employment, which kings and patriarchs did not blush to exercise in the times of primitive simplicity; and it might particularly refer to the case of David, the great type of Christ, who was a keeper of his father's sheep, before he was raised to the throne of Israel. As the government of a good king was similar to the care a good shepherd has of his flock, hence ποιμην signified both <i>shepherd</i> and <i>king</i>; and ποιμαινω, to <i>feed</i> and to <i>rule</i> among the ancient Greeks.</p>
