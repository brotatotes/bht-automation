<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:1">Matthew 20:1</span>. <i><b>For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man - a</b></i><b> </b><i><b>householder</b></i> — The very commencement of this chapter shows it to be connected with the preceding. The manner of God's proceeding under the Gospel dispensation resembles a householder, who went out at <i>day break</i>, αμα πρωι, <i>together with the morning</i>; as the light began to go out of its chambers in the east, so he went out of his bed-room to employ labourers, that they might cultivate his vineyard. This was what was called, among the Jews and Romans, the <i>first</i> hour; answering to <i>six o'clock</i> in the morning.</p>
<p><i><b>To hire labourers</b></i> — <i>Some workmen</i>, των εργατων - for he had not got all that was necessary, because we find him going out at other hours to hire more.</p>
