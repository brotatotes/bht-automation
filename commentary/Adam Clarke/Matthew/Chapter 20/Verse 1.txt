Verse Matthew 20:1. For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man - a householder — The very commencement of this chapter shows it to be connected with the preceding. The manner of God's proceeding under the Gospel dispensation resembles a householder, who went out at day break, αμα πρωι, together with the morning; as the light began to go out of its chambers in the east, so he went out of his bed-room to employ labourers, that they might cultivate his vineyard. This was what was called, among the Jews and Romans, the first hour; answering to six o'clock in the morning.To hire labourers — Some workmen, των εργατων - for he had not got all that was necessary, because we find him going out at other hours to hire more.
