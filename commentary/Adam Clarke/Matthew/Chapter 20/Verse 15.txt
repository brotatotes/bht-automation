<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:15">Matthew 20:15</span>. <i><b>Is it not lawful for me</b></i> — As eternal life is the free gift of God, he has a right to give it in whatever <i>proportions</i>, at whatever <i>times</i>, and on whatever <i>conditions</i> he pleases.</p>
<p><i><b>Is thine eye evil</b></i> — An evil eye among the Jews meant a <i>malicious, covetous</i>, or <i>envious</i> person.</p>
<p>Most commentators have different methods of interpreting this parable. Something was undoubtedly designed by its principal parts, besides the scope and design mentioned at the conclusion of the last chapter. The following, which is taken principally from the very pious <i>Quesnel</i>, may render it as useful to the reader as any thing else that has been written on it.</p>
<p>The <i>Church</i> is a <i>vineyard</i>, because it is a place of <i>labour</i>, where no man should be <i>idle</i>. Each of us is engaged to <i>labour</i> in this vineyard - to work out our salvation through him who worketh in us to will and to perform. <i>Life</i> is but a <i>day</i>, whereof <i>childhood</i>, or the first use of reason, is the day-break or <i>first hour</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:1">Matthew 20:1</span>, in which we receive the <i>first</i> CALL.</p>
<p>The promise of the kingdom of glory is given to all those who are workers together with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:2">Matthew 20:2</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>second call</i> is in the time of <i>youth</i>, which is most commonly <i>idle</i>, or only employed in <i>dissipation</i> and <i>worldly</i> cares, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:3">Matthew 20:3</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>third call</i> is at the <i>age</i> of <i>manhood</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>fourth</i>, in the <i>decline</i> of <i>life</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:5">Matthew 20:5</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>fifth</i>, when <i>sickness</i> and the <i>infirmities</i> of life press upon us. How many are there in the world who are just ready to leave it, before they properly consider for what end they were brought into it! Still <i>idle</i>, still unemployed in the things which concern their souls; though eternal life is offered to them, and hell moving from beneath to meet them! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:6">Matthew 20:6</span>.</p>
<p>Others consider the <i>morning</i> the first dawn of the <i>Gospel</i>; and the <i>first call</i> to be the preaching of <i>John Baptist</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>second call</i>, the public preaching of our LORD; and that of the <i>apostles</i> when they got an especial commission to the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5-6">Matthew 10:5-6</span>, together with that of the <i>seventy disciples</i> mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>third call</i>, which was at <i>mid-day</i>, represents the preaching of the <i>fulness</i> of the Gospel after the <i>ascension</i> of Christ, which was the <i>meridian</i> of evangelic glory and excellence.</p>
<p>The <i>fourth call</i> represents the mission of the apostles to the various <i>synagogues</i> of the <i>Jews</i>, in every part of the world where they were scattered; the history of which is particularly given in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>The <i>fifth call</i>, or <i>eleventh</i> hour, represents the general call of the <i>Gentiles</i> into the Church of Christ, when the unbelieving Jews were finally rejected. What makes this interpretation the more likely is, that the persons who are addressed at <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:7">Matthew 20:7</span>, say, <i>No man hath hired us</i>, i.e. We never heard the voice of a prophet announcing the true God, nor of an apostle preaching the Lord Jesus, until now. The Jews could not use this as an argument for their carelessness about their eternal interests.</p>
