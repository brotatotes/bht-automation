<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span>. <i><b>So the last shall be first, and the first last</b></i> â€” The GENTILES, who have been long without the true God, shall now enjoy all the privileges of the new covenant; and the Jews, who have enjoyed these from the beginning, shall now be dispossessed of them; for, because they here rejected the Lord, he also hath rejected them.</p>
<p><i><b>Many are called</b></i>, c.] This clause is wanting in BL, one other, and in the <i>Coptic</i> and <i>Sahidic</i> versions. Bishop PEARCE thinks it is an <i>interpolation</i> from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:14">Matthew 22:14</span>. The simple meaning seems to be: As those who did not come at the invitation of the householder to work in the vineyard did not receive the <i>denarius</i>, or wages, so those who do not obey the call of the Gospel, and believe in Christ Jesus, shall not inherit eternal life.</p>
<p>This place seems to refer to the ancient Roman custom of recruiting their armies. Among this celebrated people, no one was <i>forced</i> to serve his country in a military capacity and it was the highest honour to be deemed worthy of thus serving it. The youth were instructed, almost from their cradle, in military exercises. The <i>Campus Martius</i> was the grand field in which they were disciplined: there, they accustomed themselves to <i>leaping,</i> <i>running, wrestling, bearing burdens, fencing, throwing</i> the <i>javelin</i>, c., and when, through these violent exercises, they were all besmeared with dust and sweat, in order to refresh themselves, they <i>swam twice or thrice across the Tyber</i>! Rome might at any time have recruited her armies by <i>volunteers</i> from such a mass of well-educated, hardy soldiers but she thought proper, to use the words of the <i>Abbe Mably</i>, that the honour of being <i>chosen</i> to serve in the wars should be the <i>reward</i> of the accomplishments shown by the citizens in the <i>Campus Martius</i>, that the soldier should have a reputation to save; and that the regard paid him, in <i>choosing</i> him to serve, should be the pledge of his fidelity and zeal to discharge his duty. The age of serving in the army was from seventeen to forty-five, and the manner in which they were <i>chosen</i> was the following: -</p>
<p>After the creation of consuls, they every year named twenty-four military tribunes, part of whom must have served five years at least, and the rest <i>eleven</i>. When they had divided among them the command of the four legions to be formed, the consuls <i>summoned</i> to the capitol, or Campus Martius, <i>all the citizens</i> who, by their age, were obliged to bear arms. They drew up by tribes, and lots were drawn to determine in what <i>order</i> every tribe should present its soldiers. That which was the first in order <i>chose</i> the four citizens who were judged the most proper to serve in the war; and the six tribunes who commanded the first legion <i>chose</i> one of these <i>four</i>, whom they liked best. The tribunes of the second and third likewise made their <i>choice</i> one after another; and he that remained entered into the fourth legion. A new tribe presented other four soldiers, and the second legion <i>chose</i> first. The third and fourth legions had the same advantage in their turns. In this manner, each tribe successively <i>chose</i> four soldiers, till the legions were complete. They next proceeded to the creation of subaltern officers, whom the tribunes <i>chose</i> from among the soldiers of the greatest reputation. When the legions were thus completed, the citizens who had been <i>called</i>, but <i>not chosen</i>, returned to their respective employments, and served their country in other capacities. None can suppose that these were deemed <i>useless</i>, or that, because not now <i>chosen</i> to serve their country in the field, they were proscribed from the rights and privileges of citizens, much less <i>destroyed</i>, because others were found better qualified to serve their country at the post of honour and danger. Thus many are called by the preaching of the Gospel, but few are found who use their advantages in such a way as to become extensively useful in the Church-and many in the Church <i>militant</i> behave so ill as never to be admitted into the Church <i>triumphant</i>. But what a mercy that those who appear now to be rejected may be called in another muster, enrolled, serve in the field, or work in the vineyard? How many millions does the <i>long-suffering</i> of God lead to repentance!</p>
