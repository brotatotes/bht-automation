<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:19">Matthew 20:19</span>. <i><b>Deliver him to the Gentiles to mock</b></i> — This was done by <i>Herod</i> and his <i>Roman</i> soldiers. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:11">Luke 23:11</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>To scourge, and to crucify</b></i> — This was done by <i>Pilate</i>, the Roman governor. The punishment of the <i>cross</i> was <i>Roman</i> not <i>Jewish</i>; but the <i>chief priests</i> condemned him to it, and the <i>Romans</i> executed the sentence. How little did they know that they were, by this process, jointly offering up that sacrifice which was to make an atonement for the Gentiles and for the Jews; an atonement for the sin of the whole world? How often may it be literally said, <i>The</i> <i>wrath of man shall praise thee</i>!</p>
