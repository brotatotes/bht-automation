<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:2">Matthew 20:2</span>. <i><b>A penny</b></i> â€” A Roman coin, as noted before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:28">Matthew 18:28</span>, worth about <i>seven-pence halfpenny</i> or <i>seven-pence three farthings</i> of our money, and equal to the Greek <i>drachma</i>. This appears to have been the ordinary price of a day's labour at that time. See Tobit 5:14. In 1351 the price of labour was regulated in this country by parliament; and it is remarkable that "corn-weeders and hay-makers, without meat, drink, or other courtesy demanded," were to have <i>one penny</i> per day! In 1314 the pay of a <i>chaplain</i> to the Scotch bishops, who were then prisoners in England, was <i>three</i> <i>halfpence</i> per day. See <i>Fleetwood's Chronicon Precios</i>, p. 123, 129. This was miserable wages, though things at that time were so cheap that twenty-four eggs were sold for a penny, p. 72; a pair of shoes for <i>four-pence</i>, p. 71; a <i>fat goose</i> for <i>two-pence</i> <i>halfpenny</i>, p. 72; a <i>hen</i> for a <i>penny</i>, p. 72; <i>eight bushels</i> of wheat for <i>two shillings</i>, and a <i>fat ox</i> for <i>six shillings</i> and <i>eight-pence</i>! Ibid. In 1336, wheat per quarter, 2<i>s</i>.; a fat sheep 6<i>d</i>.; fat goose, 2<i>d</i>. and a pig, 1<i>d</i>.,p. 75.</p>
