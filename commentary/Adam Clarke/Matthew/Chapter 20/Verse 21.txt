<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:21">Matthew 20:21</span>. <i><b>Grant that these my two sons</b></i> — James and John. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span>. In the preceding chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>, our Lord had promised his disciples, that they should sit on <i>twelve thrones</i>, judging the twelve tribes. <i>Salome</i>, probably hearing of this, and understanding it literally, came to request the <i>chief dignities</i> in this new government for her sons; and it appears it was at their instigation that she made this request, for Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:35">Mark 10:35</span>, informs us that these brethren <i>themselves</i> made the request, i.e. they made it through the <i>medium</i> of their mother.</p>
<p><i><b>One on thy right hand, and the other on</b></i> (THY) <i><b>left</b></i> — I have added the pronoun in the latter clause on the authority of almost every MS. and version of repute.</p>
<p>That the sons of Zebedee wished for ecclesiastical, rather than secular honours, may be thought probable, from the allusion that is made here to the supreme dignities in the great Sanhedrin. The <i>prince</i> of the Sanhedrin (HA-NASI) sat in the midst of two rows of senators or elders; on his right hand sat the person termed AB (<i>the father</i> of the Sanhedrin;) and on his left hand the CHACHAM, or <i>sage</i>. These persons transacted all business in the absence of the <i>president</i>. The authority of this council was at some periods very great, and extended to a multitude of matters both <i>ecclesiastical</i> and <i>civil</i>. These appear to have been the honours which James and John sought. They seem to have strangely forgot the lesson they had learned from the transfiguration.</p>
