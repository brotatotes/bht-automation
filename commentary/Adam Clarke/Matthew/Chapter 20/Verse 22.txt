<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:22">Matthew 20:22</span>. <i><b>Ye know not what ye ask.</b></i> — How strange is the infatuation, in some <i>parents</i>, which leads them to desire <i>worldly</i> or <i>ecclesiastical</i> honours for their children! He must be much in love with the <i>cross</i> who wishes to have his child a minister of the Gospel; for, if he be such as God approves of in the work, his life will be a life of toil and suffering; he will be obliged to <i>sip</i>, at least, if not to drink largely, of the cup of Christ. <i>We</i> <i>know not what we ask</i>, when, in getting our children into the CHURCH, we take upon ourselves to <i>answer for their</i> CALL to the sacred <i>office</i>, and for the <i>salvation</i> of the <i>souls</i> that are put under their care. Blind parents! rather let your children beg their bread than thrust them into an office to which God has not called them; and in which they will not only ruin their souls, but be the means of damnation to hundreds; for if <i>God has not sent</i> <i>them</i>, they shall not profit the people at all.</p>
<p><i><b>And to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized</b></i>, &amp;c.] This clause in <i>this</i>, and the <i>next verse</i>, is wanting in BDL, two others, (7 more in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>,) <i>Coptic, Sahidic, Ethiopic</i>, Mr. WHEELOCK'S <i>Persic, Vulgate, Saxon</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i>, except two. Grotius, Mill, and Bengel, think it should be omitted, and Griesbach has left it out of the text in both his editions. It is omitted also by <i>Origen, Epiphanius,</i> <i>Hilary, Jerome, Ambrose</i>, and <i>Juvencus</i>. According to the rules laid down by critics to appreciate a false or true reading, this clause cannot be considered as forming a part of the sacred text. It may be asked, Does not <i>drink of my cup</i>, convey the same idea? Does the clause add any thing to the perspicuity of the passage? And, though found in many good MSS., is not the balance of evidence in point of antiquity against it? Baptism among the Jews, as it was performed in the coldest weather, and the persons were kept under water for some time, was used not only to express <i>death</i>, but the most cruel kind of death. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. As to the term <i>cup</i>, it was a common figure, by which they expressed calamities, judgments, desolation, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>They say unto him, We are able.</b></i> — Strange blindness! You <i>can</i>? No: one drop of this cup would sink you into utter ruin, unless upheld by the power of God. However, the man whom God has appointed to the work he will preserve in it.</p>
