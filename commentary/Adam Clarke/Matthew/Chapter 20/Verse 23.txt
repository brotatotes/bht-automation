<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>. <i><b>Is not mine to give, but</b></i><b> it shall be given to them </b><i><b>for whom it is prepared of my Father.</b></i> — The common translation, in which the words, <i>it shall be given to them</i>; are interpolated by our translators, utterly changes and destroys the meaning of the passage. It represents Christ (in opposition to the whole Scriptures) as having nothing to do in the dispensing of rewards and punishments; whereas, our Lord only intimates that, however partial he may be to these two brethren, yet seats in glory can only be given to those who are <i>fitted</i> for them. No <i>favour</i> can prevail here; the elevated seat is for him who is filled with the fulness of God. The true construction of the words is this: - ουκ εϚιν εμον δουναι, αλλ' ὁις ητοιμυϚαι ὑπο του πατρος μου, <i>To sit</i> <i>on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, except to</i> <i>them for whom it is prepared of my Father</i>. According to the prediction of Christ, these brethren did partake of his afflictions: <i>James</i> was martyred by <i>Herod</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>; and <i>John</i> was banished to <i>Patmos</i>, for the testimony of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>.</p>
