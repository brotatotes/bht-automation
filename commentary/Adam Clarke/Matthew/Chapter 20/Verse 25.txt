<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:25">Matthew 20:25</span>. <i><b>Exercise dominion - and - exercise authority upon them.</b></i> — They <i>tyrannized</i> and <i>exercised arbitrary power</i> over the people. This was certainly true of the governments in our Lord's time, both in the <i>east</i> and in the <i>west</i>. I have endeavoured to express, as nearly as possible, the meaning of the two Greek verbs, κατακυριευουσιν, and κατεξουσιαζουσιν; and those who understand the genius of the language will perceive that I have not <i>exhausted</i> their sense, however some may think that no emphasis was intended, and that these compound verbs are used for the simple κυριευειν, and εξουσιαζειν. See <i>Wakefield</i> and <i>Rosenmuller</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>government</i> of the <i>Church</i> of Christ is widely different from secular governments. It is founded in humility and brotherly love: it is derived from Christ, the great Head of the Church, and is ever conducted by his maxims and spirit. When <i>political</i> matters are brought into the Church of Christ, both are ruined. The <i>Church</i> has more than once ruined the <i>State</i>; the <i>State</i> has often <i>corrupted</i> the <i>Church</i>: it is certainly for the interests of both to be kept <i>separate</i>. This has already been abundantly exemplified in both cases, and will continue so to be, over the whole world, wherever the Church and State are <i>united</i> in secular matters.</p>
