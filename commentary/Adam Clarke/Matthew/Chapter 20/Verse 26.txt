<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span>. <i><b>It shall not be so among you</b></i> — Every kind of lordship and spiritual domination over the Church of Christ, like that exercised by the Church of Rome, is destructive and anti-christian.</p>
<p><i><b>Your minister</b></i> — Or, <i>deacon</i>, διακονος. I know no other word which could at once convey the meaning of the original, and make a proper distinction between it and δουλος, or <i>servant</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:27">Matthew 20:27</span>. The office of a deacon, in the primitive Church, was to <i>serve</i> in the <i>agapae</i>, or love feasts, to <i>distribute the bread</i> and <i>wine</i> to the communicants; to <i>proclaim different parts</i> and <i>times</i> of <i>worship</i> in the churches; and to <i>take care</i> of the <i>widows,</i> <i>orphans, prisoners</i>, and <i>sick</i>, who were provided for out of the revenues of the Church. Thus we find it was the very <i>lowest</i> ecclesiastical office. <i>Deacons</i> were first appointed by the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1-6">Acts 6:1-6</span>; they had the care of the poor, and preached occasionally.</p>
