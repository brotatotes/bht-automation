<p>From these directions of our Lord, we may easily discern what sort of a spirit his ministers should be of.</p>
<p>1. A minister of Christ is not to consider himself a <i>lord</i> over Christ's flock.</p>
<p>2. He is not to conduct the concerns of the Church with an <i>imperious</i> spirit.</p>
<p>3. He is to reform the weak, after Christ's example, more by <i>loving instruction</i> than by <i>reproof</i> or <i>censure</i>.</p>
<p>4. He should consider that true apostolic greatness consists in <i>serving</i> the followers of Christ with all the powers and talents he possesses.</p>
<p>5. That he should be ready, if required, to <i>give up his life unto</i> <i>death</i>, to promote the salvation of men.</p>
