<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>. <i><b>A ransom for many.</b></i> — αυτρον αντι πολλων, or a <i>ransom</i> <i>instead of many</i>, - one ransom, or atonement, <i>instead</i> of the <i>many</i> prescribed in the Jewish law. Mr. <i>Wakefield</i> contends for the above translation, and with considerable show of reason and probability.</p>
<p>The word λυτρον is used by the <i>Septuagint</i> for the Hebrew פדיו, <i>pidion</i>, the ransom paid for a man's life: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:30">Exodus 21:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:49-51">Numbers 3:49-51</span>; and λυτρα is used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+35:31">Numbers 35:31</span>, where a <i>satisfaction</i> (Hebrew כפר <i>copher</i>, an <i>atonement</i>) for the life of a murderer is refused. The original word is used by Lucian in exactly the same sense, who represents Ganymede promising to sacrifice a ram to Jupiter, λυτρον υπερ εμου, as <i>a</i> <i>ransom for himself</i>, provided he would dismiss him.</p>
<p>The whole Gentile world, as well as the Jews, believed in vicarious sacrifices. Virgil, AEn. v. 85, has nearly the same words as those in the text. "UNUM PRO MULTIS dabitur CAPUT," - <i>One</i> man must be given for <i>many</i>. Jesus Christ laid down his life as a ransom for the lives and souls of the children of men. In the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, and in most of the <i>Itala</i>, the <i>Saxon</i>, and one of the <i>Syriac, Hilary, Leo Magnus</i>, and <i>Juvencus</i>, the following remarkable addition is found; "But seek ye to increase from a little, and to be lessened from that which is great. Moreover, when ye enter into a house, and are invited to sup, do not recline in the most eminent places, lest a more honourable than thou come after, and he who invited thee to supper come up to thee and say, Get down yet lower; and thou be put to confusion. But if thou sit down in the lowest place, and one inferior to thee come after, he who invited thee to supper will say unto thee, Go and sit higher: now this will be advantageous to thee." This is the largest addition found in any of the MSS., and contains not less than <i>sixty</i> words In the original, and eighty-three in the Anglo-Saxon. It may be necessary to remark, that Mr. <i>Marshall</i>, in his edition of the Gothic and Saxon Gospels, does not insert these words in the text, but gives them, p. 496 of his observations. This addition is at least as ancient as the fourth century, for it is quoted by <i>Hilary</i>, who did not die till about A. D. 367.</p>
