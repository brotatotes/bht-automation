<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:30">Matthew 20:30</span>. <i><b>Two blind men</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:46">Mark 10:46</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>, mention only one blind man, <i>Bartimeus</i>. Probably <i>he</i> was mentioned by the other evangelists, as being a person well known before and after his cure. <i>Blindness</i> of heart is a disorder of which, men seldom complain, or from which they desire to be delivered; and it is one property of this blindness, to keep the person from <i>perceiving</i> it, and to persuade him that his sight is <i>good</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Sitting by the way side</b></i> — In the likeliest place to receive alms, because of the multitudes going and coming between Jerusalem and Jericho.</p>
<p><i><b>Cried out</b></i> — In the midst of judgments God remembers mercy. Though God had deprived them, for wise reasons, of their <i>eyes</i>, he left them the use of their <i>speech</i>. It is never so <i>ill</i> with us, but it might be <i>much worse</i>: let us, therefore, be submissive and thankful.</p>
<p><i><b>Have mercy on us</b></i> — Hearing that Jesus passed by, and not knowing whether they should ever again have so good an opportunity of addressing him, they are determined to call, and call earnestly. They ask for <i>mercy</i>, conscious that they <i>deserve</i> nothing, and they ask with <i>faith-Son of David</i>, acknowledging him as the promised <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
