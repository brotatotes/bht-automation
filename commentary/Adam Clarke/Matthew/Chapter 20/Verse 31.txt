<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:31">Matthew 20:31</span>. <i><b>The multitude rebuked them</b></i> — Whenever a soul begins to cry after Jesus for <i>light</i> and <i>salvation</i>, the world and the devil join together to drown its cries, or force it to be silent. But let all such remember, Jesus is now passing by; that their souls must perish everlastingly, if not saved by him, and they may never have so good an opportunity again. While there is a broken and a contrite heart, let it sigh its complaints to God, till he hear and answer.</p>
<p><i><b>They cried the more</b></i> — When the world and the devil begin to rebuke, in this case, it is a proof that the salvation of God is <i>nigh</i>; therefore, let such <i>cry out a great deal the more</i>.</p>
