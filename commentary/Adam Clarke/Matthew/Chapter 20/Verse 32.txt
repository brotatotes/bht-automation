<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:32">Matthew 20:32</span>. <i><b>Jesus stood</b></i> — "The cry of a believing penitent," says one, "is sufficient to stop the most merciful Jesus, were he going to make a new heaven and a new earth; for what is all the <i>irrational</i> part of God's creation in worth, when compared with the value of one immortal soul!" <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:50">Mark 10:50</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>What will ye that I shall do</b></i> — Christ is at all times infinitely willing to save sinners: when the desire of the heart is turned towards him, there can be little delay in the salvation. <i>What is</i> <i>thy wish</i>? If it be a good one, God will surely fulfil it.</p>
