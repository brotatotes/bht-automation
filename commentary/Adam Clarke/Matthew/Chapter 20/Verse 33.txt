<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:33">Matthew 20:33</span>. <i><b>That our eyes may be opened.</b></i> â€” He who feels his own sore, and the plague of his heart, has no great need of a <i>prompter</i> in prayer. A hungry man can easily ask bread; he has no need to go to a book to get expressions to state his wants in; his hunger tells him he wants food, and he tells <i>this</i> to the person from whom he expects relief. Helps to devotion, in all ordinary cases, may be of great use; in extraordinary cases they can be of little importance; the afflicted heart alone can tell its own sorrows, with appropriate pleadings.</p>
