Verse Matthew 20:7. No man hath hired us. — This was the reason why they were all the day idle.And whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. — Ye may expect payment in proportion to your labour, and the time ye spend in it; but this clause is wanting in some of the best MSS., versions, and fathers.
