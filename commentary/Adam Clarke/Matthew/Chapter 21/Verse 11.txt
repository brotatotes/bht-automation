Verse Matthew 21:11. This is Jesus THE PROPHET] ο προφητης THAT prophet whom Moses spoke of, Deuteronomy 18:18. I will raise them up a prophet - like unto thee, &c. Every expression of the multitude plainly intimated that they fully received our blessed Lord as the promised Messiah. - How strange is it that these same people (if the creatures of the high priest be not only intended) should, about five days after, change their hosannas for, Away with him! crucify him! crucify him! How fickle is the multitude! Even when they get right, there is but little hope that they will continue so long.
