<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:11">Matthew 21:11</span>. <i><b>This is Jesus</b></i><b> THE PROPHET</b>] ο προφητης THAT <i>prophet</i> whom Moses spoke of, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+18:18">Deuteronomy 18:18</span>. <i>I will raise them up a prophet - like unto thee</i>, &amp;c. Every expression of the multitude plainly intimated that they fully received our blessed Lord as the promised Messiah. - How strange is it that these same people (if the creatures of the high priest be not only intended) should, about five days after, change their hosannas for, <i>Away with him! crucify him! crucify him!</i> How fickle is the multitude! Even when they get <i>right</i>, there is but little hope that they will continue so long.</p>
