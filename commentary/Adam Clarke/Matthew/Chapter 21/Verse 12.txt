Verse Matthew 21:12. Jesus went into the temple of God, c.] "Avarice," says one, "covered with the veil of religion, is one of those things on which Christ looks with the greatest indignation in his Church. Merchandize of holy things, simoniacal presentations, fraudulent exchanges, a mercenary spirit in sacred functions ecclesiastical employments obtained by flattery, service, or attendance, or by any thing which is instead of money; collations, nominations, and elections made through any other motive than the glory of God; these are all fatal and damnable profanations, of which those in the temple were only a shadow." QUESNEL.Money-changers â€” Persons who furnished the Jews and proselytes who came from other countries, with the current coin of Judea, in exchange for their own.
