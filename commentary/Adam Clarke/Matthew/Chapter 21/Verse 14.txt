<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:14">Matthew 21:14</span>. <i><b>The blind and the lame came</b></i> â€” Having condemned the <i>profane</i> use of the temple, he now shows the proper use of it. It is a <i>house of prayer</i>, where God is to manifest his goodness and power in giving <i>sight</i> to the spiritually <i>blind</i>, and <i>feet</i> to the <i>lame</i>. The <i>Church</i> or <i>chapel</i> in which the <i>blind</i> and the <i>lame</i> are not healed has <i>no</i> Christ in it, and is not worthy of attendance.</p>
