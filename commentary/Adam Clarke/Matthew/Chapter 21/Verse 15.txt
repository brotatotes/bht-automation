<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:15">Matthew 21:15</span>. <i><b>The chief priests - were sore displeased</b></i> â€” Or, <i>were</i> <i>incensed</i>. Incensed at what! At the purification of the profaned temple! This was a work <i>they</i> should have done themselves, but for which they had neither <i>grace</i> nor <i>influence</i>; and their pride and jealousy will not suffer them to permit others to do it. Strange as it may appear, the <i>priesthood</i> itself, in all corrupt times, has been ever the most forward to <i>prevent</i> a reform in the Church. Was it because they were conscious that a reformer would find them no better than <i>money-changers</i> in, and <i>profaners</i> of, the house of God, and that they and their system must be <i>overturned</i>, if the true worship of God were restored! Let him who is concerned answer this to his conscience.</p>
