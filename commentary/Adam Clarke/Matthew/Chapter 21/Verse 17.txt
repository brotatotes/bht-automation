See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:37">Luke 21:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:39">Luke 22:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:1-2">John 8:1-2</span>.

<p><i><b>Lodged there.</b></i> — Not merely to avoid the snares laid for him by those bad men, but to take away all suspicion of his affecting the regal power. To the end of this verse is added by the Saxon, [Anglo-Saxon]. <i>And taught them of the kingdom of God</i>. This same reading is found in some MSS., <i>Missals</i>, and one copy of the <i>Itala</i>. It appears also in <i>Wickliff</i>, and my old folio English MS. Bible, and <i>taugt hem of the kyngdom of God</i>; and in two MS. copies of the <i>Vulgate</i>, in my possession: one, duodecimo, very fairly written, in 1300; the other a large folio, probably written in the 11th or 12th century, in which the words are, IBIQUE docebat eos de regno Dei. AND THERE <i>he taught them concerning the kingdom of God</i>.</p>
