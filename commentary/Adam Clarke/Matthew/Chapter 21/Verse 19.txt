<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>. <i><b>He saw a fig tree in the way</b></i> — επι της οδου, <i>By the</i> <i>road side</i>. As this fig tree was by the <i>way side</i>, it was no <i>private</i> property; and on this account our Lord, or any other traveller, had a right to take of its fruit. For a full explanation of this difficult passage, relative to this emblematic fig tree, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:13">Mark 11:13</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>Let no fruit grow on thee</b></i> — Can a professor, who affords Christ nothing but <i>barren words</i> and <i>wishes</i>, expect any thing but his malediction? When the soul continues in <i>unfruitfulness</i>, the influences of grace are removed, and then the tree speedily withers from the very root.</p>
