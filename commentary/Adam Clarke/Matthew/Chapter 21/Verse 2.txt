<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:2">Matthew 21:2</span>. <i><b>Ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt</b></i> â€” <i>Asses</i> and <i>mules</i> were in common use in Palestine: <i>horses</i> were seldom to be met with. Our blessed Lord takes every opportunity to convince his disciples that nothing was <i>hidden</i> from him: he informs them of the most minute occurrence; and manifested his power over the heart in disposing the owner to permit the ass to be taken away.</p>
