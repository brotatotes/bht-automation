<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:20">Matthew 21:20</span>. <i><b>How soon is the fig tree withered away!</b></i> â€” We often say to our neighbours, "How suddenly this man died! Who could have expected it so soon?" But who takes warning by these examples? What we say <i>to-day</i> of OTHERS, may be said <i>to-morrow</i> of OURSELVES. Be ye also ready! Lord, increase our faith!</p>
