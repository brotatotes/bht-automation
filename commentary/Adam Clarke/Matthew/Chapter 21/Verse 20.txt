Verse Matthew 21:20. How soon is the fig tree withered away! â€” We often say to our neighbours, "How suddenly this man died! Who could have expected it so soon?" But who takes warning by these examples? What we say to-day of OTHERS, may be said to-morrow of OURSELVES. Be ye also ready! Lord, increase our faith!
