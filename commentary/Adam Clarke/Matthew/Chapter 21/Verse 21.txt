<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>. <i><b>If ye have faith, and doubt not</b></i> â€” See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span>. <i>Removing mountains</i>, and <i>rooting up of mountains</i>, are phrases very generally used to signify the <i>removing</i> or <i>conquering</i> great <i>difficulties</i>-getting through <i>perplexities</i>. So, many of the rabbins are termed <i>rooters up of mountains</i>, because they were dexterous in removing difficulties, solving cases of conscience, c. In this sense our Lord's words are to be understood. He that has faith will get through every difficulty and perplexity mountains shall become molehills or plains before him. The saying is neither to be taken in its literal sense, nor is it <i>hyperbolical</i>: it is a proverbial form of speech, which no Jew could misunderstand, and with which no Christian ought to be puzzled.</p>
