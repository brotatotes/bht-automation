Verse Matthew 21:23. By what authority doest thou these things? — The things which the chief priests allude to, were his receiving the acclamations of the people as the promised Messiah, his casting the traders out of the temple, and his teaching the people publicly in it.Who gave thee this authority? — Not them: for, like many of their successors, they were neither teachers nor cleansers; though they had the name and the profits of the place.
