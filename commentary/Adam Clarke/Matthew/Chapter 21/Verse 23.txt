<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23">Matthew 21:23</span>. <i><b>By what authority doest thou these things?</b></i> — The things which the chief priests allude to, were his <i>receiving</i> the <i>acclamations</i> of the people as the <i>promised Messiah</i>, his <i>casting</i> the <i>traders</i> out of the <i>temple</i>, and his <i>teaching</i> the <i>people</i> publicly in it.</p>
<p><i><b>Who gave thee this authority?</b></i> — Not <i>them</i>: for, like many of their successors, they were neither <i>teachers</i> nor <i>cleansers</i>; though they had the name and the profits of the place.</p>
