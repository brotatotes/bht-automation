<p>Verse 32. <i><b>John came unto you in the way of righteousness</b></i> â€” Proclaiming the truth, and living agreeably to it. Or, <i>John came</i> <i>unto you</i>, who are <i>in the way of righteousness</i>. This seems rather to be the true meaning and construction of this passage. The Jews are here distinguished from the Gentiles. The former were in the <i>way of righteousness</i>, had the revelation of God, and the ordinances of justice <i>established</i> among them; the latter were in the <i>way of unrighteousness</i>, without the Divine revelation, and iniquitous in all their conduct: John came to both, preaching the doctrine of repentance, and proclaiming Jesus the Christ. To say that it was John who came in the way of righteousness, and that to him the words refer, is, in my opinion, saying nothing; for this was necessarily implied: as he professed to come from God, he must not only <i>preach</i> righteousness, but <i>walk</i> in it.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to get a worldly minded and self-righteous man brought to Christ. <i>Examples</i> signify little to him. Urge the example of an eminent <i>saint</i>, he is discouraged at it. Show him a <i>profligate sinner</i> converted to God, him he is ashamed to own and follow; and, as to the conduct of the generality of the followers of Christ, it is not striking enough to impress him. John, and Christ, and the apostles preach; but, to multitudes, all is in vain.</p>
