<p>Verse 33. <i><b>There was a certain householder</b></i> — Let us endeavour to find out a general and practical meaning for this parable. <i>A</i> <i>householder </i>- the <i>Supreme Being</i>. The <i>family </i>- the <i>Jewish nation</i>. The <i>vineyard </i>- the <i>city of Jerusalem</i>. The <i>fence </i>- the <i>Divine</i> <i>protection</i>. The <i>wine-press </i>- the <i>law</i> and <i>sacrificial rites</i>. The <i>tower </i>- the <i>temple</i>, in which the Divine presence was manifested. The <i>husbandmen </i>- the <i>priests</i> and <i>doctors of the law</i>. Went <i>from</i> <i>home </i>- entrusted the cultivation of the vineyard to the priests, c., with the utmost confidence as a man would do who had the most trusty servants, and was obliged to absent himself from home for a certain time. Our Lord takes this parable from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:1">Isaiah 5:1</span>, c. but whether our blessed Redeemer quote from the <i>law</i>, the <i>prophets</i>, or the <i>rabbins</i>, he reserves the liberty to himself to beautify the whole, and render it more pertinent.</p>
<p>Some apply this parable also to Christianity, thus: - The <i>master</i> or <i>father </i>- our <i>blessed Lord</i>. The <i>family - professing Christians in</i> <i>general</i>. The <i>vineyard </i>- the <i>true Church</i>, or <i>assembly</i> of the <i>faithful</i>. The <i>hedge </i>- the <i>true faith</i>, which keeps the sacred assembly <i>enclosed</i> and <i>defended</i> from the errors of <i>heathenism</i> and <i>false Christianity</i>. The <i>wine-press</i>-the <i>atonement</i> made by the sacrifice of Christ, typified by the <i>sacrifices</i> under the law. The <i>tower</i>-the <i>promises</i> of the <i>Divine presence</i> and <i>protection</i>. The <i>husbandmen </i>- the <i>apostles</i> and all their <i>successors</i> in the <i>ministry</i>. The <i>going from home</i>-the <i>ascension</i> to heaven. But this parable cannot go on all fours in the <i>Christian</i> cause, as any one may see. In the case of the <i>husbandmen</i>, especially it is applicable; unless we suppose our Lord intended such as those inquisitorial <i>Bonners</i>, who always persecuted the true ministers of Christ, and consequently Christ himself in his members; and to these may be added the whole train of <i>St. Bartholomew</i> EJECTORS, and all the fire and faggot men of a certain Church, who think they do God service by murdering his saints. But let the persecuted take courage: Jesus Christ will <i>come back</i> shortly; and then <i>he will</i> <i>miserably destroy those wicked men</i>: indeed, he has done so already to several, and let out his vineyard to more faithful husbandmen.</p>
<p><i><b>Digged a wine-press</b></i> — ωρυξε ληνον. St. Mark has υποληνιον, the pit under the press, into which the liquor ran, when squeezed out of the fruit by the press.</p>
