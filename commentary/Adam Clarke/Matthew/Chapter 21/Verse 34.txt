<p>Verse 34. <i><b>He sent his servants</b></i> — <i>Prophets</i>, which, from <i>time</i> to <i>time</i>, he sent to the Jewish nation to call both priests and people back to the purity of his holy religion.</p>
<p><i><b>Receive the fruits of it.</b></i> — Alluding to the ancient custom of paying the rent of a farm in <i>kind</i>; that is, by a part of the <i>produce</i> of the <i>farm</i>. This custom anciently prevailed in most nations; and still prevails in the highlands of Scotland, and in some other places. The <i>Boldon book</i>, a survey made of the state of the bishopric of Durham in 1183, shows how much of the rents was paid in cows, sheep, pigs, fowls, eggs, &amp;c., the remaining part being made up chiefly by manual labour.</p>
