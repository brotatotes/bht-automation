Verse 36. Other servants — There is not a moment in which God does not shower down his gifts upon men, and require the fruit of them. Various instruments are used to bring sinners to God. There are prophets, apostles, pastors, teachers: some with his gift after this manner, and some after that. The true disciples of Christ have been persecuted in all ages, and the greatest share of the persecution has fallen upon the ministers of his religion; for there have always been good and bad husbandmen, and the latter have persecuted the former.More than the first — Or, more honourable, so I think πλειονας should be translated; for, as the fulness of the time approached, each prophet more clearly and fully pointed out the coming of Christ.Our translation, which says, more than the first, conveys no meaning at all. πλειος is the meaning I have given it above, in Matthew 6:25. πλειον της τροφης, of MORE VALUE than food; and in Numbers 22:15 πλειους και εντιμοτερους, persons higher in dignity and office.
