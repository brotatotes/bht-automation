<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Last of all he sent - his son</b></i> — This requires no comment. Our Lord plainly means <i>himself</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>They will reverence</b></i> — εντραπησονται, they will <i>reflect</i> upon their <i>conduct</i> and <i>blush for shame</i> because of it, when they see my son. So the <i>Syric</i> and <i>Persic</i>.</p>
