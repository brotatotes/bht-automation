<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Cast</b></i><b> him </b><i><b>out of the vineyard</b></i> â€” Utterly rejected the counsel of God against themselves; and would neither acknowledge the <i>authority</i> of Christ, nor submit to his <i>teaching</i>. What a strange and unaccountable case is this! - a sinner, to enjoy a little longer his <i>false peace</i>, and the gratification of his sinful appetites, rejects Jesus, and persecutes that Gospel which troubles his sinful repose.</p>
