<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:41">Matthew 21:41</span>. <i><b>He will miserably destroy those wicked men</b></i> — So, according to this evangelist, our Lord caused them to pass that sentence of destruction upon themselves which was literally executed about <i>forty years</i> after. But Luke relates it differently: according to him, they said μηγενοιτο, <i>God forbid!</i> The Codex Leicestrensis omits οιλεγουσιν, <i>they say</i>; so that the following words appear to be spoken by our Lord. Michaelis supposes that in the Hebrew original the word was ויאמר <i>waiomer</i>, <i>he said</i>; for which the Greek translator might have read ויאמרו <i>waiomeru, they said</i>.</p>
