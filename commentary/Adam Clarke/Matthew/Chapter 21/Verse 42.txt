Verse Matthew 21:42. The stone — R. Solom. Jarchi, on Micah 5:0., says, this stone means the Messiah, אכן משיח: Abarbanel is of the same opinion. This seems to have been originally spoken of David who was at first rejected by the Jewish rulers, but was afterwards chosen by the Lord to be the great ruler of his people Israel. The quotation is taken from Psalms 118:22.As the Church is represented in Scripture under the name of the temple and house of God, in allusion to the temple of Jerusalem, which was a type of it, 1 Corinthians 3:16; Hebrews 3:6; 1 Peter 2:5; so Jesus Christ is represented as the foundation on which this edifice is laid, 1 Corinthians 3:11; Ephesians 2:20-21.The builders — The chief priests and elders of the people, with the doctors of the law.Rejected — An expression borrowed from masons, who, finding a stone, which being tried in a particular place, and appearing improper for it, is thrown aside, and another taken; however, at last, it may happen that the very stone which had been before rejected, may be found the most suitable as the head stone of the corner.This passage, as applied by our Lord to himself, contains an abridgment of the whole doctrine of the Gospel.1. The Lord's peculiar work is astonishingly manifested in the mission of Jesus Christ.2. He, being rejected and crucified by the Jews, became an atonement for the sin of the world.3. He was raised again from the dead, a proof of his conquest over death and sin, and a pledge of immortality to his followers.4. He was constituted the foundation on which the salvation of mankind rests, and the corner stone which unites Jews and Gentiles, beautifies, strengthens, and completes the whole building, as the head stone, or uppermost stone in the corner does the whole edifice.5. He is hereby rendered the object of the joy and admiration of all his followers and the glory of man. This was done by the Lord, and is marvellous in our eyes.
