<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>. <i><b>The stone</b></i> — R. Solom. Jarchi, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:0">Micah 5:0</span>., says, this <i>stone</i> means the <i>Messiah</i>, אכן משיח: Abarbanel is of the same opinion. This seems to have been originally spoken of <i>David</i> who was at first rejected by the Jewish rulers, but was afterwards chosen by the Lord to be the great ruler of his people Israel. The quotation is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>.</p>
<p>As the <i>Church</i> is represented in Scripture under the name of the <i>temple</i> and <i>house</i> of God, in allusion to the <i>temple</i> of Jerusalem, which was a type of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>; so Jesus Christ is represented as the <i>foundation</i> on which this edifice is laid, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20-21">Ephesians 2:20-21</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The builders</b></i> — The <i>chief priests</i> and <i>elders</i> of the people, with the <i>doctors</i> of the <i>law</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Rejected</b></i> — An expression borrowed from masons, who, finding a stone, which being tried in a particular place, and appearing improper for it, is thrown aside, and another taken; however, at last, it may happen that the <i>very stone</i> which had been before <i>rejected</i>, may be found the most suitable as the <i>head stone of the</i> <i>corner</i>.</p>
<p>This passage, as applied by our Lord to himself, contains an abridgment of the whole doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
<p>1. The <i>Lord's</i> peculiar <i>work</i> is astonishingly manifested in the mission of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>2. He, being <i>rejected</i> and <i>crucified</i> by the Jews, became an <i>atonement</i> for the sin of the world.</p>
<p>3. He was <i>raised</i> again from the dead, a proof of his <i>conquest</i> over <i>death</i> and <i>sin</i>, and a <i>pledge</i> of <i>immortality</i> to his followers.</p>
<p>4. He was constituted the <i>foundation</i> on which the salvation of mankind rests, and the <i>corner stone</i> which unites <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles, beautifies, strengthens</i>, and <i>completes</i> the whole building, as the <i>head stone</i>, or <i>uppermost</i> stone in the corner does the whole edifice.</p>
<p>5. He is hereby rendered the <i>object</i> of the <i>joy</i> and <i>admiration</i> of all his followers and the <i>glory</i> of man. <i>This was done by the</i> <i>Lord, and is marvellous in our eyes</i>.</p>
