<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:43">Matthew 21:43</span>. <i><b>Therefore say I</b></i> — Thus showing them, that to them alone the parable belonged. <i>The kingdom of God shall be taken</i> <i>from you</i>-the Gospel shall be taken from you, and given to the Gentiles, who will receive it, and bring forth fruit to the glory of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Bringing forth the fruits</b></i> — As in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:34">Matthew 21:34</span> an allusion is made to paying the landlord in <i>kind</i>, so here the Gentiles are represented as paying God thus. The <i>returns</i> which He expects for his grace are <i>the fruits of grace</i>; nothing can ever be acceptable in the sight of God that does not spring from <i>himself</i>.</p>
