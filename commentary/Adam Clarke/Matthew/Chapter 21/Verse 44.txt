<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>. The 44th verse should certainly come before <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:43">Matthew 21:43</span>, otherwise the narration is not consecutive.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>. <i>The stone which the builders rejected, is become the</i> <i>head of the corner</i>, c.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>. <i>Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken</i>, c. This is an allusion to the punishment of stoning among the Jews. The place of stoning was twice as high as a man while standing on this, one of the witnesses struck the culprit on the loins, so that he fell over this scaffold if he died by the stroke and fall, well; if not, the other witness threw a <i>stone</i> upon <i>his</i> <i>heart</i>, and despatched him. That stone thrown on the culprit was, in some cases, as much as two men could lift up. Tract <i>Sanhed</i>. and <i>Bab. Gemara</i>, and <i>Lightfoot</i>. See also the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:7">John 8:7</span>.</p>
<p>He, whether Jew or Gentile, who shall <i>not believe</i> in the Son of God, shall suffer grievously in consequence; but on whomsoever the <i>stone</i> (Jesus Christ) <i>falls</i> in the <i>way of judgment</i>, he shall <i>be</i> <i>ground to powder</i>, λικμησει αυτον - it shall make him so <i>small</i> as to render him capable of being <i>dispersed</i> as <i>chaff</i> by the <i>wind</i>. This seems to allude, not only to the dreadful <i>crushing</i> of the Jewish state by the Romans, but also to that general <i>dispersion</i> of the Jews through all the nations of the world, which continues to the present day. This whole verse is wanting in the Codex Bezae, one other, five copies of the Itala, and Origen; but it is found in the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:18">Luke 20:18</span>, and seems to have been quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14-15">Isaiah 8:14-15</span>. <i>He shall be</i> for <i>a</i> STONE <i>of</i> STUMBLING, <i>and for a</i> ROCK OF OFFENCE <i>to both the houses of Israel </i>- and <i>many among them</i> <i>shall</i> STUMBLE <i>and</i> FALL, <i>and be</i> BROKEN.</p>
