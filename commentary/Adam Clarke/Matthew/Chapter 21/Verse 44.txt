Verse Matthew 21:44. The 44th verse should certainly come before Matthew 21:43, otherwise the narration is not consecutive.-Verse Matthew 21:42. The stone which the builders rejected, is become the head of the corner, c.-Verse Matthew 21:44. Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, c. This is an allusion to the punishment of stoning among the Jews. The place of stoning was twice as high as a man while standing on this, one of the witnesses struck the culprit on the loins, so that he fell over this scaffold if he died by the stroke and fall, well; if not, the other witness threw a stone upon his heart, and despatched him. That stone thrown on the culprit was, in some cases, as much as two men could lift up. Tract Sanhed. and Bab. Gemara, and Lightfoot. See also the note on John 8:7.He, whether Jew or Gentile, who shall not believe in the Son of God, shall suffer grievously in consequence; but on whomsoever the stone (Jesus Christ) falls in the way of judgment, he shall be ground to powder, λικμησει αυτον - it shall make him so small as to render him capable of being dispersed as chaff by the wind. This seems to allude, not only to the dreadful crushing of the Jewish state by the Romans, but also to that general dispersion of the Jews through all the nations of the world, which continues to the present day. This whole verse is wanting in the Codex Bezae, one other, five copies of the Itala, and Origen; but it is found in the parallel place, Luke 20:18, and seems to have been quoted from Isaiah 8:14-15. He shall be for a STONE of STUMBLING, and for a ROCK OF OFFENCE to both the houses of Israel - and many among them shall STUMBLE and FALL, and be BROKEN.
