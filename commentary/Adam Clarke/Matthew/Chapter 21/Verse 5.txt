<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:5">Matthew 21:5</span>. <i><b>Tell ye the daughter of Sion</b></i> â€” The quotation is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span>, but not in the precise words of the prophet.</p>
<p>This entry into Jerusalem has been termed the <i>triumph</i> of Christ. It was indeed the triumph of <i>humility</i> over <i>pride</i> and worldly grandeur; of <i>poverty</i> over <i>affluence</i>; and of <i>meekness</i> and <i>gentleness</i> over <i>rage</i> and <i>malice</i>.</p>
<p>He is coming now <i>meek</i>, full of kindness and compassion to those who were plotting his destruction! He comes to deliver up himself into their hands; their king comes to be murdered by his subjects, and to make his death a ransom price for their souls!</p>
