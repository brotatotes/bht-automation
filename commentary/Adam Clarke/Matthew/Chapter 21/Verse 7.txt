<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:7">Matthew 21:7</span>. <i><b>And put on them their clothes</b></i> — Thus acknowledging him to be their <i>king</i>, for this was a <i>custom</i> observed by the people when they found that God had appointed a man to the kingdom. When Jehu sat with the captains of the army, and Elisha the prophet came, by the order of God, to anoint him king over Israel, as soon as he came out of the inner chamber into which the prophet had taken him to anoint him, and they knew what was done, <i>every man</i> <i>took his garment</i>, and <i>spread it under him on the top of the steps</i>, and <i>blew the trumpets</i>, saying, "Jehu is king." <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+9:13">2 Kings 9:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And they set</b></i><b> him </b><i><b>thereon.</b></i> — Και επεκαθισεν επανω αυτων, <i>and</i> <i>he sat upon them</i>; but instead of επανω αυτων, <i>upon</i> THEM, the Codex Bezae, seven copies of the <i>Itala</i>, some copies of the <i>Vulgate</i>, and some others, read επ' αυτον, <i>upon him</i>, i.e. the colt. This is most likely to be the true reading; for we can scarcely suppose that he rode upon both by <i>turns</i>, - this would appear <i>childish</i>; or that he rode upon both at <i>once</i>, for this would be <i>absurd</i>. Some say he sat on <i>both</i>; for "the ass that was <i>tied up</i> was an emblem of the Jews <i>bound under the yoke of the law</i>; and the <i>colt</i> that had <i>not been tied</i> represented the <i>Gentiles</i> who were <i>not under the law</i>; and that Jesus Christ's sitting on both represented his <i>subjecting</i> the Jews and the Gentiles to the <i>sway</i> of his evangelical <i>sceptre</i>." He who <i>can</i> receive this saying, let him receive it.</p>
