<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span>. <i><b>Hosanna to the son of David</b></i> — When persons applied to the king for help, or for a redress of grievances, they used the word <i>hosanna</i>, or rather from the Hebrew הושיעה נא HOSHIAH NA! <i>Save now</i>! or, <i>Save, we beseech thee</i>! - redress our grievances, and give us help from oppression! Thus both the <i>words</i> and <i>actions</i> of the people prove that they acknowledged Christ as their <i>king</i>, and looked to him for <i>deliverance</i>. How easily might he have assumed the sovereignty at this time, had he been so disposed! For instances of the use of this <i>form</i> of speech, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+14:4">2 Samuel 14:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+6:26">2 Kings 6:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:25">Psalms 118:25</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Son of David</b></i> — A well-known epithet of the Messiah. <i>He who</i> <i>cometh in the name</i>, c. He who comes in the <i>name</i> and <i>authority</i> of the Most High.</p>
<p><i><b>Hosanna in the highest</b></i> — Either meaning, Let the <i>heavenly hosts</i> join with us in magnifying this august Being! - or, Let the <i>utmost</i> <i>degrees</i> of hosanna, of <i>salvation</i>, and <i>deliverance</i>, be communicated to thy people! Probably there is an allusion here to the custom of the Jews in the feast of tabernacles. During the first seven days of that feast, they went <i>once</i> round the altar, each day, with <i>palm</i> and <i>other branches</i> in their hands, singing HOSANNA: but on the <i>eighth</i> day of that feast they walked <i>seven</i> times round the altar, singing the <i>hosanna</i> and this was termed the <i>hosanna rabba</i>, the GREAT <i>hosanna</i>: i.e. <i>Assist with the</i> <i>greatest succour</i>. Probably answering to the τοις υψιστοις of the evangelist, for on this day they beg the most <i>speedy</i> and <i>powerful</i> <i>help</i> against their <i>enemies</i>, and likewise pray for a <i>prosperous</i> and <i>fruitful</i> year. See STEHLIN'S <i>Jewish Traditions</i>, vol. ii. p. 322.</p>
