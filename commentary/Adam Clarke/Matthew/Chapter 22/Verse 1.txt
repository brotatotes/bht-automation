<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:2">Matthew 22:2</span>. <i><b>The kingdom of heaven</b></i> — In <i>Bereshith Rabba</i>, sect. 62. fol. 60, there is a parable very similar to this, and another still more so in <i>Sohar. Levit</i>. fol. 40. But these rabbinical parables are vastly ennobled by passing through the hands of our Lord. It appears from Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:15">Luke 14:15</span>; c., that it was at an <i>entertainment</i> that this parable was originally spoken. It was a constant practice of our Lord to take the <i>subjects</i> of his discourses from the persons present, or from the <i>circumstances</i> of <i>times, persons</i>, and <i>places</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:7-10">John 4:7-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26-27">John 6:26-27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span>. A preacher that can do so can never be at a loss for text or sermon.</p>
<p><i><b>A marriage for his son</b></i> — <i>A marriage feast</i>, so the word γαμους properly means. Or a feast of inauguration, when his son was put in possession of the government, and thus he and his new subjects became married together. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+1:5-9">1 Kings 1:5-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+1:19">1 Kings 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+1:25">1 Kings 1:25</span>, c., where such a feast is mentioned.</p>
<p>From this parable it appears plain,</p>
<p>1. That the KING means the <i>great God</i>.</p>
<p>2. His SON, the <i>Lord Jesus</i>.</p>
<p>3. The MARRIAGE, his <i>incarnation</i>, or <i>espousing human nature</i>, by taking it into <i>union</i> with himself.</p>
<p>4. The MARRIAGE FEAST, the <i>economy</i> of the <i>Gospel</i>, during which men are <i>invited</i> to partake of the <i>blessings</i> purchased by, and consequent on, the <i>incarnation</i> and death of our blessed Lord.</p>
<p>5. By <i>those who</i> HAD BEEN <i>bidden</i>, or <i>invited</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:3">Matthew 22:3</span>, are meant the <i>Jews</i> in general, who had this <i>union</i> of Christ with human nature, and his <i>sacrifice</i> for sin, pointed out by various <i>rites, ceremonies</i>, and <i>sacrifices</i> under the law and who, by all the prophets, <i>had been</i> constantly invited to believe in and receive the promised Messiah.</p>
<p>6. By the SERVANTS, we are to understand the <i>first preachers</i> of the Gospel, proclaiming salvation to the Jews. JOHN the <i>Baptist</i> and the seventy disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span>,) may be here particularly intended.</p>
<p>7. By the OTHER SERVANTS, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:4">Matthew 22:4</span>, the <i>apostles</i> seem to be meant, who, though they were to preach the Gospel to the whole world, yet were to begin at JERUSALEM (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:47">Luke 24:47</span>) with the first offers of mercy.</p>
<p>8. By their <i>making light of it</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</span>, is pointed out their <i>neglect</i> of this salvation, and their preferring <i>secular</i> <i>enjoyments</i>, c., to the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p>9. By <i>injuriously</i> <i>using</i> some, and <i>slaying</i> others, of his servants, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:6">Matthew 22:6</span>, is pointed out the persecution raised against the <i>apostles</i> by the <i>Jews</i>, in which some of them were martyred</p>
<p>. 10. By <i>sending forth</i> <i>his troops</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:7">Matthew 22:7</span>, is meant the <i>commission</i> given to the <i>Romans</i> against <i>Judea</i> and, <i>burning up their city</i>, the total destruction of Jerusalem by <i>Titus</i>, the son of <i>Vespasian</i>, which happened about <i>forty-one</i> years after.</p>
<p>On this parable it is necessary to remark,</p>
<p>1.That man was made at first in <i>union</i> with God.</p>
<p>2. That <i>sin</i> entered in, and <i>separated</i> between God and man.</p>
<p>3. That as there can be no <i>holiness</i> but in <i>union</i> with God, and no <i>heaven</i> without <i>holiness</i>, therefore he provided a way to <i>reconcile</i> and <i>reunite</i> man to himself.</p>
<p>4. This was effected by Christ's <i>uniting</i> himself to <i>human nature</i>, and giving his <i>Spirit</i> to those who <i>believe</i>.</p>
<p>5. That as the <i>marriage</i> <i>union</i> is the <i>closest</i>, the most <i>intimate, solemn</i>, and <i>excellent,</i> of all the connections formed among mortals, and that they who are thus united in the Lord are <i>one flesh</i> so that mystical <i>union</i> which is formed between God and the soul through Jesus Christ, by the Eternal Spirit, is the <i>closest</i>, most <i>intimate, solemn</i>, and <i>excellent</i>, that can be conceived; for he who is thus joined unto the Lord is <i>one spirit</i>.</p>
<p>6. This <i>contract</i> is made <i>freely</i>: no man can be <i>forced</i> to it, for it is a union of <i>will</i> to <i>will, heart</i> to <i>heart</i>; and it is by <i>willing</i> and <i>consenting</i> that we <i>come</i> unto God through his Son.</p>
<p>7. That if this <i>marriage</i> do not take place <i>here</i>, an eternal <i>separation</i> from God, and from the glory of his power, shall be the fearful consequence.</p>
<p>8. That there are <i>three</i> states in which men run the risk of living without God and losing their souls.</p>
<p>1st. That of a <i>soft, idle, voluptuous life</i>, wherein a man thinks of nothing but quietly to enjoy life, conveniences, riches, private pleasures, and public diversions. <i>They made light</i> <i>of it</i>.</p>
<p>2dly. That of a <i>man wholly taken up with agricultural</i> or <i>commercial</i> employments, in which the love of riches, and application to the <i>means</i> of acquiring them, generally stifle all thoughts of salvation. <i>One went to his own field, and another to</i> <i>his traffic</i>.</p>
<p>3dly. That of a man who is <i>openly unjust, violent,</i> and <i>outrageously wicked</i>, who is a <i>sinner by profession</i>, and not only <i>neglects</i> his salvation, but <i>injuriously</i> treats all those who bring him the Gospel of reconciliation. <i>Seizing his servants,</i> <i>they treated them injuriously</i>, &amp;c.</p>
