<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:11">Matthew 22:11</span>. <i><b>When the king came</b></i> — When God shall come to judge the world.</p>
<p><i><b>Wedding garment</b></i> — Among the orientals, long white robes were worn at public festivals; and those who appeared on such occasions with any other garments were esteemed, not only highly culpable, but worthy of punishment. Our Lord seems here to allude to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:7-8">Zephaniah 1:7-8</span>, <i>The Lord hath prepared a</i> SACRIFICE, <i>he hath</i> BIDDEN <i>his guests.</i> <i>And it shall come to pass, in the day of the Lord's sacrifice,</i> <i>that I will</i> PUNISH <i>the princes, and the</i> KING'S CHILDREN, <i>and</i> ALL SUCH <i>as are clothed with</i> STRANGE APPAREL. The person who invited the guests prepared such a garment for each, for the time being; and with which he was furnished on <i>his application to the ruler</i> of the feast. It was this which made the conduct of the person mentioned in the text inexcusable; he might have had a proper marriage garment, if he had <i>applied</i> for it.</p>
<p>This <i>marriage feast</i> or <i>dinner</i> (the communication of the graces of the Gospel in this life) prepares for the <i>marriage supper</i> of the Lamb, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7-9">Revelation 19:7-9</span>, the enjoyment of eternal blessedness in the kingdom of glory. Now, as without <i>holiness</i> no man can see the Lord, we may at once perceive what our Lord means by the <i>marriage</i> <i>garment </i>- it is HOLINESS of <i>heart</i> and <i>life</i>: the text last quoted asserts that the <i>fine, white</i>, and <i>clean linen</i> (alluding to the marriage garment above mentioned) was an emblem of the RIGHTEOUSNESS of the SAINTS. Mark this expression: the <i>righteousness</i>, the whole <i>external</i> conduct; regulated according to the <i>will</i> and <i>word</i> of God. Of the SAINTS, the <i>holy persons</i>, whose souls were purified by the blood of the Lamb.</p>
