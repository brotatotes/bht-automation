<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:12">Matthew 22:12</span>. <i><b>He saith unto him, Friend</b></i> — Rather, <i>companion</i>: so εταιρε should be translated. As this man represents the state of a person in the visible Church, who neglects to come unto the master of the feast for a marriage garment, for the salvation which Christ has procured, he cannot be with any propriety called a <i>friend</i>, but may well be termed a <i>companion</i>, as being a <i>member</i> of the visible Church, and <i>present</i> at all those ordinances where Christ's <i>presence</i> and blessing are found, by all those who sincerely wait upon him for salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>How camest thou in hither</b></i> — Why profess to be called by my name while living without a preparation for my kingdom?</p>
<p><i><b>He was speechless.</b></i> — εφιμωθη, he was <i>muzzled</i>, or <i>gagged</i>. He had nothing to say in vindication of his neglect. There was a garment provided, but he neither put it on, nor applied for it. His conduct, therefore, was in the highest degree insulting and indecorous. As this man is the emblem, by general consent, of those who shall perish in the last day, may we not ask, without offence, Where does the doctrine of absolute <i>reprobation</i> or <i>preterition</i> appear in his case? If Christ had <i>never died for him,</i> or if he had <i>applied</i> for the <i>garment</i>, and was <i>refused</i>, might he not well have alleged this in behalf of his soul? - and would not the <i>just</i> God have listened to it? But there is not the smallest excuse for him: Christ died, the sacrifice was offered, for <i>him</i>; the ministers of the Gospel invited him; the Holy Spirit strove with <i>him</i>; he <i>might</i> have been <i>saved</i>, but he <i>was not</i>: and the <i>fault</i> lies so absolutely at his <i>own door</i> that the just God is vindicated in his conduct, while he sends him to hell, not for the lack of what he <i>could not get</i>, but for the lack of what he <i>might</i> <i>have had</i>, but either neglected or refused it.</p>
<p><i><b>Then said the king to the servants</b></i> — To the ministering angels, executors of the Divine will.</p>
<p><i><b>Cast him into outer darkness</b></i> — The Jewish marriages were performed in the night season, and the hall where the feast was made was superbly illuminated; the <i>outer darkness</i> means, therefore, the darkness on the <i>outside</i> of this festal hall; rendered still more gloomy to the person who was suddenly thrust out into it from such a profusion of light.
