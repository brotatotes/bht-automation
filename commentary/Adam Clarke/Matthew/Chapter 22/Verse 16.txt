<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>. <i><b>The Herodians</b></i> â€” For an account of this sect, see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>. The preceding parable had covered the Pharisees with confusion: when it was ended they <i>went out</i>, not to <i>humble</i> themselves before God, and deprecate the judgments with which they were threatened; but to <i>plot afresh</i> the destruction of their teacher. The depth of their malice appears,</p>
<p>1. In their <i>mode</i> of <i>attack</i>. They had often questioned our Lord on matters concerning <i>religion</i>; and his answers only served to increase <i>his</i> reputation, and <i>their</i> confusion. They now shift their ground, and question him concerning <i>state affairs</i>, and the question is such as <i>must</i> be answered; and yet the answer, to all human appearance, can be none other than what may be construed into a crime against the <i>people</i>, or against the <i>Roman government</i>.</p>
<p>2. Their profound <i>malice</i> appears farther in the <i>choice</i> of their <i>companions</i> in this business, viz. the <i>Herodians</i>. Herod was at this very time at Jerusalem, whither he had come to hold the passover. Jesus, being of Nazareth, which was in Herod's jurisdiction, was considered as his subject. Herod himself was extremely attached to the Roman emperor, and made a public profession of it: all these considerations engaged the Pharisees to unite the Herodians, who, as the Syriac intimates, were the <i>domestics of Herod</i>, in this infernal plot.</p>
<p>3. Their profound <i>malice</i> appears, farther, in the <i>praises</i> they gave our Lord. <i>Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way</i> <i>of God</i>. This was indeed the real character of our blessed Lord; and now they bear testimony to the <i>truth</i>, merely with the design to make it subserve their bloody purposes. Those whose hearts are influenced by the spirit of the wicked one never do <i>good</i>, but when they hope to accomplish <i>evil</i> by it. Men who praise you to your face are ever to be suspected. The <i>Italians</i> have a very expressive proverb on this subject: - </p>
<p>I have never known the sentiment in this proverb to fail; and it was notoriously exemplified in the present instance. <i>Flatterers</i>, though they speak the truth, ever carry about with them a <i>base</i> or <i>malicious</i> soul.</p>
<p>4. Their <i>malice</i> appears still farther in the <i>question</i> they propose. <i>Is it lawful to give</i> <i>tribute to Caesar, or not</i>? - <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:17">Matthew 22:17</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>constitution</i> of the Jewish republic, the <i>expectations</i> which they had of future glory and excellence, and the <i>diversity</i> of <i>opinions</i> which divided the Jews on this subject, rendered an answer to this question extremely difficult: -</p>
<p>1. In the presence of the <i>people</i>, who professed to have no other king but God, and looked on their <i>independence</i> as an essential point of their religion.</p>
<p>2. In the presence of the <i>Pharisees</i>, who were ready to stir up the people against him, if his decision could be at all construed to be contrary to their prejudices, or to their religious rights.</p>
<p>3. In the presence of the <i>Herodians</i>, who, if the answer should appear to be against Caesar's rights, were ready to inflame their master to avenge, by the death of our Lord, the affront offered to his master the emperor.</p>
<p>4. The answer was <i>difficult</i>, because of the <i>different sentiments</i> of the Jews on this subject; some maintaining that they <i>could not</i> <i>lawfully</i> pay tribute to a <i>heathen</i> governor: while others held that as they were now under this strange government, and had no power to free themselves from it, it was <i>lawful</i> for them to pay what they had not power to refuse.</p>
<p>5. The answer was <i>difficult</i>, when it is considered that multitudes of the people had begun <i>now</i> to receive Jesus as the promised Messiah, who was to be the <i>deliverer</i> of their nation from spiritual and temporal <i>oppression</i>, and therefore had lately sung to him the <i>Hosanna Rabba</i>: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span>. If then he should decide the question in <i>Caesar's favour</i>, what idea must the people have of him, either as <i>zealous</i> for the <i>law</i>, or as the <i>expected Messiah</i>? If <i>against</i> Caesar, he is ruined. Who that loved Jesus, and was not convinced of his sovereign wisdom, could help trembling for him in these circumstances?</p>
<p>Jesus opposes the depth of his <i>wisdom</i> to the depth of their <i>malice</i>, and manifests it: -</p>
<p>1. By <i>unmasking</i> them, and showing that he knew the very secrets of their hearts. <i>Ye</i> HYPOCRITES! <i>why</i> <i>tempt ye me</i>? i.e. <i>why do ye try me thus</i>? This must cover them with <i>confusion</i>, when they saw their motives thus discovered; and tend much to lessen their influence in the sight of the people, when it was manifest that they acted not through a desire to receive <i>information</i>, by which to regulate their conduct, but merely to ensnare and ruin him.</p>
<p>2. Christ shows his profound <i>wisdom</i> in not attempting to discuss the question at large; but settled the business by seizing a maxim that was common among all people, and acknowledged among the Jews, <i>That the prince who causes his image and titles to be stamped on</i> <i>the current coin of a country, is virtually acknowledged thereby</i> <i>as the governor</i>. See Maimon. Gezel. c. v. in Wetstein. When Sultan MAHMOUD, king of <i>Maveralnahar, Turquestan</i>, and the <i>Indies</i>, wished to seize on the dominions of SEIDEH, queen of Persia, who governed in the place of her young son <i>Megededde-vlet</i>, about A. D. 909, he sent an ambassador to her with the following order: <i>You</i> <i>must acknowledge me for your</i> KING, <i>cause the kootbah to be read</i>, i.e. <i>pray for me in all the mosques of the kingdom, and</i> GET YOUR MONEY <i>recoined, with the</i> IMPRESSION THAT IS ON MINE: thus denoting that she must become absolutely subject to him. See Bibliot. Orient. de Galand. p. 453. Esau Afghan carried his conquest into Bhatty, into the viceroyalty of Bengal, and caused the kootbah to be read, and coin to be struck in the name of the Emperor Akbar. Ayeen Akbery, vol. ii p. 5.
