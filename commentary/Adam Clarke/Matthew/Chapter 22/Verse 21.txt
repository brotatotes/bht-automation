<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:21">Matthew 22:21</span>. <i><b>They say unto him, Caesars.</b></i> — The image was the <i>head</i> <i>of the emperor</i>; the <i>superscription</i>, his <i>titles</i>. JULIUS CAESAR was the <i>first</i> who caused his image to be struck on the Roman coin. <i>Tiberius</i> was emperor at this time.</p>
<p><i><b>Render therefore unto Caesar</b></i> — The conclusion is drawn from their own premises. You acknowledge this to be <i>Caesar's</i> coin; this coin is <i>current</i>, in your land; the currency of this coin shows the country to be <i>under</i> the Roman government; and your acknowledgment that it is Caesar's proves you have <i>submitted</i>. Don't therefore be <i>unjust</i>; but render to Caesar the things which you acknowledge to be his; at the same time, be not <i>impious</i>, but render unto God the thing's which belong to God.</p>
<p>This answer is full of consummate wisdom. It establishes the <i>limits</i>, regulates the <i>rights</i>, and distinguishes the <i>jurisdiction</i> of the two <i>empires</i> of <i>heaven</i> and <i>earth</i>. The <i>image</i> of <i>princes</i> stamped on their <i>coin</i> denotes that temporal things belong all to their government. The <i>image</i> of God stamped on the <i>soul</i> denotes that all its faculties and powers belong to the Most High, and should be employed in his service.</p>
<p>But while the earth is agitated and distracted with the question of political rights and wrongs, the reader will naturally ask, What does a man owe to <i>Caesar</i>? - to the <i>civil government</i> under which he lives? Our Lord has answered the question - <i>That which</i> IS <i>Caesar's</i>. But what is it that is Caesar's? 1. <i>Honour</i>. 2. <i>Obedience</i>. And 3. <i>Tribute</i>.</p>
<p>1. The civil government under which a man <i>lives</i>, and by which he is <i>protected</i>, demands his <i>honour</i> and <i>reverence</i>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>laws</i> which are made for the <i>suppression</i> of <i>evil doers</i>, and the maintenance of <i>good order</i>, which are calculated to promote the benefit of the <i>whole</i>, and the comfort of the <i>individual</i> should be religiously obeyed.</p>
<p>3. The government that charges itself with the <i>support</i> and <i>defence</i> of the <i>whole</i>, should have its <i>unavoidable</i> expenses, however great, repaid by the <i>people</i>, in whose behalf they are incurred; therefore we should pay <i>tribute</i>.</p>
<p>But remember, if <i>Caesar</i> should intrude into the <i>things</i> <i>of God</i>, coin a <i>new creed</i>, or broach a <i>new Gospel</i>, and affect to <i>rule</i> the <i>conscience</i>, while he rules the state, in these things Caesar is <i>not</i> to be obeyed; he is taking the <i>things of God</i>, and he must not get them. Give not therefore <i>God's things</i> to Caesar, and give not <i>Caesar's things</i> to God. That which belongs to the commonwealth should, on no account whatever, be devoted to religious uses; and let no man think he has pleased God, by giving that to charitable or sacred uses which he has purloined from the <i>state</i>. The tribute of half a shekel, which the law, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:13-14">Exodus 30:13-14</span>,) required every person above twenty years of age to pay to the temple, was, after the destruction of the temple, in the time of Vespasian, paid into the emperor's exchequer. This sum, <i>Melanethon</i> supposes, amounted annually to THREE TONS OF GOLD.</p>
