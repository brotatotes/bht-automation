<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:22">Matthew 22:22</span>. <i><b>When they had heard</b></i><b> these words, </b><i><b>they marvelled</b></i> â€” And well they might - never man spake like this man. By this decision, CAESAR is <i>satisfied </i>- he gets <i>his own</i> to the uttermost farthing. GOD is <i>glorified </i>- his <i>honour</i> is in <i>every</i> respect secured. And the PEOPLE are <i>edified </i>- one of the most difficult questions that could possibly come before them is answered in such a way as to <i>relieve</i> their <i>consciences</i>, and <i>direct</i> their <i>conduct</i>. See <i>L'Evangile</i> <i>Medite</i>, and see my discourse entitled, <i>The Rights of God and</i> <i>Caesar</i>.</p>
