Verse Matthew 22:22. When they had heard these words, they marvelled â€” And well they might - never man spake like this man. By this decision, CAESAR is satisfied - he gets his own to the uttermost farthing. GOD is glorified - his honour is in every respect secured. And the PEOPLE are edified - one of the most difficult questions that could possibly come before them is answered in such a way as to relieve their consciences, and direct their conduct. See L'Evangile Medite, and see my discourse entitled, The Rights of God and Caesar.
