<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:24">Matthew 22:24</span>. <i><b>Raise up seed unto his brother.</b></i> â€” This law is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+25:5">Deuteronomy 25:5</span>. The meaning of the expression is, that the children produced by this marriage should be reckoned in the <i>genealogy</i> of the <i>deceased</i> brother, and enjoy his estates. The word <i>seed</i> should be always translated <i>children</i> or <i>posterity</i>. There is a law precisely similar to this among the <i>Hindoos</i>.</p>
