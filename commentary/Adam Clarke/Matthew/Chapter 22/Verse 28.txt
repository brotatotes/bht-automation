<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:28">Matthew 22:28</span>. <i><b>Whose wife shall she be of the seven?</b></i> â€” The rabbins have said, That if a woman have two husbands in this world, she shall have the <i>first</i> only restored to her in the world to come. <i>Sohar. Genes</i>. fol. 24. The question put by these bad men is well suited to the mouth of a <i>libertine</i>. Those who live <i>without</i> God in the <i>world</i> have no <i>other god</i> than the <i>world</i>; and those who have not that happiness which comes from the enjoyment of God have no other pleasure than that which comes from the gratification of <i>sensual</i> appetites. The stream cannot rise higher than the spring: these men, and their <i>younger</i> brethren, <i>atheists, deists</i>, and <i>libertines</i> of all sorts, can form no idea of <i>heaven</i> as a place of <i>blessedness</i>, unless they can hope to find in it the <i>gratification</i> of their <i>sensual</i> desires. On this very ground Mohammed built his paradise.</p>
