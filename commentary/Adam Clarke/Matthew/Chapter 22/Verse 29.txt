<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Ye do err</b></i> — Or, <i>Ye are deceived </i>- by your impure passions: <i>not knowing the scriptures</i>, which assert the resurrection: - <i>nor the miraculous power of God</i> (την δυναμιν του Θεου) by which it is to be effected. In <i>Avoda Sara</i>, fol. 18, <i>Sanhedrin</i>, fol. 90, it is said: "These are they which shall have no part in the world to come: Those who say, the Lord did not come from heaven; and those who say, the resurrection cannot be proved out of the law."</p>
<p>Their <i>deception</i> appeared in their supposing, that if there were a resurrection, men and women were to marry and be given in marriage as in this life; which our Lord shows is not the case: for men and women there shall be like the angels of God, immortal, and free from all human passions, and from those propensities which were to continue with them only during this <i>present state</i> of existence. There shall be no <i>death</i>; and consequently no need of marriage to maintain the population of the spiritual world.</p>
