<p>Verse 32. <i><b>I am the God of Abraham</b></i> â€” Let it be observed, that Abraham was dead upwards of 300 years before these words were spoken to Moses: yet <i>still</i> God calls himself the <i>God of Abraham</i>, c. Now Christ properly observes that God is not the God of <i>the</i> <i>dead</i>, (that word being equal, in the sense of the Sadducees, to an <i>eternal annihilation</i>,) but of the <i>living</i> it therefore follows that, if he be the <i>God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i>, these are not <i>dead</i>, but <i>alive</i>; alive <i>with God</i>, though they had ceased, for some hundreds of years, to <i>exist among mortals</i>. We may see, from this, that our Lord combats and confutes <i>another</i> opinion of the Sadducees, viz. <i>that there is neither angel nor spirit</i>; by showing that the <i>soul</i> is not only immortal, but lives <i>with God</i>, even <i>while</i> the <i>body</i> is detained in the <i>dust</i> of the <i>earth</i>, which body is afterwards to be raised to life, and united with its soul by the <i>miraculous power of God</i>, of which <i>power</i> they showed themselves to be ignorant when they denied the <i>possibility</i> of a <i>resurrection</i>.</p>
