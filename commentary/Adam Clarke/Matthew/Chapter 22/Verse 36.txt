<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Which</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the great commandment</b></i> â€” We see here <i>three</i> kinds of <i>enemies</i> and false accusers of Christ and his disciples; and <i>three</i> sorts of <i>accusations</i> brought against them.</p>
<p>1. The <i>Herodians</i>, or politicians and courtiers, who form their questions and accusations on the <i>rights</i> of the <i>prince</i>, and matters of <i>state,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>Sadducees</i>, or <i>libertines</i>, who found theirs upon matters of <i>religion</i>, and <i>articles</i> of <i>faith</i>, which they did not credit, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:23">Matthew 22:23</span>.</p>
<p>3. The <i>Pharisees, lawyers, scribes</i>, or <i>Karaites</i>, hypocritical pretenders to devotion, who found theirs on that <i>vital</i> and <i>practical godliness</i> (the love of God and man) of which they wished themselves to be thought the sole proprietors, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:36">Matthew 22:36</span>.</p>
