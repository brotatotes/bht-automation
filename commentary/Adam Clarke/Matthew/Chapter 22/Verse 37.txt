<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Thou shalt love the Lord</b></i> — This is a subject of the greatest importance, and should be well understood, as our Lord shows that the whole of <i>true religion</i> is comprised in thus loving God and our neighbour.</p>
<p>It may not be unnecessary to inquire into the literal meaning of the word <i>love</i>. αγαπη, from αγαπαω, <i>I love</i>, is supposed to be compounded either of αγαν and ποιειν, <i>to act vehemently</i> or <i>intensely</i>; or, from αγειν κατα παν, because <i>love</i> is <i>always</i> <i>active</i>, and will <i>act in every possible way</i>; for he who loves is, with all his affection and desire, carried forward to the beloved object, in order to possess and enjoy it. Some derive it from αγαν and παυεσθαι, <i>to be completely at rest</i>, or, <i>to be</i> <i>intensely satisfied</i>; because he who loves is <i>supremely contented</i> with, and <i>rests completely satisfied</i> in, that which he loves. Others, from αγαν and παω, because a person <i>eagerly</i> embraces, and <i>vigorously holds fast</i>, that which is the object of his love. Lastly, others suppose it to be compounded of αγαω, <i>I admire</i>, and παυομαι, <i>I rest</i>, because that which a man loves intensely he <i>rests</i> in, with <i>fixed admiration</i> and <i>contemplation</i>. So that genuine love <i>changes not</i>, but always <i>abides</i> steadily <i>attached</i> to that which is loved.</p>
<p>Whatever may be thought of these <i>etymologies</i>, as being either <i>just</i> or <i>probable</i>, one thing will be evident to all those who know what <i>love</i> means, that they throw much light upon the subject, and manifest it in a variety of striking points of view. The ancient author of a MS. Lexicon in the late French king's library, under the word αγαπη, has the following definition: σπαϚος προθεσις επι τη φιλια του φιλουμενου - Σομψυχια. "A pleasing surrender of friendship to a friend: - an identity or sameness of soul." A sovereign preference given to <i>one</i> above all others, present or absent: a <i>concentration</i> of all the thoughts and desires in a single object, which a man prefers to all others. Apply this definition to the love which God requires of his creatures, and you will have the most correct view of the subject. Hence it appears that, by <i>this love</i>, the soul <i>eagerly cleaves to,</i> <i>affectionately admires</i>, and <i>constantly rests</i> in God, supremely <i>pleased</i> and <i>satisfied</i> with him as its <i>portion</i>: that it acts <i>from</i> him, as its <i>author; for</i> him, as its <i>master</i>; and <i>to</i> him, as its <i>end</i>. That, <i>by</i> it, all the powers and faculties of the mind are <i>concentrated</i> in tho Lord of the universe. That, by it, the whole man is willingly surrendered to the Most High: and that, <i>through</i> it, an <i>identity</i>, or <i>sameness</i> of spirit with the Lord is acquired-the man being made a partaker of the Divine nature, having the mind in him which was in Christ, and thus dwelling in God, and God in him.</p>
<p>But what is implied in loving God <i>with all the heart, soul,</i> <i>mind, strength</i>, c., and when may a man be said to do this?</p>
<p>1. He loves God <i>with all his heart</i>, who loves nothing in <i>comparison</i> of him, and nothing but in <i>reference</i> to him: - who is ready to give up, do, or suffer any thing in order to please and glorify him:-who has in his heart neither <i>love</i> nor <i>hatred, hope</i> nor <i>fear,</i> <i>inclination</i>, nor <i>aversion, desire</i>, nor <i>delight</i>, but as they relate to God, and are regulated by him.</p>
<p>2. He loves God with <i>all his soul</i>, or rather, εν ολη τη ψυχη, <i>with all his life</i>, who is ready to give up <i>life</i> for his sake - to endure all sorts of torments, and to be deprived of all kinds of comforts, rather than dishonour God: - who employs <i>life</i> with all its comforts, and conveniences, to glorify God in, by, and through all: - to whom <i>life</i> and <i>death</i> are nothing, but as they come from and lead to God, From this Divine principle sprang the <i>blood of the</i> <i>martyrs</i>, which became the seed of the Church. <i>They overcame</i> <i>through the blood of the Lamb, and loved not their lives unto the</i> <i>death</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:11">Revelation 12:11</span>.</p>
<p>3. He loves God with <i>all his strength</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:27">Luke 10:27</span>) who <i>exerts</i> all the <i>powers</i> of his body and soul in the service of God: - who, for the glory of his Maker, spares neither <i>labour</i> nor <i>cost </i>- who sacrifices his time, body, health, ease, for the honour of God his Divine Master: - who employs in his service all his goods, his talents, his power, credit, authority, and influence.</p>
<p>4. He loves God with <i>all his mind</i> (<i>intellect </i>- διανοια) who applies himself only to <i>know</i> God, and his holy will: - who receives with submission, gratitude, and pleasure, the sacred truths which God has revealed to man: - who studies no <i>art</i> nor <i>science</i> but as far as it is necessary for the service of God, and uses it at all times to promote his glory - who forms no projects nor designs but in reference to God and the interests of mankind: - who banishes from his <i>understanding</i> and <i>memory</i> every useless, foolish, and dangerous thought, together with every <i>idea</i> which has any tendency to defile his soul, or turn it for a moment from the <i>centre</i> of eternal repose. In a word, he who sees God in all things - thinks of him at all times - having his mind continually fixed upon God, acknowledging him in all his ways - who begins, continues, and ends all his thoughts, words, and works, to the glory of his name: - this is the person who loves God with all his <i>heart, life, strength,</i> and <i>intellect</i>. He is crucified to the world, and the world to him: he lives, yet not he, but Christ lives in him. He beholds as in a glass the glory of the Lord, and is changed into the same image from glory to glory. Simply and constantly looking unto Jesus, the author and perfecter of his faith, he receives continual supplies of enlightening and sanctifying grace, and is thus fitted for every good word and work. O glorious state! far, far, beyond this description! which comprises an ineffable communion between the ever-blessed Trinity and the soul of man!</p>
