<p>Verse 38. <i><b>This is the first and great commandment.</b></i> â€” It is so,</p>
<p>1. In its <i>antiquity</i>, being as old as the world, and engraven originally on our very nature.</p>
<p>2. In <i>dignity</i>; as directly and immediately proceeding front and referring to God.</p>
<p>3. In <i>excellence</i>; being the commandment of the new covenant, and the very spirit of the Divine adoption.</p>
<p>4. In <i>justice</i>; because it alone renders to God his due, prefers him before all things, and secures to him his proper rank in relation to them.</p>
<p>5. In <i>sufficiency</i>; being in itself capable of making men holy in this life, and happy in the other.</p>
<p>6. In <i>fruitfulness</i>; because it is the <i>root</i> of all commandments, and the fulfilling of the law.</p>
<p>7. In <i>virtue</i> and <i>efficacy</i>; because by this alone God reigns in the heart of man, and man is united to God.</p>
<p>8. In <i>extent</i>; leaving nothing to the creature, which it does not refer to the Creator.</p>
<p>9. In <i>necessity</i>; being absolutely <i>indispensable</i>.</p>
<p>10. In <i>duration</i>; being ever to be <i>continued</i> on earth, and never to be <i>discontinued</i> in heaven.</p>
