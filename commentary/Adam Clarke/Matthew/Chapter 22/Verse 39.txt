<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Thou shalt love thy neighbour</b></i> â€” The love of our neighbour springs from the love of God as its <i>source</i>; is found in the love of God as its <i>principle, pattern</i>, and <i>end</i>; and the love of God is found in the love of our neighbour, as its effect, representation, and infallible <i>mark</i>. This love of our neighbour is a love of <i>equity, charity, succour</i>, and <i>benevolence</i>. We owe to our neighbour what we have a right to expect from <i>him </i>- "Do unto all men as ye would they should do unto you," is a positive command of our blessed Saviour. By this rule, therefore, we should <i>speak,</i> <i>think</i>, and <i>write</i>, concerning every soul of man: - put the best construction upon all the words and actions of our neighbour that they can possibly bear. By this rule we are taught to bear with, love, and forgive him; to rejoice in his felicity, mourn in his adversity, desire and delight in his prosperity, and promote it to the utmost of our power: instruct his ignorance, help him in his weakness, and risk even our life for his sake, and for the public good. In a word, we must do every thing in our power, through all the possible varieties of circumstances, for our neighbours, which we would wish them to do for us, were our situations <i>reversed</i>.</p>
<p>This is the religion of Jesus! How happy would Society be, were these two plain, rational precepts properly observed! <i>Love</i> ME, <i>and love thy</i> FELLOWS! Be unutterably happy in me, and be in perfect peace, unanimity, and love, among yourselves. Great fountain and dispenser of love! fill thy creation with this sacred principle, for his sake who died for the salvation of mankind!</p>
