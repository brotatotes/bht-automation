Verse Matthew 22:44. The Lord (יהוה Yeve or Jehovah) said unto my Lord, (אדניע Adni or Adonai, my prop, stay, master, support), Sit thou on my right hand — Take the place of the greatest eminence and authority. Till I make thine enemies thy footstool - till I subdue both Jews and Gentiles under thee, and cause them to acknowledge thee as their sovereign and Lord. This quotation is taken from Psalms 110:1; and, from it, these two points are clear:1. That David wrote it by the inspiration of God; and2. That it is a prophetic declaration of the Messiah.
