<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:46">Matthew 22:46</span>. <i><b>Neither durst any - ask him any more</b></i><b> questions.</b>] "Thus," says Dr. Wotton, "our Lord put the four great sects of the Jews to silence, in one day, successively. The Herodians and Pharisees wanted to know whether they might lawfully pay tribute to Caesar or not. The Sadducees were inquisitive to know whose wife the woman should be of the seven brethren, in the resurrection, who had her to wife. Then comes the <i>scribe</i>, (or <i>karaite</i>,) who owned no authority beyond or besides the written law, and asked which was the great commandment in the law. This lawyer deserves to be mentioned here, because he not only acquiesced in, but commended, what our Lord had said in answer to his question." Wotton's Miscellaneous Discourses, vol. i. p. 78.</p>
<p>The Pharisees and Herodians were defeated, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:15-22">Matthew 22:15-22</span>. The Sadducees were confounded, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:29-33">Matthew 22:29-33</span>. The lawyers or karaites nonplussed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:37-40">Matthew 22:37-40</span>. And the Pharisees, &amp;c., finally routed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:41-46">Matthew 22:41-46</span>. Thus did the <i>wisdom</i> of God triumph over the <i>cunning</i> of men.</p>
<p>From this time, we do not find that our Lord was any more troubled with their captious questions: their whole stock, it appears, was expended, and now they coolly deliberate on the most effectual way to get him murdered. He that resists the <i>truth</i> of God is capable of effecting the worst purpose of Satan.</p>
<p>The very important subjects of this chapter have been so amply discussed in the notes, and applied so particularly to their spiritual uses, that it does not appear necessary to add any thing by way of practical improvement. The explanation of the great command of the law is particularly recommended to the reader's notice. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:36-40">Matthew 22:36-40</span>.</p>
