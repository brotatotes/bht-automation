<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:8">Matthew 22:8</span>. <i><b>Were not worthy.</b></i> â€” Because they <i>made light</i> of it, and <i>would not come</i>; preferring earthly things to heavenly blessings. Among the <i>Mohammedans</i>, refusal to come to a marriage feast, when invited, is considered a breach of the law of God. HEDAYAH, vol. iv. p. 91. Any one that shall be invited to a dinner, and does not accept the invitation, disobeys God, and his messenger: and any one who comes uninvited, you may say is a thief, and returns a plunderer.-<i>Mischat ul Mesabih</i>. It was probably considered in this light among all the oriental nations. This observation is necessary, in order to point out more forcibly the <i>iniquity</i> of the refusal mentioned in the text. A man may be said to be <i>worthy</i> of, or <i>fit</i> for, this marriage feast, when, <i>feeling</i> his <i>wretchedness</i> and <i>misery</i>, he comes to God in the way <i>appointed</i>, to get an entrance into the holiest, by the blood of Jesus.</p>
