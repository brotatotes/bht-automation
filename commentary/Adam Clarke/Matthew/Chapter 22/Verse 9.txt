Verse Matthew 22:9. Go ye therefore into the highways — διεξοδους των αδων, cross or by-paths; the places where two or more roads met in one, leading into the city, where people were coming together from various quarters of the country. St. Luke adds hedges, to point out the people to whom the apostles were sent, as either miserable vagabonds, or the most indigent poor, who were wandering about the country, or sitting by the sides of the ways and hedges, imploring relief. This verse points out the final rejection of the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles. It was a custom among the Jews, when a rich man made a feast, to go out and invite in all destitute travellers. See in Rab. Beracoth, fol. 43.As many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage — God sends his salvation to every soul, that all may believe and be saved.
