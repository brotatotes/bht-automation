<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:9">Matthew 22:9</span>. <i><b>Go ye therefore into the highways</b></i> — διεξοδους των αδων, <i>cross</i> or <i>by-paths</i>; the places where <i>two</i> or <i>more</i> roads met in <i>one</i>, leading into the city, where people were coming together from various quarters of the country. St. Luke adds <i>hedges</i>, to point out the people to whom the apostles were sent, as either <i>miserable vagabonds</i>, or the most indigent poor, who were wandering about the country, or sitting by the sides of the ways and hedges, imploring relief. This verse points out the final <i>rejection</i> of the <i>Jews</i>, and the <i>calling</i> of the <i>Gentiles</i>. It was a custom among the Jews, when a rich man made a feast, to go out and invite in all destitute travellers. See in <i>Rab. Beracoth</i>, fol. 43.</p>
<p><i><b>As many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage</b></i> — God sends his salvation to every soul, that all may believe and be saved.</p>
