<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:2">Matthew 23:2</span>. <i><b>The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat</b></i> — εκαθισαν. - They <i>sat</i> there <i>formerly</i> by Divine <i>appointment</i>: they <i>sit</i> there <i>now</i> by Divine <i>permission</i>. What our Lord says here refers to their expounding the Scriptures, for it was the custom of the Jewish doctors to <i>sit</i> while they <i>expounded</i> the <i>law</i> and <i>prophets</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20-22">Luke 4:20-22</span>,) and <i>to stand up</i> when they <i>read</i> them.</p>
<p>By <i>the seat of Moses</i>, we are to understand authority to teach the law. Moses was the great teacher of the Jewish people; and the scribes, &amp;c., are here represented as his successors.</p>
