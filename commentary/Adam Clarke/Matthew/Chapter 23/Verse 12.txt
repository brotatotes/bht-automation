<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:12">Matthew 23:12</span>. <i><b>Whosoever shall exalt himself</b></i>, c.] The way to arrive at the highest degree of dignity, in the sight of God, is by being willing to become the servant of all. Nothing is more hateful in his sight than <i>pride</i> to bring it into everlasting contempt, God was manifest in the flesh. He who was in the likeness of God took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of man, and humbled himself unto death. After this, can God look upon any <i>proud</i> man without <i>abasing</i> him? Spiritual <i>lordship</i> and <i>domination</i>, ecclesiastical <i>luxury, pomp</i>, and <i>pride</i>, must be an abhorrence in the sight of that God who gave the above advices to his followers.</p>
<p>Another lesson, which our blessed Lord teaches here, is, that no man is <i>implicitly</i> to receive the <i>sayings, doctrines</i>, and <i>decisions</i> of any man, or number of men, in the things which concern the interests of his immortal soul. Christ, his Spirit, and his word, are the only infallible teachers. Every man who wishes to save his soul must search the Scriptures, by prayer and faith. Reader, take counsel with the pious; hear the discourses of the wise and holy: but let the book of God ultimately fix thy creed.</p>
