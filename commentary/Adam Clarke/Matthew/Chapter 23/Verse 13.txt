<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13-14">Matthew 23:13-14</span>. <i><b>Wo unto you, scribes</b></i> — I think the <i>fourteenth</i> and <i>thirteenth</i> verses should be <i>transposed</i>. This transposition is authorized by some of the best MSS., versions, and fathers. The <i>fourteenth</i> is wanting in the BDL., and in many others of inferior note, as well as in several of the <i>versions</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text, in his first edition; I hesitated, and left it in, thus transposed. I am happy to find that a more extensive collation of MSS., c., afforded proof to that eminent critic that it should be restored to its place. In the <i>second</i> edition, he has transposed the two, just as I had done. The <i>fifteenth</i> reads best after the <i>thirteenth</i>.</p>
<p>-Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</span>. <i><b>Ye shut up the kingdom</b></i> — As a <i>key</i> by opening a <i>lock</i> gives <i>entrance</i> into a house, c., so <i>knowledge</i> of the sacred testimonies, manifested in <i>expounding</i> them to the people, may be said <i>to open</i> the way into the kingdom of heaven. But where men who are termed <i>teachers</i> are destitute of this <i>knowledge</i> themselves, they may be said to <i>shut</i> this kingdom because they occupy the place of those who <i>should teach</i>, and thus <i>prevent</i> the people from acquiring heavenly knowledge.</p>
<p>In ancient times the rabbins carried a <i>key</i>, which was the symbol or emblem of knowledge. Hence it is written in <i>Semachoth</i>, chap. 8.," When Rab. Samuel the little died, his key and his tablets were hung on his tomb, because he died childless." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>kingdom of heaven</i> here means the Gospel of Christ the Pharisees would not receive it themselves, and hindered the common people as far as they could.</p>
