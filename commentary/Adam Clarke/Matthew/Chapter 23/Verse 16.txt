Verse Matthew 23:16. Whosoever shall swear by the gold â€” The covetous man, says one, still gives preference to the object of his lust; gold has still the first place in his heart. A man is to be suspected when he recommends those good works most from which he receives most advantage.Is bound thereby, i.e. to fulfil his oath.
