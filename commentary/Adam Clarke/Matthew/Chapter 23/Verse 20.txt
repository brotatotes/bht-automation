<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:20">Matthew 23:20</span>. <i><b>Whoso - shall swear by the altar</b></i> â€” As an oath always supposes a person who witnesses it, and will punish perjury; therefore, whether they swore by the <i>temple</i> or the <i>gold</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:16">Matthew 23:16</span>), or by the <i>altar</i> or the <i>gift</i> laid on it, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:18">Matthew 23:18</span>), the oath necessarily supposes the God of the temple, of the altar, and of the gifts, who witnessed the whole, and would, even in <i>their exempt</i> cases, punish the perjury.</p>
