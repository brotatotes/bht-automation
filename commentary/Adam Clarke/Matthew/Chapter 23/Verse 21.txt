<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:21">Matthew 23:21</span>. <i><b>Whoso shall swear by the temple</b></i> — Perhaps it is to this custom of swearing by the temple, that Martial alludes, lib. xi. epist. 95. </p>
<p><i><b>By him that dwelleth therein.</b></i> — The common reading is κατοικουντι, <i>dwelleth</i> or INHABITETH, but κατοικησαντι, <i>dwelt</i> or DID <i>inhabit</i>, is the reading of CDEFGHKLM, <i>eighty-six</i> others; this reading has been adopted in the editions of <i>Complutum,</i> <i>Colineus, Bengel</i>, and <i>Griesbach</i>. The importance of this reading may be perceived by the following considerations. In the <i>first</i> Jewish temple, God had graciously condescended to manifest himself - he is constantly represented as dwelling between the cherubim, the two figures that stood at each end of the ark of the covenant; between whom, on the mercy seat, the lid of the ark, a splendour of glory was exhibited, which was the symbol and proof of the Divine <i>presence</i>. This the Jews called שכינה <i>Shekinah, the</i> <i>habitation of Jehovah</i>. Now the Jews unanimously acknowledge that <i>five</i> things were wanting in the second temple, which were found in the first, viz.,</p>
<p>1. The ark;</p>
<p>2. The holy spirit of prophecy;</p>
<p>3. The Urim and Thummim;</p>
<p>4. The sacred fire; and</p>
<p>5. The שכינה <i>Shekinah</i>.</p>
<p>As the Lord had long before this time abandoned the Jewish temple, and had now made the human nature of Jesus the <i>Shekinah</i>, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>, the Logos was made flesh, εσκηνωσεν, and made his tabernacle - made the <i>Shekinah</i>,-among us,) our Lord could not, with any propriety, say that the supreme Being did <i>now</i> <i>inhabit</i> the temple; and therefore used a word that hinted to them that God <i>had forsaken</i> their temple, and consequently the whole of that service which was performed in it, and had now opened the new and living way to the holiest by the Messiah. But all this was common swearing; and, whether the subject was <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, the oath was unlawful. A common swearer is worthy of no credit, when, even in the most solemn manner he takes an oath before a magistrate; he is so accustomed to stake his <i>truth</i>, perhaps even his <i>soul</i>, to things whether true or false, that an oath cannot bind him, and indeed is as little respected by himself as it is by his neighbour. Common swearing, and the shocking <i>frequency</i> and <i>multiplication</i> of oaths in <i>civil</i> cases, have destroyed all respect for an oath; so that men seldom feel themselves bound by it; and thus it is useless in many cases to require it as a confirmation, in order to end strife or ascertain truth. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37">Matthew 5:37</span>.</p>
