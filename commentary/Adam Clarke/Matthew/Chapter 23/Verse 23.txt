<p>Verse 23.. <i><b>Ye pay tithe of mint</b></i>, c.] They were remarkably scrupulous in the performance of all the rites and ceremonies of religion, but totally neglected the soul, spirit, and practice of godliness.</p>
<p><i><b>Judgment</b></i> â€” Acting according to justice and equity towards all mankind. <i>Mercy </i>- to the distressed and miserable. And <i>faith</i> in God as the fountain of all righteousness, mercy, and truth. The scribes and Pharisees neither began nor ended their works in God, nor had they any respect unto his name in doing them. They did them to be seen of men, and they had their reward-<i>human applause</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>These ought ye to have done</b></i>, &amp;c.] Our Lord did not object to their paying tithe even of common pot-herbs - this did not affect the spirit of religion but while they did this and such like, to the utter neglect of justice, mercy, and faith, they showed that they had no religion, and knew nothing of its nature.</p>
