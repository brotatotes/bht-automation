<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:24">Matthew 23:24</span>. <i><b>Blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a</b></i><b> </b><i><b>camel.</b></i> â€” This clause should be thus translated: Ye strain out the gnat, but ye swallow down the camel. In the common translation, <i>Ye strain</i> AT <i>a gnat</i>, conveys no sense. Indeed, it is likely to have been at first an error of the press, AT for OUT, which, on examination, I find escaped in the edition of 1611, and has been regularly continued since. There is now before me, "<i>The Newe</i> <i>Testament, (both in Englyshe and in Laten,) of Mayster Erasmus</i> <i>translacion, imprynted by Wyllyam Powell, dwellynge in Flete</i> <i>strete: the yere of our Lorde M.CCCCC.XLVII. the fyrste yere of</i> <i>the kynges (Edwd. VI.) moste gracious reygne</i>." in which the verse stands thus: "<i>Ye blinde gides, which strayne out a gnat, and</i> <i>swalowe a cammel</i>." It is the same also in Edmund Becke's Bible, printed in London 1549, and in several others. - <i>Clensynge a gnatte</i>. - MS. Eng. Bib. So <i>Wickliff</i>. Similar to this is the following Arabic proverb [Arabic]. <i>He eats an elephant and is choked by a</i> <i>gnat</i>.</p>
