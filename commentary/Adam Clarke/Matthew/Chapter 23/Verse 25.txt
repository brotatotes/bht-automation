<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:25">Matthew 23:25</span>. <i><b>Ye make clean the outside</b></i> — The Pharisees were exceedingly exact in observing all the washings and purifications prescribed by the law; but paid no attention to that inward purity which was typified by them. A man may appear clean without, who is unclean within; but <i>outward purity</i> will not avail in the sight of God, where <i>inward holiness</i> is wanting.</p>
<p><i><b>Extortion and excess.</b></i> — 'Αρπαγης και ακρασιας, <i>rapine and</i> <i>intemperance</i>; but instead of ακρασιας, <i>intemperance</i>, many of the very best MSS., CEFGHKS, and more than a hundred others, the Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic, Slavonic, with Chrysostorn, Euthym., and Theophylact, have αδικιας <i>injustice</i>, which Griesbach has admitted into the text instead of ακρασιας. The latter Syriac has both. Several MSS. and versions have ακαθαρσιας, <i>uncleanness</i>; others have πλεονεξιας, <i>covetousness</i>; some have πονηριας, <i>wickedness;</i> and two of the ancients have <i>iniquitate, iniquity</i>. Suppose we put them all together, the character of the Pharisee will not be overcharged. They were full of <i>rapine</i> and <i>intemperance, injustice</i> and <i>uncleanness, covetousness, wickedness</i>, and <i>iniquity</i>.</p>
