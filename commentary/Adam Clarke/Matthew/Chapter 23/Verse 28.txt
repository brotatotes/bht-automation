<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:28">Matthew 23:28</span>. <i><b>Even so ye also - appear righteous unto men</b></i> â€” But what will this appearance avail a man, when God sits in judgment upon his soul? Will the fair reputation which he had acquired among men, while his heart was the seat of unrighteousness, screen him from the stroke of that justice which <i>impartially</i> sends all impurity and unholiness into the pit of destruction? No. <i>In</i> the sin that he hath sinned, and in which he hath died, and <i>according</i> to <i>that</i>, shall he be judged and punished; and his profession of holiness only tends to sink him deeper into the lake which burns with unquenchable fire. Reader! see that thy <i>heart</i> be right with God.</p>
