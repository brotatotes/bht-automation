<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:3">Matthew 23:3</span>. <i><b>All therefore whatsoever</b></i> — That is, all those things which they read out of the law and prophets, and all things which they teach consistently with them. This must be our Lord's meaning: he could not have desired them to do every thing, without restriction, which the Jewish doctors taught; because himself warns his disciples against their false teaching, and testifies that they had made the word of God of none effect by their traditions. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:6">Matthew 15:6</span>, &amp;c. Besides, as our Lord speaks here in the past tense - <i>whatsoever they</i> HAVE <i>commanded</i>, οσαειπωσιν, he may refer to the teaching of a former period, when they taught the way of God in truth, or were much less corrupted than they were now.</p>
