<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Ye be witnesses</b></i> â€” Ye acknowledge that ye are the children of those murderers, and ye are about to give full proof that ye are not <i>degenerated</i>.</p>
<p>There are many who think that, had they lived in the time of our Lord, they would not have acted towards him as the Jews did. But we can scarcely believe that they who reject his Gospel, trample under foot his precepts, do despite to the Spirit of his grace, love sin, and hate his followers, would have acted otherwise to him than the murdering Jews, had they lived in the same times.</p>
