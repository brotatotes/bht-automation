<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Fill ye up then</b></i> — Notwithstanding the profession you make, ye will fill up the measure of your fathers-will continue to walk in their way, accomplish the fulness of every evil purpose by murdering me; and then, when the measure of your iniquity is full, vengeance shall come upon you to the uttermost, as it did on your rebellious ancestors. The 31st verse should be read in a parenthesis, and then the 32d will appear to be, what it is, an Inference from the 30th.</p>
<p><i>Ye will fill up</i>, or <i>fill ye up </i>- πληρωσατε but it is manifest that the <i>imperative</i> is put here for the <i>future</i>, a thing quite consistent with the <i>Hebrew idiom</i>, and frequent in the Scriptures. So <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>, <i>Destroy this temple</i>, &amp;c., i.e. Ye <i>will</i> destroy or pull down this temple, and I <i>will</i> rebuild it in three days-Ye <i>will</i> crucify me, and I <i>will</i> rise again the third day. Two good MSS. have the word in the future tense: and my old MS. Bible has it in the present-<i>Ge</i> (ye) <i>fulfillen the mesure of youre</i> (your) <i>fadris</i>.</p>
