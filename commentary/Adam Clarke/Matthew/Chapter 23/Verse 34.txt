<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Wherefore</b></i> â€” To show how my prediction, <i>Ye will fill</i> <i>up the measure of your fathers</i>, shall be verified, <i>Behold, I send</i> (I am just going to commission them) <i>prophets</i>, &amp;c. <i>and some ye</i> <i>will kill</i>, (with legal process,) and some ye will <i>crucify</i>, pretend to try and find guilty, and deliver them into the hands of the Romans, who shall, through you, <i>thus</i> put them to death. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49">Luke 11:49</span>. By prophets, wise men, and scribes, our Lord intends the evangelists, apostles, deacons, &amp;c., who should be employed in proclaiming his Gospel: men who should equal the ancient prophets, their wise men, and scribes, in all the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit.</p>
