<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span>. <i><b>Upon the earth</b></i> — επι της γης, <i>upon this land</i>, meaning probably the land of <i>Judea</i>; for thus the word is often to be understood. The national punishment of all the innocent <i>blood</i> <i>which had been shed in the land</i>, shall speedily come upon you, <i>from the blood of Abel the just</i>, the first prophet and preacher of righteousness, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:4">Hebrews 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>, <i>to the blood of Zachariah, the son of Barachiah</i>. It is likely that our Lord refers to the murder of Zachariah, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:20">2 Chronicles 24:20</span>, who <i>said to the people, Why transgress ye the commandments of God,</i> <i>so that ye cannot prosper? Because ye have forsaken the Lord, he</i> <i>hath forsaken you. And they conspired against him and stoned</i> <i>him - at the commandment of the king, in the court of the house of</i> <i>the Lord. And when he died, he said, The Lord look upon and</i> <i>require it</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:21-22">2 Chronicles 24:21-22</span>.</p>
<p>But it is objected, that this Zachariah was called the son of <i>Jehoiada</i>, and our Lord calls this one the son of <i>Barachiah</i>. Let it be observed,</p>
<p>1. That <i>double</i> names were frequent among the Jews; and sometimes the person was called by one, sometimes by the other. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:1">1 Samuel 9:1</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+8:33">1 Chronicles 8:33</span>, where it appears that the father of <i>Kish</i> had two names, <i>Abiel</i> and <i>Ner</i>. So <i>Matthew</i> is called <i>Levi</i>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:9">Matthew 9:9</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:14">Mark 2:14</span>. So <i>Peter</i> was also called <i>Simon</i>, and <i>Lebbeus</i> was called <i>Thaddeus.</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:2-3">Matthew 10:2-3</span>.</p>
<p>2. That Jerome says that, in the Gospel of the Nazarenes, it was <i>Jehoiada</i>, instead of <i>Barachiah</i>.</p>
<p>3. That <i>Jehoiada</i> and <i>Barachiah</i> have the very same meaning, the <i>praise</i> or <i>blessing of Jehovah</i>.</p>
<p>4. That as the Lord <i>required</i> the blood of Zachariah so fully that in a year all the princes of Judah and Jerusalem were destroyed by the Syrians, and Joash, who commanded the murder, slain by his own servants, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:23-25">2 Chronicles 24:23-25</span>, and their state grew worse and worse, till at last the temple was burned, and the people carried into captivity by Nebuzaradan: - so it should also be with the present race. The Lord would, after the crucifixion of Christ, visit upon them the murder of all those righteous men, that their state should grow worse and worse, till at last the temple should be destroyed, and they finally ruined by the Romans. See this prediction in the next chapter: and see Dr. Whitby concerning Zachariah, the son of Barachiah.</p>
<p>Some think that our Lord refers, in the spirit of prophecy, to the murder of Zacharias, son of Baruch, a rich Jew, who was judged, condemned, and massacred in the temple by Idumean zealots, because he was rich, a lover of liberty, and a hater of wickedness. They gave him a mock trial; and, when no evidence could be brought against him of his being guilty of the crime they laid to his charge, viz. a design to betray the city to the Romans, and his judges had pronounced him <i>innocent</i>, two of the stoutest of the zealots fell upon him and slew him in the <i>middle</i> <i>of the temple</i>. See Josephus, WAR, b. iv. chap. 5. s. 5. See Crevier, vol. vi. p. 172, History of the Roman Emperors. Others imagine that Zachariah, one of the minor prophets, is meant, who might have been massacred by the Jews; for, though the account is not come down to us, our Lord might have it from a well known tradition in those times. But the former opinion is every way the most probable.</p>
<p><i><b>Between the temple and the altar.</b></i> — That is, between the sanctuary and the altar of burnt-offerings.</p>
