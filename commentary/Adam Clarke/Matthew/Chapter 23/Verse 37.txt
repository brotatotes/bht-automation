<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span>. <i><b>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem</b></i> —</p>
<p>1. It is evident that our blessed Lord seriously and earnestly wished the salvation of the Jews.</p>
<p>2. That he did every thing that could be done, consistently with his own perfections, and the liberty of his creatures, to effect this.</p>
<p>3. That his tears over the city, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span>, sufficiently evince his sincerity.</p>
<p>4. That these persons nevertheless perished. And</p>
<p>5. That the reason was, they <i>would not</i> <i>be gathered</i> together under his <i>protection</i>: therefore <i>wrath</i>, i.e. punishment, <i>came upon them to the uttermost</i>.</p>
<p>From this it is evident that there have been persons whom Christ wished to save, and bled to save, who notwithstanding perished, because <i>they would</i> <i>not come unto him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span>. The metaphor which our Lord uses here is a very beautiful one. When the hen sees a beast of prey coming, she makes a noise to assemble her chickens, that she may cover them with her wings from the danger. The Roman <i>eagle</i> is about to fall upon the Jewish state - nothing can prevent this but their conversion to God through Christ-Jesus cries throughout the land, publishing the Gospel of <i>reconciliation </i>- they would not <i>assemble</i>, and the <i>Roman eagle</i> came and destroyed them. The hen's affection to her brood is so very strong as to become proverbial. The following beautiful Greek epigram, taken from the Anthologia, affords a very fine illustration of this text. </p>

<p>This epigram contains a happy illustration, not only of our Lord's simile, but also of his own conduct. How long had these thankless and unholy people been the <i>objects</i> of his <i>tenderest</i> cares! For more than 2000 years, they engrossed the most peculiar regards of the most beneficent Providence; and during the <i>three</i> years of our Lord's public ministry, his preaching and miracles had but one object and aim, the instruction and salvation of this thoughtless and disobedient people. For <i>their</i> sakes, he who was <i>rich</i> became <i>poor</i>, that they through <i>his poverty</i> might be <i>rich: - </i> for their sakes, he made himself of <i>no reputation</i>, and took upon him the form of a servant, and became obedient unto <i>death</i>, even the death of the cross! HE <i>died</i>, that THEY might not <i>perish</i>, but have everlasting life. Thus, to save their life, he freely abandoned his own.</p>
