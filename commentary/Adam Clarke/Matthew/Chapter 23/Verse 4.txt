<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>. <i><b>They bind heavy burdens</b></i> â€” They are <i>now</i> so corrupt that they have added to the ceremonies of the law others of their own invention, which are not only burdensome and oppressive, but have neither <i>reason, expediency</i>, nor <i>revelation</i>, to countenance them. In a word, like all their successors in <i>spirit</i> to the present day, they were <i>severe to others</i>, but very <i>indulgent to themselves</i>.</p>
