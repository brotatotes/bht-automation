<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:5">Matthew 23:5</span>. <i><b>All their works they do for to be seen of men</b></i> — In pointing out the corruptions of these men, our Lord gives us the distinguishing characteristics of all false teachers, whether Jewish or Christian.</p>
<p>1. They live not according to the truths they preach. <i>They say,</i> <i>and do not</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:3">Matthew 23:3</span>.</p>
<p>2. They are severe to others, point out the narrowest road to heaven, and walk in the broad road themselves. <i>They bind on</i> <i>burdens</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>.</p>
<p>3. They affect to appear righteous, and are strict observers of certain rites, c., while destitute of the power of godliness. <i>They make broad their phylacteries</i>, &amp;c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:5">Matthew 23:5</span>.</p>
<p>4. They love worldly entertainments, go to feast wherever they are asked, and seek Church preferments. <i>They love the chief</i> <i>places at feasts, and chief seats in the synagogues</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span>.</p>
<p>5. They love and seek public respect and high titles, salutations in the <i>market-place</i>, (for they are seldom in their <i>studies</i>,) and to be called of men rabbi-<i>eminent teacher</i>, though they have no title to it, either from the <i>excellence</i> or <i>fruit</i> of their teaching. When these marks are found in a man who professes to be a minister of Christ, charity itself will assert <i>he is a thief and</i> <i>a robber-he has climbed over the wall of the sheepfold</i>, or <i>broken</i> it down in order to get in.</p>
<p><i><b>Phylacteries</b></i> — φυλακτηρια, from φυλασσω, to <i>keep</i> or <i>preserve</i>. These were small slips of parchment or vellum, on which certain portions of the law were written. The Jews tied these about their foreheads and arms, for three different purposes.</p>
<p>1. To put them in <i>mind</i> of those precepts which they should constantly observe.</p>
<p>2. To procure them <i>reverence</i> and <i>respect</i> in the sight of the <i>heathen</i>. And</p>
<p>3. To act as <i>amulets</i> or <i>charms</i> to drive away evil spirits.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> use of these phylacteries is evident from their <i>name</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> use appears from what is said on the subject from the Gemara, <i>Beracoth</i>, chap. 1., quoted by Kypke. "Whence is it proved that phylacteries, (תפילין, <i>tephilin</i>,) are the strength of Israel? - Ans. From what is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+28:10">Deuteronomy 28:10</span>. <i>All the, people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the</i> <i>name</i> [of יהוה <i>Jehovah</i>] - <i>and they shall be afraid of thee</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> use of them appears from the Targum, on Cant. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:3">Matthew 8:3</span>. <i>His left hand is under my head</i>, &amp;c. "The congregation of Israel hath said, I am elect above all people, because I bind my phylacteries on my left hand, and on my head, and the scroll is fixed to the right side of my gate, the third part of which looks to my bed-chamber, that DAEMONS <i>may not be permitted to</i> INJURE <i>me</i>."</p>
<p>An original phylactery lies now before me. It is a piece of fine vellum, about eighteen inches long, and an inch and quarter broad. It is divided into four unequal compartments: in the first is written, in a very fair character, with many <i>apices</i>, after the mode of the German Jews, the first ten verses of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:0">Exodus 10:0</span>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:1-10">Exodus 13:1-10</span>) in the second compartment is written, from the eleventh to the sixteenth verse of the same chapter (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:11-16">Exodus 13:11-16</span>), inclusive in the third, from the fourth to the ninth verse (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</span>), inclusive, of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+6:0">Deuteronomy 6:0</span>., beginning with, <i>Hear, O Israel</i>, c. in the fourth, from the thirteenth to the twenty-first verse, inclusive, of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+11:0">Deuteronomy 11:0</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+11:13-21">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</span>).</p>
<p>These passages seem to be chosen in vindication of the <i>use</i> of the phylactery itself, as the reader will see on consulting them: Bind them for a SIGN upon thy HAND - and for FRONTLETS between thy EYES-write them upon the POSTS of thy HOUSE, and upon thy GATES all which commands the Jews took in the most literal sense.</p>
<p>Even the <i>phylactery</i> became an important appendage to a Pharisee's character, insomuch that some of them wore them very broad, either that they might have the more written on them, or that, the characters being <i>larger</i>, they might be the more <i>visible</i>, and that they might hereby acquire greater esteem among the common people, as being more than ordinarily religious. For the same reason, they wore the <i>fringes</i> of their garments of an unusual length. Moses had commanded (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:38-39">Numbers 15:38-39</span>) the children of Israel to put <i>fringes</i> to the borders of their garments, that, when they <i>looked</i> upon even these <i>distinct threads</i>, they might remember, not only the <i>law</i> in <i>general</i>, but also the very <i>minutiae</i>, or smaller parts of all the <i>precepts, rites</i>, and <i>ceremonies</i>, belonging to it. As these hypocrites were destitute of all the life and power of religion <i>within</i>, they endeavoured to supply its place by <i>phylacteries</i> and <i>fringes without</i>. <i>See Clark's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:9">Exodus 13:9</span><i>"</i>.</p>
