<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:7">Matthew 23:7</span>. <i><b>To be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</b></i> — רבי רבי, i.e. <i>My teacher! my teacher!</i> The second <i>rabbi</i> is omitted by several excellent MSS., by most of the ancient versions, and by some of the fathers. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it in the text, with the note of doubtfulness.</p>
<p>There are three words used among the Jews as titles of dignity, which they apply to their doctors - Rabh, Rabbi, and Rabban; each of these terms has its particular meaning: rabban implies much more than rabbi, and rabbi much more than <i>rabh</i>.</p>
<p>They may be considered as three degrees of comparison: <i>rabh</i> great, <i>rabbi</i> greater, and <i>rabban</i> greatest. These rabbins were looked up to as infallible oracles in religious matters, and usurped not only the place of the law, but of God himself.</p>
