<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:8">Matthew 23:8</span>. <i><b>But be not ye called Rabbi</b></i> — As our Lord probably spoke in Hebrew, the latter word rabbi, in this verse, must have been in the plural; but as the contracted form of the plural sounds almost exactly like the singular, the Greek writer would naturally express them both in the same letters.</p>
<p>None of the prophets had ever received this title, nor any of the Jewish doctors before the time of <i>Hillel</i> and <i>Shammai</i>, which was about the time of our Lord; and, as disputes on several subjects had run high between these two schools, the people were of course divided; some acknowledging <i>Hillel</i> as rabbi, - infallible teacher, and others giving this title to <i>Shammai</i>. The Pharisees, who always sought the honour that comes from men, assumed the title, and got their followers to address them by it. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:3">Matthew 19:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>One is your Master</b></i> — Instead of καθηγητης, <i>guide</i> or <i>leader</i>, (the common reading here, and which occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:10">Matthew 23:10</span>,) the famous Vatican MS., upwards of fifty others, and most of the ancient versions, read διδασκαλος, <i>master</i>. The most eminent critics approve of this reading and, independently of the very respectable authority by which it is supported, it is evident that this reading is more consistent with the context than the other,- <i>Be not ye called</i> MASTERS, <i>for one is your</i> MASTER.</p>
<p><i><b>Even Christ</b></i> — <i>Griesbach</i> has left this out of the text, because it is wanting in many of the most excellent MSS., versions, and fathers. <i>Mill</i> and <i>Bengel</i> approve of the omission. It might have been brought into this verse from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:10">Matthew 23:10</span>. Our Lord probably alludes to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:13">Isaiah 54:13</span>, <i>All thy children shall be taught of the Lord.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Ye are brethren.</b></i> — No one among you is <i>higher</i> than another, or can possibly have from me any <i>jurisdiction</i> over the rest. Ye are, in this respect, perfectly <i>equal</i>.</p>
