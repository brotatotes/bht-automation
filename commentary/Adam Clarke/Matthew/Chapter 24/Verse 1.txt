<p>This chapter contains a prediction of the utter destruction of the city and temple of Jerusalem, and the subversion of the whole political constitution of the Jews; and is one of the most valuable portions of the new covenant Scriptures, with respect to the <i>evidence</i> which it furnishes of the <i>truth</i> of Christianity. Every thing which our Lord foretold should come on the temple, city, and people of the Jews, has been fulfilled in the most correct and astonishing manner; and witnessed by a writer who was present during the whole, who was himself a Jew, and is acknowledged to be an historian of indisputable veracity in all those transactions which concern the destruction of Jerusalem. Without having designed it, he has written a commentary on our Lord's words, and shown how every tittle was punctually fulfilled, though he knew <i>nothing</i> of the Scripture which contained this remarkable prophecy. His account will be frequently referred to in the course of these notes; as also the admirable work of <i>Bishop</i> <i>Newton</i> on the prophecies.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:1">Matthew 24:1</span>. <i><b>And Jesus went out, and departed from, the temple</b></i> â€” Or, <i>And Jesus, going out of the temple, was going away</i>. This is the arrangement of the words in several eminent manuscripts, versions, and fathers; and is much clearer than that in the common translation. The Jews say the temple was built of white and green-spotted marble. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. Josephus says the stones were white and strong; fifty feet long, twenty-four broad, and sixteen thick. Antiq. b. 15. c. xi. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1">Mark 13:1</span>.</p>
