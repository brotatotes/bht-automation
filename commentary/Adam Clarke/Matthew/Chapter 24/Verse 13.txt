<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:13">Matthew 24:13</span>. <i><b>But he that shall endure</b></i> â€” The persecutions that shall come - <i>unto the end</i>; to the destruction of the Jewish polity, without growing cold or apostatizing - <i>shall be saved</i>, shall be delivered in all imminent dangers, and have his soul at last brought to an eternal glory. It is very remarkable that not a single Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem, though there were many there when <i>Cestius Gallus</i> invested the city; and, had he persevered in the siege, he would soon have rendered himself master of it; but, when he unexpectedly and unaccountably raised the siege, the Christians took that opportunity to escape. See <i>Eusebius</i>, Hist. Eccles lib. iii. c. 5, and Mr. <i>Reading's</i> note there; and see the note here on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:20">Matthew 24:20</span>.</p>
