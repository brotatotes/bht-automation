<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:14">Matthew 24:14</span>. <i><b>And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in</b></i><b> </b><i><b>all the world</b></i> — But, notwithstanding these persecutions, there should be a universal publication of the <i>glad tidings of the</i> <i>kingdom, for a testimony to all nations</i>. God would have the iniquity of the Jews published every where, before the heavy stroke of his judgments should fall upon them; that all mankind, as it were, might be brought as <i>witnesses</i> against their cruelty and obstinacy in crucifying and rejecting the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><i>In all the world</i>, εν ολη τη οικουμενη. Perhaps no more is meant here than the <i>Roman empire</i>; for it is beyond controversy that πασαν την οικουμενην, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>, means no more than <i>the whole Roman empire</i>: as a decree for taxation or enrolment from Augustus Caesar could have no influence but in the Roman dominions; but see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>. <i>Tacitus</i> informs us, Annal. l. xv., that, as early as the reign of Nero, the Christians were grown so numerous at Rome as to excite the jealousy of the government; and in other parts they were in proportion. However, we are under no necessity to restrain the phrase to the Roman empire, as, previously to the destruction of Jerusalem, the Gospel was not only preached in the lesser Asia, and Greece, and Italy, the greatest theatres of action then in the world; but was likewise propagated as far <i>north</i> as SCYTHIA; as far <i>south</i> as ETHIOPIA; as far <i>east</i> as PARTHIA and INDIA; and as far <i>west</i> as SPAIN and BRITAIN. On this point, Bishop Newton goes on to say, That there is some probability that the Gospel was preached in the British nations by St. Simon the apostle; that there is much greater probability that it was preached here by St. Paul; and that there is an absolute certainty that it was planted here in the times of the apostles, before the destruction of Jerusalem. See his proofs. Dissert. vol. ii. p. 235, 236. edit. 1758. St. Paul himself speaks, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>, of the Gospel's being come into ALL THE WORLD, <i>and preached</i> TO EVERY CREATURE <i>under heaven</i>. And in his Epistle to the Romans, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:18">Romans 10:18</span>, he very elegantly applies to the lights of the Church, what the psalmist said of the lights of heaven. <i>Their sound went into</i> ALL THE EARTH, <i>and their words unto the</i> END <i>of the</i> WORLD. What but the wisdom of God could foretell this? and what but the power of God could accomplish it?</p>
<p><i><b>Then shall the end come.</b></i> — When this general publication of the Gospel shall have taken place, then a <i>period</i> shall be put to the whole Jewish economy, by the utter destruction of their city and temple.</p>
