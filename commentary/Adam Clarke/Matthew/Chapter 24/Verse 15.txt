<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span>. <i><b>The abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel</b></i> â€” This <i>abomination of desolation</i>, St. Luke, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:20-21">Luke 21:20-21</span>), refers to the <i>Roman army</i>; and this abomination <i>standing in the holy place</i> is the <i>Roman army</i> besieging Jerusalem; this, our Lord says, is what was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, in the <i>ninth</i> and <i>eleventh</i> chapters of his prophecy; and <i>so</i> let every one who reads these prophecies understand them; and in reference to this very event they are understood by the rabbins. The Roman army is called an abomination, for its ensigns and images, which were so to the Jews. Josephus says, (War, b. vi. chap. 6,) the Romans brought their ensigns into the temple, and placed them over against the eastern gate, and sacrificed to them there. The Roman army is therefore fitly called the <i>abomination</i>, and the <i>abomination</i> which <i>maketh desolate</i>, as it was to desolate and lay waste Jerusalem; and this army besieging Jerusalem is called by St. Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:14">Mark 13:14</span>, <i>standing where it ought not</i>, that is, as in the text here, <i>the</i> <i>holy place</i>; as not only the city, but a considerable compass of ground about it, was deemed <i>holy</i>, and consequently no <i>profane</i> persons should stand on it.</p>
