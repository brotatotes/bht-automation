<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:17">Matthew 24:17</span>. <i><b>Let him which is on the house top</b></i> — The houses of the Jews, as well as those of the ancient Greeks and Romans, were <i>flat-roofed</i>, and had stairs on the outside, by which persons might ascend and descend without coming into the house. In the eastern walled cities, these flat-roofed houses usually formed continued terraces from one end of the city to the other; which <i>terraces</i> terminated at the <i>gates</i>. He, therefore, who is walking on the house top, let him <i>not come down to take any thing out of his</i> <i>house</i>; but let him instantly pursue his course along the tops of the houses, and escape out at the city gate as fast as he can.</p>
<p><i><b>Any thing</b></i> — Instead of τι, <i>any thing</i>, we should read τα, <i>the things</i>; which reading is supported by all the best MSS., versions, and fathers.</p>
