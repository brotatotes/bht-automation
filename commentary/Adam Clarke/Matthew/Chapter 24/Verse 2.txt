<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>. <i><b>See ye not all these things?</b></i> — The common text, and many manuscripts, have ουβλεπετε, <i>Do ye not see</i>, or <i>consider</i>? But the <i>negative</i> particle is omitted by several excellent manuscripts, by the Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, Ethiopic, Slavonic, Vulgate, and Itala versions, and by some of the primitive fathers, who all read it thus, <i>see</i>, or <i>consider all these things</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>There shall not be left here one stone</b></i> — These seem to have been the last words he spoke as he left the temple, into which he never afterwards entered; and, when he got to the mount of Olives, he renewed the discourse. From this mount, on which our Lord and his disciples now sat, the whole of the city, and particularly the temple, were clearly seen. This part of our Lord's prediction was fulfilled in the most literal manner. Josephus says, War, book vii. c. 1: "Caesar gave orders that they should now <i>demolish the</i> <i>whole city and temple</i>, τε πολιν απασαν και τον νεων κατασκεπτειν, except the three towers, <i>Phaselus, Hippicus</i>, and <i>Mariamne</i>, and a part of the western wall, and these were spared; but, for all the rest of the wall, it was laid so completely even with the ground, by those who <i>dug it up to the foundation</i>, that there was left nothing to make those that came thither believe it had ever been inhabited." Maimonides, a Jewish rabbin, in Tract. <i>Taanith</i>, c. 4, says, "That the very foundations of the temple were digged up, according to the Roman custom." His words are these: "On that ninth day of the month Ab, fatal for vengeance, the wicked Turnus Rufus, of the children of Edom, ploughed up the temple, and the places round about it, that the saying might be fulfilled, <i>Zion</i> <i>shall be ploughed as a field</i>." This Turnus, or rather Terentius Rufus, was left general of the army by Titus, with commission, as the Jews suppose, to destroy the city and the temple, as Josephus observes.</p>
<p>The temple was destroyed</p>
<p>1st. <i>Justly</i>; because of the sins of the Jews.</p>
<p>2dly. <i>Mercifully</i>; to take away from them the occasion of continuing in Judaism: and</p>
<p>3dly. <i>Mysteriously</i>; to show that the ancient sacrifices were abolished, and that the whole Jewish economy was brought to an end, and the Christian dispensation introduced.</p>
