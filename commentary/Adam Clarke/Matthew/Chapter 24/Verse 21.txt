<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:21">Matthew 24:21</span>. <i><b>For then shall be great tribulation</b></i> â€” No history can furnish us with a parallel to the calamities and miseries of the Jews:-rapine, murder, famine, and pestilence <i>within</i>: fire and sword, and all the horrors of war, <i>without</i>. Our Lord wept at the foresight of these calamities; and it is almost impossible for any humane person to read the relation of them in Josephus without weeping also. St. Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:22">Luke 21:22</span>, calls these the <i>days of vengeance, that all things which were</i> <i>written might be fulfilled</i>. 1. These were the days in which all the calamities predicted by <i>Moses, Joel, Daniel</i>, and other <i>prophets</i>, as well as those predicted by our <i>Saviour</i>, met in one common centre, and were fulfilled in the most terrible manner on that generation. 2. These were the days of vengeance in another sense, as if God's judgments had certain periods and revolutions; for it is remarkable that the temple was burned by the Romans in the same month, and on the same day of the month, on which it had been burned by the Babylonians. See Josephus, WAR, b. vi. c. 4.</p>
