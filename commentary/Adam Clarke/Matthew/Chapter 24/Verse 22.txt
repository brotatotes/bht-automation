<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:22">Matthew 24:22</span>. <i><b>Except those days should be shortened</b></i> â€” Josephus computes the number of those who perished in the siege at <i>eleven</i> <i>hundred thousand</i>, besides those who were slain in other places, WAR, b. vi. c. 9; and if the Romans had gone on destroying in this manner, the whole nation of the Jews would, in a short time, have been entirely extirpated; but, <i>for the sake of the elect</i>, the <i>Jews</i>, that <i>they</i> might not be <i>utterly destroyed</i>, and for the <i>Christians</i> particularly, the days were shortened. These, partly through the fury of the zealots on one hand, and the hatred of the Romans on the other; and partly through the difficulty of subsisting in the mountains without houses or provisions, would in all probability have been all destroyed, either by the sword or famine, if the days had not been shortened. The besieged themselves helped to shorten those days by their divisions and mutual slaughters; and by fatally deserting their strong holds, where they never could have been subdued, but by famine alone. So well fortified was Jerusalem, and so well provided to stand a siege, that the enemy <i>without</i> could not have prevailed, had it not been for the factions and seditions <i>within</i>. When <i>Titus</i> was viewing the fortifications after the taking of the city, he could not help ascribing his success to God. "We have fought," said he, "with God on our side; and it is God who pulled the Jews out of these strong holds: for what could <i>machines</i> or the <i>hands of men</i> avail against such towers as these?" WAR, b. vi. c. 9.</p>
