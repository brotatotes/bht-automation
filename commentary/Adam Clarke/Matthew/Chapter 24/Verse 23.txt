<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:23">Matthew 24:23</span>. <i><b>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo here</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>Christ</b></i> — Our Lord had cautioned his disciples against false Christs and prophets before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:11">Matthew 24:11</span>; but he seems here to intimate that there would be <i>especial</i> need to attend to this caution about the time of the siege. And in fact many such impostors did arise about that time, promising deliverance from God; and the lower the Jews were reduced, the more disposed they were to listen to such deceivers. Like a man drowning, they were willing to catch even at a straw, while there was any prospect of being saved. But as it was to little purpose for a man to take upon him the character of <i>the Christ</i>, without miracles to avouch his Divine mission, so it was the common artifice of these impostors to show <i>signs</i> and <i>wonders</i>, σημεια και τερατα; the very words used by Christ in this prophecy, and by Josephus in his history: ANT. b. xx. c. 7. Among these <i>Simon Magus</i>, and <i>Dositheus</i>, mentioned before; and <i>Barcocab</i>, who, St. Jerome says, pretended to vomit flames. And it is certain these and some others were so dexterous in imitating miraculous works that they deceived many; and such were their works, that if the <i>elect</i>, the <i>chosen persons</i>, the <i>Christians</i>, had not had the fullest evidence of the truth of Christ's mission and miracles, they must have been <i>deceived</i> too: but, having had these proofs, they could not possibly be deceived by these impostors. This is simply the meaning of this place; and it is truly astonishing that it should be brought as a proof for the doctrine (whether <i>true</i> or <i>false</i> is at present out of the question) of the <i>necessary</i> and <i>eternal</i> <i>perseverance of the saints</i>! How abundant the Jews were in magic, divination, sorcery, incantation, &amp;c., see proved by Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i> on this place.</p>
