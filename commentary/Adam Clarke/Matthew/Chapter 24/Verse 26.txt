<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:26">Matthew 24:26</span>. <i><b>If they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>desert</b></i> â€” Is it not worthy of remark that our Lord not only foretold the appearance of these impostors, but also the <i>manner</i> and <i>circumstances</i> of their conduct? Some he mentions as appearing in the <i>desert</i>. Josephus says, ANT. b. xx. c. 7, and WAR, book ii. c. 13: That many impostors and cheats persuaded the people to follow them to the <i>desert</i>, promising to show them <i>signs</i> and <i>wonders</i> done by the providence of God, is well attested. An Egyptian false prophet, mentioned by Josephus, ANT. b. xx. c. 7, and in the Acts, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:38">Acts 21:38</span>, <i>led out into the</i> DESERT <i>four thousand men, who were murderers</i>, but these were all taken or destroyed by <i>Felix</i>. Another promised salvation to the people, if they would follow him to the DESERT, and he was destroyed by <i>Festus</i>, ANT. b. xx. c. 7. Also, one <i>Jonathan</i>, a weaver, persuaded a number to follow him to the DESERT, but he was taken and burnt alive by Vespasian. See WAR, b. vii. c. 11.</p>
<p>As some conducted their deluded followers to the DESERT, so did others to the <i>secret chambers</i>. Josephus mentions a false prophet, WAR, b. vi. c. 5, who declared to the people in the city, that God commanded them to go up <i>into the temple</i>, and there they should receive the signs of deliverance. A multitude of men, women, and children, went up accordingly; but, instead of deliverance, the place was set on fire by the Romans, and 6,000 perished miserably in the flames, or in attempting to escape them.</p>
