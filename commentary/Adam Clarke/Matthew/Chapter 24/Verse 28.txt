<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:28">Matthew 24:28</span>. <i><b>For wheresoever the carcass is</b></i> — πτωμα, <i>the dead</i> <i>carcass</i>. The Jewish nation, which was morally and judicially dead.</p>
<p><i><b>There will the eagles</b></i> — The Roman armies, called so partly from their strength and fierceness, and partly from the <i>figure</i> of these animals which was always wrought on their <i>ensigns</i>, or even in brass, placed on the tops of their ensign-staves. It is remarkable that the Roman fury pursued these wretched men <i>wheresoever</i> they were found. They were a <i>dead carcass</i> doomed to be <i>devoured</i>; and the Roman eagles were the commissioned devourers. See the pitiful account in Josephus, WAR, b. vii. c. 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, and 11.</p>
