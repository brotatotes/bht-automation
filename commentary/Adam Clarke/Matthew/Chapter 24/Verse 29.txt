<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Immediately after the tribulation</b></i>, c.] Commentators generally understand this, and what follows, of the end of the world and Christ's coming to judgment: but the word <i>immediately</i> shows that our Lord is not speaking of any <i>distant</i> event, but of something immediately consequent on calamities already predicted: and that must be the destruction of Jerusalem. "The Jewish heaven shall perish, and the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i> of its glory and happiness shall be darkened-brought to nothing. The <i>sun</i> is the religion of the <i>Church</i> the <i>moon</i> is the government of the <i>state</i>; and the <i>stars</i> are the judges and doctors of both. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:10">Isaiah 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:7-8">Ezekiel 32:7-8</span>, c." <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>In the prophetic language, great commotions upon earth are often represented under the notion of commotions and changes in the heavens:-</p>
<p>The fall of <i>Babylon</i> is represented by the stars and constellations of heaven withdrawing their light, and the sun and moon being darkened. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:9-10">Isaiah 13:9-10</span>.</p>
<p>The destruction of <i>Egypt</i>, by the heaven being covered, the sun enveloped with a cloud, and the moon withholding her light. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:7-8">Ezekiel 32:7-8</span>.</p>
<p>The destruction of the <i>Jews</i> by <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i> is represented by <i>casting down some of the host of heaven</i>, and the <i>stars</i> to the ground. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+8:10">Daniel 8:10</span>.</p>
<p>And this very destruction of <i>Jerusalem</i> is represented by the Prophet Joel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:30-31">Joel 2:30-31</span>, by showing wonders in heaven and in earth - <i>darkening the sun, and turning the moon into blood</i>. This general mode of describing these judgments leaves no room to doubt the propriety of its application in the present case.</p>
<p>The falling of stars, i.e. those meteors which are called <i>falling stars</i> by the common people, was deemed an omen of evil times. The heathens have marked this: - </p>
