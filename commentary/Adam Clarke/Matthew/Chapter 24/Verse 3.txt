<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:3">Matthew 24:3</span>. <i><b>Tell us, when shall these things be?</b></i> — There appear to be <i>three</i> questions asked here by the disciples.</p>
<p>1st. <i>When shall</i> <i>these things be</i>? viz. the <i>destruction</i> of the <i>city, temple</i>, and <i>Jewish state</i>.</p>
<p>2dly. <i>What shall be the sign of thy coming</i>? viz. to <i>execute</i> these judgments upon them, and to <i>establish</i> thy own Church: and</p>
<p>3dly. <i>When shall this world end</i>? When wilt thou come to <i>judge</i> the <i>quick</i> and the <i>dead</i>?</p>
<p>But there are some who maintain that these are but three parts of the <i>same</i> question, and that our Lord's answers only refer to the destruction of the Jewish state, and that nothing is spoken here concerning the LAST or <i>judgment</i> <i>day</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>End of the world</b></i> — του αιωνος; or, <i>of the age</i>, viz. the Jewish economy, which is a frequent <i>accommodated</i> meaning of the word αιων, the <i>proper</i> meaning of which is, as <i>Aristotle</i> (De Caelo) observes, ETERNAL. αιων, <i>quasi</i> αει ων <i>continual being</i>: and no words can more forcibly point out <i>eternity</i> than these. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:33">Genesis 21:33</span>.</p>
