<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man</b></i> — The plain meaning of this is, that the destruction of Jerusalem will be such a remarkable instance of Divine vengeance, such a signal manifestation of Christ's power and glory, that all the <i>Jewish</i> <i>tribes</i> shall mourn, and many will, in consequence of this manifestation of God, be led to acknowledge Christ and his religion. By της γης, <i>of the land</i>, in the text, is evidently meant here, as in several other places, the <i>land of Judea</i> and its <i>tribes</i>, either its then <i>inhabitants</i>, or the Jewish people wherever found.</p>
