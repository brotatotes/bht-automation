<p>Verse 31. <i><b>He shall send his angels</b></i> — τους αγγελους, <i>his</i> <i>messengers</i>, the <i>apostles</i>, and their successors in the Christian ministry.</p>
<p><i><b>With a great sound of a trumpet</b></i> — Or, <i>a loud-sounding</i> <i>trumpet </i>- the earnest affectionate call of the Gospel of peace, life, and salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall gather together his elect</b></i> — The <i>Gentiles</i>, who were now <i>chosen</i> or <i>elected</i>, in place of the rebellious, obstinate <i>Jews</i>, according to Our Lord's prediction, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:11-12">Matthew 8:11-12</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:28-29">Luke 13:28-29</span>. <i>For the children of the kingdom</i>, (the <i>Jews</i> who were <i>born</i> with a <i>legal right</i> to it, but had now finally <i>forfeited</i> that right by their iniquities) <i>should be thrust out</i>. It is worth serious observation, that the Christian religion spread and prevailed mightily <i>after</i> this period: and nothing contributed more to the success of the Gospel than the <i>destruction of Jerusalem</i> happening in the very <i>time</i> and <i>manner</i>, and with the very <i>circumstances</i>, so particularly foretold by our Lord. It was <i>after this period</i> that the kingdom of Christ began, and his reign was established in almost every part of the world.</p>
<p>To St. Matthew's account, St. Luke adds, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:24">Luke 21:24</span>, <i>They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shalt be led away</i> <i>captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by</i> <i>the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled</i>. The number of those who fell by the sword was very great. ELEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND perished during the siege. Many were slain at other places, and at other times. By the commandment of <i>Florus</i>, the first author of the war, there were slain at Jerusalem 3,600, Jos. WAR, b. ii. c. 14. By the inhabitants of <i>Caesarea</i>, above 20,000. At <i>Scythopolis</i>, above 13,000. At <i>Ascalon</i>, 2,500. At <i>Ptolemais</i>, 2,000. At <i>Alexandria</i>, 50,000. At <i>Joppa</i>, when taken by <i>Cestius Gallus</i>, 8,400. In a <i>mountain</i> called <i>Asamon</i>, near <i>Sepporis</i>, above 2,000. At <i>Damascus</i>, 10,000. In a <i>battle</i> with the <i>Romans</i> at <i>Ascalon</i>, 10,000. In an <i>ambuscade</i> near the <i>same</i> <i>place</i>, 8,000. At <i>Japha</i>, 15,000. Of the <i>Samaritans</i>, on Mount <i>Gerizim</i>, 11,600. At <i>Jotapa</i>, 40,000. At <i>Joppa</i>, when taken by <i>Vespasian</i>, 4,200. At <i>Tarichea</i>, 6,500. And <i>after</i> the <i>city</i> was <i>taken</i>, 1,200. At <i>Gamala</i>, 4,000, besides 5,000 who threw themselves down a <i>precipice</i>. Of those who fled with <i>John</i>, of <i>Gischala</i>, 6,000. Of the <i>Gadarenes</i>, 15,000 slain, besides <i>countless</i> multitudes <i>drowned</i>. In the village of <i>Idumea</i>, above 10,000 slain. At <i>Gerasa</i>, 1,000. At <i>Machaerus</i>, 1,700. In the <i>wood</i> of <i>Jardes,</i> 3,000. In the <i>castle</i> of <i>Masada</i>, 960. In <i>Cyrene</i>, by <i>Catullus</i> the governor, 3,000. Besides these, many of every <i>age, sex</i>, and <i>condition</i>, were slain in the war, who are not reckoned; but, of those who are reckoned, the number amounts to upwards of 1,357,660, which would have appeared incredible, if their own historian had not so particularly enumerated them. See Josephus, WAR, book ii. c. 18, 20; book iii. c. 2, 7, 8, 9; book iv. c. 1, 2, 7, 8, 9; book vii. c. 6, 9, 11; and Bp. Newton, vol. ii. p. 288-290.</p>
<p>Many also were <i>led away captives into all nations</i>. There were <i>taken</i> at <i>Japha</i>, 2,130. At <i>Jotapa</i>, 1,200. At <i>Tarichea</i>, 6,000 chosen young men, who were sent to Nero; others sold to the number of 30,400, besides those who were given to Agrippa. Of the <i>Gadarenes</i> were <i>taken</i> 2,200. In <i>Idumea</i> above 1,000. Many besides these were <i>taken</i> in <i>Jerusalem</i>; so that, as Josephus says, the number of the <i>captives</i> taken in the whole war amounted to 97,000. Those above <i>seventeen</i> years of age were sent to the <i>works in</i> <i>Egypt</i>; but most were distributed through the Roman provinces, to be destroyed in their <i>theatres</i> by the <i>sword</i>, and by the <i>wild</i> <i>beasts</i>; and those under <i>seventeen</i> years of age were sold for <i>slaves</i>. Eleven thousand in one place perished for <i>want</i>. At <i>Caesarea, Titus</i>, like a thorough-paced infernal savage, murdered 2,500 Jews, in honour of his brother's birthday; and a greater number at <i>Berytus</i> in honour of his father's. See Josephus, WAR, b. vii. c. 3. s. 1. Some he caused to kill each other; some were thrown to the wild beasts; and others burnt alive. And all this was done by a man who was styled, <i>The darling of mankind</i>! Thus were the Jews miserably tormented, and distributed over the Roman provinces; and continue to be distressed and dispersed over all the nations of the world to the present day. Jerusalem also was, according to the prediction of our Lord, to be <i>trodden down by the</i> <i>Gentiles</i>. Accordingly it has never since been in the possession of the <i>Jews</i>. It was first in subjection to the <i>Romans</i>, afterwards to the <i>Saracens</i>, then to the <i>Franks</i>, after to the <i>Mamalukes</i>, and now to the <i>Turks</i>. Thus has the prophecy of Christ been most literally and terribly fulfilled, on a people who are still preserved as continued monuments of the truth of our Lord's prediction, and of the truth of the Christian religion.
