<p>Verse 34. <i><b>This generation shall not pass</b></i> — Η γενεα αυτη, <i>this</i> <i>race</i>; i.e. the Jews shall not cease from being a <i>distinct people</i>, till all the counsels of God relative to <i>them</i> and the <i>Gentiles</i> be fulfilled. Some translate η γενεα αυτη, <i>this generation</i>, meaning the persons who were then living, that they should not die before these signs, c., took place: but though this was true, as to the calamities that fell upon the Jews, and the destruction of their government, temple, c., yet as our Lord mentions Jerusalem's continuing to be under the power of the Gentiles till the fulness of the Gentiles should come in, i.e. till all the nations of the world should receive the Gospel of Christ, after which the Jews themselves should be converted unto God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>, &amp;c., I think it more proper not to restrain its meaning to the few years which preceded the destruction of Jerusalem but to understand it of the care taken by Divine providence to preserve them as a <i>distinct</i> <i>people</i>, and yet to keep them out of their own land, and from their temple service. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:30">Mark 13:30</span>. But still it is literally true in reference to the destruction of Jerusalem. John probably lived to see these things come to pass compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:22">John 21:22</span>; and there were some rabbins alive at the time when Christ spoke these words who lived till the city was destroyed, viz. <i>Rabban Simeon</i>, who perished with the city; <i>R. Jochanan ben</i> <i>Zaccai</i>, who outlived it; <i>R. Zadoch, R. Ismael</i>, and others. See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>The war began, as Josephus says, Ant. b. xx. c. 11. s. 1, in the second year of the government of <i>Gessius Florus</i>, who succeeded <i>Albinus</i>, successor of <i>Porcius Festus</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:27">Acts 24:27</span>, in the month of <i>May</i>, in the <i>twelfth</i> year of <i>Nero</i>, and the <i>seventeenth</i> of <i>Agrippa</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:0">Acts 25:0</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:0">Acts 26:0</span>, that is, in <i>May</i>, A. D. 66.</p>
<p>The temple was burnt August 10, A. D. 70, the same day and month on which it had been burnt by the king of Babylon: Josephus, Ant. b. xx. c. 11. s. 8.</p>
<p>The city was taken September 8, in the second year of the reign of Vespasian, or the year of Christ 70. Ant. b. vi. c. 10.</p>
<p>That was the end of the siege of Jerusalem, which began, as Josephus several times observes, about the fourteenth day of the month <i>Nisan</i>, or our <i>April</i>. See War, b. v. c. 3. s. 1, c. 13. s. 7; b. vi. c. 9. s. 3.</p>
<p>On this occasion, a medal was struck with the following inscription round a laureated head of the emperor: - <i>IMP.erator</i> <i>J.ulius CAES.ar VESP.asianus AUG.ustus. P.ontifex M.aximus,</i> <i>TR.ibunitia, P.otestate P.ater P.atrice CO.nS.ul VIII. </i>- On the obverse are represented a <i>palm</i> tree, the emblem of the land of Judaea; the emperor with a <i>trophy</i> standing on the left; <i>Judea</i>, under the figure of a distressed woman, sitting at the foot of the tree weeping, with her head bowed down, supported by her left hand, with the legend JUDAEA CAPTA. S.<i>enatus</i> C.<i>onsultus.</i> at the bottom. This is not only an extraordinary fulfilment of our Lord's prediction, but a literal accomplishment of a prophecy delivered about 800 years before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+3:26">Isaiah 3:26</span>, <i>And she, desolate, shall sit upon the ground</i>.</p>
