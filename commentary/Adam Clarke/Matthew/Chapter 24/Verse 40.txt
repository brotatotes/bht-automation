<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:40-41">Matthew 24:40-41</span>. <i><b>Then shall two</b></i><b> men - </b><i><b>two</b></i><b> women - </b><i><b>one shall be taken,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>and the other left.</b></i> — The meaning seems to be, that so general should these calamities be, that no <i>two persons</i>, wheresoever found, or about whatsoever employed, should be <i>both</i> able to effect their escape; and that <i>captivity</i> and the <i>sword</i> should have a complete triumph over this unhappy people.</p>
<p><i><b>Two</b></i><b> women shall be </b><i><b>grinding</b></i> — Women alone are still employed in grinding the corn in the east; and it is only when despatch is required, or the uppermost millstone is heavy, that a <i>second</i> woman is added. See Wakefield, and Harmer, Obs. vol. i. 253. That they were formerly thus employed, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+11:5">Exodus 11:5</span>, and the note there. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+47:2">Isaiah 47:2</span>.</p>
