<p>Verse 42. <i><b>Watch therefore</b></i> â€” Be always on your guard, that you may not be taken unawares, and that you may be properly prepared to meet God in the way either of <i>judgment</i> or <i>mercy</i>, whensoever he may come. This advice the followers of Christ took, and therefore they escaped; the miserable Jews rejected it, and were destroyed. Let us learn wisdom by the things which they suffered.</p>
