<p>Verse 43. <i><b>If the good man of the house had known</b></i> â€” "As a <i>master</i> of a <i>family</i> who expected a <i>thief</i> at <i>any time</i> of the <i>night</i>, would take care to be <i>awake</i>, and ready to protect his house; so do ye, who know that the Son of man <i>will</i> come. Though the <i>day</i> and <i>hour</i> be <i>uncertain</i>, continue <i>always</i> in a state of <i>watchfulness,</i> that he may not come upon you <i>unawares</i>." WAKEFIELD.</p>
