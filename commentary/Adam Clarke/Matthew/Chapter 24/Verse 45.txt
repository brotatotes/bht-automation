Verse 45. Who then is a faithful and wise servant â€” All should live in the same expectation of the coming of Christ, which a servant has with respect to the return of his master, who, in departing for a season, left the management of his affairs to him; and of which management he is to give an exact account on his master's return.Here is an abstract of the duties of a minister of Christ.1. He is appointed, not by himself, but by the vocation and mission of his Master.2. He must look on himself, not as the master of the family, but as the servant.3. He must be scrupulously faithful and exact in fulfilling the commands of his Master.4. His fidelity must be ever accompanied by wisdom and prudence.5. He must give the domestics - the sacred family, their food; and this food must be such as to afford them true nourishment. And6. This must be done in its season.
