<p>Verse 45. <i><b>Who then is a faithful and wise servant</b></i> â€” All should live in the same expectation of the coming of Christ, which a servant has with respect to the return of his master, who, in departing for a season, left the management of his affairs to him; and of which management he is to give an exact account on his master's return.</p>
<p>Here is an abstract of the duties of a minister of Christ.</p>
<p>1. He is appointed, not by himself, but by the vocation and mission of <i>his Master</i>.</p>
<p>2. He must look on himself, not as the <i>master</i> of the family, but as the <i>servant</i>.</p>
<p>3. He must be scrupulously <i>faithful</i> and exact in fulfilling the commands of his Master.</p>
<p>4. His <i>fidelity</i> must be ever accompanied by <i>wisdom</i> and <i>prudence</i>.</p>
<p>5. He must give the domestics - the sacred family, their food; and this food must be such as to afford them <i>true nourishment</i>. And</p>
<p>6. This must be done in <i>its season</i>. There are certain portions of the bread of life which lose their effect by being administered out of proper season, or to improper persons.</p>
