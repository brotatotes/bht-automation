<p>Verse 47. <i><b>He shall make him ruler over all his goods.</b></i> â€” O heavenly privilege of a faithful minister of Christ! He shall receive from God a power to dispense all the blessings of the new covenant; and his word shall ever be accompanied with the demonstration of the Holy Ghost to the hearts of all that hear it. Much of a preacher's <i>usefulness</i> may be lost by his <i>unfaithfulness</i>.</p>
