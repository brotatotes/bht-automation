<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:48">Matthew 24:48</span>. <i><b>But, and if that evil servant</b></i> â€” Here are three characters of a bad minister.</p>
<p>1. He has little or no faith in the <i>speedy coming</i> of Christ, either to <i>punish</i> for <i>wickedness</i>, or to <i>pardon</i> and <i>sanctify</i> those who believe. It may be, he does not outwardly profess this, but he says it in his <i>heart</i>, and God searches his heart, and knows that he professes to teach what he does not believe.</p>
<p>2. He governs with an absolute dominion, oppressing his colleagues and doing violence to the followers of Christ. <i>And shall begin to smite</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>3. He leads an irregular life does not love the company of the children of God, but <i>eats</i> and <i>drinks with the drunkards</i>, preferring the tables of the great and the rich, whose god is their belly, and thus <i>feeds himself</i> <i>without fear</i>. Great God! save thine inheritance from being ravaged by such wolves!</p>
