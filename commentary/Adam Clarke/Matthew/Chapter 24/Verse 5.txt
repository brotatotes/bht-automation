<p>1. Josephus says, (War, b. ii. c. 13,) that there were many who, pretending to Divine inspiration, deceived the people, leading out numbers of them to the <i>desert</i>, pretending that God would there show them the signs of liberty, meaning redemption from the Roman power: and that an Egyptian false prophet led 30,000 men into the desert, who were almost all cut off by <i>Felix</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:38">Acts 21:38</span>. It was a just judgment for God to deliver up that people into the hands of <i>false</i> <i>Christs</i> who had rejected the <i>true one</i>. Soon after our Lord's crucifixion, Simon Magus appeared, and persuaded the people of Samaria that he was <i>the great power of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9-10">Acts 8:9-10</span>; and boasted among the Jews that he was the <i>son of God</i>.</p>
<p>2. Of the same stamp and character was also <i>Dositheus</i>, the Samaritan, who pretended that he was <i>the Christ</i> foretold by Moses.</p>
<p>3. About twelve years after the death of our Lord, when <i>Cuspius</i> <i>Fadus</i> was procurator of Judea, arose an impostor of the name of <i>Theudas</i>, who said he was a <i>prophet</i>, and persuaded a great multitude to follow him with their best effects to the river Jordan, which he promised to divide for their passage; and saying these things, says Josephus, <i>he deceived many</i>: almost the very words of our Lord.</p>
<p>4. A few years afterwards, under the reign of Nero, while Felix was procurator of Judea, impostors of this stamp were so frequent that some were taken and killed almost every day. Jos. Ant. b. xx. c. 4. and 7.</p>
