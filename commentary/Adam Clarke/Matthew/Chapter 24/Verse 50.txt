<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:50">Matthew 24:50</span>. <i><b>The lord of that servant</b></i> â€” Here are <i>three</i> punishments which answer to the <i>three</i> characteristics of the <i>bad minister</i>.</p>
<p>1. A sudden death, and the weight of God's judgments falling upon him, without a moment to avert it: this answers to his <i>infidelity</i> and <i>forgetfulness. He shall come in a day in which he looked not</i> <i>for him</i>.</p>
<p>2. A <i>separation</i> from the communion of saints, and from all the gifts which he has abused: this answers to the abuse of his authority in the Church of Christ.</p>
<p>3. He shall have tears and eternal pains, in company with all such hypocrites as himself: and this answers to his voluptuous life, pampering the flesh at the expense of his soul.</p>
