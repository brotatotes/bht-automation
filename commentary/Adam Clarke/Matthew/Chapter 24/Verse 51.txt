<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:51">Matthew 24:51</span>. <i><b>Cut him asunder</b></i> — This refers to an ancient mode of punishment used in several countries. Isaiah is reported to have been <i>sawed</i> ASUNDER. That it was an ancient mode of punishment is evident from what Herodotus says: that <i>Sabacus</i>, king of Ethiopia, had a vision, in which he was commanded μεσους διαταμειν, <i>to cut</i> <i>in two</i>, all the Egyptian priests, lib. ii. And in lib. vii. where Xerxes ordered one of the sons of Pythius μεσον διαταμειν, <i>to be</i> <i>cut in two</i>, and one half placed on each side of the way, that his army might pass through between them. See Raphelius also, in his notes from Herodotus and Polybius. This kind of punishment was used among the Persians: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+2:5">Daniel 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+3:29">Daniel 3:29</span>. Story of Susannah, ver. 55, 59. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+12:31">2 Samuel 12:31</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+20:3">1 Chronicles 20:3</span>. It may also have reference to that mode of punishment in which the different members were chopped off seriatim, first the <i>feet</i>, then the <i>hands</i>, next the <i>legs</i>, then the <i>arms</i>, and lastly the <i>head</i>. This mode of punishment is still in use among the <i>Chinese</i>. But we find an exact parallel among the Turks, in the following passage from W. Lithgow's Travels, p. 153. London 4to. edit. "If a Turk should happen to kill another Turk, his punishment is thus: After he is adjudged to death, he is brought forth to the market place; and a blocke being brought hither of four foot high, the malifactor is stript naked, and then laid thereon with his belly downward; they draw in his middle together so small with running cords that they strike his body a - two with one blow: his hinder parts they cast to be eaten by hungry dogs kept for the same purpose; and the forequarters and head they throw into a grievous fire, made there for the same end. And this is the punishment for manslaughter."</p>
<p>This is the very same punishment, and for the same offence, as that mentioned by our Lord, the killing of a fellow servant-one of the same nation, and of the same religion.</p>
<p>THE reader has no doubt observed, in the preceding chapter, a series of the most striking and solemn predictions, fulfilled in the most literal, awful, and dreadful manner. Christ has foretold the ruin of the Jewish people, and the destruction of their polity; and in such a circumstantial manner as none else could do, but He, under whose eye are all events, and in whose hands are the government and direction of all things. Indeed he rather <i>declared</i> what <i>he would do</i>, than <i>predicted</i> what <i>should come to pass</i>. And the <i>fulfilment</i> has been as <i>circumstantial</i> as the <i>prediction</i>. Does it not appear that the <i>predicted point</i> was so literally referred to by the <i>occurring fact</i>, by which it was to have its accomplishment, as to leave no room to doubt the <i>truth</i> of the <i>prediction</i>, or the <i>certainty</i> of the event by which it was <i>fulfilled</i>? Thus the wisdom of God, as also his justice and providence, have had a plenary manifestation.</p>
<p>But this <i>wisdom</i> appears, farther, in preserving such a <i>record</i> of the <i>prediction</i>, and such <i>evidence</i> of its <i>accomplishment</i>, as cannot possibly be doubted. The <i>New Testament</i>, given by the inspiration of God, and handed down uncorrupted from father to son, by both friends and enemies, perfect in its credibility and truth, inexpungable in its evidences, and astonishingly circumstantial in details of future occurrences, which the wisdom of God alone could foreknow - that New Testament is the <i>record</i> of these predictions. The <i>history</i> of the <i>Romans</i>, written by so many hands; the <i>history</i> of the <i>Jews</i>, written by one of <i>themselves;</i> <i>triumphal arches, coins, medals</i>, and <i>public monuments</i> of different kinds, are the <i>evidence</i> by which the fulfilment of the <i>record</i> is demonstrated. Add to this the <i>preservation</i> of the Jewish people; a people scattered through all nations, yet subsisting as a <i>distinct body</i>, without <i>temple, sacrifices</i>, or <i>political</i> government; and who, while they attempt to suppress the truth, yet reluctantly stand forth as an unimpeachable <i>collateral</i> evidence, that the solemn record, already alluded to, is <i>strictly</i> and <i>literally</i> true! Who that has ever consulted the Roman historians of the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, the history of Josephus, and the 24th chapter of St. Matthew's Gospel, and who knows any thing of the <i>present state</i> of the Jews over the face of the earth, or even of those who sojourn in England, can doubt for a moment the truth of this Gospel, or the infinite and all - comprehensive knowledge of Him who is its author! Here then is one portion of Divine Revelation that is incontrovertibly and absolutely proved to be the <i>truth of God</i>. Reader! if he, who, while he predicted the ruin of this disobedient and refractory people, <i>wept</i> over their city and its inhabitants, has so, minutely fulfilled the <i>threatenings</i> of his <i>justice</i> on the unbelieving and disobedient, will he not as <i>circumstantially</i> fulfil the <i>promises</i> of his grace to all them that believe? The existence of his revelation, the continuance of a Christian Church upon earth, the certainty that there is one individual saved from his sins by the grace of the Gospel, and walking worthy of his vocation are continued proofs and evidences that he is still the same; that he will fulfil every jot and tittle of that word on which he has caused thee to trust; and save to the uttermost all that come unto the Father by him. The word of the Lord endureth for ever; and they who trust in him shall never be confounded.</p>
