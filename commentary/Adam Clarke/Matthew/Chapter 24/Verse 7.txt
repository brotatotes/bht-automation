<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:7">Matthew 24:7</span>. <i><b>Nation shall rise against nation</b></i> — This portended the dissensions, insurrections and mutual slaughter of the Jews, and those of other nations, who dwelt in the same cities together; as particularly at Caesarea, where the Jews and Syrians contended about the <i>right</i> of the city, which ended there in the total expulsion of the Jews, above 20,000 of whom were slain. The whole Jewish nation being exasperated at this, flew to arms, and burnt and plundered the neighbouring cities and villages of the <i>Syrians</i>, making an immense slaughter of the people. The Syrians, in return, destroyed not a less number of the Jews. At <i>Scythopolis</i> they murdered upwards of 13,000. At <i>Ascalon</i> they killed 2,500. At <i>Ptolemais</i> they slew 2000, and made many prisoners. The <i>Tyrians</i> also put many Jews to death, and imprisoned more: the people of <i>Gadara</i> did likewise; and all the other cities of <i>Syria</i> in proportion, as they hated or feared the Jews. As <i>Alexandria</i> the Jews and heathens fought, and 50,000 of the former were slain. The people of <i>Damascus</i> conspired against the Jews of that city, and, assaulting them unarmed, killed 10,000 of them. See Bishop <i>Newton</i>, and Dr. <i>Lardner</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Kingdom against kingdom</b></i> — This portended the open wars of different <i>tetrarchies</i> and <i>provinces</i> against each other.</p>
<p>1st. That of the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Galileans</i> against the <i>Samaritans</i>, for the murder of some <i>Galileans</i> going up to the feast of Jerusalem, while <i>Cumanus</i> was procurator.</p>
<p>2dly. That of the whole nation of the <i>Jews</i> against the <i>Romans</i> and <i>Agrippa</i>, and other allies of the Roman empire; which began when <i>Gessius Florus</i> was procurator.</p>
<p>3dly. That of the civil war in <i>Italy</i>, while <i>Otho</i> and <i>Vitellius</i> were contending for the empire.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that the Jews themselves say, "In the time of the Messiah, wars shall be stirred up in the world; nation shall rise against nation, and city against city." <i>Sohar Kadash</i>. "Again, Rab. Eleasar, the son of Abina, said, When ye see kingdom rising against kingdom, then expect the immediate appearance of the Messiah." <i>Bereshith Rabba</i>, sect. 42.</p>
<p>The THIRD sign, <i>pestilence</i> and <i>famine</i>.</p>
<p>It is farther added, that <i><b>There shall be famines, and</b></i><b> </b><i><b>pestilences</b></i> — There was a famine foretold by Agabus, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>,) which is mentioned by <i>Suetonius, Tacitus</i>, and <i>Eusebius</i>; which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar, and was so severe at Jerusalem that Josephus says (Ant. b. xx. c. 2.) many died for lack of food. <i>Pestilences</i> are the usual attendants of famines: as the scarcity and badness of provisions generally produce epidemic disorders.</p>
<p>The FOURTH sign, <i>earthquakes</i> or <i>popular commotions</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Earthquakes, in divers places.</b></i> — If we take the word σεισμοι from σειω <i>to shake</i>, in the first sense, then it means particularly those popular commotions and insurrections which have already been noted; and this I think to be the true meaning of the word: but if we confine it to <i>earthquakes</i>, there were several in those times to which our Lord refers; particularly one at <i>Crete</i> in the reign of Claudius, one at <i>Smyrna, Miletus, Chios, Samos</i>. See <i>Grotius</i>. One at <i>Rome</i>, mentioned by <i>Tacitus</i>; and one at <i>Laodicea</i> in the reign of <i>Nero</i>, in which the city was overthrown, as were likewise <i>Hierapolis</i> and <i>Colosse</i>. See <i>Tacit</i>. Annal. lib. xii. and lib. xiv. One at <i>Campania</i>, mentioned by <i>Seneca</i>; and one at <i>Rome</i>, in the reign of <i>Galba</i>, mentioned by <i>Suetonius</i> in the life of that emperor. Add to all these, a dreadful one in Judea, mentioned by <i>Josephus</i> (War, b. iv. c. 4.) accompanied by a <i>dreadful tempest,</i> <i>violent winds, vehement showers</i>, and continual <i>lightnings</i> and <i>thunders</i>; which led many to believe that these things portended some uncommon calamity.</p>
<p>The FIFTH sign, <i>fearful portents</i>.</p>
<p>To these St. Luke adds that there <i>shall be fearful sights and</i> <i>great signs from heaven</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:11">Luke 21:11</span>.) Josephus, in his preface to the Jewish war, enumerates these.</p>
<p>1st. A <i>star</i> hung over the city like a <i>sword</i>; and a <i>comet</i> continued a whole <i>year</i>.</p>
<p>2d. The people being assembled at the feast of <i>unleavened bread</i>, at the ninth hour of the night, a <i>great light</i> shone about the altar and the temple, and this continued for half an hour.</p>
<p>3d. At the same feast, a <i>cow</i> led to sacrifice brought forth a <i>lamb</i> in the midst of the temple!</p>
<p>4th. The <i>eastern gate</i> of the temple, which was of <i>solid brass</i>, and very <i>heavy</i>, and could hardly be shut by <i>twenty</i> <i>men</i>, and was fastened by strong <i>bars</i> and <i>bolts</i>, was seen at the sixth hour of the night <i>to open of its own accord</i>!</p>
<p>5th. Before sun-setting there were seen, over all the country, <i>chariots</i> and <i>armies</i> fighting in the <i>clouds</i>, and besieging cities.</p>
<p>6th. At the feast of pentecost, when the priests were going into the inner temple by night, to attend their service, they heard first a motion and noise, and then a voice, as of a multitude, saying, LET US DEPART HENCE! 7th. What Josephus reckons one of the most terrible signs of all was, that one <i>Jesus</i>, a country fellow, <i>four</i> <i>years before the war began</i>, and when the city was in peace and plenty, came to the feast of tabernacles, and ran crying up and down the streets, day and night: "A voice from the east! a voice from the west! a voice from the four winds! a voice against Jerusalem and the temple! a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides! and a voice against all the people!" Though the magistrates endeavoured by stripes and tortures to restrain him, yet he still cried, with a mournful voice, "Wo, wo to Jerusalem!" And this he continued to do for several years together, going about the walls and crying with a loud voice: "Wo, wo to the city, and to the people, and to the temple!" and as he added, "Wo, wo to myself!" a stone from some sling or engine struck him dead on the spot!</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that Josephus appeals to the testimony of <i>others</i>, who saw and heard these fearful things. <i>Tacitus</i>, a Roman historian, gives very nearly the same account with that of Josephus. Hist. lib. v.</p>
