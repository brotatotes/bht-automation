<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:8">Matthew 24:8</span>. <i><b>All these are the beginning of sorrows.</b></i> — ωδινων, <i>travailing pains</i>. The whole land of Judea is represented under the notion of a woman in grievous travail; but our Lord intimates, that all that had already been mentioned were only the first pangs and throes, and nothing in comparison of that hard and death-bringing labour, which should afterwards take place.</p>
<p>From the calamities of the <i>nation</i> in general, our Lord passes to those of the <i>Christians</i>; and, indeed, the sufferings of his followers were often occasioned by the judgments sent upon the land, as the poor Christians were charged with being the cause of these national calamities, and were cruelly persecuted on that account.</p>
