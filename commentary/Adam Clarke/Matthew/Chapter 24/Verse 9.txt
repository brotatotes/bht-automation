<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:9">Matthew 24:9</span>. <i><b>Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted</b></i> — Rather, <i>Then they will deliver you up to affliction</i>, εις θλιψιν. By a bold figure of speech, <i>affliction</i> is here <i>personified</i>. They are to be delivered into affliction's own hand, to be harassed by all the modes of inventive torture.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye shall be hated of all nations</b></i> — Both <i>Jew</i> and <i>Gentile</i> will unite in persecuting and tormenting <i>you</i>. Perhaps παντων των εθνων means <i>all the Gentiles</i>, as in the parallel places in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:9-11">Mark 13:9-11</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:12-15">Luke 21:12-15</span>, the <i>Jewish</i> persecution is mentioned <i>distinctly</i>. Ye shall be delivered up to COUNCILS and be beaten in SYNAGOGUES, and ye shall stand before governors and kings for my name's sake - be not anxiously careful beforehand what ye shall speak - for ye are not the speakers, but the Holy Spirit will speak by you - I will give you utterance and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to contradict or resist. We need go no farther than the Acts of the Apostles for the completion of these particulars. Some were delivered to <i>councils</i>, as Peter and John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:5">Acts 4:5</span>. Some were brought before rulers and kings, as Paul before Gallio, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span>, before Felix, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:0">Acts 24:0</span>, before Festus and Agrippa, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:0">Acts 25:0</span>. Some had <i>utterance and wisdom which their adversaries were not able to</i> <i>resist</i>: so Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:10">Acts 6:10</span>, and Paul, who made even Felix himself <i>tremble</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>. Some were <i>imprisoned</i>, as Peter and John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:3">Acts 4:3</span>. Some were <i>beaten</i>, as Paul and Silas, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>. Some were <i>put to death</i>, as Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>, and James the brother of John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>. But if we look beyond the book of the Acts of the Apostles, to the bloody persecutions under <i>Nero</i>, we shall find these predictions still more amply fulfilled: in these, numberless Christians fell, besides those two champions of the faith Peter and Paul. And it was, as says Tertullian, <i>nominis praelium</i>, a war against the very name of <i>Christ</i>; for he who was called Christian had committed crime enough, in bearing the <i>name</i>, to be put to death. So true were our Saviour's words, that they should be hated of all men for <i>his</i> NAME'S <i>sake</i>.</p>
<p>But they were not only to be hated by the Gentiles, but they were to be betrayed by <i>apostates</i>.</p>
