<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span>. <i><b>Then shall the kingdom of heaven</b></i> — The state of Jews and professing Christians - the state of the visible Church at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, and in the day of judgment: for the parable appears to relate to both those periods. And particularly at the time in which Christ shall come to judge the world, it shall appear what kind of reception his Gospel has met with. This parable, or something very like it, is found in the Jewish records: so in a treatise entitled RESHITH CHOCMAH, <i>the</i> <i>beginning of wisdom</i>, we read thus: "Our wise men of blessed memory say, Repent whilst thou hast strength to do it, whilst thy <i>lamp</i> <i>burns</i>, and thy <i>oil is not extinguished</i>; for if thy <i>lamp be gone</i> <i>out</i>, thy <i>oil</i> will profit thee nothing." Our doctors add, in MEDRASH: "The holy blessed God said to Israel, My sons, repent whilst the gates of repentance stand open; for I receive a gift at present, but when I shall sit in judgment, in the age to come, I will receive none." Another parable, mentioned by <i>Kimchi</i>, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:13">Isaiah 65:13</span>. "Rabbi Yuchanan, the son of Zachai, spoke a parable concerning a <i>king</i>, who <i>invited</i> his servants, but set them no time to come: the <i>prudent</i> and <i>wary</i> among them <i>adorned</i> themselves and, standing at the door of the king's house, said, Is any thing wanting in the house of the king? (<i>i.e.</i> Is there any work to be done?) But the <i>foolish</i> ones that were among them went away, and working said, When shall the feast be in which there is no labour? Suddenly the king sought out his servants: those who were <i>adorned</i> <i>entered in</i>, and they who were still polluted entered in also. The king was <i>glad</i> when he met the <i>prudent</i>, but he was <i>angry</i> when he met the <i>foolish</i>: he said, Let the <i>prudent sit down</i> and <i>eat</i>-let the others <i>stand</i> and <i>look on</i>." Rabbi Eliezer said, "Turn to God one day before your death." His disciples said, "How can a man know the day of his death?" He answered them, "Therefore you should turn to God <i>to-day</i>, perhaps you may die <i>to-morrow</i>; thus every day will be employed in returning." See <i>Kimchi</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:13">Isaiah 65:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Virgins</b></i> — Denoting the <i>purity</i> of the Christian doctrine and character. In this parable, the <i>bridegroom</i> is generally understood to mean <i>Jesus Christ</i>. The <i>feast</i>, that state of felicity to which he has promised to raise his genuine followers. The <i>wise</i>, or <i>prudent</i>, and <i>foolish virgins</i>, those who <i>truly</i> <i>enjoy</i>, and those who <i>only profess</i> the <i>purity</i> and <i>holiness</i> of his religion. The <i>oil</i>, the grace and salvation of God, or that faith which works by love. The <i>vessel</i>, the <i>heart</i> in which this <i>oil</i> is contained. The <i>lamp</i>, the profession of enjoying the burning and shining light of the Gospel of Christ. <i>Going forth</i>; the whole of their sojourning upon earth.</p>
