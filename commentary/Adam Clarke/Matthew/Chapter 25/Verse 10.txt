<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:10">Matthew 25:10</span>. <i><b>While they went to buy, the bridegroom came</b></i> — What a dismal thing it is, not to discover the emptiness of one's heart of all that is good, till it is too late to make any successful application for relief! God alone knows how many are thus deceived.</p>
<p><i><b>And they that were ready</b></i> — <i>They who were prepared </i>- who had not only a burning <i>lamp</i> of an evangelical profession, but had <i>oil</i> in their <i>vessels</i>, the <i>faith</i> that works by <i>love</i> in their hearts, and their lives <i>adorned</i> with all the fruits of the Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>The door was shut.</b></i> — Sinners on a death-bed too often meet with those deceitful merchants, who promise them salvation for a <i>price</i> which is of <i>no value</i> in the sight of God. <i>Come unto me</i>, says Jesus, <i>and buy</i>: there is no salvation but through his blood - no hope for the sinner but that which is founded upon his sacrifice and death. <i>The door was shut</i>-dreadful and fatal words! No <i>hope</i> remains. Nothing but <i>death</i> can shut this door; but death may surprise us in our sins, and then despair is our only portion.</p>
