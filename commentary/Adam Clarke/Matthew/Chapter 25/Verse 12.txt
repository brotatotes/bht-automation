<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:12">Matthew 25:12</span>. <i><b>I know you not.</b></i> â€” As if he had said, Ye are not of my company - ye were neither with the bride nor the bridegroom: ye slept while the others were in procession. I do not <i>acknowledge</i> you for my disciples - ye are not like him who is <i>love </i>- ye refused to receive his grace - ye sinned it away when ye had it; now you are necessarily excluded from that kingdom where nothing but <i>love</i> and <i>purity</i> can dwell.</p>
