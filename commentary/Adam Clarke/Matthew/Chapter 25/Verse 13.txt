<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:13">Matthew 25:13</span>. <i><b>Watch therefore</b></i> — If to <i>watch</i> be to employ ourselves <i>chiefly</i> about the business of our salvation, alas! how few of those who are called <i>Christians</i> are there who do <i>watch</i>! How many who <i>slumber</i>! How many who are asleep! How many seized with a <i>lethargy</i>! How many <i>quite dead</i>!</p>
<p><i><b>Wherein the Son of man cometh.</b></i> — These words are omitted by many excellent MSS., most of the versions, and several of the fathers. <i>Griesbach</i> has left them out of the text: <i>Grotius, Hammond, Mill</i>, and <i>Bengel</i>, approve of the omission.</p>
