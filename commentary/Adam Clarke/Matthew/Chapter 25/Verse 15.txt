<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:15">Matthew 25:15</span>. <i><b>Unto one he gave five talents - to every man according</b></i><b> </b><i><b>to his several ability</b></i> — The duties men are called to perform are <i>suited</i> to their situations, and the <i>talents</i> they receive. The <i>good</i> that any man has he has <i>received from God</i>, as also the <i>ability</i> to <i>improve</i> that good. God's graces and temporal mercies are <i>suited</i> to the <i>power</i> which a man has of <i>improving</i> them. To give eminent gifts to persons incapable of properly improving them, would be only to lead into a snare. The talent which each man has suits his <i>own</i> state best; and it is only <i>pride</i> and <i>insanity</i> which lead him to <i>desire</i> and <i>envy</i> the graces and talents of another. <i>Five</i> talents would be <i>too much</i> for some men: <i>one</i> talent would be <i>too little</i>. He who receives <i>much</i>, must make <i>proportionate</i> improvement; and, from him who has received <i>little</i>, the improvement only of that <i>little</i> will be required. As <i>five</i> <i>talents</i>, in one case, are sufficient to answer the <i>purpose</i> for which they were given; so also are <i>two</i> and <i>one</i>.</p>
<p>The man who improves the grace he has received, however <i>small</i>, will as surely get to the kingdom of God, as he who has received most from his master, and improved all.</p>
<p>There is a parable something like this in <i>Sohar Chadash</i>, fol. 47: "A certain king gave a deposit to three of his servants: the first kept it; the second lost it; the third spoiled one part of it, and gave the rest to another to keep. After some time, the king came and demanded the deposit. Him who had preserved it, the king praised, and made him governor of his house. Him who had lost it, he delivered to utter destruction, so that both his name and his possessions were blotted out. To the third, who had spoiled a part and given the rest to another to keep, the king said, Keep him, and let him not go out of my house, till we see what the other shall do to whom he has entrusted a part: if he shall make a proper use of it, this man shall be restored to liberty; if not, he also shall be punished." See <i>Schoettgen</i>. I have had already occasion to remark how greatly every Jewish parable is improved that comes through the hands of Christ.</p>
<p>In this parable of our Lord, four things may be considered: -</p>
<p>I. The <i>master</i> who distributes the talents.</p>
<p>II. The <i>servants</i> who <i>improved</i> their talents.</p>
<p>III. The <i>servant</i> who <i>buried</i> his talent. And</p>
<p>IV. His <i>punishment</i>.</p>
<p>1. The master's <i>kindness</i>. The servants <i>had</i> nothing - <i>deserved</i> nothing - had <i>no claim</i> on their master, yet he, in his KINDNESS, <i>delivers unto them his goods</i>, not for his <i>advantage</i>, but for their <i>comfort</i> and <i>salvation</i>.</p>
<p>2. The master distributes these goods <i>diversely; - giving to one</i> <i>five, to another, two, and to another one</i>. No person can complain that he has been <i>forgotten</i>; the master gives to <i>each</i>. None can complain of the <i>diversity</i> of the gifts; it is the <i>master</i> who has done it. The master has an absolute right over his own goods, and the servants cannot find fault with the distribution. He who has <i>little</i> should not <i>envy</i> him who has received <i>much</i>, for he has the <i>greater labour</i>, and the <i>greater account</i> to give. He who has <i>much</i> should not despise him who has <i>little</i>, for the <i>sovereign master</i> has made the <i>distinction</i>; and his <i>little</i>, suited to the <i>ability</i> which God has given him, and fitted to the <i>place</i> in which God's providence has fixed him, is sufficiently calculated to answer the <i>purpose</i> of the <i>master</i>, in the salvation of the servant's soul.</p>
<p>3. The master distributes his talents with WISDOM. He gave to each <i>according to his several ability</i>, i.e. to the <i>power</i> he had to <i>improve</i> what was given. It would not be <i>just</i> to make a servant <i>responsible</i> for what he is <i>naturally incapable</i> of <i>managing</i>; and it would not be <i>proper</i> to give <i>more</i> than could be <i>improved</i>. The powers which men have, God has given; and as he best knows the extent of these powers, so he suits his graces and blessings to them in the most wise, and effectual way. Though he may <i>make one</i> <i>vessel for honour</i>, (i.e. a more honourable place or office,) <i>and</i> <i>another for dishonour</i>, (a less honourable office,) yet <i>both</i> are for the <i>master's use</i>-both are <i>appointed</i> and <i>capacitated to show</i> <i>forth his glory</i>.</p>
<p>II. The servants who <i>improved</i> their talents.</p>
<p>These persons are termed δουλοι, <i>slaves</i>, such as were the property of the master, who might dispose of them as he pleased. <i>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:16">Matthew 25:16</span>.</p>
<p>1. The work was <i>speedily</i> begun - <i>as soon</i> as the master gave the talents and departed, <i>so soon</i> they began to labour. There is not a moment to be lost - every moment has its grace, and every grace has its employment, and every thing is to be done for eternity.</p>
<p>2. The work was <i>perseveringly</i> carried on; <i>after a long time the</i> <i>lord of those servants cometh</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:19">Matthew 25:19</span>. The master was <i>long</i> before he returned, but they did not <i>relax</i>. The longer time, the greater improvement. God gives every man just time enough to live, in this world, to glorify his Maker, and to get his soul saved. Many <i>begin</i> well, and <i>continue</i> faithful for a time-but how few <i>persevere to the end</i>! Are there none who seem to have outlived their glory, their character, their usefulness?</p>
<p>3. Their work was crowned with <i>success</i>. They <i>doubled</i> the sum which they had received. Every grace of God is capable of great improvement. Jesus himself, the pure, immaculate Jesus, <i>grew in</i> <i>wisdom and favour with God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:52">Luke 2:52</span>.</p>
<p>4. They were <i>ready</i> to give in a <i>joyful</i> account when their master came and called for them.</p>
<p>1st. They come without <i>delay</i>: they <i>expected</i> his coming; and it was with an eye to <i>this</i> that they <i>continued</i> their labour-they endured as seeing him who is invisible.</p>
<p>2dly. They come without <i>fear</i>; the master before whom they appear has always loved them, and given them the fullest proofs of his affection for them: his love to them has begotten in them love to him; and their <i>obedience</i> to his orders sprung from the love they bore to him. He that loveth me, says Jesus, will <i>keep</i> my words.</p>
<p>3d. They render up their accounts without <i>confusion</i>: he who received <i>five</i> brought <i>five</i> others; and he who had received <i>two</i> brought <i>two</i> more: nothing was to be <i>done</i> when their master called; all their business was <i>fully prepared</i>.</p>
<p>4th. They gave up <i>every thing</i> to their master, without attempting to <i>appropriate</i> any thing. Their ability was <i>his</i>, the talents <i>his</i>, and the continued <i>power</i> to improve them, <i>his</i>. All is of God, and all must be returned to him.</p>
<p>5. Their <i>recompense</i> from their gracious master.</p>
<p>1st. They receive <i>praise</i>. <i>Well done, good and faithful servants</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:21">Matthew 25:21</span>. What a glorious thing to have the <i>approbation</i> of God, and the testimony of a good conscience! They were <i>good</i>, pure and upright within - <i>faithful</i>, using to God's glory the blessings he had given.</p>
<p>2d. They receive gracious <i>promises. Ye have been faithful over a</i> <i>little, I will set you over much</i>. These promises refer not only to a <i>future</i> glory, but to an <i>increase</i> of God's grace and mercy <i>here</i>; for the more faithfully a man improves what God has already given him, the more he shall have from his gracious Master: for he giveth <i>more grace</i>, till he fills the faithful soul with his own <i>fulness</i>.</p>
<p>3d. They receive GLORY. <i>Enter into the joy of your</i> <i>Lord</i>. As ye were <i>partakers</i> of my <i>nature</i> on <i>earth</i>, be ye <i>sharers</i> of my <i>glory</i> in <i>heaven</i>. The <i>joy</i>, the happiness wherewith I am happy, shall be your eternal portion! O, what is all we can <i>do</i>, all we can <i>suffer</i>, even the most <i>lingering</i> and <i>cruel martyrdom</i>, in comparison of this unbounded, eternal joy!</p>
<p>III. Of the servant who <i>buried</i> his <i>talent</i>.</p>
<p><i>He that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid</i> <i>his Lord's money</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:18">Matthew 25:18</span>.</p>
<p>1. See the <i>ingratitude</i> of this servant. His master gave him a talent, <i>capable</i> of being improved to his own present and eternal advantage; but he slights the mercy of his lord.</p>
<p>2. See his <i>idleness</i>. Rather than exert himself to <i>improve</i> what he has received, he goes and <i>hides</i> it.</p>
<p>3. See his gross <i>error</i>. He DIGS to <i>hide it </i>- puts himself to <i>more</i> <i>trouble</i> to render the mercy of God to him of none effect, than he would have had in combating and <i>conquering</i> the world, the devil, and the flesh.</p>
<p>4. See his <i>injustice</i>. He <i>takes</i> his master's money, and neither <i>improves</i> nor <i>designs</i> to improve it, even while he is <i>living</i> on and <i>consuming</i> that bounty which would have been sufficient for a <i>faithful servant</i>. How much of this <i>useless lumber</i> is to be found in the Church of Christ! But suppose the man be a <i>preacher</i>-what a terrible account will <i>he</i> have to give to God-consuming the <i>provision</i> made for a <i>faithful</i> pastor, and so <i>burying</i>, or <i>misusing</i> his talent, as to do <i>no good</i>, to immortal souls!</p>
<p>5. Hear the <i>absurdity</i> of his <i>reasoning. Lord, I knew thee that</i> <i>thou art a hard</i> (or <i>avaricious</i>) <i>man, reaping where thou hast not</i> <i>sown</i>, c., <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:24">Matthew 25:24</span>. See this meaning of σκληρος proved by <i>Kypke</i>. The wicked excuse of this faithless servant <i>confuted</i> <i>itself</i> and <i>condemned him</i>. Nevertheless it is on this very <i>model</i> that sinners in general seek to <i>justify</i> themselves and the conclusion turns always against them. <i>I knew thee to be a hard</i> <i>man</i>. How awfully <i>deceived</i> and deeply <i>depraved</i> must that person be, who not only attempts to <i>excuse</i> his follies, but to <i>charge</i> his <i>crimes</i> on GOD <i>himself</i>!</p>
<p><i>I was afraid - Why</i>? Because thou wert an <i>enemy</i> to thy <i>soul</i>, and to thy <i>God. - I was afraid - of what</i>? that he would require <i>more</i> than he did <i>give</i>. How could this be? Did he not give thee the talent <i>freely</i>, to show thee his <i>benevolence</i>? And did he not suit it to thy <i>ability</i>, that he might show thee his <i>wisdom, justice</i>, and <i>goodness</i>, in not making thee <i>responsible</i> for <i>more</i> than thou couldst <i>improve</i>?</p>
<p>IV. Behold the awful <i>punishment</i> of this faithless servant.</p>
<p>1. He is <i>reproached. Thou wicked and slothful servant! Wicked </i>- in thy heart: <i>slothful </i>- in thy work. THOU <i>knewest that I reap where I</i> <i>sowed not</i>. Thou art condemned by thy own mouth - <i>whose</i> is the unemployed <i>talent</i>? Did <i>I</i> not give thee this? And did I require the improvement of <i>two</i> when I gave thee but <i>one</i>? - Thou knowest I did not.</p>
<p>2. He is <i>stripped</i> of what he <i>possessed. Take - the talent from</i> <i>him</i>. O terrible word! - Remove the <i>candlestick</i> from that <i>slothful,</i> <i>worldly-minded Church</i>: take away the <i>inspirations</i> of the Holy Spirit from that <i>lukewarm, Christless Christian</i>, who only lives to resist them and render them of none effect. <i>Dispossess</i> that <i>base,</i> <i>man-pleasing minister</i> of his ministerial gifts; let his <i>silver</i> become <i>brass</i>, and his <i>fine gold, dross</i>. He loved the <i>present</i> world more than the <i>eternal</i> world, and the <i>praise</i> of <i>men</i> more than the <i>approbation</i> of <i>God</i>. <i>Take away the talent from him</i>!</p>
<p>3. He is <i>punished</i> with an everlasting <i>separation</i> from God and the glory of his power. <i>Cast forth the unprofitable servant</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:30">Matthew 25:30</span>. Let him have nothing but <i>darkness</i>, who refused to walk in the <i>light</i>: let him have nothing but <i>misery - weeping and gnashing of</i> <i>teeth</i>, who has refused the <i>happiness</i> which God provided for him.</p>
<p>Reader, if the <i>careless virgin</i>, and the <i>unprofitable servant</i>, against whom no <i>flagrant</i> iniquity is <i>charged</i>, be punished with an <i>outer darkness</i>, with a <i>hell of fire</i>: of what <i>sorer</i> punishment must he be judged worthy, who is a <i>murderer</i>, an <i>adulterer</i>, a <i>fornicator</i>, a <i>blasphemer</i>, a <i>thief</i>, a <i>liar</i>, or in any respect an <i>open violater</i> of the <i>laws</i> of God? The <i>careless virgins</i>, and the <i>unprofitable servants</i>, were <i>saints</i> in comparison of millions, who are, notwithstanding, dreaming of an endless heaven, when fitted only for an endless hell!</p>
