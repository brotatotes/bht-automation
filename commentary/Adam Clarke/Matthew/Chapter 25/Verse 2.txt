Verse Matthew 25:2. Five of them were wise — Or, provident, φρονιμοι - they took care to make a proper provision beforehand, and left nothing to be done in the last moment.Five were foolish — μωροι, which might be translated careless, is generally rendered foolish; but this does not agree so well with φρονιμοι, provident, or prudent, in the first clause, which is the proper meaning of the word. μωρος in the Etymologicon, is thus defined, μη ὁρᾶ το δεον, he who sees not what is proper or necessary. These did not see that it was necessary to have oil in their vessels, (the salvation of God in their souls,) as well as a burning lamp of religious profession, Matthew 25:3; Matthew 25:4.
