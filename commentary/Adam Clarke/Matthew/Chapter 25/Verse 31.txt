<p>Verse 31. <i><b>When the Son of man shall come</b></i> — This must be understood of Christ's coming at the <i>last day</i>, to judge mankind: though all the preceding part of the chapter may be applied also to the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><i><b>Holy angels</b></i> — The word αγιοι is omitted by many excellent manuscripts, versions, and fathers. <i>Mill</i> and <i>Bengel</i> approve of the omission, and <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text. It is supposed by some that our Lord will have <i>other</i> angels (messengers) with him in that day, besides the <i>holy</i> ones. The <i>evil</i> angels may be in attendance to take, as their prey, those who shall be found on his left hand.</p>
<p><i><b>The throne of his glory</b></i> — That glorious throne on which his glorified human nature is seated, at the right hand of the Father.</p>
