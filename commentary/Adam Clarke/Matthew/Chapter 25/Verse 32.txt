<p>Verse 32. <i><b>All nations</b></i> — Literally, <i>all the nations </i>- all the <i>Gentile</i> world; the Jews are necessarily included, but they were spoken of in a particular manner in the preceding chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>He shall separate them</b></i> — Set each kind <i>apart</i> by themselves.</p>
<p><i><b>As a shepherd divideth</b></i>, c.] It does not appear that <i>sheep</i> and <i>goats</i> were ever <i>penned</i> or <i>housed</i> together, though they might feed in the same pasture yet even this was not done but in separate flocks; so Virgil, Eclog. vii. v. 2. </p>
<p>These two shepherds had <i>distinct</i> flocks, which fed in the same pasture, but <i>separately</i>; and they are only now <i>driven together</i>, for the convenience of the two shepherds, during the time of their musical contest.</p>
