<p>Verse 33. <i><b>He shall set the sheep</b></i>, c.] The <i>right hand</i> signifies, among the rabbins, <i>approbation</i> and <i>eminence</i>: the <i>left</i> <i>hand, rejection</i>, and <i>disapprobation</i>. Hence in <i>Sohar Chadash</i> it is said, "The <i>right</i> hand is given, the <i>left</i> also is given - to the <i>Israelites</i> and the <i>Gentiles</i> are given <i>paradise</i> and <i>hell </i>- this <i>world</i>, and the <i>world to come</i>." The right and left were emblematical of endless beatitude and endless misery among the Romans. Hence Virgil:- </p>
<p>SHEEP, which have ever been considered as the emblems of <i>mildness, simplicity, patience</i>, and <i>usefulness</i>, represent here the <i>genuine</i> disciples of Christ.</p>
<p>GOATS, which are naturally <i>quarrelsome, lascivious</i>, and excessively <i>ill-scented</i>, were considered as the symbols of <i>riotous, profane</i>, and <i>impure</i> men. They here represent all who have lived and died in their sins.
