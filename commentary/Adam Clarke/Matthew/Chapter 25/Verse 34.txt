<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Ye blessed of my Father</b></i> — This is the king's address to his followers; and contains the <i>reason</i> why they were found in the practice of all righteousness, and were now brought to this state of glory - they were <i>blessed </i>- came as <i>children</i>, and received the <i>benediction</i> of the <i>Father</i>, and <i>became</i>, and <i>continued</i> to be, members of the heavenly <i>family</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Inherit</b></i> — The inheritance is only for the <i>children</i> of the family - <i>if sons, then heirs</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span>, but not otherwise. The sons only shall enjoy the father's <i>estate</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Prepared for you</b></i> — That is, the kingdom of glory is designed for <i>such as you</i>-you who have received the <i>blessing</i> of the <i>Father</i>, and were <i>holy, harmless, undefiled</i>, and <i>separated</i> from <i>sinners</i>.</p>
