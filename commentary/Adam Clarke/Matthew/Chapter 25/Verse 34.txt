Verse 34. Ye blessed of my Father — This is the king's address to his followers; and contains the reason why they were found in the practice of all righteousness, and were now brought to this state of glory - they were blessed - came as children, and received the benediction of the Father, and became, and continued to be, members of the heavenly family.Inherit — The inheritance is only for the children of the family - if sons, then heirs, Galatians 4:7, but not otherwise. The sons only shall enjoy the father's estate.Prepared for you — That is, the kingdom of glory is designed for such as you-you who have received the blessing of the Father, and were holy, harmless, undefiled, and separated from sinners.From the foundation of the world — It was God's purpose and determination to admit none into his heaven but those who were made partakers of his holiness, Hebrews 12:14. The rabbins say, Seven things were created before the foundation of the world.1. The law.2. Repentance.3. Paradise.4. Hell.5. The throne of God.6. The temple; and7. The name of the Messiah.
