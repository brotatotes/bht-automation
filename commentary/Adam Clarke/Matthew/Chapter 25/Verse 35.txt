<p>Verse 35. <i><b>I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat</b></i> — Every thing which is done to a follower of Christ, whether it be <i>good</i> or <i>evil</i>, he considers as done to himself, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:4-5">Acts 9:4-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10">Hebrews 6:10</span>. Of all the fruits of the Spirit, none are mentioned here but those that spring from <i>love</i>, or <i>mercy</i>; because these give men the nearest conformity to God. Jesus had said, <i>Blessed are</i> <i>the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy</i>; and he here shows how this promise shall be fulfilled. The rabbins say: "As often as a poor man presents himself at thy door, the holy blessed God stands at his right hand: if thou give him alms, know that he who stands at his right hand will give thee a reward. But if thou give him not alms, he who stands at his right hand will punish thee." <i>Vaiyikra Rabba</i>, s. 34, fol. 178.</p>
<p><i><b>A stranger, and ye took me in</b></i> — συνηγαγετε με, <i>ye entertained</i> <i>me: Kypke</i> has fully proved that this is the meaning of the original. Literally, συναγειν signifies <i>to gather together.</i> <i>Strangers</i> are sometimes so destitute as to be ready to perish for lack of food and raiment: a supply of these things keeps their souls and bodies <i>together</i>, which were about to be separated through lack of the necessaries of life. The word may also allude to a provision made for a <i>poor family</i>, which were <i>scattered</i> <i>abroad</i>, perhaps begging their bread, and who by the ministry of benevolent people are <i>collected</i>, relieved, and put in a way of getting their bread. O blessed work! to be the instruments of preserving human life, and bringing comfort and peace into the habitations of the wretched!</p>
<p>While writing this, (Nov. 13, 1798,) I hear the bells loudly ringing in commemoration of the birth-day of E. <i>Colson</i>, Esq., a native of this city, (Bristol,) who spent a long life and an immense fortune in relieving the miseries of the distressed. His works still praise him in the gates; his name is revered, and his birth-day held sacred, among the inhabitants. Who has heard the bells ring in commemoration of the birth of any <i>deceased hero</i> or <i>king</i>? Of so much more <i>value</i>, in the sight even of the multitude, is a life of <i>public usefulness than one of worldly glory</i> or <i>secular state</i>. But how high must such a person rank in the sight of God, who, when Christ in his <i>representatives</i> was hungry, gave him food; when thirsty, gave him drink; when naked clothed him; when sick and in prison, visited him! Thou blessed of my Father! come. Thou hast been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, and now thou shalt eternally enjoy the true riches.</p>
<p>The Supreme God is represented in the <i>Bhagvat Geeta</i> as addressing mankind, when he had just formed them, thus: "Those who dress their meat <i>but</i> for <i>themselves</i>, eat the bread of <i>sin</i>." Geeta, p. 46.</p>
