<p>Verse 36. <i><b>I was sick, and ye visited me</b></i> â€” Relieving the strangers, and visiting the sick, were in high estimation among the Jews. One of their sayings on this head is worthy of notice: "He who neglects to visit the sick is like him who has shed blood." That is, as he has neglected, when it was in his power, to <i>preserve</i> life, he is as guilty in the sight of the Lord as he is who has committed murder. See <i>Kypke</i> in loco.</p>
