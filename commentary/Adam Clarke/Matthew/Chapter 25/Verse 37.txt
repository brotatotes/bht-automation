<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Lord, when saw we thee an hungered</b></i>, c.] This barbarous expression, <i>an hungered</i>, should be banished out of the text, wheresoever it occurs, and the simple word <i>hungry</i> substituted for it. Whatever is done for Christ's <i>sake</i>, is done through Christ's <i>grace</i> and he who does the work attributes to Jesus both the <i>will</i> and the <i>power</i> by which the work was done, and seeks and expects the kingdom of heaven not as a <i>reward</i>, but as a <i>gift</i> of <i>pure unmerited mercy</i>. Yet, while workers together with his grace, God attributes to <i>them</i> that which they do through his influence, as if they had done it independently of him. God has a right to form what estimate he pleases of the works wrought through himself: but man is never safe except when he attributes all to his Maker.</p>
