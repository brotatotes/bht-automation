<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:4">Matthew 25:4</span>. <i><b>Took oil in their vessels</b></i> â€” They not only had a sufficiency of oil in their lamps, but they carried a <i>vessel</i> with oil to recruit their lamps, when it should be found expedient. This the <i>foolish</i> or <i>improvident</i> neglected to do: hence, when the oil that was in their lamps burned out, they had none to pour into the lamp to maintain the flame.</p>
