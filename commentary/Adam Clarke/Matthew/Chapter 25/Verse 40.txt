Verse Matthew 25:40. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren â€” The meanest follower of Christ is acknowledged by him as his brother! What infinite condescension! Those, whom many would scorn to set with the dogs of their flock, are brothers and sisters of the blessed Jesus, and shall soon be set among the princes of his people.
