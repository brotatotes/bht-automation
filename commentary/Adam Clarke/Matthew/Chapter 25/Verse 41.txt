<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>. <i><b>Depart from me, ye cursed</b></i> — Or, <i>Ye cursed!</i> <i>depart. </i>- These words are the address of the king to the sinners; and contain the <i>reason</i> why they are to be separated from blessedness: <i>Ye are cursed</i>, because ye have <i>sinned</i>, and <i>would not</i> <i>come unto me that ye might have life</i>. - No work of <i>piety</i> has proceeded from your <i>hand</i>, because the carnal mind, which is enmity against me, reigned in your <i>heart</i>; and ye would not have <i>me</i> to reign over you. <i>Depart</i>! this includes what some have termed the punishment of <i>loss</i> or <i>privation</i>. Ye cannot, ye, shall not be united to <i>me - Depart</i>! O terrible word! and yet a worse is to come.</p>
<p><i><b>Into everlasting fire</b></i> — This is the <i>punishment</i> of <i>sense</i>. Ye shall not only be <i>separated</i> from me, but ye shall be <i>tormented</i>, awfully, everlastingly tormented in that place of separation.</p>
<p><i><b>Prepared for the devil and his angels</b></i> — The devil and his angels sinned <i>before</i> the creation of the world, and the place of torment was <i>then</i> prepared for <i>them</i>: it never was designed for <i>human souls;</i> but as the wicked are <i>partakers</i> with the devil and his angels in their <i>iniquities</i>, in their rebellion against God, so it is right that they should be <i>sharers</i> with them in their <i>punishment</i>. We see here, plainly, <i>why</i> sinners are destroyed, not because there was no salvation for them, but because they neglected to <i>receive</i> good, and <i>do</i> good. As they received not the Christ who was offered to them, so they could not do the work of righteousness which was required of them. They are <i>cursed</i>, because they <i>refused</i> to be <i>blessed</i>; and they are <i>damned</i>, because they <i>refused</i> to be <i>saved.</i></p>
