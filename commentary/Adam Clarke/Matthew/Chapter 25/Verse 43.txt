Verse Matthew 25:43. I was a stranger â€” If men were sure that Jesus Christ was actually somewhere in the land, in great personal distress, hungry, thirsty, naked, and confined, they would doubtless run unto and relieve him. Now Christ assures us that a man who is hungry, thirsty, naked, c., is his representative, and that whatever we do to such a one he will consider as done to himself yet this testimony of Christ is not regarded! Well, he will be just when he judges, and righteous when he punishes.
