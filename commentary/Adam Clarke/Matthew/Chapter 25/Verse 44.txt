Verse Matthew 25:44. Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, c.] It is want of faith which in general produces hard-heartedness to the poor. The man who only sees with eyes of flesh is never likely to discover Christ in the person of a man destitute of the necessaries of life. Some pretend not to know the distressed because they have no desire to relieve them; but we find that this ignorance will not avail them at the bar of God.
