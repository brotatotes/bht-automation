<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:44">Matthew 25:44</span>. <i><b>Lord, when saw we thee an hungered</b></i>, c.] It is want of <i>faith</i> which in general produces <i>hard-heartedness</i> to the poor. The man who only sees with eyes of flesh is never likely to discover Christ in the person of a man destitute of the necessaries of life. Some pretend <i>not to know</i> the distressed because they have no desire to relieve them; but we find that this ignorance will not avail them at the bar of God.</p>
