<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>. <i><b>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment</b></i> — No appeal, no remedy, to all eternity! No <i>end</i> to the punishment of those whose <i>final</i> impenitence manifests in them an eternal <i>will</i> and <i>desire</i> to sin. By dying in a <i>settled opposition</i> to God, they cast themselves into a <i>necessity</i> of continuing in an <i>eternal</i> <i>aversion</i> from him.</p>
<p>But some are of opinion that this punishment shall have <i>an end</i>: this is as likely as that the glory of the righteous shall have <i>an</i> <i>end</i>: for the same word is used to express the <i>duration</i> of the punishment, κολασιν αιωνιον, as is used to express the duration of the state of glory: ζωην αιωνιον. I have seen the best things that have been written in favour of the final redemption of damned spirits; but I never saw an answer to the argument against that doctrine, drawn from this verse, but what sound learning and criticism should be ashamed to acknowledge. The original word αιων is certainly to be taken here in its proper grammatical sense, <i>continued being</i>, αειων, NEVER ENDING. Some have gone a <i>middle</i> way, and think that the wicked shall be <i>annihilated</i>. This, I think, is contrary to the text; if they <i>go into punishment</i>, they <i>continue</i> to <i>exist</i>; for that which <i>ceases</i> to <i>be, ceases</i> to <i>suffer</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:33">Genesis 21:33</span>, where the whole subject is explained.</p>
<p>A very good improvement of the parable of the wise and foolish virgins is made by <i>Salvian</i>, a very pious writer of the fifth century, (Epist. ad. Ecclus. Cath. lib. ii.,) the substance of which, in Mr. <i>Bulkley's</i> translation, is as follows: -</p>
<p><i>Ego unum scio</i>, c. "One thing I know, that the lamps of the foolish virgins are said to have gone out for want of the oil of good works but thou, whoever thou art, thinkest that thou hast <i>oil</i> in <i>abundance</i>, and so did they; for, if they had not believed themselves to have had it, they would have provided themselves with it; for since afterwards, as the Lord says, they would gladly have borrowed, and sought it so eagerly, no doubt they would have done so before, had they not been deceived by the confidence of having it. Thou thinkest thyself <i>wise</i>, and these did not imagine themselves to be <i>foolish</i>: thou thinkest that thy <i>lamp</i> has <i>light</i>, and they lost their light because they thought they should have it. For why did they prepare their lamps if they did not think they should be <i>lighted</i>? In a word, their lamps, I suppose, must have afforded some <i>degree of light</i>; for since we read of their being afraid that their lamps should go out, they certainly had something which they feared would be extinguished. Nor was it a groundless fear; their lamps <i>did go out</i>, and that pure light of virginity which appeared profited them nothing, for want of a supply of <i>oil</i>. From whence we understand that what is but a little, is in a manner nothing. You have therefore need of a lamp plentifully filled, that your light may be lasting. And if those which we light up here for a short time so soon fail, unless copiously supplied with oil, how much must thou stand in need of that thy lamp may shine to eternity?"</p>
<p>This writer was a priest of Marseilles, in 430. He bewailed the profligacy of his times so much, and so pathetically, that he has been styled the <i>Jeremiah of the fifth century</i>. Were he still upon earth, he would find equal reason to deplore the wickedness and carelessness of mankind.</p>
<p>From what our Lord has here said, we may see that God indispensably requires of every man to bring forth <i>good fruit</i>; and that a <i>fruitless tree</i> shall be inevitably cut down, and cast into the fire. Let it be also remarked that God does not here <i>impute</i> to his own children the good works which Jesus Christ did <i>for</i> <i>them</i>. No! Christ's feeding the multitudes in Judea will not be imputed to them, while persons in their own neighbourhood are perishing through want, and they have wherewithal to relieve them. He gives them a power that they may glorify his name by it and have, in their own souls, the continued satisfaction which arises from succouring the distressed. Let it be farther remarked, that Christ does not say here that they have <i>purchased</i> the eternal life by these good deeds. No! for the <i>power</i> to work, and the <i>means</i> of working, came both from God. They first had redemption through his blood, and then his Spirit worked in them to <i>will</i> and to <i>do</i>. They were therefore only <i>workers together</i> with him, and could not be said, in any sense of the word, to purchase <i>God's glory</i>, with his own <i>property</i>. But though God works <i>in</i> them, and <i>by</i> them, he does not obey <i>for</i> them. The works of piety and mercy THEY perform, under the influence and by the aid of his grace. Thus God <i>preserves</i> the <i>freedom</i> of the human soul, and <i>secures</i> his <i>own glory</i> at the same time. Let it be remarked, farther, that the punishment inflicted on the foolish virgins, the slothful servant, and the cursed who are separated from God, was not because of their personal crimes; but because they were not <i>good</i>, and were not <i>useful</i> in the world. Their lives do not appear to have been stained with <i>crimes</i>,-but they were not adorned with <i>virtues</i>. They are sent to hell because they <i>did no good</i>. They were not renewed in the image of God; and hence did not bring forth fruit to his glory. If these <i>harmless</i> people are sent to perdition, what must the end be of the <i>wicked</i> and <i>profligate</i>!</p>
