<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span>. <i><b>At midnight there was a cry</b></i> — The Jewish weddings were generally celebrated in the night; yet they usually began at the rising of the evening star; but in this case there was a more than ordinary <i>delay</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Behold, the bridegroom cometh</b></i> — What an awful thing to be summoned to appear before the Judge of quick and dead! The following is an affecting relation, and <i>fas est ab hoste doceri</i>. "When Rabbi Jochanan ben Zachai was sick, his disciples came to visit him; and when he saw them he began to weep. They say to him, Rabbi! the light of Israel, the right hand pillar, the strong hammer, wherefore dost <i>thou</i> weep? He answered them, If they were carrying me before a king of flesh and blood, who is here today, and to-morrow in the grave; who, if he were angry with me, his anger would not last for ever: if he put me in prison, his prison would not be everlasting; if he condemned me to death, that death would not be eternal; whom I could soothe with words or bribe with riches; yet even in these circumstances I should weep. But now I am going before the King of kings, the holy and the blessed God, who liveth and endureth for ever and for ever; who, if he be angry with me, his anger will last for ever; if he put me in prison, his bondage will be everlasting; if he condemn me to death, that death will be eternal; whom I cannot soothe with words nor bribe with riches: when, farther, there are before me <i>two ways</i>, the one to hell and the other to paradise, and I know not in which they are carrying me, shall I not weep?" TALMUD <i>Beracoth</i>, fol. 29.</p>
