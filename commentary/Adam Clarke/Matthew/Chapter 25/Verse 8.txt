<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:8">Matthew 25:8</span>. <i><b>Our lamps are gone out.</b></i> — σβεννυνται, <i>are going out</i>. So then it is evident that they were <i>once</i> lighted. They had once hearts <i>illuminated</i> and <i>warmed</i> by faith and love; but they had <i>backslidden</i> from the salvation of God, and now they are excluded from heaven, because, through their <i>carelessness</i>, they have let the light that was in them become <i>darkness</i>, and have not applied in <i>time</i> for a <i>fresh supply</i> of the salvation of God.</p>
<p>A Jewish rabbin supposes God addressing man thus:-<i>I give thee my</i> <i>lamp, give thou me thy lamp; if thou keep my lamp I will keep thy</i> <i>lamp; but if thou extinguish my lamp I will extinguish thy lamp</i>. That is, I give thee my WORD and testimonies to be a <i>light</i> unto thy feet and a <i>lanthorn</i> to thy steps, to <i>guide</i> thee safely through life; give me thy SOUL and all its concerns, that I may <i>defend</i> and <i>save</i> thee from all evil: <i>keep</i> my WORD, <i>walk</i> in my <i>ways</i>, and I will <i>keep</i> thy SOUL that nothing shall injure it; but if thou <i>trample</i> under foot my <i>laws</i>, I will cast thy <i>soul</i> into <i>outer</i> <i>darkness</i>.</p>
