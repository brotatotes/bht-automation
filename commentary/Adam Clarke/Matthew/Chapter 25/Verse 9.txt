<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:9">Matthew 25:9</span>. <i><b>Lest there be not enough for us and you</b></i> — These had all been <i>companions</i> in the Christian course, and there was a time when they might have been <i>helpful</i> to each other; but that <i>time</i> is now <i>past</i> for ever-none has a particle of grace to spare, not even to help the soul of the dearest relative! The grace which every man receives is just enough to save his <i>own soul</i>; he has no <i>merits</i> to <i>bequeath</i> to the <i>Church</i>; no work of <i>supererogation</i> which can be placed to the account of another.</p>
<p><i><b>Go ye rather to them that sell, and buy</b></i> — By leaving out the particle δε, <i>but</i>, (on the indisputable authority of ABDGHKS, and HV, of Matthai, with <i>sixteen</i> others, the <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i> but one,) and transposing a very little the members of the sentence, the sense is more advantageously represented, and the reading smoother: <i>Rather go to them that sell, and buy for</i> <i>yourselves, lest there be not enough for us and you</i>. <i>Beza, Mill,</i> <i>Bengel</i>, and <i>Griesbach</i>, approve of the omission of the particle δε</p>
