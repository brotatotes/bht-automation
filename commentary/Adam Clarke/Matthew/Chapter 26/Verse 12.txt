Verse Matthew 26:12. She did it for my burial. — Or, She hath done it to embalm me - ενταφιασαι με. The Septuagint use ενταφιαστης for the person whose office it was to embalm, Genesis 50:2, and ενταφιαζω for the Hebrew הנט which signifies to prepare with spices, or aromatics, Genesis 50:3. Our Lord took this opportunity to tell them, once more, that he was shortly to die.
