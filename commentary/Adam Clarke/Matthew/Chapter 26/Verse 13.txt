<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:13">Matthew 26:13</span>. <i><b>Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached</b></i> — Another remarkable proof of the prescience of Christ. Such a matter as this, humanly speaking, depended on mere <i>fortuitous</i> circumstances, yet so has God disposed matters, that the thing has continued, hitherto, as firm and regular as the ordinances of heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>For a memorial of her.</b></i> — As embalming <i>preserves</i> the body from <i>corruption</i>, and she has done this good work to <i>embalm</i> and <i>preserve</i> this body, so will I order every thing concerning this transaction to be carefully recorded, to <i>preserve</i> her memory to the latest ages. The actions which the world blames, through the spirit of envy, covetousness, or malice, God takes delight to <i>distinguish</i> and <i>record</i>.</p>
