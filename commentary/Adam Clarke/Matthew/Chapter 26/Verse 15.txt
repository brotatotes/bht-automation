<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:15">Matthew 26:15</span>. <i><b>Thirty pieces of silver.</b></i> — τριακοντα αργυρια, <i>thirty</i> <i>silverlings</i>; but στατηρας, <i>staters</i>, is the reading of the Codex Bezae, three copies of the <i>Itala, Eusebius</i>, and <i>Origen</i> sometimes; and στατηρας αργυριου, <i>silver staters</i>, is the reading of the famous Basil MS. No. 1, in Griesbach, and one copy of the <i>Itala</i>.</p>
<p>A <i>stater</i> was the same as the shekel, and worth about 3<i>s</i>. English money, according to Dean Prideaux: a goodly price for the Saviour of the world! <i>Thirty staters</i>, about 4<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. the common price for the meanest slave! See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:32">Exodus 21:32</span>. The rabbins say, thirty <i>selain</i> of pure silver was the standard price for a slave, whether <i>good</i> or <i>bad, male</i> or <i>female</i>. See tract <i>Erachin</i>, fol. 14, and <i>Shekalim</i>, cap. 1. Each <i>selaa</i> weighed 384 barley-corns; the same number was contained in a shekel; and therefore the <i>shekel</i> and the <i>selaa</i> were the same. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:16">Genesis 20:16</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+38:24">Exodus 38:24</span>.</p>
