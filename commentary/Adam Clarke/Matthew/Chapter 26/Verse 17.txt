<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span>. <i><b>Now the first</b></i><b> day </b><i><b>of the</b></i><b> feast of </b><i><b>unleavened bread</b></i> — As the feast of unleavened bread did not begin till the day after the passover, the <i>fifteenth</i> day of the month, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:5-6">Leviticus 23:5-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+28:16-17">Numbers 28:16-17</span>, <i>this</i> could not have been, properly, the <i>first</i> day of that feast; but as the Jews began to eat unleavened bread on the <i>fourteenth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:18">Exodus 12:18</span>, this day was often termed <i>the first of unleavened bread</i>. The evangelists use it in this sense, and call even the paschal day by this name. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:12">Mark 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:7">Luke 22:7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Where wilt thou that we prepare</b></i> — How astonishing is this, that HE who created all things, whether visible or invisible, and by whom all things were upheld, should so <i>empty</i> himself as not to be <i>proprietor</i> of a single house in his whole creation, to eat the last passover with his disciples! This is certainly a mystery, and so, less or more is every thing that God does. But how inveterate and destructive must the nature of sin be, when such <i>emptying</i> and <i>humiliation</i> were necessary to its destruction! It is worthy of note what the Talmudists say, that the inhabitants of Jerusalem did not let out their houses to those who came to the annual feasts; but afforded all accommodations of this kind gratis. A man might therefore go and request the use of any room, on such an occasion, which was as yet unoccupied. The earthen jug, and the skin of the sacrifice, were left with the host. See <i>Lightfoot</i>, vol. ii. p. 21.</p>
