The circumstances are more particularly marked in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:8">Luke 22:8</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>My time is at hand</b></i> — That is, the time of my crucifixion. <i>Kypke</i> has largely shown that καιρος is often used among the Greeks for <i>affliction</i> and <i>calamity</i>. It might be rendered here, <i>the time of</i> <i>my crucifixion is at hand</i>.</p>
