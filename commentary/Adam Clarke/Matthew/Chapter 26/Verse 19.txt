<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:19">Matthew 26:19</span>. <i><b>And the disciples did</b></i> — The disciples that were sent on this errand were Peter and John. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:8">Luke 22:8</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>They made ready the passover</b></i> — That is, they provided the lamb, c., which were appointed by the law for this solemnity. Mr. Wakefield justly observes, "that the Jews considered the passover as a <i>sacrificial</i> rite <i>Josephus</i> calls it θυσιαν, A SACRIFICE; and <i>Trypho</i>, in <i>Justin Martyr</i>, speaks of προβατον του πασχα θυειν, SACRIFICING <i>the paschal lamb</i>. But what comes nearer to the point is this, that <i>Maimonides</i>, one of the most eminent of the Jewish rabbins, has a particular treatise on the <i>paschal sacrifice</i>; and throughout that piece, speaks of the lamb as a <i>victim</i>, and of the solemnity itself as a <i>sacrifice</i>. And R. <i>Bechai</i>, in his commentary on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+2:11">Leviticus 2:11</span>, says that the paschal sacrifice was of a <i>piacular</i> nature, in order to <i>expiate</i> the guilt contracted by the idolatrous practices of the Israelites In Egypt." It was highly necessary that this should be considered as an <i>expiatory sacrifice</i>, as it typified that Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. For much more on this important subject than can, with propriety, be introduced into these notes, see a <i>Discourse on the Eucharist</i>, lately published by the author of this work.</p>
