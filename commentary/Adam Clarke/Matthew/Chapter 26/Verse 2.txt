<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:2">Matthew 26:2</span>. <i><b>The passover</b></i> — A feast instituted in Egypt, to commemorate the destroying angel's <i>passing over</i> the houses of the Israelites, when he slew the firstborn of the Egyptians. See the whole of this business largely explained in the Notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:1-27">Exodus 12:1-27</span>. This feast began on the fourteenth day of the first moon, in the first month, Nisan, and it lasted only <i>one</i> day; but it was immediately followed by the days of <i>unleavened bread</i>, which were <i>seven</i>, so that the whole lasted eight days, and all the eight days are sometimes called the feast of the passover, and sometimes the <i>feast</i> or <i>days of unleavened bread</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:1-7">Luke 22:1-7</span>. The three most signal benefits vouchsafed to the Israelites were,</p>
<p>1. <i>The deliverance from the slavery of Egypt</i>; to commemorate which they kept <i>the feast of unleavened bread</i>, and the passover.</p>
<p>2. The <i>giving of the law</i>; to commemorate which, they kept the <i>feast of weeks</i>.</p>
<p>3. Their sojourning in the wilderness, and entrance into the <i>promised land</i>; to commemorate which, they kept the <i>feast of</i> <i>tabernacles</i>.</p>

<p><i><b>The Son of man is betrayed</b></i>, (rather <i>delivered up</i>,)<b> </b><i><b>to be</b></i><b> </b><i><b>crucified.</b></i> — With what amazing calmness and precision does our blessed Lord speak of this awful event! What a proof does he here give of his <i>prescience</i> in so correctly predicting it; and of his love in so cheerfully undergoing it! Having <i>instructed</i> his disciples and the Jews by his <i>discourses, edified</i> them by his <i>example, convinced</i> them by his <i>miracles</i>, he now prepares to <i>redeem</i> them by his <i>blood</i>! These two verses have no proper connection with this chapter, and should be joined to the preceding.</p>
