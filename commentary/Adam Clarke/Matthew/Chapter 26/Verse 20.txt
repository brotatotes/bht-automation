<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:20">Matthew 26:20</span>. <i><b>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>twelve.</b></i> â€” It is a common opinion that our Lord ate the passover some hours before the Jews ate it; for the Jews, according to custom, ate theirs at the <i>end</i> of the <i>fourteenth</i> day, but Christ ate his the preceding even, which was the beginning of the same sixth day, or Friday; the Jews begin their day at <i>sunsetting</i>, we at midnight. Thus Christ ate the passover on the <i>same day</i> with the Jews, but not on the <i>same hour</i>. Christ kept this passover the beginning of the fourteenth day, the precise day and hour in which the Jews had eaten their first passover in Egypt. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:6-12">Exodus 12:6-12</span>. And in the same part of the same day in which the Jews had sacrificed their first paschal lamb, viz. <i>between</i> <i>the two evenings</i>, about the <i>ninth hour</i>, or 3 o'clock, Jesus Christ our passover was sacrificed for us: for it was at this hour that he yielded up his last breath; and then it was that, the sacrifice being <i>completed</i>, Jesus said, IT IS FINISHED.
