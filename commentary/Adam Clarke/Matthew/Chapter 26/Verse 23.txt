<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:23">Matthew 26:23</span>. <i><b>He that dippeth his hand</b></i> â€” As the Jews ate the passover a whole family together, it was not convenient for them all to dip their bread in the <i>same</i> dish; they therefore had several little dishes or plates, in which was the juice of the bitter herbs, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:8">Exodus 12:8</span>, on different parts of the table; and those who were nigh one of these, dipped their bread in it. As Judas is represented as dipping in the <i>same</i> dish with Christ, it shows that he was either near or opposite to him. If this man's heart had not been hardened, and his conscience seared beyond all precedent, by the deceitfulness of his sin, would he have showed his face in this sacred assembly, or have thus put the seal to his own perdition, by eating of this sacrificial lamb? Is it possible that he could feel no compunction? Alas! having delivered <i>himself</i> up into the hands of the devil, he was capable of delivering up his <i>Master</i> into the hands of the chief priests; and thus, when men are completely hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, they can outwardly perform the most solemn acts of devotion, without feeling any sort of inward concern about the matter.</p>
