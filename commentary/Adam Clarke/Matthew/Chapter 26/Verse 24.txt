<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span>. <i><b>The Son of man goeth</b></i> — That is, is about to die. <i>Going, going away, departing</i>, &amp;c., are frequently used in the best Greek and Latin writers, for <i>death</i>, or <i>dying</i>. The same words are often used in the Scriptures in the same sense.</p>
<p><i><b>It had been good for that man</b></i> — Can this be said of any sinner, in the common sense in which it is understood, if there be any redemption from hell's torments? If a sinner should suffer millions of millions of years in them, and get out at last to the enjoyment of heaven, then it was well for him that he had been born, for still he has an <i>eternity of blessedness</i> before him. Can the doctrine of the <i>non-eternity</i> of hell's torments stand in the presence of this saying? Or can the doctrine of the <i>annihilation</i> of the wicked consist with this declaration? It would have been well for that man if he had never been born! Then he must be in some state of <i>conscious existence</i>, as <i>non-existence</i> is said to be <i>better</i> than that <i>state</i> in which he is now found. It was common for the Jews to say of any flagrant transgressor, <i>It would have</i> <i>been better for him had he never been born</i>. See several examples in <i>Schoettgen</i>. See the case of Judas argued at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:0">Acts 1:0</span>.</p>
