<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:25">Matthew 26:25</span>. <i><b>Judas - said, Master, is it I?</b></i> — What excessive impudence! He knew, in his conscience, that he had already <i>betrayed</i> his Master, and was waiting now for the servants of the chief priests, that he might <i>deliver</i> him into their hands; and yet he says, (hoping that he had transacted his business so privately that it had not yet transpired,) <i>Master, is it I</i>? It is worthy of remark, that each of the other disciples said κυριε, LORD, <i>is it</i> <i>I</i>? But Judas <i>dares</i> not, or <i>will</i> not, use this august title, but simply says ραββι, TEACHER, <i>is it I</i>?</p>
<p><i><b>Thou hast said.</b></i> — συ ειπας, or אתון אמריתון <i>atun amaritun</i>, "Ye have said," was a common form of expression for YES. IT IS so. "When the Zipporenses inquired whether Rabbi Judas was dead? the son of Kaphra answered, <i>Ye have said</i>," i.e. He is dead. See <i>Schoettgen</i>. Hor. Hebr. p. 225.</p>
