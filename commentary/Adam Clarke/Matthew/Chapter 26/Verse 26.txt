<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span>. <i><b>Jesus took bread</b></i> — This is the first institution of what is termed the LORD's SUPPER. To every part of this ceremony, as here mentioned, the utmost attention should be paid.</p>
<p>To do this, in the most effectual manner, I think it necessary to set down the text of the three evangelists who have transmitted the whole account, collated with that part of St. Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians which speaks of the same subject, and which, he assures us, he received by Divine revelation. It may seem strange that, although John (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1-38">John 13:1-38</span>) mentions all the circumstances preceding the holy supper, and, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1-31">John 14:1-31</span> the circumstances which succeeded the breaking of the bread, and in chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:0">John 15:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:0">John 16:0</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:0">John 17:0</span>, the discourse which followed the administration of the cup; yet he takes no notice of the Divine institution at all. This is generally accounted for on his knowledge of what the other three evangelists had written; and on his conviction that their relation was true, and needed no additional confirmation, as the matter was amply established by the conjoint testimony of three such respectable witnesses.</p>

<p>From the preceding harmonized view of this important transaction, as described by <i>three</i> EVANGELISTS and <i>one</i> APOSTLE, we see the first institution, nature, and design of what has been since called THE LORD'S SUPPER. To every circumstance, as set down here, and the mode of expression by which such circumstances are described, we should pay the deepest attention.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span>. <i><b>As they were eating</b></i> — Either an <i>ordinary</i> supper, or the <i>paschal lamb</i>, as some think. See the observations at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>Jesus took bread</b></i> — Of what kind? <i>Unleavened</i> bread, certainly, because there was no other kind to be had in all Judea at this time; for this was the first day of unleavened bread, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span>), i.e. the 14th of the month Nisan, when the Jews, according to the command of God, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:15-20">Exodus 12:15-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:15">Exodus 23:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:25">Exodus 34:25</span>), were to purge away all <i>leaven</i> from their houses; for he who sacrificed the passover, having leaven in his dwelling, was considered to be such a transgressor of the Divine law as could no longer be tolerated among the people of God; and therefore was to be cut off from the congregation of Israel. <i>Leo</i> of Modena, who has written a very sensible treatise on the <i>customs of the Jews</i>, observes, "That so strictly do some of the Jews observe the precept concerning the removal of all leaven from their houses, during the celebration of the paschal solemnity, that they either provide vessels entirely <i>new</i> for baking, or else have a set for the purpose, which are dedicated solely to the service of the passover, and never brought out on any other occasion."</p>
<p>To this divinely instituted custom of removing all leaven previously to the paschal solemnity, St. Paul evidently alludes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6-8">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</span>. <i>Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge</i> <i>out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are</i> <i>unleavened. For even Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us;</i> <i>therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with</i> <i>the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the</i> UNLEAVENED <i>bread</i> <i>of sincerity and truth</i>.</p>
<p>Now, if any respect should be paid to the primitive institution, in the celebration of this Divine ordinance, then, <i>unleavened,</i> <i>unyeasted</i> bread should be used. In every sign, or type, the thing <i>signifying</i> or pointing out that which is <i>beyond</i> itself should either have certain <i>properties</i>, or be accompanied with certain <i>circumstances</i>, as <i>expressive as possible</i> of the thing <i>signified</i>. <i>Bread</i>, simply considered in itself, may be an emblem apt enough of the <i>body</i> of our Lord Jesus, which was given for us; but the design of God was evidently that it should not only point out this, but also the <i>disposition</i> required in those who should celebrate both the <i>antetype</i> and the <i>type</i>; and this the apostle explains to be <i>sincerity</i> and <i>truth</i>, the reverse of <i>malice</i> and <i>wickedness</i>. The very <i>taste</i> of the bread was instructive: it pointed out to every communicant, that he who came to the table of God with <i>malice</i> or <i>ill-will</i> against any soul of man, or with <i>wickedness</i>, a profligate or sinful life, might expect to eat and drink judgment to himself, as not discerning that the Lord's body was sacrificed for this very purpose, <i>that all sin might be destroyed</i>; and that sincerity, ειλικρινεια, such purity as <i>the clearest light can</i> <i>discern no stain in</i>, might be diffused through the whole soul; and that <i>truth</i>, the law of righteousness and true holiness, might regulate and guide all the actions of life. Had the bread used on these occasions been of the common kind, it would have been perfectly unfit, or improper, to have communicated these <i>uncommon</i> <i>significations</i>; and, as it was <i>seldom</i> used, its rare occurrence would make the emblematical representation more deeply impressive; and the <i>sign</i>, and the thing <i>signified</i>, have their due correspondence and influence.</p>
<p>These circumstances considered, will it not appear that the use of <i>common bread</i> in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is highly improper? He who can say, "<i>This is a matter of no importance</i>," may say with equal propriety, the <i>bread</i> itself is of no importance; and another may say, the <i>wine</i> is of no importance; and a third may say, "<i>neither</i> the <i>bread</i> nor <i>wine</i> is any thing, but as they lead to <i>spiritual</i> references; and, the spiritual reference being once understood, the signs are useless." Thus we may, through affected spirituality, refine away the whole ordinance of God; and, with the <i>letter</i> and <i>form</i> of religion, abolish religion itself. Many have already acted in this way, not only to their loss, but to their ruin, by showing how profoundly wise they are above what is written. Let those, therefore, who consider that <i>man shall live by every word which proceeds from the mouth of God</i>, and who are conscientiously solicitous that each Divine institution be not only preserved, but observed in all its original integrity, attend to this circumstance. The <i>Lutheran</i> Church makes use of unleavened bread to the present day.</p>
<p><i><b>And blessed it</b></i> — Both St. <i>Matthew</i> and St. <i>Mark</i> use the word ευλογησας, <i>blessed</i>, instead of ευχαριστησας, <i>gave thanks</i>, which is the word used by St. <i>Luke</i> and St. <i>Paul</i>. But instead of ευλογησας, <i>blessed</i>, ευχαριστησας, <i>gave thanks</i>, is the reading of ten MSS. in uncial characters, of the Dublin <i>Codex rescriptus</i>, published by Dr. Barrett, and of more than one hundred others, of the greatest respectability. This is the reading also of the <i>Syriac</i> and <i>Arabic</i>, and is confirmed by several of the primitive fathers. The terms, in this case, are nearly of the same import, as both <i>blessing</i> and <i>giving thanks</i> were used on these occasions. But what was it that our Lord blessed? Not the <i>bread</i>, though many think the contrary, being deceived by the word IT, which is improperly <i>supplied</i> in our version. In all the four places referred to above, whether the word <i>blessed</i> or <i>gave thanks</i> is used, it refers not to the <i>bread</i>, but to <i>God</i>, the dispenser of every good. Our Lord here conforms himself to that constant Jewish custom, viz. of acknowledging God as the author of every good and perfect gift, by <i>giving thanks</i> on <i>taking the bread</i> and <i>taking the cup</i> at their ordinary meals. For every Jew was forbidden to eat, drink, or use any of God's creatures without rendering him thanks; and he who acted contrary to this command was considered as a person who was guilty of sacrilege.</p>
<p>From this custom we have derived the decent and laudable one of saying grace (<i>gratas</i> thanks) before and after meat. The Jewish form of blessing, probably that which our Lord used on this occasion, none of my readers will be displeased to find here, though it has been mentioned once before. On taking the <i>bread</i> they say: - </p>
<p><i><b>And brake it</b></i> — We often read in the Scriptures of <i>breaking</i> bread, but never of <i>cutting</i> it. The Jewish people had nothing similar to our high-raised <i>loaf</i>: their bread was made broad and thin, and was consequently very brittle, and, to divide it, there was no need of a knife.</p>
<p>The <i>breaking</i> of the <i>bread</i> I consider essential to the proper performance of this solemn and significant ceremony: because this act was designed by our Lord to shadow forth the <i>wounding,</i> <i>piercing</i>, and <i>breaking</i> of his body upon the cross; and, as all this was essentially necessary to the making a <i>full atonement</i> for the sin of the world, so it is of vast importance that this apparently little circumstance, the <i>breaking of the bread</i>, should be carefully attended to, that the godly communicant may have every necessary assistance to enable him to discern the Lord's body, while engaged in this most important and Divine of all God's ordinances. But who does not see that <i>one</i> small cube of <i>fermented</i>, i.e. <i>leavened</i> bread, previously divided from the mass with a knife, and separated by the fingers of the minister, can never answer the end of the institution, either as to the <i>matter</i> of the bread, or the <i>mode</i> of dividing it? Man is naturally a dull and heedless creature, especially in spiritual things, and has need of the utmost assistance of his <i>senses</i>, in union with those expressive rites and ceremonies which the <i>Holy Scripture</i>, not <i>tradition</i>, has sanctioned, in order to enable him to arrive at spiritual things, through the medium of earthly similitudes.</p>
<p><i><b>And gave</b></i><b> it </b><i><b>to the disciples</b></i> — Not only the <i>breaking</i>, but also the DISTRIBUTION, of the bread are necessary parts of this rite. In the Romish Church, the bread is not <i>broken</i> nor <i>delivered</i> to the people, that THEY may <i>take</i> and <i>eat</i>; but the consecrated wafer is put upon their tongue by the priest; and it is generally understood by the communicants, that they should not masticate, but swallow it <i>whole</i>.</p>
<p>"That the <i>breaking</i> of this bread to be <i>distributed</i>," says Dr. Whitby, "is a necessary part of this rite is evident, first, by the continual mention of it by St. Paul and all the evangelists, when they speak of the institution of this sacrament, which shows it to be a necessary part of it. 2dly, Christ says, <i>Take, eat,</i> <i>this is my body</i>, BROKEN <i>for you</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span>. But when the elements are <i>not broken</i>, it can be no more said, <i>This is my body</i> <i>broken for you</i>, than where the elements are <i>not given</i>. 3dly, Our Lord said, <i>Do this in remembrance of me</i>: i.e. 'Eat this bread, broken in remembrance of my body broken on the cross:' now, where no body <i>broken</i> is <i>distributed</i>, there, nothing can be eaten in memorial of his <i>broken body</i>. Lastly, The apostle, by saying, <i>The</i> <i>bread which we</i> BREAK, <i>is it not the communion of the body of</i> <i>Christ</i>? sufficiently informs us that the eating of his <i>broken</i> body is necessary to that end, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:10">1 Corinthians 10:10</span>. Hence it was that this rite, of <i>distributing</i> bread <i>broken</i>, continued for a thousand years, and was, as <i>Humbertus</i> testifies, observed in the Roman Church in the eleventh century." WHITBY <i>in loco</i>. At present, the opposite is as boldly practised as if the real Scriptural rite had never been observed in the Church of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>This is my body.</b></i> — Here it must be observed that Christ had nothing in his hands, at this time, but part of that unleavened bread which he and his disciples had been eating at supper, and therefore he could mean no more than this, viz. that the bread which he was now breaking <i>represented</i> his body, which, in the course of a few hours, was to be crucified for them. Common sense, unsophisticated with superstition and erroneous creeds,-and reason, unawed by the secular sword of sovereign authority, could not possibly take any other meaning than this plain, consistent, and rational one, out of these words. "But," says a false and absurd creed, "Jesus meant, when he said, HOC EST CORPUS MEUM, <i>This is my body</i>, and HIC EST CALIX SANGUINIS MEI, <i>This is the</i> <i>chalice of my blood</i>, that the bread and wine were <i>substantially</i> <i>changed</i> into his body, including flesh, blood, bones, yea, the whole Christ, in his immaculate humanity and adorable divinity!" And, for denying this, what rivers of righteous blood have been shed by state persecutions and by religious wars! Well it may be asked, "Can any man of sense believe, that, when Christ took up that bread and broke it, it was his own body which he held in his own hands, and which himself broke to pieces, and which he and his disciples ate?" He who can believe such a congeries of absurdities, cannot be said to be a <i>volunteer in faith</i>; for it is evident, the man can neither have faith nor reason, as to <i>this</i> subject.</p>
<p>Let it be observed, if any thing farther is necessary on this point, that the paschal lamb, is called the passover, because it represented the destroying angel's passing over the children of Israel, while he slew the firstborn of the Egyptians; and our Lord and his disciples call this lamb the passover, several times in this chapter; by which it is demonstrably evident, that they could mean no more than that the lamb sacrificed on this occasion was a memorial of, and Represented, the means used for the preservation of the Israelites from the blast of the destroying angel.</p>
<p>Besides, our Lord did not say, hoc est corpus meum, (this is my body), as he did not speak in the Latin tongue; though as much stress has been laid upon this quotation from the Vulgate as if the original of the three evangelists had been written in the Latin language. Had he spoken in Latin, following the idiom of the Vulgate, he would have said, Panis hic corpus meum signficat, or, Symbolum est corporis mei: - hoc poculum sanguinem meum representat, or, symbolum est sanguinis mei: - this bread signifies my body; this cup represents my blood. But let it be observed that, in the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Chaldeo-Syriac languages, as used in the Bible, there is no term which expresses to mean, signify, denote, though both the Greek and Latin abound with them: hence the Hebrews use a figure, and say, it is, for, it signifies. So <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:26">Genesis 41:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:27">Genesis 41:27</span>. The seven kine Are (i.e. represent) seven years. This Is (represents) the bread of affliction which our fathers ate in the land of Egypt. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:24">Daniel 7:24</span>. The ten horns Are (i.e. signify) ten kings. They drank of the spiritual Rock which followed them, and the Rock Was (represented) Christ. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span>. And following this Hebrew idiom, though the work is written in Greek, we find in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>, The seven stars Are (represent) the angels of the seven Churches: and the seven candlesticks Are (represent) the seven Churches. The same form of speech is used in a variety of places in the New Testament, where this sense must necessarily be given to the word. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:38">Matthew 13:38</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:39">Matthew 13:39</span>. The field IS (represents) the world: the good seed Are (represent or signify) the children of the kingdom: the tares Are (signify) the children of the wicked one. The enemy Is (signifies) the devil: the harvest Is (represents) the end of the world: the reapers Are (i.e. signify) the angels. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:9">Luke 8:9</span>. What might this parable Be? Τις ΕΙΗ η παραβολη αυτη: - What does this parable Signify? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:36">John 7:36</span>. Τις ΕΣΤΙΝ αυτος ο λογος: What is the Signification of this saying? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:6">John 10:6</span>. They understood not what things they Were, τινα ΗΝ, what was the Signification of the things he had spoken to them. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:17">Acts 10:17</span>. Τι αν ΕΙΗ οραμα, what this vision Might Be; properly rendered by our translators, what this vision should Mean. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24">Galatians 4:24</span>. For these Are the two covenants, αυται γαρ ΕΙΣΙΝ αι δυο διαθηκαι, these Signify the two covenants. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:26">Luke 15:26</span>. He asked, τι ΕΙΗ ταυτα, what these things Meant. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:36">Luke 18:36</span>. After such unequivocal testimony from the Sacred writings, can any person doubt that, This bread is my body, has any other meaning than, This bread Represents my body?</p>
<p>The Latins use the verb, sum, in all its forms, with a similar latitude of meaning. So, Esse oneri ferendo, he is Able to bear the burthen: bene Esse, to Live sumptuously: male Esse, to Live miserably: recte Esse, to Enjoy good health: Est mihi fistula, I Possess a flute: EST hodie in rebus, he now Enjoys a plentiful fortune: Est mihi namque domi pater, I Have a father at home, etc.: Esse solvendo, to be Able to pay: Fuimus Troes, Fuit Ilium; the Trojans are Extinct, Troy is No More.</p>
<p>In Greek also, and Hebrew, it often signifies to live, to die, to be killed. Ουκ ΕΙΜΙ, I am Dead, or a dead man. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:18">Matthew 2:18</span> : Rachel weeping for her children, οτι ουκ ΕΙΣΙ, because they Were Murdered. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+42:36">Genesis 42:36</span> : Joseph is not, יוסף איננו Yoseph einennu, Ιωσηφ ουκ ΕΣΤΙΝ, Sept., Joseph is Devoured by a Wild Beast. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span> : Calling the things that Are not, as if they were Alive. So Plutarch in Laconicis: "This shield thy father always preserved; preserve thou it, or may thou not Be," Η μη ΕΣΟ, may thou Perish. ΟΥΚ ΟΝΤΕΣ νομοι, Abrogated laws. ΕΙΜΙ εν εμοι, I Possess a sound understanding. Εις πατερα υμιν ΕΣΟΜΑΙ, I will Perform the Part of a father to you. ΕΙΜΙ της πολεως της δε, I Am an Inhabitant of that city. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:7">1 Timothy 1:7</span> : Desiring to Be teachers of the law, θελοντες ΕΙΝΑΙ νομοδιδασκαλοι, desiring to be Reputed teachers of the law, i.e. Able divines. Τα ΟΝΤΑ, the things that Are, i.e. Noble and Honorable men: τα μη ΟΝΤΑ, the things that are not, viz. the Vulgar, or those of Ignoble Birth.</p>
<p>Tertullian seems to have had a correct notion of those words of our Lord,</p>
<p>Acceptum panem et distributum discipulis, corpus illum suum fecit, Hoc Est Corpus Meum dicendo, id est, Figura corporis mei.</p>
<p>Advers. Marc. l. v. c. 40.</p>
<p>"Having taken the bread, and distributed that body to his disciples, he made it his body by saying, This is my body, i.e. a Figure of my body."</p>
<p>That our Lord neither spoke in Greek nor Latin, on this occasion, needs no proof. It was, most probably, in what was formerly called the Chaldaic, now the Syriac, that our Lord conversed with his disciples. Through the providence of God, we have complete versions of the Gospels in this language, and in them it is likely we have the precise words spoken by our Lord on this occasion. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26-27">Matthew 26:26-27</span>, the words in the Syriac version are, hanau pagree, This is my body, hanau demee, This is my blood, of which forms of speech the Greek is a verbal translation; nor would any man, even in the present day, speaking in the same language, use, among the people to whom it was vernacular, other terms than the above to express, This represents my body, and this represents my blood.</p>
<p>As to the ancient Syrian Church on the Malabar coast, it is a fact that it never held the doctrine of transubstantiation, nor does it appear that it was ever heard of in that Church till the year 1599, when Don Alexis Menezes, Archbishop of Goa, and the Jesuit Fransic Rez, invaded that Church, and by tricks, impostures, and the assistance of the heathen governors of Cochin, and other places, whom they gained over by bribes and presents, overthrew the whole of this ancient Church, and gave the oppressed people the rites, creeds, etc., of the papal Catholic Church in its place. Vid. La Croz. Hist. du Ch. des Indes.</p>
<p>This was done at the Synod of Diamper, which began its sessions at Agomale, June 20, 1599. The tricks of this unprincipled prelate, the tool of Pope Clement VIII., and Philip II., King of Portugal, are amply detailed by Mr. La Croze, in the work already quoted.</p>
<p>But this form of speech is common, even in our own language, though we have terms enow to fill up the ellipsis. Suppose a man entering into a museum, enriched with the remains of ancient Greek sculpture: his eyes are attracted by a number of curious busts; and, on inquiring what they are, he learns, this is Socrates, that Plato, a third Homer; others Hesiod, Horace, Virgil, Demosthenes, Cicero, Herodotus, Livy, Caesar, Nero, Vespasian, etc. Is he deceived by this information? Not at all: he knows well that the busts he sees are not the identical persons of those ancient philosophers, poets, orators, historians, and emperors, but only Representations of their persons in sculpture, between which and the originals there is as essential a difference as between a human body, instinct with all the principles of rational vitality, and a block of marble. When, therefore, Christ took up a piece of bread, brake it, and said, This IS my body, who, but the most stupid of mortals, could imagine that he was, at the same time, handling and breaking his own body! Would not any person, of plain common sense, see as great a difference between the man Christ Jesus, and the piece of bread, as between the block of marble and the philosopher it represented, in the case referred to above? The truth is, there is scarcely a more common form of speech in any language than, This IS, for, This Represents or Signifies. And as our Lord refers, in the whole of this transaction, to the ordinance of the passover, we may consider him as saying: "This bread is now my body, in that sense in which the paschal lamb has been my body hitherto; and this cup is my blood of the New Testament, in the same sense as the blood of bulls and goats has been my blood under the Old: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:0">Exodus 24:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:0">Hebrews 9:0</span>. That is, the paschal lamb and the sprinkling of blood represented my sacrifice to the present time this bread and this wine shall represent my body and blood through all future ages; therefore, Do this in remembrance of me."</p>
<p>St. Luke and St. Paul add a circumstance here which is not noticed either by St. Matthew or St. Mark. After, this is my body, the former adds, which is given for you; the latter, which is broken for you; the sense of which is: "As God has in his bountiful providence given you bread for the sustenance of your lives, so in his infinite grace he has given you my body to save your souls unto life eternal. But as this bread must be broken and masticated, in order to its becoming proper nourishment, so my body must be broken, i.e. crucified, for you, before it can be the bread of life to your souls. As, therefore, your life depends on the bread which God's bounty has provided for your bodies, so your eternal life depends on the sacrifice of my body on the cross for your souls." Besides, there is here an allusion to the offering of sacrifice - an innocent creature was brought to the altar of God, and its blood (the life of the beast) was poured out for, or in behalf of, the person who brought it. Thus Christ says, alluding to the sacrifice of the paschal lamb, This is my body, το υπερ υμων διδομενον, which Is Given in your stead, or in your behalf; a free Gift, from God's endless mercy, for the salvation of your souls. This is my body, το υπερ υμων κλωμενον, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span>), which is broken - sacrificed in your stead; as without the breaking (piercing) of the body, and spilling of the blood, there was no remission.</p>
<p>In this solemn transaction we must weigh every word, as there is none without its appropriate and deeply emphatic meaning. So it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>. Christ hath loved us, and given himself, υπερ ημων, on our account, or in our stead, an offering and a Sacrifice (θυσια) to God for a sweet-smelling savor; that, as in the sacrifice offered by Noah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:21">Genesis 8:21</span>, (to which the apostle evidently alludes), from which it is said, The Lord smelled a sweet savor, ריח הניחח riach hanichoach, a savor of rest, so that he became appeased towards the earth, and determined that there should no more be a flood to destroy it; in like manner, in the offering and sacrifice of Christ for us, God is appeased towards the human race, and has in consequence decreed that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. </p>
