<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:27">Matthew 26:27</span>. <i><b>And he took the cup</b></i> — μετα το δειπνησαι, <i>after having</i> <i>supped</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:25">1 Corinthians 11:25</span>. Whether the supper was on the <i>paschal lamb</i>, or whether it was a <i>common</i> or <i>ordinary meal</i>, I shall not wait here to inquire: see at the end of this chapter. In the parallel place, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:0">Luke 22:0</span>, we find our Lord taking the cup, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17">Luke 22:17</span>, and again <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>; by the former of which was probably meant the <i>cup of blessing</i>, כוס הברכה kos haberakah, which the master of a family took, and, after <i>blessing</i> God, gave to each of his guests by way of welcome: but this <i>second</i> taking the cup is to be understood as belonging to the very important rite which he was now instituting, and on which he lays a very remarkable stress. With respect to the <i>bread</i>, he had before simply said, <i>Take, eat, this is my body</i>; but concerning the <i>cup</i> he says, <i>Drink ye all of this</i>: for as this pointed out the very <i>essence</i> of the institution, viz. the <i>blood of atonement</i>, it was necessary that each should have a particular application of it; therefore he says, <i>Drink ye</i> ALL <i>of</i> THIS. By this we are taught that the <i>cup</i> is essential to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper; so that they who deny the <i>cup</i> to the <i>people</i> sin against God's institution; and they who receive not the cup are not partakers of the body and blood of Christ. If either could without mortal prejudice be omitted, it might be the <i>bread</i>; but the <i>cup</i>, as pointing out the blood poured out, i.e. the <i>life</i>, by which alone the great sacrificial act is performed, and remission of sins procured, is absolutely indispensable. On this ground it is demonstrable, that there is not a priest under heaven, who denies the cup to the people, that can be said to celebrate the Lord's Supper at all; nor is there one of their votaries that ever received the holy sacrament. All pretension to this is an absolute farce, so long as the <i>cup</i>, the emblem of the atoning blood, is denied. How strange is it, that the very men who plead so much for the bare <i>literal</i> meaning of <i>this is my body</i>, in the preceding verse, should deny all meaning to <i>drink</i> YE ALL <i>of this</i> <i>cup</i>, in this verse! And though Christ has in the most positive manner enjoined it, they will not permit one of the laity to taste it! O, what a thing is man - a constant contradiction to <i>reason</i> and to <i>himself</i>.</p>
<p>I have just said that our blessed Lord lays remarkable stress on the administration of the <i>cup</i>, and on <i>that</i> which himself assures us is <i>represented</i> by it. As it is peculiarly emphatic, I beg leave to set down the original text, which the critical reader will do well minutely to examine:</p>
<p>Τουτο γαρ εϚι ΤΟ αιμα μου ΤΟ της καινης διαθηκης, ΤΟ περι πολλων εκχυνομενον εις αφεσιν αμαρτιων.</p>
<p>The following literal translation and paraphrase do not exceed its meaning: -</p>
<p><i>For</i> THIS <i>is</i> THAT <i>blood of mine</i> which was pointed out by all the sacrifices under the Jewish law, and particularly by the shedding and sprinkling of the blood of the paschal lamb. THAT <i>blood</i> of the sacrifice slain for the ratification <i>of the new covenant</i>. THE <i>blood</i> ready to be <i>poured out for the multitudes</i>, the whole Gentile world as well as the Jews, <i>for the taking away of sins; sin</i>, whether original or actual, in all its <i>power</i> and <i>guilt</i>, in all its internal <i>energy</i> and <i>pollution</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And gave thanks</b></i> — See the <i>form</i> used on this occasion, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span>; and see the MISHNA, TRACT ברכות <i>Beracoth</i>.</p>
