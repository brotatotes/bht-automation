<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>. <i><b>For this is my blood of the New Testament</b></i> — This is the reading both here and in St. Mark; but St. Luke and St. Paul say, <i>This cup is the New Testament in my blood</i>. This passage has been strangely mistaken: by <i>New Testament</i>, many understand nothing more than the <i>book</i> commonly known by this name, containing the <i>four Gospels, Acts of the Apostles</i>, apostolical <i>Epistles</i>, and book of the <i>Revelation</i>; and they think that the <i>cup of the New</i> <i>Testament</i> means no more than merely that cup which the book called the New Testament enjoins in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. As this is the case, it is highly necessary that this term should be explained. The original, ηκαινηδιαθηκη, which we translate, <i>The New Testament</i>, and which is the general title of all the contents of the book already described, simply means, <i>the new</i> COVENANT. <i>Covenant</i>, from <i>con, together</i>, and <i>venio, I come</i>, signifies an agreement, contract, or compact, between two parties, by which both are mutually bound to do certain things, on certain conditions and penalties. It answers to the Hebrew <i>berith</i>, which often signifies, not only the <i>covenant</i> or <i>agreement</i>, but also the sacrifice which was slain on the occasion, by the blood of which the covenant was ratified; and the contracting parties professed to subject themselves to such a death as that of the victim, in case of violating their engagements. An oath of this kind, on slaying the covenant sacrifice, was usual in ancient times: so in Homer, when a covenant was made between the Greeks and the Trojans, and the throats of lambs were cut, and their blood poured out, the following form of <i>adjuration</i> was used by the contracting parties: - </p>
<p>In this place, our Lord terms his blood <i>the blood of the</i> NEW <i>covenant</i>; by which he means that grand plan of <i>agreement</i>, or <i>reconciliation</i>, which God was now establishing between himself and mankind, by the passion and death of his Son, through whom alone men could draw nigh to God; and this NEW <i>covenant</i> is mentioned in contradistinction from the OLD <i>covenant</i>, η παλαια διαθηκη, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:14">2 Corinthians 3:14</span>, by which appellative all the books of the Old Testament were distinguished, because they pointed out the way of reconciliation to God by the blood of the <i>various victims</i> slain under the law; but <i>now</i>, as the <i>Lamb of God, which taketh away the</i> <i>sin of the world</i>, was about to be offered up, a NEW and LIVING way was thereby constituted, so that no one henceforth could come unto the Father but by HIM. Hence all the books of the New Testament, which bear unanimous testimony to the doctrine of salvation by faith through the blood of Jesus, are termed, Η Καινη Διαθηκη, <i>The</i> NEW <i>covenant</i>. See the <i>Preface</i>.</p>
<p>Dr. Lightfoot's Observations on this are worthy of serious notice. "<i>This is my blood of the New Testament</i>. Not only the <i>seal</i> of the covenant, but the <i>sanction</i> of the new covenant. The end of the <i>Mosaic</i> economy, and the confirming of a <i>new</i> one. The confirmation of the <i>old</i> covenant was by the <i>blood of bulls and</i> <i>goats</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:0">Exodus 24:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:0">Hebrews 9:0</span>, because blood was still to be shed: the confirmation of the <i>new</i> was by a <i>cup of wine</i>, because under the new covenant there is no farther shedding of blood. As it is here said of the cup, <i>This cup is the New Testament in my blood</i>; so it might be said of the <i>cup of blood</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:0">Exodus 24:0</span>, <i>That cup was the Old</i> <i>Testament in the blood of Christ</i>: there, all the articles of that covenant being read over, <i>Moses</i> sprinkled all the people with blood, and said, <i>This is the blood of the covenant which God hath</i> <i>made with you</i>; and thus the <i>old</i> covenant or testimony was confirmed. ln like manner, <i>Christ</i>, having published all the articles of the <i>new</i> covenant, he takes the cup of wine, and gives them to drink, and saith. <i>This is the New Testament in my blood</i>; and thus the new covenant was established." - <i>Works</i>, vol. ii. p. 260.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is shed</b></i> (εκχυνομενον, <i>poured out</i>)<b> </b><i><b>for many</b></i> — εκχεω and εκχυω, <i>to pour out</i>, are often used in a <i>sacrificial</i> sense in the <i>Septuagint</i>, and signify to <i>pour</i> out or <i>sprinkle</i> the blood of the sacrifices before the altar of the Lord, by way of atonement. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+16:15">2 Kings 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+8:15">Leviticus 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+9:9">Leviticus 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:12">Exodus 29:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+4:7">Leviticus 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+4:14">Leviticus 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+4:17">Leviticus 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+4:30">Leviticus 4:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+4:34">Leviticus 4:34</span>; and in various other places. Our Lord, by this very remarkable mode of expression, teaches us that, as his body was to be broken or crucified, υπερ ημων, <i>in our stead</i>, so here the blood was to be poured out to make an <i>atonement</i>, as the words, <i>remission of sins</i>, sufficiently prove for <i>without shedding of blood there was no</i> <i>remission</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:22">Hebrews 9:22</span>, nor any remission by shedding of blood, but in a <i>sacrificial</i> way. See the passages above, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span>.</p>
<p>The whole of this passage will receive additional light when collated with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11-12">Isaiah 53:11-12</span>. <i>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify</i> MANY, <i>for he</i> <i>shall bear their iniquities - because he hath</i> POURED OUT <i>his soul</i> <i>unto death, and he bare the sin of</i> MANY. The <i>pouring out of the</i> <i>soul unto death</i>, in the prophet, answers to, <i>this is the blood of</i> <i>the new covenant which is poured out for you</i>, in the evangelists; and the רבים, <i>rabbim, multitudes</i>, in Isaiah, corresponds to the MANY, πολλων, of Matthew and Mark. The passage will soon appear plain, when we consider that <i>two</i> distinct classes of persons are mentioned by the prophet.</p>
<p>1. The Jews. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:4">Isaiah 53:4</span>. <i>Surely he hath borne</i> OUR <i>griefs, and carried</i> OUR <i>sorrows</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:5">Isaiah 53:5</span>. <i>But he was wounded for</i> OUR <i>transgressions, he was bruised for</i> OUR <i>iniquities, the chastisement of</i> OUR <i>peace was upon him</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:6">Isaiah 53:6</span>. <i>All</i> WE <i>like sheep have gone astray, and the Lord hath laid upon</i> <i>him the iniquity of</i> US <i>all</i>.</p>
<p>2. <i>The</i> GENTILES. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span>. <i>By his knowledge</i>, בדעתו bedaato, i.e. by his being <i>made</i> <i>known</i>, published as <i>Christ crucified</i> among the Gentiles, <i>he shall</i> <i>justify</i> רבים rabbim, the multitudes, (the GENTILES,) <i>for he</i> <i>shall</i> (also) <i>bear</i> THEIR <i>offences</i>, as well as OURS, <i>the Jews</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:4">Isaiah 53:4</span>, c.</p>
<p>It is well known that the Jewish dispensation, termed by the apostle as above, η παλαια διαθηκη, <i>the</i> OLD <i>covenant</i>, was <i>partial</i> and <i>exclusive</i>. None were particularly interested in it save the descendants of the twelve sons of Jacob: whereas the Christian dispensation, η καινη διαθηκη, <i>the</i> NEW <i>covenant</i>, referred to by our Lord in this place, was <i>universal</i> for as <i>Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death for</i> EVERY <i>man</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>, and is that <i>Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the</i> WORLD, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>, who <i>would have</i> ALL MEN <i>to be saved, and come to the knowledge of</i> <i>the truth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:1">Matthew 26:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4">Matthew 2:4</span>, even <i>that knowledge</i> of Christ crucified, by which they are to be <i>justified</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span>, therefore he has commanded his disciples to <i>go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to</i> EVERY CREATURE, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>. The reprobate race, those who were <i>no people</i>, and <i>not beloved</i>, were to be called in; for the Gospel was to be preached to <i>all</i> the <i>world</i>, though it was to <i>begin at Jerusalem</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:47">Luke 24:47</span>. For this purpose was the blood of the new covenant sacrifice poured out for the <i>multitudes</i>, that there might be but one fold, as there is but one Shepherd; and that God might be ALL and in ALL.</p>
<p><i><b>For the remission of sins.</b></i> — εις αφεσις αμαρτιων, <i>for</i> (or, <i>in</i> <i>reference to</i>) <i>the taking away of sins</i>. For, although the blood is shed, and the atonement made, no man's sins are taken away until, as a true penitent, he returns to God, and, feeling his utter incapacity to save himself, believes in Christ Jesus, who is the justifier of the ungodly.</p>
<p>The phrase, αφεσις των αμαρτιων, <i>remission of sins</i>, (frequently used by the Septuagint), being thus explained by our Lord, is often used by the evangelists and the apostles; and does not mean merely the <i>pardon of sins</i>, as it is generally understood, but the <i>removal</i> or <i>taking away</i> of sins; not only the <i>guilt</i>, but also the very <i>nature</i> of sin, and the <i>pollution</i> of the soul through it; and comprehends all that is generally understood by the terms <i>justification</i> and <i>sanctification</i>. For the use and meaning of the phrase αφεσιςαμαρτοων, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:4">Mark 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:77">Luke 1:77</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:3">Luke 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:47">Luke 24:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:43">Acts 10:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:38">Acts 13:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:14">Colossians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18">Hebrews 10:18</span>.</p>
<p>Both St. Luke and St. Paul add, that, after giving the bread, our Lord said, <i>Do this in remembrance of me</i>. And after giving the cup, St. Paul alone adds, <i>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in</i> <i>remembrance of me</i>. The account, as given by St. Paul, should be carefully followed, being fuller, and received, according to his own declaration, by especial revelation from God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span>, <i>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto</i> <i>you</i>, &amp;c. See the harmonized view above.</p>
