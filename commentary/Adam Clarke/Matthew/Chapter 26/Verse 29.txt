<p>Verse 29. <i><b>I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>vine</b></i> — These words seem to intimate no more than this: We shall not have another opportunity of eating this bread and drinking this wine together; as in a few hours my crucifixion shall take place.</p>
<p><i><b>Until that day when I drink it new with you</b></i> — That is, I shall no more drink of the produce of the vine with you; but shall drink <i>new</i> wine - wine of a widely different nature from this - a wine which the kingdom of God alone can afford. The term <i>new</i> in Scripture is often taken in this sense. So the NEW <i>heaven</i>, the NEW <i>earth</i>, the NEW <i>covenant</i>, the NEW <i>man </i>- mean a <i>heaven, earth, covenant, man</i>, of a very <i>different</i> nature from the former. It was our Lord's invariable custom to illustrate heavenly things by those of earth, and to make that which had <i>last</i> been the subject of conversation the means of doing it. Thus he uses <i>wine</i> here, of which they had lately drunk, and on which he had held the preceding discourse, to point out the supreme blessedness of the kingdom of God. But however pleasing and useful wine may be to the body and how helpful soever, as an ordinance of God. It may be to the soul in the holy sacrament; yet the wine of the kingdom, the spiritual enjoyments at the right hand of God, will be infinitely more precious and useful. From what our Lord says here, we learn that the sacrament of his supper is a <i>type</i> and a <i>pledge</i>, to genuine Christians, of the felicity they shall enjoy with Christ in the kingdom of glory.</p>
