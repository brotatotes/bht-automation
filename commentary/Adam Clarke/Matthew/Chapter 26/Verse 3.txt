<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:3">Matthew 26:3</span>. <i><b>Then assembled together the chief priests</b></i> — That is, during the two days that preceded the passover.</p>
<p><i><b>The high priest, who was called Caiaphas</b></i> — <i>Caiaphas</i> succeeded <i>Simon</i>, son of <i>Camith</i>, about A. D. 16, or, as Calmet thinks, 25. He married the daughter of <i>Annas</i>, who was joined with him in the priesthood. About <i>two</i> years after our Lord's crucifixion, Caiaphas and Pilate were both deposed by VITELLIUS, then governor of Syria, and afterwards emperor. Caiaphas, unable to bear this disgrace, and the stings of his conscience for the murder of Christ, killed himself about A. D. 35. See Joseph. Ant. b. xviii. c. 2-4.</p>
