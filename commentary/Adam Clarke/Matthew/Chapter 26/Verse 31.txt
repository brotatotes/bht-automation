<p>Verse 31. <i><b>All ye shall be offended</b></i> — Or rather, <i>Ye will all be</i> <i>stumbled </i>- παντες υμεις σκανδαλισθησεσθε - ye will all forsake me, and lose in a great measure your confidence in me.</p>
<p><i><b>This night</b></i> — The time of trial is just at hand.</p>
<p><i><b>I will smite the shepherd</b></i> — It will happen to you as to a flock of sheep, whose shepherd has been slain - the leader and guardian being removed, the whole flock shall be scattered, and be on the point of becoming a prey to ravenous beasts.</p>
