<p>Verse 32. <i><b>But after I am risen again</b></i> — Don't lose your confidence; for though I shall appear for a time to be wholly left to wicked men, and be brought under the power of death, yet I will rise again, and triumph over all <i>your</i> enemies and mine.</p>
<p><i><b>I will go before you</b></i> — Still alluding to the case of the shepherd and his sheep. Though the shepherd has been smitten and the sheep scattered, the shepherd shall revive again, collect the scattered flock, and <i>go before them</i>, and lead them to peace, security, and happiness.</p>
