<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Peter - said unto him, Though all men shall be</b></i><b> </b><i><b>offended </b></i><b>- yet </b><i><b>will I never</b></i> â€” The presumptuous person imagines he can do every thing, and can do nothing: thinks he can excel all, and excels in nothing: promises every thing, and performs nothing. The humble man acts a quite contrary part. There is nothing we know so little of as ourselves - nothing we see less of than our own weakness and poverty. The strength of pride is only for a moment. Peter, though vainly confident, was certainly sincere - he had never been put to a sore trial, and did not know his own strength. Had this resolution of his been formed in the strength of God, he would have been enabled to maintain it against earth and hell. This most awful denial of Christ, and his abandoning him in the time of trial, was sufficient to have disqualified him for ever from being, in any sense, <i>head of the Church</i>, had such a supremacy been ever designed him. Such a supremacy was never given him by Christ; but the <i>fable</i> of it is in the Church of Rome, and the mock Peter, not Peter the apostle, is there and there only to be found.</p>
