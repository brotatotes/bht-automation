<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Jesus said</b></i> â€” Our Lord's answer to Peter is very emphatic and impressive. <i>Verily </i>- I speak a solemn weighty truth, <i>thou wilt</i> not only be <i>stumbled, fall off</i>, and <i>forsake</i> thy Master, but thou wilt even <i>deny</i> that thou <i>hast</i>, or ever <i>had</i>, any <i>knowledge</i> of or <i>connection</i> with me; and this thou wilt do, not by <i>little</i> and <i>little</i>, through a <i>long process</i> of time, till the apostasy, daily gathering strength, shall be <i>complete</i>; but thou wilt do it <i>this very night</i>, and that not <i>once</i> only, but <i>thrice</i>; and this thou wilt do also in the <i>earlier</i> part of the night, <i>before</i> even a <i>cock</i> shall <i>crow</i>. Was not this warning enough to him not to trust in his own strength, but to depend on God?</p>
