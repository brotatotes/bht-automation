<p>Verse 36. <i><b>A place called Gethsemane</b></i> — A garden at the foot of the mount of Olives. The name seems to be formed from גת <i>gath, a</i> <i>press</i>, and סמן <i>shemen, oil</i>; probably the place where the produce of the mount of Olives was prepared for use. The garden of the oilpress, or olive-press.</p>
<p><i><b>Sit ye here</b></i> — Or, <i>stay</i> in this place, <i>while I go and pray</i> <i>yonder</i>: and employ ye the time as I shall employ it - in watching unto prayer.</p>
