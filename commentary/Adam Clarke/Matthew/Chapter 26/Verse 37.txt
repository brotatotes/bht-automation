Verse 37. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee — That is, James and John; the same persons who had beheld his transfiguration on the mount - that they might contemplate this agony in the light of that glory which they had there seen; and so be kept from being stumbled by a view of his present humiliation.Began to be sorrowful — λυπεισθαι, from λυω, to dissolve - exquisite sorrow, such as dissolves the natural vigour, and threatens to separate soul and body.And very heavy. — Overwhelmed with anguish - αδημονειν. This word is used by the Greeks to denote the most extreme anguish which the soul can feel-excruciating anxiety and torture of spirit.
