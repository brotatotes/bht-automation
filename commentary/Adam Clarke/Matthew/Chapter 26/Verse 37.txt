<p>Verse 37. <i><b>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Zebedee</b></i> — That is, James and John; the same persons who had beheld his transfiguration on the mount - that they might contemplate this agony in the light of that glory which they had there seen; and so be kept from being stumbled by a view of his present humiliation.</p>
<p><i><b>Began to be sorrowful</b></i> — λυπεισθαι, from λυω, <i>to</i> <i>dissolve </i>- exquisite sorrow, such as <i>dissolves</i> the natural vigour, and threatens to <i>separate</i> soul and body.</p>
<p><i><b>And very heavy.</b></i> — <i>Overwhelmed with anguish </i>- αδημονειν. This word is used by the Greeks to denote the <i>most extreme anguish</i> which the soul can feel-<i>excruciating anxiety and torture of spirit</i>.</p>
