<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Then saith he</b></i> — <i>Then saith - Jesus</i>: - I have added the word <i>Jesus</i>, ὁ Ιησους, on the authority of a multitude of eminent MSS. See them in <i>Griesbach</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>My soul is exceeding sorrowful</b></i>, (or, <i>is surrounded with</i> <i>exceeding sorrow</i>,)<b> </b><i><b>even unto death.</b></i> — This latter word explains the two former: My soul is so dissolved in sorrow, my spirit is filled with such agony and anguish, that, if speedy succour be not given to my <i>body</i>, death must be the speedy consequence.</p>
<p><i>Now</i>, the grand expiatory sacrifice begins to be offered: in this garden Jesus enters fully into the sacerdotal office; and now, on the altar of his immaculate divinity, begins to offer his own body - his own life - a lamb without spot, for the sin of the world. St. Luke observes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:43-44">Luke 22:43-44</span>, that there appeared unto him an angel from heaven strengthening him; and that, <i>being in an agony</i>, his <i>sweat was like great drops of blood falling to the ground</i>. How exquisite must this anguish have been, when it forced the very blood through the coats of the veins, and enlarged the pores in such a preternatural manner as to cause them to empty it out in large successive drops! In my opinion, the principal part of the redemption price was paid in this unprecedented and indescribable agony.</p>
<p><i>Bloody sweats</i> are mentioned by many authors; but none was ever such as this - where a person in <i>perfect health</i>, (having never had any <i>predisposing sickness</i> to induce a debility of the system,) and in the <i>full vigour of life</i>, about <i>thirty-three</i> years of age, suddenly, through mental pressure, <i>without any fear of death</i>, sweat great drops of blood; and these continued, during his wrestling with God to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>To say that all this was occasioned by the fear he had of the ignominious death which he was about to die confutes itself - for this would not only rob him of his divinity, for which purpose it is brought, but it deprives him of all excellency, and even of manhood itself. The prospect of death could not cause him to suffer thus, when he knew that in less than three days he was to be restored to life, and be brought into an eternity of blessedness. His agony and distress can receive no consistent explication but on this ground - <i>He</i> SUFFERED, <i>the</i> JUST <i>for the</i> UNJUST, <i>that he might</i> BRING <i>us to</i> GOD. O glorious truth! O infinitely meritorious suffering! And O! above all, the <i>eternal</i> <i>love</i>, that caused him to undergo such sufferings for the sake of SINNERS!</p>
