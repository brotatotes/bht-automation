<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Fell on his face</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:44">Luke 22:44</span>. This was the ordinary posture of the supplicant when the favour was great which was asked, and deep humiliation required. The head was put between the knees, and the forehead brought to touch the earth-this was not only a humiliating, but a very <i>painful</i> posture also.</p>
<p><i><b>This cup</b></i> — The word <i>cup</i> is frequently used in the Sacred Writings to point out <i>sorrow, anguish, terror, death</i>. It seems to be an allusion to a very ancient method of punishing criminals. A cup of poison was put into their hands, and they were obliged to drink it. Socrates was killed thus, being obliged by the magistrates of Athens to drink a cup of the juice of hemlock. To death, by the <i>poisoned cup</i>, there seems an allusion in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>, <i>Jesus Christ, by the grace of God</i>, TASTED <i>death for every man</i>. The whole world are here represented as standing guilty and condemned before the tribunal of God; into every man's hand the <i>deadly cup</i> is put, and he is required to drink off the poison-Jesus enters, takes every man's cup out of his hand, and drinks off the poison, and thus tastes or suffers the death which every man otherwise must have undergone.</p>
<p><i><b>Pass from me</b></i> — Perhaps there is an allusion here to several criminals standing in a row, who are all to drink of the same cup; but, the judge extending favour to a certain one, the <i>cup passes</i> <i>by him</i> to the next.</p>
<p>Instead of προελθων μικρον, <i>going a little forward</i>, many eminent MSS. have προσελθων, <i>coming a little forward</i>-but the <i>variation</i> is of little moment. At the close of this verse several MSS. add the clause in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:43">Luke 22:43</span>,</p>
<p><i>There appeared an angel</i>, &amp;c.</p>
