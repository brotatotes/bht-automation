Verse 40. He - saith unto Peter — He addressed himself more particularly to this apostle, because of the profession he had made, Matthew 26:33; as if he had said: "Is this the way you testify your affectionate attachment to me? Ye all said you were ready to die with me; what, then, cannot you watch ONE hour?"Instead of ουκ ισχυσατε, could YE not, the Codex Alexandrinus, the later Syriac in the margin, three of the Itala, and Juvencus, read ουκ ισχυσας, couldst THOU not - referring the reproach immediately to Peter, who had made the promises mentioned before.
