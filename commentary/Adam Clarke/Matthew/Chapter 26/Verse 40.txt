<p>Verse 40. <i><b>He - saith unto Peter</b></i> — He addressed himself more particularly to this apostle, because of the profession he had made, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:33">Matthew 26:33</span>; as if he had said: "Is this the way you testify your affectionate attachment to me? Ye all said you were ready to die with me; what, then, cannot you watch ONE <i>hour</i>?"</p>
<p>Instead of ουκ ισχυσατε, <i>could</i> YE <i>not</i>, the <i>Codex</i> <i>Alexandrinus</i>, the later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, three of the <i>Itala</i>, and <i>Juvencus</i>, read ουκ ισχυσας, <i>couldst</i> THOU <i>not </i>- referring the reproach immediately to <i>Peter</i>, who had made the promises mentioned before.</p>
