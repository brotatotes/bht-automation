<p>Verse 41. <i><b>That ye enter not into temptation</b></i> — If ye cannot endure a little fatigue when there is no suffering, how will ye do when the temptation, the great trial of your fidelity and courage, cometh? <i>Watch </i>- that ye be not taken unawares; and <i>pray </i>- that when it comes ye may be enabled to bear it.</p>
<p><i><b>The spirit </b></i><b>- is </b><i><b>willing, but the flesh</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>weak</b></i> — Your <i>inclinations</i> are <i>good </i>- ye are truly <i>sincere</i>; but your <i>good</i> <i>purposes</i> will be overpowered by your <i>timidity</i>. Ye wish to continue steadfast in your adherence to your Master; but your <i>fears</i> will lead you to desert him.</p>
