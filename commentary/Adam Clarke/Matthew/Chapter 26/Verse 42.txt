<p>Verse 42. <i><b>O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me</b></i> â€” <i>If it be not possible </i>- to redeem fallen man, <i>unless I drink this</i> <i>cup</i>, unless I suffer death for them; <i>thy will be done </i>- I am content to suffer whatever may be requisite to accomplish the great design. In this address the <i>humanity</i> of Christ most evidently appears; for it was his <i>humanity</i> alone that could <i>suffer</i>; and if it did not appear that he had <i>felt</i> these sufferings, it would have been a presumption that he had <i>not</i> suffered, and consequently made no <i>atonement</i>. And had he not appeared to have been perfectly <i>resigned</i> in these sufferings, his sacrifice could not have been a <i>free-will</i> but a <i>constrained</i> offering, and therefore of no use to the salvation of mankind.</p>
