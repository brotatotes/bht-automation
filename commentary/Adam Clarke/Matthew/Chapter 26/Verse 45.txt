<p>Verse 45. <i><b>Sleep on now, and take your rest</b></i> — Perhaps it might be better to read these words interrogatively, and paraphrase them thus: <i>Do ye sleep on still</i>? Will no warnings avail? Will no danger excite you to watchfulness and prayer? <i>My hour </i>- in which I am to be delivered up, is at <i>hand</i>; therefore now think of your own personal safety.</p>
<p><i><b>The Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</b></i> — αμαρτωλων, viz. the <i>Gentiles</i> or <i>heathens</i>, who were generally distinguished by this appellation from the Jews. Here it probably means the Roman cohort that was stationed on festivals for the defence of the temple. By the Romans he was adjudged to death; for the Jews acknowledged that they had no power in capital cases.
