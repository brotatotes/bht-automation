<p>Verse 47. <i><b>Judas, one of the twelve</b></i> — More deeply to mark his base ingratitude and desperate wickedness - HE <i>was</i> ONE <i>of the</i> TWELVE-and he is a TRAITOR, and one of the <i>vilest</i> too that ever disgraced human nature.</p>
<p><i><b>A great multitude with swords and staves</b></i> — They did not come as officers of justice, but as a desperate mob. <i>Justice</i> had nothing to do in this business. He who a little before had been one of the leaders of the flock of Christ is now become the leader of ruffians and murderers! What a terrible fall!</p>
