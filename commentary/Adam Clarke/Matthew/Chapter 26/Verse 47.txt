Verse 47. Judas, one of the twelve — More deeply to mark his base ingratitude and desperate wickedness - HE was ONE of the TWELVE-and he is a TRAITOR, and one of the vilest too that ever disgraced human nature.A great multitude with swords and staves — They did not come as officers of justice, but as a desperate mob. Justice had nothing to do in this business. He who a little before had been one of the leaders of the flock of Christ is now become the leader of ruffians and murderers! What a terrible fall!
