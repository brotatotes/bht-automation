<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Gave them a sign</b></i> — How <i>coolly deliberate</i> is this dire apostate! The man <i>whom I shall kiss </i>- how deeply <i>hypocritical</i>! That is he, <i>hold him fast, seize him </i>- how diabolically <i>malicious</i>!</p>
<p><i><b>Hail, Master</b></i> — A usual compliment among the Jews. Judas pretends to wish our Lord continued <i>health</i> while he is meditating his destruction! How many <i>compliments</i> of <i>this kind</i> are there in the world! Judas had a pattern in <i>Joab</i>, who, while he pretends to inquire tenderly for the health of <i>Amasa</i>, thrust him through with his sword; but the disciple here vastly outdoes his master, and through a motive, if possible, still more base. Let all those who use <i>unmeaning</i> or <i>insidious</i> compliments rank for ever with <i>Joab</i> and <i>Judas</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And kissed him.</b></i> — <i>And tenderly kissed him </i>- this is the proper meaning of the original word κατεφιλησεν, he <i>kissed</i> him <i>again</i> and <i>again</i>-still pretending the most affectionate attachment to him, though our Lord had before unmasked him.</p>
