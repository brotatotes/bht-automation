<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:5">Matthew 26:5</span>. <i><b>Not on the feast</b></i><b> day, </b><i><b>lest there be an uproar</b></i> â€” It was usual for the Jews to punish criminals at the public festivals; but in this case they were afraid of an insurrection, as our Lord had become very popular. The providence of God directed it thus, for the reason given in the preceding note.</p>
<p>He who observes a festival on motives purely <i>human</i> violates it in his heart, and is a <i>hypocrite</i> before God. It is likely they feared the <i>Galileans</i>, as being the countrymen of our Lord, more than they feared the people of Jerusalem.</p>
