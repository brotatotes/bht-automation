<p>Verse 51. <i><b>One of them which were with Jesus</b></i> — This was Peter-<i>struck a servant of the high priest's</i>, the servant's name was Malchus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>, and smote off his ear. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:51">Luke 22:51</span>, it is said, <i>Jesus touched and healed it</i>. Here was another miracle, and striking proof of the Divinity of Christ. Peter did not <i>cut</i> the ear, merely, <i>he cut it</i> OFF, αφειλεν. Now to heal it, Jesus must either take up the ear and put it on again, or else create a new one - either of these was a miracle, which nothing less than <i>unlimited power</i> could produce. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>.</p>
