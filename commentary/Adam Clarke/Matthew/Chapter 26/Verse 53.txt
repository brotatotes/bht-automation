<p>Verse 53. <i><b>More than twelve legions of angels?</b></i> — As if he had said, Instead of you <i>twelve</i>, one of whom is a traitor, my Father can give me more than <i>twelve legions of angels</i> to defend me. A legion, at different times, contained different numbers; 4,200, 5,000, and frequently 6,000 men; and from this saying, taking the latter number, which is the common rate, may we not - safely believe that the angels of God amount to more than 72,000?</p>
