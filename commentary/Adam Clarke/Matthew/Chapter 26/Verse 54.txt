<p>Verse 54. <i><b>But how then</b></i> â€” Had I such a defence - <i>shall the</i> <i>Scriptures be fulfilled</i>, which say, <i>that thus it must be</i>? That is, that I am to suffer and die for the sin of the world. Probably the Scriptures to which our Lord principally refers are <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:0">Psalms 22:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:0">Psalms 69:0</span>, and especially <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:0">Isaiah 53:0</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</span>. Christ shows that they had no power against him but what he <i>permitted</i>; and that he willingly gave up himself into their hands.</p>
