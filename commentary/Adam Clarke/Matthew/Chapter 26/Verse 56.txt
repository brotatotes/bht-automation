<p>Verse 56. <i><b>But all this was done</b></i> — This is probably the observation of the evangelist. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:23">Matthew 2:23</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</b></i> — O what is man! How little is even his utmost <i>sincerity</i> to be depended on! Jesus is abandoned by all! - even <i>zealous</i> Peter and <i>loving</i> John are among the fugitives! Was ever <i>master</i> so served by his <i>scholars</i>? Was ever <i>parent</i> so treated by his <i>children</i>? Is there not as much zeal and love among them all as might make one <i>martyr</i> for God and truth? Alas! no. He had but twelve who professed inviolable attachment to him; one of these betrayed him, another denied him with oaths, and the rest run away and utterly abandon him to his implacable enemies! Are there not found among his disciples still,</p>
<p>1st. Persons who betray him and his cause?</p>
<p>2dly. Persons who deny him and his people?</p>
<p>3dly. Persons who abandon him, his people, his cause, and his truth?</p>
<p>Reader! dost <i>thou</i> belong to any of these classes?</p>
