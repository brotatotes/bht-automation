<p>Verse 58. <i><b>Peter followed him afar off</b></i> — Poor Peter! this is the <i>beginning</i> of his dreadful fall. His <i>fear</i> kept him from <i>joining</i> the company, and publicly acknowledging his Lord; and his <i>affection</i> obliged him to follow at a <i>distance</i> that he might see the end.</p>
<p><i><b>And sat with the servants, to see the end.</b></i> — When a man is weak in faith, and can as yet only follow Christ at a distance, he should avoid all dangerous places, and the company of those who are most likely to prove a snare to him. Had not Peter got to the <i>high priest's palace</i>, and <i>sat down</i> with the <i>servants</i>, he would not thus have denied his Lord and Master.</p>
<p><i>Servants-officers</i>, υπηρετων. Such as we term serjeants, constables, &amp;c.</p>
