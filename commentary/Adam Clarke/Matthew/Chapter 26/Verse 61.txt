<p>Verse 61. <i><b>I am able to destroy the temple of God</b></i> â€”</p>
<p>1st. These words were not fairly quoted. Jesus had said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>, <i>Destroy this temple, and I will build it again in three days</i>.</p>
<p>2dly. The <i>inuendo</i> which they produce, applying these words to a pretended design to destroy the temple at <i>Jerusalem</i>, was utterly unfair; for these words <i>he spoke of the temple of his body</i>.</p>
<p>It is very easy, by means of a few small <i>alterations</i>, to render the most holy things and innocent persons odious to the world, and even to take away the life of the innocent.</p>
