Verse 64. Thou hast said â€” That is, I am the Christ, the promised Messiah, (Matthew 26:25; Matthew 26:25;) and you and this whole nation shall shortly have the fullest proof of it: for hereafter, in a few years, ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, fully invested with absolute dominion, and coming in the clouds of heaven, to execute judgment upon this wicked race. See Matthew 24:30. Our Lord appears to refer to Daniel 7:13: One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, &c. This may also refer to the final judgment.
