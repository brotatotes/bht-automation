<p>Verse 66. <i><b>He is guilty of death.</b></i> — ενοχος θανατου εστι, <i>he is</i> <i>liable to death</i>. All the <i>forms</i> of justice are here violated. The judge becomes a <i>party</i> and <i>accuser</i>, and proceeds to the verdict without examining whether all the prophecies concerning the Messiah, and the innumerable miracles which he wrought, did not justify him. <i>Examination</i> and <i>proof</i> are the ruin of all <i>calumnies,</i> and of the authors of them, and therefore they take care to keep off from these two things. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
