<p>Verse 67. <i><b>Then did they spit in his face</b></i> — This was done as a mark of the most profound contempt. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+16:10">Job 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+30:10">Job 30:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:6">Isaiah 50:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:1">Micah 5:1</span>. The judges now delivered him into the hands of the <i>mob</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And buffeted him</b></i> — Smote him with their fists, εκολαφισαν. This is the translation of Theophylact. κολαφιζειν, says he, means, "to beat with the hand, the <i>fingers being clenched</i>. συγκαμτομενων των δακτυλων, or, to speak more briefly, to buffet with the <i>fist</i>."</p>
<p><i><b>Smote</b></i><b> him </b><i><b>with the palms of their hands</b></i> — ερραπισαν. ραπιζω, says Suidas, means "παταξαι την γναθον απλη τη χειρι, <i>to smite the</i> <i>cheek with the open hand</i>." Thus they offered him <i>indignity</i> in all its various and vexatious forms. Insults of this kind are never forgiven by the world: Jesus not only takes no revenge, (though it be completely in his power,) but bears all with meekness, without even one word of reply.</p>
