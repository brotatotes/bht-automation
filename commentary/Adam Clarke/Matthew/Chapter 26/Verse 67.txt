Verse 67. Then did they spit in his face — This was done as a mark of the most profound contempt. See Job 16:10; Job 30:10; Isaiah 50:6; Micah 5:1. The judges now delivered him into the hands of the mob.And buffeted him — Smote him with their fists, εκολαφισαν. This is the translation of Theophylact. κολαφιζειν, says he, means, "to beat with the hand, the fingers being clenched. συγκαμτομενων των δακτυλων, or, to speak more briefly, to buffet with the fist."Smote him with the palms of their hands — ερραπισαν. ραπιζω, says Suidas, means "παταξαι την γναθον απλη τη χειρι, to smite the cheek with the open hand." Thus they offered him indignity in all its various and vexatious forms. Insults of this kind are never forgiven by the world: Jesus not only takes no revenge, (though it be completely in his power,) but bears all with meekness, without even one word of reply.
