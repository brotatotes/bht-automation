Verse 69. A damsel came unto him — A maid servant, παιδισκη. See this translation vindicated by Kypke.Thou also wast with Jesus — What a noble opportunity had Peter now to show his zeal for the insulted cause of truth, and his attachment to his Master. But, alas! he is shorn of his strength. Constables and maid servants are no company for an apostle, except when he is delivering to them the message of salvation. Evil communications corrupt good manners. Had Peter been in better company, he would not have had so foul a fall.
