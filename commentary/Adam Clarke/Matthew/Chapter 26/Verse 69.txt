<p>Verse 69. <i><b>A damsel came unto him</b></i> — <i>A maid servant</i>, παιδισκη. See this translation vindicated by <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou also wast with Jesus</b></i> — What a noble opportunity had Peter now to show his zeal for the insulted cause of truth, and his attachment to his Master. But, alas! he is shorn of his strength. <i>Constables</i> and <i>maid servants</i> are no company for an apostle, except when he is delivering to them the message of salvation. <i>Evil</i> <i>communications corrupt good manners</i>. Had Peter been in better company, he would not have had so foul a fall.</p>
