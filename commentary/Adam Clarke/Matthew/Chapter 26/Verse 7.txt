<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:7">Matthew 26:7</span>. <i><b>There came unto him a woman</b></i> â€” There is much contention among commentators about the transaction mentioned here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span>; some supposing them to be different, others to be the same.

At this, the woman poured the oil on the <i>head</i> of Christ; at the other, Mary anointed Christ's <i>feet</i> with it. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3- :">Mark 14:3- :</span></p>
