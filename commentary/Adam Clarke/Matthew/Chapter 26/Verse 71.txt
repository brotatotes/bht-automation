<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:71">Matthew 26:71</span>. <i><b>Unto them that were there</b></i> — Instead of λεγει τοις εκει. και, more than one hundred MSS., many of which are of the first authority and antiquity, have λεγει αυτοις. εκει και, <i>she</i> <i>saith unto them, this man was</i> THERE <i>also</i>. I rather think this is the genuine reading. τοις might have been easily mistaken for αυτοις, if the first syllable αυ were but a little <i>faded</i> in a MS. from which others were copied: and then the placing of the point after εκει. instead of after αυτοις. would naturally follow, as placed after τοις, it would make no sense. <i>Griesbach</i> approves of this reading.</p>
