Verse Matthew 26:71. Unto them that were there — Instead of λεγει τοις εκει. και, more than one hundred MSS., many of which are of the first authority and antiquity, have λεγει αυτοις. εκει και, she saith unto them, this man was THERE also. I rather think this is the genuine reading. τοις might have been easily mistaken for αυτοις, if the first syllable αυ were but a little faded in a MS. from which others were copied: and then the placing of the point after εκει. instead of after αυτοις. would naturally follow, as placed after τοις, it would make no sense. Griesbach approves of this reading.
