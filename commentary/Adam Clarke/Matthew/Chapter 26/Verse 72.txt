<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:72">Matthew 26:72</span>. <i><b>And again he denied with an oath</b></i> â€” This is a <i>third</i> gradation of his iniquity. He has told a <i>lie</i>, and he <i>swears</i> to support it. A liar has always some suspicion that his testimony is not credited, for he is conscious to his own falsity, and is therefore naturally led to support his assertions by oaths.</p>
