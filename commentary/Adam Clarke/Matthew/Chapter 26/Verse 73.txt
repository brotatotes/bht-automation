<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span>. <i><b>Thy speech</b></i> — <i>Thy manner of speech</i>, η λαλια σου, <i>that dialect of thine </i>- his <i>accent</i> being different from that of Jerusalem. From various examples given by <i>Lightfoot</i> and <i>Schoettgen</i>, we find that the Galileans had a very corrupt pronunciation, frequently interchanging ת ה א and ע, and so blending or dividing words as to render them unintelligible, or cause them to convey a contrary sense.</p>
<p><i><b>Bewrayeth thee.</b></i> — δηλου σε ποιει, <i>maketh thee manifest</i>, from the Anglo-saxon [Anglo-Saxon], to accuse, betray; a word long since lost from our language.</p>
