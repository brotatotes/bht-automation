<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:74">Matthew 26:74</span>. <i><b>Then began he to curse and to swear</b></i> — Rather, <i>Then he</i> <i>began positively to affirm </i>- καταθεματιζειν, from κατα intensive, and τιθημι, <i>I lay down, place, affirm</i>. But the common reading is καταναθεματιζειν, which signifies <i>to wish curses on himself</i>. The former reading is supported by almost <i>every</i> MS. <i>of value</i>, and is, beyond dispute, the <i>true reading</i>, and has been received by <i>Griesbach</i> into the text. The business is bad enough, but the common reading makes it worse. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:72">Matthew 26:72</span>, Peter is said to <i>deny with an oath</i>; here, he <i>positively affirms and swears</i>, probably <i>by the name of God</i>, for this is the import of the word ομνυειν. This makes the <i>fourth</i> and final <i>gradation</i> in the climax of Peter's fall. From these awful beginnings it is not unfair to conclude that Peter might have gone almost as far as Judas himself, had not the traitorous business been effected before. Yet all this evil sprung simply from the <i>fear of man</i>. How many denials of Christ and his truth have sprung since, from the same cause!</p>
<p><i><b>The cock crew</b></i> — This animal becomes, in the hand of God, the instrument of awaking the fallen apostle, at last, to a sense of his fall, danger, and duty. When abandoned of God, the <i>smallest</i> thing may become the occasion of a <i>fall</i>; and, when in the hand of God, the smallest matter may become the instrument of our <i>restoration</i>. Let us never think lightly of what are termed <i>little</i> <i>sins</i>: the smallest one has the seed of eternal ruin in it. Let us never think contemptibly of the <i>feeblest</i> means of grace: each may have the seed of eternal salvation in it. Let us ever remember that the great Apostle Peter fell through <i>fear of a servant maid</i>, and rose through the <i>crowing of a cock</i>.</p>
