<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:75">Matthew 26:75</span>. <i><b>Peter remembered the word of Jesus</b></i> — St. Luke says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span>, <i>The Lord turned and looked upon Peter</i>. So it appears he was nigh to our Lord, either at the time when the cock crew, or shortly after. The <i>delicacy</i> of this reproof was <i>great </i>- he must be <i>reproved</i> and <i>alarmed</i>, otherwise he will proceed <i>yet farther</i> in his iniquity; Christ is in bonds, and cannot <i>go</i> and <i>speak</i> to him; if he <i>call aloud</i>, the disciple is <i>discovered</i>, and falls a victim to Jewish <i>malice</i> and Roman <i>jealousy</i>; he therefore does the whole by a <i>look</i>. In the hand of Omnipotence every thing is <i>easy</i>, and he can save by a <i>few</i>, as well as by <i>many</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He went out</b></i> — He left the <i>place</i> where he had sinned, and the <i>company</i> which had been the <i>occasion</i> of his transgression.</p>
<p><i><b>And wept bitterly.</b></i> — Felt bitter anguish of soul, which evidenced itself by the tears of contrition which flowed plentifully from his eyes. Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall! Where the <i>mighty</i> have been slain, what shall support the <i>feeble</i>? Only the grace of the ALMIGHTY God.</p>
<p>This transaction is recorded by the inspired penmen,</p>
<p>1st. That all may watch unto prayer, and shun the occasions of sin.</p>
<p>2dly. That if a man be unhappily overtaken in a fault, he may not despair, but cast himself immediately with a contrite heart on the infinite tenderness and compassion of God. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:27">John 18:27</span>.</p>
<p>I have touched on the subject of our Lord's anointing but slightly in the preceding notes, because the controversy upon this point is not yet settled; and, except to harmonists, it is a matter of comparatively little importance. Bishop Newcome has written largely on this fact, and I insert an extract from his notes.</p>
