<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>. <i><b>When the morning was come</b></i> — As soon as it was light - <i>took counsel against Jesus</i>. They had begun this counsel the preceding evening, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:59">Matthew 26:59</span>. But as it was contrary to all forms of law to proceed against a person's life by <i>night</i>, they seem to have separated for a few hours, and then, at the break of day, came together again, pretending to conduct the business according to the forms of law.</p>
<p><i><b>To put him to death</b></i> — They had already determined his death, and pronounced the sentence of death on him; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:66">Matthew 26:66</span>. And now they assemble under the pretence of reconsidering the evidence, and deliberating on it, to give the greater appearance of justice to their conduct. They wished to make it appear that "they had taken ample time to consider of it, and, from the fullest conviction, by the most satisfactory and conclusive evidence, they had now delivered him into the hands of the Romans, to meet that death to which they had adjudged him."</p>
