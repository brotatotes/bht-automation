<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:16">Matthew 27:16</span>. <i><b>A notable prisoner - Barabbas.</b></i> — This person had, a short time before, raised an insurrection in Jerusalem, in which it appears, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:7">Mark 15:7</span>, some lives were lost. In some MSS., and in the <i>Armenian</i> and <i>Syriac Hieros</i>., this man has the surname of <i>Jesus</i>. Professor Birch has discovered this reading in a Vatican MS., written in 949, and numbered 354, in which is a marginal note which has been attributed to Anastasius, bishop of Antioch, and to <i>Chrysostom</i>, which asserts that in the most ancient MSS. the passage was as follows: - Τινα θελετε απο των δυω απολυσω υμιν, ΙΝ τον βαραββαν, η ΙΝ τον λεγομενον ΧΝ: <i>Which of the two</i> <i>DO ye wish me to release unto you, Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is</i> <i>called Christ</i>? As <i>Jesus</i>, or <i>Joshua</i>, was a very common name among the Jews, and as the name of the <i>father</i> was often joined to that of the son, as <i>Simon Barjonah</i>, Simon, son of Jonah; so it is probable it was the case here, <i>Jesus Barabba, Jesus</i>, son of <i>Abba</i>, or <i>Abbiah</i>. If this name were originally written as above, which I am inclined to believe, the general omission of JESUS in the MSS. may be accounted for from the over zealous scrupulosity of Christian copyists, who were unwilling that a <i>murderer</i> should, in the same verse, be honoured with the name of the <i>Redeemer of the</i> <i>world</i>.
