Verse Matthew 27:18. For envy — δια φθονον, through malice. Then it was his business, as an upright judge, to have dispersed this mob, and immediately released Jesus.Seeing malice is capable of putting even Christ himself to death, how careful should we be not to let the least spark of it harbour in our breast. Let it be remembered that malice as often originates from envy as it does from anger.
