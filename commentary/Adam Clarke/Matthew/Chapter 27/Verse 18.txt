<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:18">Matthew 27:18</span>. <i><b>For envy</b></i> — δια φθονον, <i>through malice</i>. Then it was his business, as an upright judge, to have dispersed this mob, and immediately released Jesus.</p>
<p>Seeing <i>malice</i> is capable of putting even Christ himself to death, how careful should we be not to let the least spark of it harbour in our breast. Let it be remembered that <i>malice</i> as often originates from <i>envy</i> as it does from <i>anger</i>.</p>
