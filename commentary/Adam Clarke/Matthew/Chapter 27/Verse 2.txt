<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:2">Matthew 27:2</span>. <i><b>They - delivered him to Pontius Pilate</b></i> â€” The Sanhedrin had the power of life and death in their own hands in every thing that concerned <i>religion</i>; but as they had not evidence to put Christ to death because of <i>false doctrine</i>, they wished to give countenance to their conduct by bringing in the <i>civil</i> power, and therefore they delivered him up to Pilate as one who aspired to regal dignities, and whom he must put to death, if he professed to be Caesar's friend. <i>Pontius Pilate</i> governed Judea ten years under the <i>Emperor Tiberius</i>; but, having exercised great cruelties against the Samaritans, they complained of him to the emperor, in consequence of which he was deposed, and sent in exile to <i>Vienna</i>, in <i>Dauphiny</i>, where he killed himself two years after.</p>
