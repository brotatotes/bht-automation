<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:21">Matthew 27:21</span>. <i><b>They said, Barabbas.</b></i> â€” What a fickle crowd! A little before they all hailed him as the <i>Son of David</i>, and acknowledged him as a gift from God; now they prefer a murderer to him! But this it appears they did at the instigation of the chief priests. We see here how dangerous wicked priests are in the Church of Christ; when pastors are corrupt, they are capable of inducing their flock to prefer <i>Barabbas</i> to <i>Jesus</i>, the <i>world</i> to <i>God</i>, and the <i>pleasures of sense</i> to the <i>salvation of their souls</i>. The invidious epithet which a certain statesman gave to the people at large was, in its utmost latitude, applicable to these Jews, - they were a SWINISH MULTITUDE.</p>
