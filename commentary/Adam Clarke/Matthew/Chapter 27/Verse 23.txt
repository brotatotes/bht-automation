<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:23">Matthew 27:23</span>. <i><b>What evil hath he done?</b></i> — Pilate plainly saw that there was nothing laid to his charge for which, consistently with the Roman laws, he could condemn him.</p>
<p><i><b>But they cried out the more</b></i> — What strange fury and injustice! They could not answer Pilate's question, <i>What evil hath he done</i>? He had done none, and they knew he had done none; but they are <i>determined</i> on his death.</p>
