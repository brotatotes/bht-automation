<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:25">Matthew 27:25</span>. <i><b>His blood be on us and on our children.</b></i> â€” If this man be <i>innocent</i>, and we put him to death as a <i>guilty</i> person, may the punishment due to such a crime be visited upon us, and upon our children after us! What a dreadful imprecation! and how literally fulfilled! The notes on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>, will show how they fell victims to their own imprecation, being visited with a series of calamities unexampled in the history of the world. They were visited with the same kind of punishment; for the Romans crucified them in such numbers when Jerusalem was taken, that there was found a deficiency of crosses for the condemned, and of places for the crosses. Their children or descendants have had the same curse entailed upon <i>them</i>, and continue to this day a proof of the innocence of Christ, the truth of his religion, and of the justice of God.</p>
