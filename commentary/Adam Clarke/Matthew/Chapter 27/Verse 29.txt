<p>Verse 29. <i><b>A crown of thorns</b></i> — στεφανον εξ ακανθων. It does not appear that this crown was intended to be an instrument of <i>punishment</i> or <i>torture</i> to his head, but rather to render him ridiculous; for which cause also they put a <i>reed</i> in his hand, by way of <i>sceptre</i>, and bowed their knees, pretending to do him homage. The crown was not probably of <i>thorns</i>, in our sense of the word: there are eminently learned men who think that the crown was formed of the herb <i>acanthus</i>; and Bishop Pearce and Michaelis are of this opinion. Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>, and John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:5">John 19:5</span>, term it, στεφανον ακανθινον, which may very well be translated an <i>acanthine crown</i> or wreath, formed out of the branches of the herb <i>acanthus</i>, or <i>bear's foot</i>. This, however, is a prickly plant, though nothing like <i>thorns</i>, in the common meaning of that word. Many Christians have gone astray in magnifying the sufferings of Christ from this circumstance; and painters, the worst of all commentators, frequently represent Christ with a crown of long thorns, which one standing by is striking into his head with a stick. These representations engender ideas both false and absurd.</p>
<p>There is a passage produced from <i>Philo</i> by Dr. <i>Lardner</i>, which casts much light on these indignities offered to our blessed Lord.</p>
<p>"<i>Caligula</i>, the successor of Tiberius, gave <i>Agrippa</i> the tetrarchy of his uncle Philip, with the right of wearing a <i>diadem</i> or <i>crown</i>. When he came to Alexandria, on his way to his tetrarchate, the inhabitants of that place, filled with envy at the thoughts of a Jew having the title of <i>king</i>, showed their indignation in the following way. They brought one <i>Carabus</i> (a sort of an idiot) into the theatre; and, having placed him on a lofty seat, that he might be seen by all, they put a diadem upon his head, made of the herb <i>byblos</i>, (the ancient <i>papyrus</i>, or <i>paper flag</i>;) his body they covered with a mat or carpet, instead of a royal cloak. One seeing a piece of reed, παπυρου (the stem, probably, of the aforesaid herb) lying on the ground, picked it up, and put it in his hand in place of a sceptre. Having thus given him a mock royal dress, several young fellows, with poles on their shoulders, came and stood on each side of him as his guards. Then there came people, some to pay their homage to him, some to ask justice, and some to consult him on affairs of state and the crowd that stood round about made a confused noise, crying, <i>Mario</i>, that being, as they say, the Syriac word for LORD; thereby showing that they intended to ridicule Agrippa, who was a Syrian." See PHILO, <i>Flace</i>. p. 970, and Dr. <i>Lardner</i>, Works, vol. i. p. 159.</p>
<p>There is the most remarkable coincidence between this account and that given by the evangelists; and the conjecture concerning the <i>acanthus</i> will probably find no inconsiderable support from the <i>bylos</i> and <i>papyrus</i> of Philo. This plant, Pliny says, grows to ten cubits long in the stem and the flowers were used <i>ad deos</i> <i>coronandos</i>, for CROWNING THE GODS. See Hist. Nat. lib. xiii. c. 11.</p>
<p>The reflections of pious Quesnel on these insults offered to our blessed Lord merit serious attention.</p>
<p>Let the crown of thorns make those Christians blush who throw away so much time, pains, and money, in beautifying and adorning a sinful head. Let the world do what it will to render the royalty and mysteries of Christ contemptible, it is my <i>glory</i> to serve a King thus <i>debased</i>; my <i>salvation</i>, to adore that which the world <i>despises</i>; and my <i>redemption</i>, to go unto God through the <i>merits</i> of him who was crowned <i>with thorns</i>."</p>
