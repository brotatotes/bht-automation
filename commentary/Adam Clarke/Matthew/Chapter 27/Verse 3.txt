<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:3">Matthew 27:3</span>. <i><b>Judas - when he saw that he was condemned, repented</b></i> â€” There is much of the wisdom and goodness of God to be seen in this part of Judas's conduct. Had our Lord been condemned to death on the evidence of one of his own disciples, it would have furnished infidels with a strong argument against Christ and the Christian religion. "One of his own disciples, knowing the whole imposture, declared it to the Jewish rulers, in consequence of which he was put to death as an impostor and deceiver." But the traitor, being stung with remorse, came and acknowledged his crime, and solemnly declared the innocence of his Master, threw back the money which <i>they</i> gave him to induce him to do this villainous act; and, to establish the evidence which he now gave against <i>them</i> and <i>himself</i>, in behalf of the <i>innocence</i> of Christ, hanged himself, or died through excessive grief and contrition. Thus the character of Christ was rescued from all reproach; infidelity deprived of the power to cry "imposture!" and the Jewish rulers overwhelmed with eternal infamy. If it should ever be said, "One who knew him best delivered him up as an impostor,"-to this it may be immediately answered, "The <i>same person</i>, struck with remorse, came and declared his own guilt, and Christ's innocence; <i>accused</i> and <i>convicted</i> the Jewish rulers, in the <i>open</i> council, of having <i>hired</i> him to do this iniquitous action, threw them back the bribe they had given him, and then hanged himself through distress and despair, concluding his iniquity in this business was <i>too great</i> to be <i>forgiven</i>." Let him who chooses, after this plenary evidence to the innocence of Christ, continue the objection, and cry out <i>imposture</i>! take heed that <i>he</i> go not and do LIKEWISE. Caiaphas, Pilate, and Judas have done so already, and I have known several, who have called Christ an impostor, who have <i>cut</i> their <i>own throats, shot, drowned</i>, or <i>hanged themselves</i>. God is a jealous God, and highly resents every thing that is done and said against that eternal truth that came to man through Jesus Christ, by the Holy Spirit. Indeed, there is one class of Deists, viz. those who are vicious in their lives, and virulent in their opposition to Christianity, who generally bring themselves to an untimely end.</p>
