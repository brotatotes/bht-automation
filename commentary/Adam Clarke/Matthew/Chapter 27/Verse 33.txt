<p>Verse 33. <i><b>A place called Golgotha</b></i> — From the Hebrew גלגתה or גלגלת, <i>golgoleth, a skull</i>, probably so called from the many skulls of these who had suffered crucifixion and other capital punishments scattered up and down in the place. It is the same as <i>Calvary</i>, Calvaria, i.e. <i>calvi capitis area</i>, the place of <i>bare</i> <i>skulls</i>. Some think the place was thus called, because it was in the <i>form</i> of a human skull. It is likely that it was the place of public execution, similar to the <i>Gemoniae Scalae</i> at Rome.</p>
