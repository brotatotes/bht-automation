<p>Verse 34. <i><b>They gave him vinegar - mingled with gall</b></i> — Perhaps χολη, commonly translated <i>gall</i>, signifies no more than <i>bitters</i> of any kind. It was a common custom to administer a stupefying potion compounded of sour wine, which is the same as vinegar, from the French <i>vinaigre</i>, frankincense, and myrrh, to condemned persons, to help to alleviate their sufferings, or so disturb their intellect that they might not be sensible of them. The rabbins say that they put a grain of frankincense into a cup of strong wine; and they ground this on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+31:6">Proverbs 31:6</span>: <i>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish</i>, i.e. who is condemned to death. Some person, out of kindness, appears to have administered this to our blessed Lord; but he, as in all other cases, determining to endure the fulness of pain, refused to take what was thus offered to him, choosing to tread the winepress <i>alone</i>. Instead of οξος, <i>vinegar</i>, several excellent MSS. and versions have οινον, <i>wine</i>; but as <i>sour wine</i> is said to have been a general drink of the common people and Roman soldiers, it being the same as vinegar, it is of little consequence which reading is here adopted. This custom of giving stupefying potions to condemned malefactors is alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+31:6">Proverbs 31:6</span>: <i>Give strong drink</i>, שקר shekar, inebriating drink, to <i>him who is</i> <i>ready to</i> PERISH, <i>and wine to him who is</i> BITTER <i>of soul </i>- because he is just going to suffer the punishment of death. And thus the rabbins, as we have seen above, understand it. See <i>Lightfoot</i> and <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>Michaelis offers an ingenious exposition of this place: "Immediately after Christ was fastened to the cross, they gave him, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>, <i>vinegar mingled with gall</i>; but, according to Mark, they offered him <i>wine mingled with myrrh</i>. That St. Mark's account is the right one is probable from this circumstance, that Christ refused to drink what was offered him, as appears from both evangelists. <i>Wine mixed with myrrh</i> was given to malefactors at the place of execution, to intoxicate them, and make them less sensible to pain. Christ, therefore, with great propriety, refused the aid of such remedies. But if vinegar was offered him, which was taken merely to assuage thirst, there could be no reason for his rejecting it. Besides, he tasted it before he rejected it; and therefore he must have found it different from that which, if offered to him, he was ready to receive. To solve this difficulty, we must suppose that the words used in the Hebrew Gospel of St. Matthew were such as agreed with the account given by St. Mark, and at the same time were capable of the construction which was put on them by St. Matthew's Greek translator. Suppose St. Matthew wrote חליא במרירא (<i>chaleea bemireera</i>) which signifies, <i>sweet wine with bitters</i>, or <i>sweet wine and myrrh</i>, as we find it in Mark; and Matthew's translator overlooked the <i>yod</i> י in חליא (<i>chaleea</i>) he took it for חלא (<i>chala</i>) which signifies <i>vinegar</i>; and <i>bitter</i>, he translated by χολη, as it is often used in the Septuagint. Nay, St. Matthew may have written חלא, and have still meant to express <i>sweet wine</i>; if so, the difference only consisted in the <i>points</i>; for the same word which, when pronounced <i>chale</i>, signifies <i>sweet</i>, denotes <i>vinegar</i>, as soon as it is pronounced <i>chala</i>."</p>
<p>With this conjecture Dr. Marsh (Michaelis's translator) is not satisfied; and therefore finds a Chaldee word for οινος <i>wine</i>, which may easily be mistaken for one that denotes οξος <i>vinegar</i>; and likewise a Chaldee word, which signifies σμυρνα, (<i>myrrh</i>,) which may be easily mistaken for one that denotes χολη, (<i>gall</i>.) "Now," says he, "חמר (<i>chamar</i>) or חמרא (<i>chamera</i>) really denotes οινος (<i>wine</i>,) and חמץ (<i>chamets</i>) or חמצא (<i>charnetsa</i>) really denotes οξος (<i>vinegar</i>.) Again, מורא (<i>mura</i>) really signifies σμυρνα (<i>myrrh</i>,) and מררא (<i>murera</i>) really signifies χολη (<i>gall</i>.) If, then, we suppose that the original Chaldee text was חמרא הליט במורא (<i>chamera heleet bemura</i>) <i>wine mingled with myrrh</i>, which is not at all improbable, as it is the reading of the Syriac version, at <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:23">Mark 15:23</span>, it might easily have been mistaken for חמצא הליט במררא (<i>chametsa haleet bemurera</i>) <i>vinegar mingled with gall</i>." This is a more ingenious conjecture than that of Michaelis. See Marsh's notes to Michaelis, vol. iii., part 2d. p. 127-28. But as that kind of <i>sour wine</i>, which was used by the Roman soldiers and common people, appears to have been termed οινος, and <i>vin aigre</i> is <i>sour wine</i>, it is not difficult to reconcile the two accounts, in what is most material to the facts here recorded.</p>
