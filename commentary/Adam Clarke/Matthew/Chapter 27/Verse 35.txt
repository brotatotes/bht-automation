<p>Verse 35. <i><b>And they crucified him</b></i> — Crucifixion properly means the act of nailing or tying to a cross. The cross was made of two beams, either crossing at the top at right angles, like a T, or in the middle of their length, like an X. There was, besides, a piece on the centre of the transverse beam, to which the accusation or statement of the crime of the culprit was attached, and a piece of wood which projected from the middle, on which the person <i>sat</i>, as on a sort of <i>saddle</i>; and by which the whole body was supported. <i>Tertullian</i> mentions this particularly: <i>Nobis</i>, says he, <i>tota crux imputatur, cum antenna scilicet sua, et cum illo</i> SEDILIS <i>excessu</i>. Advers. Nationes, lib. ii. <i>Justin Martyr</i>, in his dialogue with Trypho the Jew, gives precisely the same description of the cross; and it is worthy of observation that both he and <i>Tertullian</i> flourished before the punishment of the cross had been abolished. The cross on which our Lord suffered was of the former kind; being thus represented in all old monuments, coins, and crosses. St. Jerome compares it to a <i>bird</i> <i>flying</i>, a <i>man swimming</i>, or praying with his arms <i>extended</i>. The punishment of the cross was inflicted among the ancient Hindoos from time immemorial for various species of theft; see Halhead's Code of Gentoo Laws, p. 248, and was common among the Syrians, Egyptians, Persians, Africans, Greeks, and Romans: it is also still in use among the Chinese, who do not <i>nail</i>, but tie the criminal to it. It was probably the Romans who introduced it among the Jews. Before they became subject to the Romans, they used <i>hanging</i> or <i>gibbeting</i>, but not the <i>cross</i>. This punishment was the most dreadful of all others, both for the <i>shame</i> and <i>pain</i> of it: and so scandalous, that it was inflicted as the last mark of detestation upon the vilest of people. It was the punishment of robbers and murderers, provided they were <i>slaves</i>; but if they were <i>free</i>, it was thought too infamous a punishment for such, let their crimes be what they might.</p>
<p>The body of the criminal was fastened to the upright beam, by nailing or tying the feet to it, and on the transverse piece by nailing, and sometimes tying the hands to it. As the hands and feet are the grand instruments of motion, they are provided with a greater quantity of <i>nerves</i>; and the nerves in those places, especially the hands, are peculiarly sensible. Now, as the nerves are the instruments of all sensation or feeling, wounds in the parts where they abound must be peculiarly painful; especially when inflicted with such rude instruments as large nails, forced through the places by the violence of a hammer; thus tearing asunder the nervous fibrillae, delicate tendons, and small bones of those parts. This punishment will appear dreadful enough, when it is considered that the person was permitted to hang (the whole weight of his body being borne up by his nailed hands and the projecting piece which passed between the thighs) till he perished through agony and lack of food. Some, we are informed, have lived three whole days in this state. It is true that, in some cases, there was a kind of mercy shown to the sufferer, which will appear sufficiently horrid, when it is known that it consisted in breaking the bones of their legs and thighs to pieces with a large hammer, in order to put them the sooner out of pain! Such a <i>coup</i> <i>de grace</i> as this could only spring from those <i>tender mercies of</i> <i>the wicked</i> which God represents as <i>cruelty</i> itself. Some were permitted to hang on the cross till eaten up by birds of prey, which often began to tear them before life was extinct. <i>Horace</i> alludes to this punishment, and from what he says, it seems to have been inflicted on slaves, c., not on <i>trifling</i> occasions, but for the most <i>horrible</i> crimes. </p>
<p><i><b>And parted his garments, casting lots</b></i> — These were the Roman soldiers, who had crucified him: and it appears from this circumstance, that in those ancient times the spoils of the criminal were claimed by the executioners, as they are to the present day. It appears that they divided a part, and cast lots for the rest: viz. for his seamless coat, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:23-24">John 19:23-24</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>saying, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture</b></i><b> </b><i><b>did they cast lots.</b></i> — The whole of this quotation should be omitted, as making no part originally of the genuine text of <i>this</i> evangelist. It is omitted by almost every MS. of worth and importance, by almost all the versions, and the most reputable of the primitive fathers, who have written or commented on the place. The words are plainly an interpolation, borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:24">John 19:24</span>, in which place they will be properly noticed.</p>
