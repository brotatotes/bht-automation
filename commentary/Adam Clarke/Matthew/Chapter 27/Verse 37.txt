<p>Verse 37. <i><b>His accusation</b></i> — It was a common custom to affix a label to the cross, giving a statement of the crime for which the person suffered. This is still the case in China, when a person is crucified. Sometimes a person was employed to carry this before the criminal, while going to the place of punishment.</p>
<p>It is with much propriety that Matthew calls this αιτια, <i>accusation</i>; for it was false that ever Christ pretended to be KING OF THE JEWS, in the sense the inscription held forth: he was <i>accused</i> of this, but there was no proof of the accusation; however it was affixed to the cross. From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:21">John 19:21</span>, we find that the Jews wished this to be a little altered: Write, said they, that HE <i>said, l am king of the Jews</i>; thus endeavouring, by the addition of a vile lie, to countenance their own conduct in putting him to death. But this Pilate refused to do. Both Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:38">Luke 23:38</span>, and John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:20">John 19:20</span>, say that this accusation was written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. In those three languages, we may conceive the label to stand thus, according to the account given by St. John; the Hebrew being the mixed dialect then spoken. </p>
