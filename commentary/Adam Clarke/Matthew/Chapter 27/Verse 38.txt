<p>Verse 38. <i><b>Two thieves</b></i> — λησται, <i>robbers</i>, or cutthroats: men who had committed robbery and murder; for it does not appear that persons were crucified for robbery only. Thus was our Lord <i>numbered</i> (his name enrolled, placed as it were in the death warrant) <i>with transgressors</i>, according to the prophetic declaration, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span>; and the Jews placed him between these two, perhaps to intimate that he was the <i>worst</i> felon of the <i>three</i>.</p>
