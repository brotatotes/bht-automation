<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:4">Matthew 27:4</span>. <i><b>Innocent blood.</b></i> — αιμα αθωον, a Hebraism, for an <i>innocent man</i>. But instead of αθωον, <i>innocent</i>, two ancient MSS., <i>Syriac, Vulgate, Sahidic, Armenian</i>, and all the <i>Itala; Origen,</i> <i>Cyprian, Lucifer, Ambrose, Leo</i>, read δικαιον, <i>righteous</i>, or <i>just</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>What</b></i><b> is that </b><i><b>to us?</b></i> — What is it? - A great deal. You should immediately go and reverse the sentence you have pronounced, and liberate the innocent person. But this would have been <i>justice</i>, and that would have been a <i>stranger</i> at <i>their</i> tribunal.</p>
