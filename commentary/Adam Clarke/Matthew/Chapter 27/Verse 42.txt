Verse 42. He saved others; himself he cannot save. — Or, Cannot he save himself? Several MSS. read this with the mark of interrogation as above; and this makes the sarcasm still more keen.A high priest who designs to destroy the temple of God: a Saviour who saves not himself; and the Son of God crucified: these are the contradictions which give offence to Jews and libertines. But a high priest who dispels the types and shadows, only that he may disclose the substance of religion, and become the minister of a heavenly sanctuary; a Saviour who dies only to be the victim of salvation; and the Son of God who confines his power within the bounds of the cross to establish the righteousness of faith: this is what a Christian adores; this is the foundation of his hope, and the fountain of his present comfort and final blessedness. See Quesnel.We will believe him. — Instead of αυτω, him, many excellent MSS. have επ' αυτῳ, IN him: this is a reading which Griesbach and other eminent critics have adopted.
