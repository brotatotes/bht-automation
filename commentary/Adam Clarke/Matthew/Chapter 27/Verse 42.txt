<p>Verse 42. <i><b>He saved others; himself he cannot save.</b></i> — Or, <i>Cannot</i> <i>he save himself</i>? Several MSS. read this with the mark of <i>interrogation</i> as above; and this makes the sarcasm still more keen.</p>
<p>A <i>high priest</i> who designs to <i>destroy the temple of God: a</i> <i>Saviour</i> who saves not <i>himself</i>; and the <i>Son of God</i> crucified: these are the contradictions which give offence to Jews and libertines. But a <i>high priest</i> who dispels the <i>types</i> and <i>shadows</i>, only that he may disclose the substance of religion, and become the <i>minister</i> of a <i>heavenly sanctuary</i>; a <i>Saviour</i> who dies <i>only</i> to be the <i>victim</i> of salvation; and <i>the Son of God</i> who confines his power within the bounds of the cross to establish the <i>righteousness</i> of <i>faith</i>: this is what a Christian adores; this is the foundation of his hope, and the fountain of his present comfort and final blessedness. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>We will believe him.</b></i> — Instead of αυτω, <i>him</i>, many excellent MSS. have επ' αυτῳ, IN <i>him</i>: this is a reading which <i>Griesbach</i> and other eminent critics have adopted.</p>
