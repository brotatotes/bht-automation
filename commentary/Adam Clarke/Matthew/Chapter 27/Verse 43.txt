<p>Verse 43. <i><b>If he will have him</b></i> — Or, <i>if he delight in him </i>- ει θελει αυτον. The verbs θελω and εθελω, are used by the <i>Septuagint</i> in more than forty places for the Hebrew חפץ <i>chaphets</i>, which signifies, <i>earnestly to desire</i>, or <i>delight in</i>. Now as this is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:8">Psalms 22:8</span>, <i>He trusted in the Lord, that he would deliver him; let him deliver</i> <i>him</i>, (כי חפץ בו ki chaphets bo,) <i>for he</i> HATH DELIGHTED IN HIM: - ὁτι θελει αυτον, Sept. This will sufficiently vindicate the above translation; as the evangelist quotes the words from that version, with the simple change of ει, <i>if</i>, for ὁτι, <i>because</i>.</p>
