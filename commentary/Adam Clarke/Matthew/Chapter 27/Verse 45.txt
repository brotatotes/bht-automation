<p>Verse 45. <i><b>There was darkness over all the land</b></i> — I am of opinion that πασαν την γην does not mean all the world, but only the land of Judea. So the word is used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:25">Luke 4:25</span>, and in other places. Several eminent critics are of this opinion: <i>Beza</i> defends this meaning of the word, and translates the Greek, <i>super universam</i> REGIONEM <i>over the whole</i> COUNTRY. Besides, it is evident that the evangelists speak of things that happened in <i>Judea</i>, the place of their residence. It is plain enough there was a darkness in Jerusalem, and over all Judea; and probably over all the people among whom Christ had for more than three years preached the everlasting Gospel; and that this darkness was <i>supernatural</i> is evident from this, that it happened during the <i>passover</i>, which was celebrated only at the <i>full moon</i>, a time in which it was <i>impossible</i> for the sun to be <i>eclipsed</i>. But many suppose the darkness was over the <i>whole world</i>, and think there is sufficient evidence of this in ancient authors. PHLEGON and THALLUS, who flourished in the beginning of the <i>second</i> century, are supposed to speak of this. The former says: "In the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad, there was an extraordinary eclipse of the sun: at the sixth hour, the day was turned into dark night, so that the stars in heaven were seen; and there was an earthquake in <i>Bithynia</i>, which overthrew many houses in the city of <i>Nice</i>." This is the substance of what <i>Phlegon</i> is reputed to have said on this subject: - but</p>
<p>1. All the authors who quote him <i>differ</i>, and often very materially, in what they say was found in him.</p>
<p>2. <i>Phlegon</i> says nothing of <i>Judea</i>: what he says is, <i>that in such an Olympiad</i>, (some say the 102nd, others the 202nd,) <i>there was an eclipse in</i> <i>Bithynia, and an earthquake at Nice</i>.</p>
<p>3. <i>Phlegon</i> does not say that the <i>earthquake</i> happened at the <i>time</i> of the <i>eclipse</i>.</p>
<p>4. <i>Phlegon</i> does not intimate that this <i>darkness</i> was <i>extraordinary</i>, or that the eclipse happened at the <i>full of the moon</i>, or that it lasted <i>three hours</i>. These circumstances could not have been omitted by him, if he had known them.</p>
<p>5. <i>Phlegon</i> speaks merely of an <i>ordinary</i>, though perhaps total, eclipse of the sun, and cannot mean the <i>darkness</i> mentioned by the evangelists.</p>
<p>6. <i>Phlegon</i> speaks of an <i>eclipse</i> that happened in <i>some</i> year of the 102nd, or 202nd <i>Olympiad</i>; and therefore little stress can be laid on what he says as applying to this event.</p>
<p>The quotation from THALLUS, made by AFRICANUS, found in the Chronicle of SYNCELLUS, of the <i>eighth</i> century, is allowed by eminent critics to be of little importance. This speaks "of a darkness over all the world, and an earthquake which threw down many houses in Judea and in other parts of the earth." It may be necessary to observe, that THALLUS is quoted by several of the <i>ancient</i> ecclesiastical writers for <i>other</i> matters, but never for <i>this</i>; and that the time in which he lived is so very <i>uncertain</i>, that Dr. Lardner supposes there is room to think he lived rather <i>before</i> than <i>after</i> Christ.</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS the <i>Areopagite</i> is supposed to have mentioned this event in the most decided manner: for being at <i>Heliopolis</i> in Egypt, with his friend <i>Apollophanes</i>, when our Saviour suffered, they there saw a wonderful eclipse of the sun, whereupon Dionysius said to his friend, "Either God himself suffers, or sympathizes with the sufferer." It is enough to say of this <i>man</i>, that all the writings attributed to him are known to be <i>spurious</i>, and are proved to be <i>forgeries</i> of the <i>fifth</i> or <i>sixth</i> century. Whoever desires to see more on this subject, may consult Dr. Lardner, (vol. vii. p. 371, ed. 1788,) a man whose name should never be mentioned but with respect, notwithstanding the peculiarities of his religious creed; who has done more in the service of Divine revelation than most divines in Christendom; and who has raised a monument to the perpetuity of the Christian religion, which all the infidels in creation shall never be able to pull down or deface.</p>
<p>This miraculous darkness should have caused the enemies of Christ to understand that he was the <i>light</i> of the world, and that because they did not <i>walk in it</i> it was now <i>taken away</i> from them.</p>
