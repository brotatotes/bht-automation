<p>Verse 46. <i><b>My God! My God! why hast thou forsaken me!</b></i> — These words are quoted by our Lord from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:1">Psalms 22:1</span>; they are of very great importance, and should be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Some suppose "that the <i>divinity</i> had now <i>departed</i> from Christ, and that his <i>human nature</i> was left unsupported to bear the punishment due to men for their sins." But this is by no means to be admitted, as it would deprive his sacrifice of its <i>infinite</i> <i>merit</i>, and consequently leave the sin of the world without an atonement. Take <i>deity</i> away from any <i>redeeming act</i> of Christ, and <i>redemption</i> is ruined. Others imagine that our Lord spoke these words to the <i>Jews</i> only, to prove to them that he was the <i>Messiah</i>. "The Jews," say they, "believed this psalm to speak of the Messiah: they quoted the <i>eighth</i> verse of it against Christ - <i>He</i> <i>trusted in God that he would deliver him; let him deliver him,</i> <i>seeing he delighted in him</i>. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:43">Matthew 27:43</span>.) To which our Lord immediately answers, <i>My God! my God!</i> c, thus showing that he was the person of whom the psalmist prophesied." I have doubts concerning the propriety of this interpretation.</p>
<p>It has been asked, What language is it that our Lord spoke? <i>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani</i>. Some say it is <i>Hebrew </i>- others <i>Syriac</i>. I say, as the evangelists quote it, it is <i>neither</i>. St. Matthew comes nearest the <i>Hebrew</i>, אלי אלי למה עזבתני Eli, Eli, lamah <i>azabthani</i>, in the words, Ηλι, Ηλι, λαμα σαβαχθανι, <i>Eli, Eli, lama</i> <i>sabachthani</i>.</p>
<p>And St. Mark comes nearest the Syriac, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:34">Mark 15:34</span>, [Syriac] <i>Alohi, Alohi, l'mono shebachtheni</i>, in the words Ελωΐ, Ελωΐ, λαμμα σαβαχθανι, <i>Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani</i>. It is worthy of note, that a Hebrew MS. of the twelfth century, instead of עזבתני <i>azabthani, forsaken me</i>, reads שכחתני <i>shechachthani</i>, FORGOTTEN <i>me</i>. This word makes a very good sense, and comes nearer to the <i>sabachthani</i> of the evangelists. It may be observed also, that the words, <i>Why hast thou</i> FORGOTTEN <i>me</i>? are often used by David and others, in times of oppression and distress. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+42:9">Psalms 42:9</span>.</p>
<p>Some have taken occasion from these words to depreciate the character of our blessed Lord. "They are unworthy," say they, "of a man who suffers, <i>conscious of his innocence</i>, and argue imbecility, impatience, and despair." This is by no means fairly deducible from the passage. However, some think that the words, as they stand in the <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Syriac</i>, are capable of a translation which destroys all objections, and obviates every difficulty. The particle למה <i>lamah</i>, may be translated, <i>to what - to</i> <i>whom - to what kind or sort - to what purpose or profit</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:32">Genesis 25:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:29">Genesis 32:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:15">Genesis 33:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+9:29">Job 9:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+6:20">Jeremiah 6:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+20:18">Jeremiah 20:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+5:18">Amos 5:18</span>; and the verb עזב <i>azab</i> signifies <i>to leave - to deposit - to commit to</i> <i>the care of</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+39:6">Genesis 39:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+39:11">Job 39:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+10:14">Psalms 10:14</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+49:11">Jeremiah 49:11</span>. The words, taken in this way, might be thus translated: <i>My God! my</i> <i>God! to what sort</i> of persons <i>hast thou left me</i>? The words thus understood are rather to be referred to the wicked Jews than to our Lord, and are an exclamation indicative of the obstinate wickedness of his crucifiers, who <i>steeled</i> their hearts against every operation of the Spirit and power of God. See <i>Ling. Brit.</i> <i>Reform</i>. by B. Martin, p. 36.</p>
<p>Through the whole of the Sacred Writings, God is represented as <i>doing</i> those things which, in the course of his providence, he only <i>permits to be done</i>; therefore, the words, <i>to whom hast thou left</i> or <i>given me up</i>, are only a <i>form</i> of expression for, "How astonishing is the wickedness of those persons into whose hands I am fallen!" If this interpretation be admitted, it will free this celebrated passage from much embarrassment, and make it speak a sense consistent with itself, and with the dignity of the Son of God.</p>
<p>The words of St. Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:34">Mark 15:34</span>, agree pretty nearly with this translation of the Hebrew: Εις τι με εγκατιλεπες; <i>To what</i> [<i>sort</i> of persons, understood] <i>hast thou left me</i>? A literal translation of the passage in the Syriac Testament gives a similar sense: <i>Ad</i> <i>quid dereliquisti me</i>? "To what hast thou abandoned me?" And an ancient copy of the old Itala version, a Latin translation before the time of St. Jerome, renders the words thus: <i>Quare me in</i> <i>opprobrium dedisti</i>? "Why hast thou abandoned me to reproach?"</p>
<p>It may he objected, that this can never agree with the ινατι, <i>why</i>, of Matthew. To this it is answered, that ινατι must have here the same meaning as εις τι - as the translation of למה <i>lama</i>; and that, if the meaning be at all <i>different</i>, we must follow that evangelist who expresses most <i>literally</i> the meaning of the original: and let it be observed, that the Septuagint often translate למה by ινατι instead of εις τι, which evidently proves that it often had the same meaning. Of this criticism I say, <i>Valet quod valet</i>, Let it pass for no more than it is worth: the subject is difficult. But whatever may be thought of the above mode of interpretation, one thing is certain, viz. That the words could not be used by our Lord in the sense in which they are generally understood. This is sufficiently evident; for he well knew <i>why</i> he was come <i>unto that hour</i>; nor could <i>he</i> be <i>forsaken</i> of God, <i>in whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily</i>. The Deity, however, might restrain so much of its <i>consolatory</i> support as to leave the <i>human</i> nature fully <i>sensible</i> of all its sufferings, so that the consolations might not take off any part of the keen edge of his passion; and this was necessary to make his sufferings meritorious. And it is probable that this is all that is intended by our Lord's quotation from the twenty-second Psalm. Taken in this view, the words convey an unexceptionable sense, even in the common translation.</p>
