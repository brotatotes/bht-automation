<p>Verse 48. <i><b>Took a sponge</b></i> â€” This being the most convenient way to reach a liquid to his mouth; <i>tied it on a reed</i>, that they might be able to reach his lips with it. This reed, as we learn from St. John, was a stalk of <i>hyssop</i>, which, in that country, must have grown to a considerable magnitude. This appears also to have been done in <i>mercy</i>, to alleviate his sufferings. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>.</p>
