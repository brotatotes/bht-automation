<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span>. <i><b>In the temple</b></i> — ναος signifies, properly, the temple itself, into which none but the priests were permitted to enter; therefore εν τω ναω must signify, <i>near the temple</i>, by the temple door, where the boxes stood to receive the free-will offerings of the people, for the support and repairs of the sacred edifice. See this amply proved by <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hanged himself</b></i> — Or was <i>strangled </i>- απηγξατο. Some eminent critics believe that he was only <i>suffocated</i> by excessive grief, and thus they think the account here given will agree with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>. Mr. <i>Wakefield</i> supports this meaning of the word with great learning and ingenuity. I have my doubts - the old method of reconciling the two accounts appears to me quite plausible - <i>he went</i> <i>and strangled himself</i>, and the rope breaking, <i>he fell down</i>, and by the violence of the fall <i>his body was bursted</i>, and <i>his bowels</i> <i>gushed out</i>. I have thought proper, on a matter of such difficulty, to use the word <i>strangled</i>, as possessing a middle meaning between <i>choking</i> or <i>suffocation</i> by excessive grief, and <i>hanging</i>, as an act of suicide. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:4">Matthew 10:4</span>. Dr. Lightfoot is of opinion that the devil caught him up into the air, strangled him, and threw him down on the ground with violence, so that his body was burst, and his guts shed out! This was an ancient tradition.</p>
