<p>Verse 50. <i><b>Yielded up the ghost.</b></i> — αφηκε το πνευμα, <i>He dismissed</i> <i>the spirit</i>. He himself willingly gave up that life which it was impossible for man to take away. It is not said that he <i>hung</i> on the <i>cross till he died</i> through pain and agony; nor is it said that his <i>bones</i> were <i>broken</i>, the <i>sooner</i> to put him out of pain, and to <i>hasten</i> his death; but that himself <i>dismissed the soul</i>, that he might thus become, not a <i>forced</i> sacrifice, but a <i>free-will</i> <i>offering for sin</i>.</p>
<p>Now, as our English word <i>ghost</i>, from the Anglo-Saxon [Anglo-Saxon] <i>gast</i>, an <i>inmate, inhabitant, guest</i>, (a casual visitant,) also a <i>spirit</i>, is now restricted among us to the latter meaning, always signifying the <i>immortal spirit</i> or <i>soul</i> of man, the <i>guest</i> of the body and as <i>giving up the spirit, ghost</i>, or <i>soul</i>, is an act not proper to man, though <i>commending it to God</i>, in our last moments, is both an act of faith and piety; and as <i>giving up the</i> <i>ghost</i>, i.e. <i>dismissing his spirit</i> from his body, is attributed to Jesus Christ, to whom alone it is proper; I therefore object against its use in <i>every other case</i>.</p>
<p>Every man, since the fall, has not only been <i>liable</i> to death, but has <i>deserved</i> it; as all have forfeited their lives because of sin. Jesus Christ, as born immaculate, and having never sinned, had not <i>forfeited</i> his life, and therefore may be considered as naturally and properly immortal. <i>No man</i>, says he, <i>taketh</i> it, my life, <i>from me, but I lay it down of myself: I have power to lay it</i> <i>down, and I have power to take it again; therefore doth the Father</i> <i>love me, because I lay down my life that I</i> might <i>take it again</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17-18">John 10:17-18</span>. Hence we rightly translate <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:50">Matthew 27:50</span>, αφηκε το πνευμα, <i>he gave up the ghost</i>; i.e. <i>he dismissed his spirit</i>, that he <i>might die for the sin of the world</i>. The Evangelist St. John (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span>) makes use of an expression to the same import, which we translate in the same way: παρεδωκε το πνευμα, <i>he</i> <i>delivered up his spirit</i>. We translate <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:37">Mark 15:37</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>, <i>he gave up the ghost</i>, but not correctly, because the word in both these places is very different - εξεπνευσε, <i>he breathed his last</i>, or <i>expired</i>; though in the latter place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>, there is an equivalent expression - <i>O Father, into thy hands</i>, παρατιθεμαι το πνευμα μου, <i>I commit my spirit</i>; i.e. I place my soul in thy hand: proving that the act was <i>his own</i>; that no man could take his life away from him; that he did not die by the <i>perfidy</i> of his disciple, or the <i>malice</i> of the Jews, but by his <i>own free act</i>. Thus HE LAID DOWN <i>his life for the sheep</i>. Of Ananias and Sapphira, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:5">Acts 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:10">Acts 5:10</span>, and of Herod, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:23">Acts 12:23</span>, our translation says, they <i>gave up the ghost</i>; but the word in both places is εξεψυξε, which simply means to <i>breathe out</i>, to <i>expire</i>, or <i>die</i>: but in no case, either by the Septuagint in the Old, or any of the sacred writers in the <i>New Testament</i>, is αφηκε το πνευμα, or παρεδωκε το πνευμα, <i>he dismissed his spirit</i>, or <i>delivered up</i> <i>his spirit</i>, spoken of any person but Christ. Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, c., <i>breathed their last</i> Ananias, Sapphira, and Herod, <i>expired</i>; but none, Jesus Christ excepted, <i>gave up the</i> <i>ghost, dismissed</i>, or <i>delivered up his own spirit</i>, and was, consequently, <i>free among the dead</i>. Of the patriarchs, c., the Septuagint use the word εκλειπων, <i>failing</i> or κατεπαυσεν, he <i>ceased</i>, or <i>rested</i>.</p>
