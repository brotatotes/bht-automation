<p>Verse 51. <i><b>The veil of the temple was rent</b></i> â€” That is, the veil which separated the <i>holy place</i>, where the priests ministered, from the <i>holy</i> of <i>holies</i>, into which the high priest only entered, and that once a year, to make a general expiation for the sins of the people. This <i>rending</i> of the <i>veil</i> was <i>emblematical</i>, and pointed out that the separation between Jews and Gentiles was now abolished, and that the privilege of the high priest was now communicated to all mankind: ALL might henceforth have access to the throne of grace, through the one great atonement and mediator, the Lord Jesus.
