Verse 53. And came out of the graves after his resurrection — Not BEFORE, as some have thought, for Christ was himself the FIRST FRUITS of them who slept, 1 Corinthians 15:20. The graves were opened at his death, by the earthquake, and the bodies came out at his resurrection.And appeared unto many. — Thus establishing the truth of our Lord's resurrection in particular, and of the resurrection of the body in general, by many witnesses. Quesnel's reflections on these passages may be very useful."1. The veil being rent shows that his death is to put an end to the figurative worship, and to establish the true religion.2. The earthquake, that this dispensation of the Gospel is to make known through the earth the judgments of God against sin and sinners.3. The rocks being rent declare that the sacrifice of Christ is to make way for the grace of repentance.4. The graves being opened, that it is to destroy the death of sin, and confer the life grace on sinners.5. The rising of the bodies of the saints shows that this death of Christ is to merit, and his Gospel publish, the eternal happiness of body and soul for all that believe in his name."It is difficult to account for the transaction mentioned Matthew 27:52-53. Some have thought that these two verses have been introduced into the text of Matthew from the gospel of the Nazarenes; others think that the simple meaning is this: - by the earthquake several bodies that had been buried were thrown up and exposed to view, and continued above ground till after Christ's resurrection, and were seen by many persons in the city. Why the graves should be opened on Friday, and the bodies not be raised to life till the following Sunday, is difficult to be conceived. The place is extremely obscure.
