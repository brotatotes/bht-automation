<p>Verse 55. <i><b>Many women</b></i> — To their everlasting honour, these women evidenced more <i>courage</i>, and <i>affectionate attachment</i> to their Lord and Master, than the disciples did, who had promised to <i>die</i> with him rather than forsake him.</p>
<p><i><b>Beholding afar off</b></i> — <i>At a distance </i>- απο μακροθεν. Though this expression may be understood to refer, rather to the distance from which they came, (viz. from Galilee,) than the <i>distance they stood</i> <i>from the cross</i>; yet, as all malefactors were crucified <i>naked</i>, perhaps this may account for the <i>distance</i> at which these modest women stood.</p>
