Verse 56. Mary Magdalene — She probably had her name from Magdala, a village or district in Lower Galilee. See Matthew 15:39. Some think she was called Magdalene from מגדלא magdala, which signifies a plaiter of hair. See Lightfoot.Mary the mother of James — She was mother of him called James the lesser, or junior, who was son of Alpheus or Cleopas - see Matthew 10:3; Mark 15:40; John 19:25; and she was sister to the holy virgin. Thus it appears that there were four remarkable Marys mentioned in the Gospels.1. MARY the Virgin, wife of JOSEPH.2. MARY SALOME, her sister, wife of Cleopas, John 19:25.3. MARY MAGDALENE, or MARY of Magdala; and,4. MARY, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, John 11:1.Though Baronius asserts, and Lightfoot is of the same opinion, that Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, was one and the same person. It is difficult to ascertain and distinguish these women where their names occur in the Gospels, so many being called by the name of Mary.Joses — Several MSS. and versions read Joseph.
