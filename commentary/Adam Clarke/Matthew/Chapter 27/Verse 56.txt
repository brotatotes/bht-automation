<p>Verse 56. <i><b>Mary Magdalene</b></i> — She probably had her name from <i>Magdala</i>, a village or district in Lower Galilee. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:39">Matthew 15:39</span>. Some think she was called Magdalene from מגדלא <i>magdala</i>, which signifies a <i>plaiter of hair</i>. See Lightfoot.</p>
<p><i><b>Mary the mother of James</b></i> — She was mother of him called <i>James</i> <i>the lesser</i>, or junior, who was son of Alpheus or Cleopas - see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span>; and she was sister to the holy virgin. Thus it appears that there were four remarkable <i>Marys</i> mentioned in the Gospels.</p>
<p>1. MARY the <i>Virgin</i>, wife of JOSEPH.</p>
<p>2. MARY SALOME, her sister, wife of <i>Cleopas</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span>.</p>
<p>3. MARY MAGDALENE, or MARY of <i>Magdala</i>; and,</p>
<p>4. MARY, the sister of <i>Martha</i> and <i>Lazarus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:1">John 11:1</span>.</p>
<p>Though Baronius asserts, and Lightfoot is of the same opinion, that Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, was one and the same person. It is difficult to ascertain and distinguish these women where their names occur in the Gospels, so many being called by the name of <i>Mary</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Joses</b></i> — Several MSS. and versions read <i>Joseph</i>.</p>
