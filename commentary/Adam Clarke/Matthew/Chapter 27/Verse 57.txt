<p>Verse 57. <i><b>When the even</b></i> — This must have been about three o'clock, or a little after; for our Lord having expired about <i>three o'clock</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>, and the Jewish passover beginning about <i>four</i>, it was necessary that Joseph, who would not fail to eat the passover at the usual time, should have obtained and buried the body of Christ some time before four o'clock. But such was the general consternation, occasioned by the prodigies that took place on this most awful occasion, that we may safely conjecture that nothing was done in <i>order</i>, and perhaps the passover itself was not eaten at the usual hour, if at all, that day. See at the end of the preceding chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>A rich man</b></i> — He was a counsellor of the great Sanhedrin, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:50">Luke 23:50</span>; and, from the accounts given of him by the evangelists we learn that he was a man of the greatest respectability. He now acted a more honourable part than all the disciples of our Lord. He was of <i>Arimathea</i>, or <i>Rama</i>, in the tribe of Benjamin, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:18">Matthew 2:18</span>, but lived ordinarily in Jerusalem, as being a member of the great council.</p>
