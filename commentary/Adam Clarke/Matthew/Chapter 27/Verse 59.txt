<p>Verse 59. <i><b>Wrapped it in a clean linen cloth</b></i> â€” The Jews, as well as the Egyptians, added spices to keep the body from putrefaction, and the linen was wrapped about every part to keep the aromatics in contact with the flesh. From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39-40">John 19:39-40</span>, we learn that a mixture of myrrh and aloes of one hundred pounds' weight had been applied to the body of Jesus when he was buried. And that a second embalmment was intended, we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:56">Luke 23:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>, as the hurry to get the body interred before the Sabbath did not permit them to complete, the embalming in the first instance. See an account of the mode of embalming among the Egyptians, in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+50:2">Genesis 50:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+50:26">Genesis 50:26</span>.</p>
