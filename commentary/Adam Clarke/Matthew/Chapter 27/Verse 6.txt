<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:6">Matthew 27:6</span>. <i><b>The treasury</b></i> — κορβαναν - the place whither the people brought their free-will offerings for the service of the temple, so called from the Hebrew קרבן <i>korban</i>, AN OFFERING, from קרב <i>karab, he drew nigh</i>, because the person who brought the gift <i>came</i> <i>nigh</i> to that place where God manifested his glory between the cherubim, over the mercy-seat in the most holy place. It is from this idea that the phrase <i>to draw nigh to God</i> is taken, which is so frequently used in the sacred writings.</p>
<p><i><b>Because it is the price of blood.</b></i> — "What hypocrites, as one justly exclaims, to adjudge an innocent man to death, and break the eternal laws of <i>justice</i> and <i>mercy</i> without scruple, and to be, at the same time, so very nice in their attention to a <i>ceremonial</i> direction of the law of Moses! Thus it is that the devil often deludes many, even among the <i>priests</i>, by a false and superstitious tenderness or conscience in things indifferent, while calumny, envy, oppression of the innocent, and a conformity to the world, give them no manner of trouble or disturbance." See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
