<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:60">Matthew 27:60</span>. <i><b>Laid it in his own new tomb</b></i> — To all human appearance the body of Christ must have had the same burial-place with those of the two robbers, as he was numbered with the <i>transgressors</i>, and suffered with them; for <i>then</i> he was a sacrifice, bearing the sin of the world in his own body on the tree; but now the sacrifice is offered, the atonement made and accepted, he is no longer to be <i>enrolled</i> with the <i>transgressors</i>, and, according to a prophecy delivered nearly seven hundred years before that time, he is to have the burying-place of a rich man. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9-10">Isaiah 53:9-10</span>. Had our Lord been buried in the common burial-ground of the malefactors, his resurrection could not have been so distinctly remarked, as the chief priests would never have thought of sealing the stone there, or setting a watch; but now that the body is got into the hands of a friend, they judge it necessary to make use of these precautions, in order, as they said, to prevent imposture; and from this very circumstance the resurrection of Christ had its fullest evidence, and was put beyond the power of successful contradiction. What a number of objections would not human <i>prudence</i> have made to Joseph's conduct, had he consulted it on this occasion! It would have represented to him that, "this was to expose himself, to bring himself into trouble, to render himself suspected, to put himself out of all capacity of doing good, to ruin himself irrecoverably; and now it could do no good to his teacher - he is now <i>dead</i>, and needs no longer any office of kindness from men." There is, sometimes in our whole life, but <i>one</i> opportunity in which God designs <i>signally</i> to employ us; and, through our general backwardness to every good work, we are for reserving ourselves to other opportunities, in which God neither <i>requires</i> nor will <i>accept</i> our services.</p>
<p><i><b>Rolled a great stone to the door</b></i> — Some are of opinion that this tomb was cut down into the rock, perpendicularly from the surface; and that the great stone spoken of here covered over the entrance to it. The stone, no doubt, was intended to secure the place as much as possible.</p>
