<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:62">Matthew 27:62</span>. <i><b>The next day</b></i> — This was the <i>seventh</i>, or <i>Saturday</i>, and might be what we should term the evening of the <i>sixth</i>, or <i>Friday</i>, because the Jews always ended their day when the sun set, and then began the next.</p>
<p><i><b>That followed the day of the preparation</b></i> — That is, of the <i>Sabbath</i>. The victuals, c., which were to be used on the Sabbath by the Jews, were always <i>prepared</i> the preceding evening before the sun set. It is of this <i>preparation</i> that the evangelist speaks here and it is the same which is mentioned by Mark, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:42">Mark 15:42</span>; by Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:54">Luke 23:54</span>; and by John, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31">John 19:31</span>. But there was another preparation which happened in the same day: viz. The preparation of the passover; this began about twelve o'clock, and continued till four, the time in which they ate the paschal lamb. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span>.</p>
