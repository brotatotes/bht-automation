<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:63">Matthew 27:63</span>. <i><b>Sir, we remember</b></i>, c.] While these wicked men are fulfilling their own vicious counsels, they are subserving the great cause of Christianity. Every thing depended on the resurrection of Christ if it did not appear that he rose from the dead, then the whole system was false, and no atonement was made. It was necessary therefore that the chief priests, c., should make use of every precaution to prevent an imposture, that the resurrection of Christ might have the fullest evidence to support it. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:60">Matthew 27:60</span>.</p>
<p>The word Κυριε is here very properly translated <i>sir</i>, which, in many other places, is as improperly translated <i>Lord</i>. When a Roman is the speaker, or the person addressed, Κυριε should always be translated <i>sir</i> when strangers address our Lord, the word is a title of civil respect, and should, in general, be translated in the same way.</p>
<p><i><b>After three days I will rise again.</b></i> — This they probably took from his saying, <i>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will</i> <i>build it up</i>. If so, they destroyed, by their own words, the false accusation they brought against him to put him to death; <i>then</i> they <i>perverted</i> the meaning, <i>now</i> they <i>declare</i> it. Thus the wise are taken in their own craftiness. Neither the devil nor his servants ever speak truth, but when they expect to accomplish some bad purpose by it.</p>
