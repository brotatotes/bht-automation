<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:66">Matthew 27:66</span>. <i><b>Made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and</b></i><b> </b><i><b>setting a watch.</b></i> — Or rather, <i>made the tomb secure by the guard,</i> <i>and by sealing the stone</i>. I follow <i>Kypke</i>, in construing μετα της κουστωδιας, with ησφαλισαντο. The <i>guard</i> was to take care that the disciples should not steal him away; and the <i>seal</i>, which was probably the seal of the governor, was to prevent the guards from being corrupted so as to permit the theft. So every thing was done which human policy and prudence could, to prevent a resurrection, which these very precautions had the most direct tendency to authenticate and establish. How wonderful are the wisdom and goodness of God! - and how true is it, <i>that there is</i> <i>neither might nor counsel against him</i>!</p>
<p>1. The <i>death</i> of Christ was ordered, so as to be witnessed by <i>thousands</i>; and if his resurrection take place, it must be <i>demonstrated</i>; and it cannot take place without being <i>incontestable</i>, such are the <i>precautions</i> used here to prevent all <i>imposture</i>.</p>
<p>2. The more the circumstances of the death of Christ are examined, the more astonishing the whole will appear. The death is uncommon - the person uncommon - and the object uncommon; and the whole is grand, majestic, and awful. Nature itself is thrown into unusual action, and by means and causes wholly supernatural. In every part, the finger of God most evidently appears.</p>
<p>3. How glorious does Christ appear in his death! Were it not for his thirst, his exclamation on the cross, and the piercing of his side, we should have found it difficult to believe that such a person could ever have entered the empire of death; but the <i>divinity</i> and the <i>manhood</i> equally appear, and thus the certainty of the atonement is indubitably established.</p>
<p>4. But who can reflect on the state of the poor disciples, during the whole of the time in which our blessed Lord lay under the empire of death, without sharing their sorrows! When he expired on the cross their expectation was cut off; and when his body was laid in the grave their hopes were buried; and nothing but the resurrection of Christ from the dead could have given a resurrection to their hopes. It is true they had heard him say that he would rise again the third day; but in this it is evident their faith was very imperfect; and the uncertainty, perplexity, anxiety, and distress which they in consequence must have suffered, can neither be described nor imagined. Though <i>we</i> know the glorious result, yet who can help sympathizing with the pious father, the virgin mother, and the disconsolate disciples!</p>
