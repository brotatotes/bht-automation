<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:7">Matthew 27:7</span>. <i><b>To bury strangers in.</b></i> — τοις ξενοις, <i>the strangers</i>, probably meaning, as some learned men conjecture, the <i>Jewish</i> strangers who might have come to Jerusalem, either to worship, or on some other business, and died there during their stay. See here, the very money for which the blessed Jesus was sold becomes subservient to the purpose of <i>mercy</i> and <i>kindness</i>! The <i>bodies</i> of <i>strangers</i> have a place of <i>rest</i> in the field purchased by the <i>price</i> at which his <i>life</i> was valued, and the <i>souls</i> of strangers and foreigners have a place of <i>rest</i> and <i>refuge</i> in his blood which was shed as a ransom price for the salvation of the whole world.</p>
