<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:9">Matthew 27:9</span>. <i><b>Jeremy the prophet</b></i> — The words quoted here are not found in the Prophet <i>Jeremiah</i>, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:13">Zechariah 11:13</span>. But St. Jerome says that a Hebrew of the sect of the Nazarenes showed him this prophecy in a Hebrew apocryphal copy of Jeremiah; but probably they were <i>inserted</i> there only to countenance the quotation here.</p>
<p>One of Colbert's, a MS. of the eleventh century, has ζαξαριου, <i>Zechariah</i>; so has the later Syriac in the margin, and a copy of the Arabic quoted by <i>Bengel</i>. In a very elegant and correct MS. of the Vulgate, in my possession, written in the fourteenth century, <i>Zachariam</i> is in the margin, and <i>Jeremiam</i> in the text, but the former is written by a later hand. <i>Jeremiah</i> is wanting in two MSS., the <i>Syriac</i>, later <i>Persic</i>, two of the <i>Itala</i>, and in some other Latin copies. It is very likely that the original reading was δια τοι προφητου, and the name of no prophet mentioned. This is the more likely, as Matthew often omits the name of the prophet in his quotations. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22">Matthew 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:5">Matthew 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:15">Matthew 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:35">Matthew 13:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:4">Matthew 21:4</span>. Bengel approves of the omission.</p>
<p>It was an ancient custom among the Jews, says Dr. Lightfoot, to divide the Old Testament into three parts: the first beginning with the law was called THE LAW; the second beginning with the Psalms was called THE PSALMS; the third beginning with the prophet in question was called JEREMIAH: thus, then, the writings of Zechariah and the other prophets being included in that <i>division</i> that began with <i>Jeremiah</i>, all quotations from it would go under the name of this prophet. If this be admitted, it solves the difficulty at once. Dr. Lightfoot quotes <i>Baba Bathra</i>, and Rabbi David Kimchi's preface to the prophet Jeremiah, as his authorities; and insists that the word <i>Jeremiah</i> is perfectly correct as standing at the head of that division from which the evangelist quoted, and which gave its denomination to all the rest. But <i>Jeremiah</i> is the reading in several MSS. of the Coptic. It is in one of the <i>Coptic Dictionaries</i> in the British Museum, and in a Coptic MS. of <i>Jeremiah</i>, in the library of <i>St. Germain</i>. So I am informed by the Rev. Henry Tattam, Rector of St Cuthbert's, Bedford.</p>
