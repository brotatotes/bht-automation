<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span>. <i><b>In the end of the Sabbath</b></i> — Οψε δε σαββατων. <i>After</i> <i>the end of the week</i>: this is the translation given by several eminent critics; and in this way the word οψε is used by the most eminent Greek writers. Thucydides, lib. iv. chap. 93, της ημερας οψε ην - the day was <i>ended</i>. Plutarch, οψε των βασιλεως χρονων - <i>after</i> the times of the king. Philostratus οψε των Τροικων - <i>after</i> the Trojan war. See Rosenmuller. In <i>general</i> the Jews divided their natural day, which consisted of twenty-four hours, into <i>day</i> and <i>night</i>. Their artificial day began at the <i>rising</i> and ended at the <i>setting</i> of the sun; all the rest of the time, from the setting to the rising of the sun, they termed <i>night</i>: hence the same word, in Hebrew, signifies both <i>evening</i> and <i>night</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:5">Genesis 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:47">Mark 6:47</span>. Matthew has employed the word in this extensive sense here, pointing out the <i>latter part</i> of the Jewish night, that which immediately preceded the rising of the sun, and not that <i>first</i> <i>part</i> which we call the <i>evening</i>. The transaction mentioned here evidently took place early on the morning of the <i>third</i> day after our Lord's crucifixion; what is called our Sunday morning, or first day of the next week.</p>
<p><i><b>Came - to see the sepulchre.</b></i> — That is, they <i>set out</i> at this time in order to visit the tomb of our Lord, and also to weep there, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:31">John 11:31</span>, and to embalm the body of our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>. St. Matthew omits Mary Salome, mentioned by Mark; and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, mentioned by Luke. The <i>other Mary</i> was the wife of Cleopas, and mother of James and Joses, mentioned before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:56">Matthew 27:56</span>. Were not <i>Mary</i> and <i>Salome</i> two distinct persons?</p>
