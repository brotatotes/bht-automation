<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:13">Matthew 28:13</span>. <i><b>His disciples came by night</b></i> — This was as <i>absurd</i> as it was <i>false</i>. On one hand, the terror of the disciples, the smallness of their number (only eleven;) and their almost total want of faith; on the other, the great danger of such a bold enterprise, the number of armed men who guarded the tomb, the authority of Pilate and of the Sanhedrin, must render such an imposture as this utterly devoid of credit.</p>
<p><i><b>Stole him</b></i><b> away </b><i><b>while we slept.</b></i> — Here is a whole heap of absurdities.</p>
<p>1st. Is it likely that so many men would all fall asleep, in the open air, at once?</p>
<p>2dly. Is it at all probable that a <i>Roman guard</i> should be found off their watch, much less asleep, when it was instant <i>death</i>, according to the Roman military laws, to be found in this state?</p>
<p>3dly. Could they be so sound asleep as not to awake with all the noise which must be necessarily made by removing the great stone, and taking away the body?</p>
<p>4thly. Is it at all likely that these disciples could have had time sufficient to do all this, and to come and return, without being perceived by any person? And</p>
<p>5thly. If they were asleep, how could they possibly know that it was the <i>disciples</i> that stole him, or indeed that any person or persons stole him? - for, being <i>asleep</i>, they could see no person. From their own <i>testimony</i>, therefore, the <i>resurrection</i> may be as <i>fully proved</i> as the <i>theft</i>.</p>
