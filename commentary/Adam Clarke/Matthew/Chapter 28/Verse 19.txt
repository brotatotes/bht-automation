<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>. <i><b>Go ye therefore</b></i> — Because I have the authority aforesaid, and can send <i>whomsoever</i> I will to do <i>whatsoever</i> I please: - <i>teach</i>, μαθητευσατε, <i>make disciples of all nations</i>, bring them to an acquaintance with God who bought them, and then <i>baptize</i> <i>them in the name of the Father</i>. It is natural to suppose that <i>adults</i> were the first subjects of baptism; for as the Gospel was, in a peculiar manner, sent to the Gentiles, they must hear and receive it, before they could be expected to renounce their old prejudices and idolatries, and come into the bonds of the Christian covenant. But, certainly, no argument can be drawn from this concession against the baptism of <i>children</i>. When the Gentiles and Jews had received the faith and blessings of the Gospel, it is natural enough to suppose they should wish to get their children incorporated with the visible Church of Christ; especially if, as many pious and learned men have believed, baptism succeeded to circumcision, which I think has never yet been disproved. The apostles knew well that the Jews not only circumcised the children of proselytes, but also baptized them; and as they now received a commission to teach and proselyte all the nations, and baptize them in the name of the holy Trinity, they must necessarily understand that <i>infants</i> were included: nor could they, the custom of their country being considered, have understood our Lord differently, unless he had, in the most express terms, said that they were <i>not</i> to baptize children, which neither he nor his apostles ever did. And as to the objection, that the baptized were obliged to profess their faith, and that, therefore, only <i>adults</i> should be baptized, there is no weight at all in it; because what is spoken of such refers to those who, only at that period of life, heard the Gospel, and were not born of parents who had been Christians; therefore they could not have been baptized into the Christian faith, forasmuch as no such faith was at their infancy preached in the world. That the children and even infants, of proselytes, were baptized among the Jews, and reputed, in consequence, <i>clean</i>, and partakers of the blessings of the covenant, see proved at large by Wetstein, in his note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span>, and particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>In the name of the Father</b></i>, c.] Baptism, properly speaking, whether administered by dipping or sprinkling, signifies a full and eternal consecration of the person to the service and honour of that <i>Being</i> in whose name it is administered but this consecration can never be made to a <i>creature</i>; therefore the <i>Father</i>, and the <i>Son</i>, and the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, are not <i>creatures</i>. Again, baptism is not made in the name of a <i>quality</i> or <i>attribute</i> of the Divine nature; therefore the <i>Father</i>, and the <i>Son</i>, and the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, are not <i>qualities</i> or <i>attributes</i> of the Divine nature. The <i>orthodox</i>, as they are termed, have generally considered this text as a decisive proof of the doctrine of the holy <i>Trinity</i>: and what else can they draw from it? Is it possible for words to convey a plainer sense than these do? And do they not direct every reader to consider the <i>Father</i>, the <i>Son</i>, and the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, as three distinct persons? "But this I can never believe." I cannot help that - you shall not be persecuted by me for differing from my opinion. I cannot go over to <i>you</i>; I must abide by what I believe to be the meaning of the Scriptures. Dr. Lightfoot has some good thoughts on this commission given to the apostles: -</p>
<p>"I. <i>Christ</i> commands them to go and baptize the nations: but how much time was past before such a journey was taken! And when the time was now come that this work should be begun, <i>Peter</i> doth not enter upon it without a previous admonition given him from heaven. And this was occasioned hereby, that, according to the command of <i>Christ</i>, the Gospel was first to be preached to <i>Judea, Samaria</i>, and <i>Galilee</i>.</p>
<p>"II. He commands them to baptize <i>in the name of the Father, and</i> <i>of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</i>; but among the <i>Jews</i>, they baptized only in the name of <i>Jesus</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:16">Acts 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:5">Acts 19:5</span>. For this reason, that thus the baptizers might assert, and the baptized confess, <i>Jesus</i> to be the true <i>Messias</i>; which was chiefly controverted by the Jews. Of the same nature is that apostolic blessing, <i>Grace and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord</i> <i>Jesus Christ</i>. Where then is the <i>Holy Ghost</i>? He is not excluded, however he be not named. The Jews did more easily consent to the <i>Spirit</i> of the <i>Messias</i>, which they very much celebrate, than to the <i>person</i> of the <i>Messias</i>. Above all others they deny and abjure <i>Jesus</i> of <i>Nazareth</i>. It belonged to the apostles, therefore, the more earnestly to assert <i>Jesus</i> (to be the <i>Messias</i>) by how much the more vehemently they opposed him: which being once cleared, the acknowledging of the <i>Spirit</i> of <i>Christ</i> would be introduced without delay or scruple. <i>Moses</i>, (in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:14">Exodus 6:14</span>,) going about to reckon up all the tribes of <i>Israel</i>, goes no farther than the tribe of <i>Levi</i>; and takes up with that to which his business and story at that present related. In like manner, the apostles, for the present, baptize in the name of <i>Jesus</i>, and bless in the name of the Father and of <i>Jesus</i>, that thereby they might more firmly establish the doctrine of <i>Jesus</i>, which met with such sharp and virulent opposition; which doctrine being established among them, they would soon agree about the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>"III. Among the <i>Jews</i>, the controversy was about the true <i>Messias</i>; among the <i>Gentiles</i>, about the true God. It was therefore proper among the Jews to baptize in the name of Jesus, that he might be vindicated to be the true <i>Messias</i>. Among the Gentiles, <i>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</i>, that they might be hereby instructed in the doctrine of the true God. - Let this be particularly noted.</p>
<p>"IV. The Jews baptized proselytes <i>into the name of the Father</i>, that is, into the profession of God, whom they called by the name of <i>Father</i>. The apostles baptize the <i>Jews into the name of Jesus</i> <i>the Son</i>, and the Gentiles, <i>into the name of the Father, and of the</i> <i>Son, and of the Holy Ghost</i>.</p>
<p>"V. The Father hath revealed himself in the old covenant; the Son in the new; in human flesh by his miracles, doctrine, resurrection and ascension; the Holy Ghost in his gifts and miracles. Thus the doctrine of the ever blessed Trinity grew by degrees to full maturity. For the arriving to the acknowledgment of which, it was incumbent upon all who professed the true God to be three in one to be baptized into his name." LIGHTFOOT'S Works, vol. ii. p. 274.</p>
