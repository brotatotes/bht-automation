<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:2">Matthew 28:2</span>. <i><b>A great earthquake</b></i> — σεισμος, a <i>shaking</i> or <i>commotion</i> of any kind: probably the word means no more than the <i>confusion</i> caused among the guards by the angel's appearance. All this had taken place before the women reached the sepulchre.</p>
<p><i><b>The angel of the Lord descended from heaven</b></i> — Matthew is very particular in this, to show that the word <i>angel</i> is not to be taken in the sense of an <i>ordinary messenger</i>, who might have come from <i>Joseph</i> of Arimathea, or from any other; but in the sense of an <i>extraordinary</i> messenger, who descended from GOD, out of <i>heaven</i>, for this very purpose. It is likely that the angel had descended, rolled away the stone, and was sitting on it, before the women reached the tomb.</p>
