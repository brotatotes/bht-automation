<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:3">Matthew 28:3</span>. <i><b>His countenance</b></i> — <i>His appearance</i>, η ιδεα αυτου; or, <i>his face</i>, for so the word is used in some of the best Greek writers. It seems, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:5">Mark 16:5</span>, that this angel had assumed the appearance of a <i>young man</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Like lightning</b></i> — Coruscations of glory continually flaming from his face. This might produce the <i>confusion</i> mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:2">Matthew 28:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>His raiment white as snow</b></i> — He was clothed in garments emblematical of the <i>glad tidings</i> which he came to announce. It would have been inconsistent with the message he brought, had the angel appeared in <i>black robes</i>, such as those preposterously wear who call themselves his successors in the ministry of a once <i>suffering</i>, but now <i>risen</i> and highly exalted, Saviour. But the world is as full of <i>nonsense</i> as of <i>sin</i>; and who can correct and bring it to <i>reason</i> and <i>piety</i>?</p>
