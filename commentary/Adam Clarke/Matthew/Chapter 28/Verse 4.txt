<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:4">Matthew 28:4</span>. <i><b>The keepers - became as dead</b></i><b> men.</b>] God can, by one and the same means, <i>comfort</i> his <i>servants</i>, and <i>terrify</i> his <i>enemies.</i> The resurrection of Christ is a subject of <i>terror</i> to the servants of sin, and a subject of consolation to the sons of God; because it is a proof of the resurrection of both, the one to shame and everlasting contempt-the other to eternal glory and joy.</p>
