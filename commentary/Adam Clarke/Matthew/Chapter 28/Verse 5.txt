<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:5">Matthew 28:5</span>. <i><b>I know that ye seek Jesus</b></i> â€” Speaking after the manner of men, these women deserved to be the first witnesses of the resurrection of Christ: during <i>life</i> they ministered to him, and in <i>death</i> they were not divided. They attended him to the CROSS, notwithstanding their attachment to him exposed them to the most imminent danger; and now they come to watch and weep at his TOMB. The common opinion is, that women are more <i>fickle</i> and less <i>courageous</i> than men. The <i>reverse</i> of this I believe to be the truth, in those who are thoroughly converted to God; and who, previously to conversion, whether <i>man</i> or <i>woman</i>, can be trusted in any case?</p>
