Behold what honour God puts upon those who persevere in his truth, and continue to acknowledge him before men!That he is risen from the dead — There is a remarkable saying of R. Judah Hakkodesh, which some critics quote on this subject: "After THREE DAYS the SOUL of the Messiah shall RETURN to its body, and he shall GO OUT of that STONE in which he shall be BURIED."Goeth before you into Galilee — As himself promised, Matthew 26:32.
