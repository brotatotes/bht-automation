<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span>. <i><b>And as they went to tell his disciples</b></i> — This clause is wanting in the Codex <i>Vatican</i>, and Codex <i>Bezae</i>, and in twenty others, and in most of the <i>versions</i>. The omission is approved by <i>Mill, Bengel</i>, and <i>Schmid</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it in the text with a note of doubtfulness. It appears to be superfluous. To connect this with the next clause, the particle και, <i>and</i>, is obliged to be suppressed in all the translations. I think the verse should begin with, <i>And behold he goeth</i>, c., and the former clause be suppressed. <i>Probabiliter delenda</i>, says Professor White, in his <i>Crisews Griesbachianae</i>, speaking of the preceding words.</p>
<p><i><b>Jesus met them</b></i> — Christ bestows his graces and consolations by <i>degrees</i>, first by his angels, and then by himself. He does not reveal himself to incredulous and disobedient souls he appears not even to these women till he has tried their faith and obedience by his ministering angels.</p>
<p><i><b>All hail.</b></i> — Anglo-Saxon, [Anglo-Saxon], <i>Health be to you!</i> χαιρετε, <i>Be ye safe, rejoice.</i></p>
<p><i><b>And they held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</b></i> — This kind of reverence is in daily use among the <i>Hindoos</i>: when a disciple meets his religious guide in the public streets, he prostrates himself before him, and, taking the dust from his teacher's feet, rubs it on his <i>forehead, breast</i>, &amp;c.
