Verse Matthew 28:9. And as they went to tell his disciples — This clause is wanting in the Codex Vatican, and Codex Bezae, and in twenty others, and in most of the versions.

I think the verse should begin with, And behold he goeth, c., and the former clause be suppressed. Probabiliter delenda, says Professor White, in his Crisews Griesbachianae, speaking of the preceding words.Jesus met them — Christ bestows his graces and consolations by degrees, first by his angels, and then by himself. He does not reveal himself to incredulous and disobedient souls he appears not even to these women till he has tried their faith and obedience by his ministering angels.All hail. — Anglo-Saxon, [Anglo-Saxon], Health be to you! χαιρετε, Be ye safe, rejoice.And they held him by the feet, and worshipped him. — This kind of reverence is in daily use among the Hindoos: when a disciple meets his religious guide in the public streets, he prostrates himself before him, and, taking the dust from his teacher's feet, rubs it on his forehead, breast, &c.
