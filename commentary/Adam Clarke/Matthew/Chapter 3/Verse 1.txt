<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>. <i><b>John the Baptist</b></i> — John, surnamed The Baptist, because he required those to be baptized who professed to be contrite because of their sins, was the son of a priest named Zacharias, and his wife Elisabeth, and was born about A. M. 3999, and about six months before our blessed Lord. Of his almost miraculous conception and birth, we have a circumstantial account in the Gospel of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:0">Luke 1:0</span>: to which, and the notes there, the reader is requested to refer. For his fidelity in reproving Herod for his incest with his brother Philip's wife, he was cast into prison, no doubt at the suggestion of Herodias, the profligate woman in question. He was at last beheaded at her instigation, and his head given as a present to <i>Salome</i>, her daughter, who, by her elegant dancing, had highly gratified Herod, the paramour of her incestuous mother. His ministry was short; for he appears to have been put to death in the 27th or 28th year of the Christian aera.</p>
<p><i><b>Came - preaching</b></i> — κηρυσσων, proclaiming, as a <i>herald</i>, a matter of great and solemn importance to men; the subject not his own, nor of himself, but from that God from whom alone he had received his commission. See on the nature and importance of the <i>herald's</i> office, at the end of this chapter. κηρυσσειν, says Rosenmuller, <i>de iis dicitur, qui in</i> PLATEIS, <i>in</i> CAMPIS, <i>in</i> AERE <i>aperto, ut a</i> <i>multis audiantur, vocem tollunt</i>, c. "The verb κηρυσσειν is applied to those who, in the <i>streets, fields</i>, and <i>open air</i>, lift up their voice, that they may be heard by many, and proclaim what has been committed to them by <i>regal</i> or <i>public authority</i> as the KERUKES among the <i>Greeks</i>, and the PRECONES among the <i>Romans</i>."</p>
<p><i><b>The wilderness of Judea</b></i> — That is, the <i>country</i> parts, as distinguished from the <i>city</i>; for in this sense the word <i>wilderness</i>, מדבר midbar or מדבריות <i>midbarioth</i>, is used among the rabbins. John's manner of life gives no countenance to the eremite or hermit's life, so strongly recommended and applauded by the Roman Church.</p>
