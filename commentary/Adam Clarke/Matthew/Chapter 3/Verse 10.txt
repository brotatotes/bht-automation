<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:10">Matthew 3:10</span>. <i><b>And now also the axe is laid</b></i> â€” Or, <i>Even now the axe</i> <i>lieth</i>. As if he had said, There is not a moment to spare - God is about to cut off every impenitent soul - you must therefore either turn to God <i>immediately</i>, or be utterly and finally ruined. It was customary with the prophets to represent the <i>kingdoms, nations</i>, and <i>individuals</i>, whose ruin they predicted, under the notion of <i>forests</i> and <i>trees</i>, doomed to be cut down. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+46:22-23">Jeremiah 46:22-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+31:3">Ezekiel 31:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+31:11-12">Ezekiel 31:11-12</span>. The Baptist follows the same metaphor: the <i>Jewish nation</i> is the <i>tree</i>, and the <i>Romans</i> the <i>axe</i>, which, by the just judgment of God, was speedily to cut it down. It has been well observed, that there is an allusion here to a woodman, who, having marked a tree for excision, lays his axe at its root, and strips off his outer garment, that he may wield his blows more powerfully, and that his work may be quickly performed. For about sixty years before the coming of Christ, this axe had been lying at the root of the Jewish tree, Judea having been made a province to the Roman empire, from the time that <i>Pompey</i> took the city of Jerusalem, during the contentions of the two brothers <i>Hyrcanus</i> and <i>Aristobulus</i>, which was about sixty-three years before the coming of Christ. See Joseph. Antiq. l. xiv. c. 1-5. But as the country might be still considered as in the hands of the Jews, though subject to the Romans, and God had waited on them now nearly ninety years from the above time, expecting them to bring forth fruit, and none was yet produced; he kept the Romans as an axe, lying at the root of this tree, who were ready to cut it down the moment God gave them the commission.</p>
