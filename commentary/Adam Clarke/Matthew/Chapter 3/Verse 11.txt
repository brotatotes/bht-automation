<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>. <i><b>But he that cometh after me</b></i> — Or, <i>I coming after me</i>, who is now on his way, and will shortly make his appearance. Jesus Christ began his ministry when he was thirty years of age, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:23">Luke 3:23</span>, which was the age appointed by the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+4:3">Numbers 4:3</span>. John the Baptist was born about <i>six months</i> before Christ; and, as he began his public ministry when thirty years of age, then this <i>coming after</i> refers to six months after the commencement of John's public preaching, at which time Christ entered upon his.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear</b></i> — This saying is expressive of the most profound <i>humility</i> and <i>reverence</i>. To <i>put on, take off,</i> and <i>carry the shoes</i> of their masters, was, not only among the <i>Jews</i>, but also among the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, the work of the vilest slaves. This is amply proved by <i>Kypke</i>, from <i>Arrian</i>, <i>Plutarch</i>, and the Babylonian <i>Talmud</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>With the Holy Ghost, and</b></i> with <i>fire</i>] That the influences of the <i>Spirit of God</i> are here designed, needs but little proof. Christ's religion was to be a spiritual religion, and was to have its seat in the <i>heart</i>. Outward precepts, however well they might <i>describe</i>, could not <i>produce</i> inward spirituality. This was the province of the Spirit of God, and of it <i>alone</i>; therefore he is represented here under the similitude of <i>fire</i>, because he was to <i>illuminate</i> and <i>invigorate</i> the soul, <i>penetrate</i> every part, and <i>assimilate</i> the whole to the image of the God of glory. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>With </b><i><b>fire</b></i> — καιπυρι. This is wanting in E. S. (two MSS. one of the ninth, the other of the tenth century) eight others, and many <i>Evangelistaria</i>, and in some <i>versions</i> and printed <i>editions</i>; but it is found in the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:16">Luke 3:16</span>, and in the most authentic MSS. and versions. It was probably the different interpretations given of it by the fathers that caused some transcribers to leave it out of their copies.</p>
<p>The <i>baptism of fire</i> has been differently understood among the primitive fathers. Some say, it means the <i>tribulations, crosses</i>, and <i>afflictions</i>, which believers in Christ are called to pass through. Hence the author of the <i>Opus Imperfectum</i>, on Matthew, says, that there are <i>three</i> sorts of baptism,</p>
<p>1. that of <i>water</i>;</p>
<p>2. that of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>; and,</p>
<p>3. that of <i>tribulations</i> and <i>afflictions</i>, represented under the notion of <i>fire</i>.</p>
<p>He observes farther, that our blessed Lord went through these <i>three</i> baptisms:</p>
<p>1. That of <i>water</i>, he received from the hands of <i>John</i>.</p>
<p>2. That of the <i>Holy Spirit</i> he received from the <i>Father</i>. And,</p>
<p>3. That of <i>fire</i>, he had in his contest with <i>Satan</i> in the desert.</p>
<p>St. <i>Chrysostom</i> says; it means the <i>superabundant graces</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>. <i>Basil</i> and <i>Theophilus</i> explain it of the <i>fire of hell</i>. <i>Cyril</i>, <i>Jerome</i>, and others, understand by it the descent of the Holy Spirit, on the day of pentecost.</p>
<p><i>Hilary</i> says, it means a fire that the righteous must pass through in the day of judgment, to purify them from such defilements as necessarily cleaved to them here, and with which they could not be admitted into glory.</p>
<p><i>Ambrose</i> says, this baptism shall be administered at the gate of paradise, by John Baptist; and he thinks that this is what is meant by the <i>flaming sword</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:24">Genesis 3:24</span>.</p>
<p><i>Origen</i> and <i>Lactantius</i> conceive it to be a <i>river of fire</i>, at the gate of heaven, something similar to the <i>Phlegethon</i> of the heathens; but they observe, that when the righteous come to pass over, the liquid flames shall divide, and give them a free passage: that Christ shall stand on the brink of it, and receive through the flames all those, and <i>none</i> but those, who have received in this world the <i>baptism of water</i> in his name: and that <i>this</i> baptism is for those who, having received the faith of Christ, have not, in every respect, lived conformably to it; for, though they laid the good foundation, yet they built <i>hay, straw</i>, and <i>stubble</i> upon it, and this work of theirs must be tried, and destroyed by this <i>fire</i>. This, they think, is St. Paul's meaning, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13-15">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</span>. <i>If any man build on this foundation</i> (viz. Jesus Christ) <i>gold</i>, <i>silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work</i> <i>shall be made manifest: and the fire shall try every man's work</i>, <i>of what sort it is. - If any man's work be burnt, he shall suffer</i> <i>loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as</i> BY FIRE. From this fire, understood in this way, the fathers of the following ages, and the schoolmen, formed the famous and lucrative doctrine of PURGATORY. Some in the primitive Church thought that <i>fire</i> should be, in some way or other, joined to the <i>water</i> in baptism; and it is supposed that they administered it by causing the person to pass between two fires, or to leap through the flame; or by having a <i>torch</i>, or <i>lighted candle</i>, present. Thus have those called <i>Doctors of the Church</i> trifled. The exposition which I have given, I believe to be the only genuine one.</p>
