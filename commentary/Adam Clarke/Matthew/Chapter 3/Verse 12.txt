<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:12">Matthew 3:12</span>. <i><b>Whose fan</b></i> is <i>in his hand</i>] The Romans are here termed God's <i>fan</i>, as, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:10">Matthew 3:10</span>, they were called his <i>axe</i>, and, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:7">Matthew 22:7</span>, they are termed his <i>troops</i> or <i>armies</i>.</p>
<p>The winnowing fan of the Hindoos is square, made of split bamboo; and the corn is winnowed by <i>waving</i> the <i>fan</i> backwards with <i>both hands</i>-"Whose <i>fan</i> is in <i>his hand</i>."</p>
<p><i><b>His floor</b></i> — Does not this mean the <i>land of Judea</i>, which had been long, as it were, the <i>threshing-floor</i> of the Lord? God says, he will now, by the winnowing fan (viz. the Romans) <i>throughly cleanse</i> <i>this floor </i>- <i>the wheat</i>, those who believe in the Lord Jesus, <i>he will</i> <i>gather into his garner</i>, either take to heaven from the evil to come, or put in a place of safety, as he did the Christians, by sending them to <i>Pella</i>, in <i>Coelosyria</i>, previously to the destruction of <i>Jerusalem</i>. <i>But he will burn up the chaff </i>- the disobedient and rebellions Jews, who would not come unto Christ, that they might have life.</p>
<p><i><b>Unquenchable fire.</b></i> — That cannot be extinguished by <i>man</i>.</p>
