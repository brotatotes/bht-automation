<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:15">Matthew 3:15</span>. <i><b>To fulfil all righteousness.</b></i> — That is, <i>Every</i> <i>righteous ordinance</i>: so I think the words πασανδικαιοσυνην should be translated; and so our common version renders a similar word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>. The following passage, quoted from <i>Justin Martyr</i>, will doubtless appear a strong vindication of this translation. "Christ was circumcised, and observed all the other ordinances of the law of Moses, not with a view to his own justification; but to fulfil the dispensation committed to him by the Lord, the God and Creator of all things."- <i>Wakefield</i>.</p>
<p>How remarkable are the following words of <i>Creeshna</i> (an <i>Incarnation</i> of the Supreme God, according to the <i>Hindoo</i> theology) related in the <i>Bhagvat Geeta</i>, p. 47. Addressing his disciple <i>Arjoon</i>, he says, "I myself, <i>Arjoon</i>, have not, in the three regions of the universe, any thing which is <i>necessary</i> for me to perform; nor any thing to obtain, which is not obtained; and yet <i>I live in</i> <i>the exercise of the moral duties</i>. If I were not vigilantly to attend to those duties, all men would presently follow my example. If I were not to perform the moral actions, this world would fail in their duties: I should be the cause of spurious births, and should drive the people from the right way. As the ignorant perform the duties of life from a <i>hope</i> of <i>reward</i>, so the <i>wise man,</i> out of <i>respect to the opinions</i> and <i>prejudices</i> of mankind, should perform the same without motives of interest. The wise man, by industriously performing all the duties of life, should induce the vulgar to attend to them."</p>
<p>The Septuagint use this word often for the Hebrew משפת <i>mishpat</i>, <i>judgment, appointment</i>. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+18:19">Ezekiel 18:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+18:21">Ezekiel 18:21</span>, the person who δικαιοσυνην και ελεος πεποιηκε - <i>hath done righteousness and</i> <i>mercy</i>, is he who sacredly attended to the performance of all the religious <i>ordinances</i> mentioned in that chapter, and performed them in the genuine spirit <i>of mercy</i>. δικαιωματα is used 1Mac 1:13, 49; 2:21, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:10">Hebrews 10:10</span>, to denote religious ceremonies. Michaelis supposes that כל חק <i>kol chok</i>, all religious statutes or ordinances, were the words used in the Hebrew original of this Gospel.</p>
<p>But was this an <i>ordinance</i>? Undoubtedly: it was the <i>initiatory</i> ordinance of the Baptist's dispensation. Now, as Christ had submitted to <i>circumcision</i>, which was the <i>initiatory</i> ordinance of the Mosaic dispensation, it was necessary that he should submit to this, which was instituted by no less an authority, and was the <i>introduction</i> to his own dispensation of eternal mercy and truth. But it was necessary on another account: Our Lord represented the high priest, and was to be the high priest over the house of God: - now, as the high priest was initiated into his office by <i>washing</i> and <i>anointing</i>, so must Christ: and hence he was baptized, washed, and anointed by the Holy Ghost. Thus he fulfilled the righteous ordinance of his initiation into the office of high priest, and thus was prepared to make an atonement for the sins of mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>Then he suffered him.</b></i> — In the <i>Opus Imperfectum</i>, quoted by Griesbach, there is the following addition, which, at least, may serve to show the opinion of its author: <i>Et Johannes quidem</i> <i>baptizauit ilium in aqua, ille autem Johannem cum Spiritu</i>. "Then John baptized him with water, and he baptized John with the Spirit."</p>
