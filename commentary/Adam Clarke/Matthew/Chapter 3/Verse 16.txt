Verse Matthew 3:16. The heavens were opened unto him — That is, to John the Baptist - and he, John, saw the Spirit of God - lighting upon him, i.e. Jesus. There has been some controversy about the manner and form in which the Spirit of God rendered itself visible on this occasion. St. Luke, Luke 3:22, says it was in a bodily shape like to a dove: and this likeness to a dove some refer to a hovering motion, like to that of a dove, and not to the form of the dove itself: but the terms of the text are too precise to admit of this far-fetched interpretation.This passage affords no mean proof of the doctrine of the Trinity. That three distinct persons are here, represented, there can be no dispute.1. The person of Jesus Christ, baptized by John in Jordan.2. The person of the Holy Ghost in a bodily shape, (σωματικω ειδει, Luke 3:22) like a dove.3. The person of the Father; a voice came out of heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, c.The voice is here represented as proceeding from a different place to that in which the persons of the Son and Holy Spirit were manifested and merely, I think, more forcibly to mark this Divine personality.
