<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>. <i><b>The heavens were opened unto him</b></i> — That is, to John the Baptist - <i>and he</i>, John, <i>saw the Spirit of God - lighting upon him</i>, i.e. Jesus. There has been some controversy about the manner and form in which the <i>Spirit of God</i> rendered itself visible on this occasion. St. Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>, says it was <i>in a bodily shape like to a dove</i>: and this <i>likeness</i> to a <i>dove</i> some refer to a <i>hovering motion</i>, like to that of a dove, and not to the <i>form</i> of the dove itself: but the terms of the text are too precise to admit of this far-fetched interpretation.</p>
<p>This passage affords no mean proof of the doctrine of the <i>Trinity</i>. That <i>three</i> distinct <i>persons</i> are here, represented, there can be no dispute.</p>
<p>1. The <i>person</i> of <i>Jesus Christ</i>, baptized by John in Jordan.</p>
<p>2. The <i>person</i> of the <i>Holy Ghost</i> in a <i>bodily</i> <i>shape</i>, (σωματικω ειδει, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>) like a dove.</p>
<p>3. The <i>person</i> of the <i>Father</i>; a <i>voice</i> came out of heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, c.</p>
<p>The voice is here represented as proceeding from a <i>different</i> place to that in which the <i>persons</i> of the <i>Son</i> and <i>Holy Spirit</i> were manifested and merely, I think, more forcibly to mark this Divine <i>personality</i>.</p>
