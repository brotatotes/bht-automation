<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>. <i><b>In whom I am well pleased.</b></i> — εν ω ενδακησα <i>in whom I</i> <i>have delighted </i>- though it is supposed that the <i>past</i> tense is here used for the <i>present</i>: but <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>. By this <i>voice</i>, and <i>overshadowing of the Spirit</i>, the mission of the Lord Jesus was publicly and solemnly accredited; God intimating that he had before delighted in him: the law, in all its ordinances, having pointed him out, for they could not be pleasing to God, but as they were fulfilled in, and showed forth, the Son of man, till, he came.</p>
<p>As the office of a <i>herald</i> is frequently alluded to in this chapter, and also in various other parts of the New Testament, I think it best to give a full account of it here, especially as the office of the ministers of the Gospel is represented by it. Such persons can best <i>apply</i> the different correspondences between their own and the <i>herald's</i> office.</p>
<p>At the Olympic and Isthmian games, heralds were persons of the utmost consequence and importance. Their office was: -</p>
<p>1. To proclaim from a scaffold, or elevated place, the <i>combat</i> that was to be entered on.</p>
<p>2. To summon the <i>Agonistae</i>, or contenders, to make their appearance, and to announce their names.</p>
<p>3. To specify the <i>prize</i> for which they were to contend.</p>
<p>4. To <i>admonish</i> and <i>animate</i>, with appropriate discourses, the athletae, or combatants.</p>
<p>5. To set before them, and explain, the <i>laws</i> of the <i>agones</i>, or contenders; that they might see that even the <i>conqueror</i> could not receive the <i>crown</i> or <i>prize</i>, unless he had strove <i>lawfully</i>.</p>
<p>6. After the conflict was ended, to bring the business before the <i>judges</i>, and, according to their determination, to <i>proclaim</i> the <i>victor</i>.</p>
<p>7. To deliver the <i>prize</i> to the <i>conqueror</i>, and to put the <i>crown</i> on his head, in the presence of the assembly.</p>
<p>8. They were the persons who convoked all <i>solemn</i> and <i>religious</i> assemblies, and brought forth, and often <i>slew</i>, the <i>sacrifices</i> offered on those occasions.</p>
<p>9. They frequently called the attention of the people, during the sacrifices, to the <i>subject</i> of <i>devotion</i>, with <i>hoc age</i>! τουτο πραττε: <i>mind what you are about, don't be idle; think of</i> <i>nothing else</i>. See PLUTARCH in <i>Coriolanus</i>.</p>
<p>The office, and nearly the word itself, was in use among the ancient Babylonians, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+3:4">Daniel 3:4</span>, where the Chaldee word כרוזא <i>caroza</i>, is rendered by the Septuagint κηρυξ <i>kerux</i>, and by our translation, very properly, <i>herald</i>. His business in the above place was to <i>call an assembly</i> of the people, for the purpose of <i>public worship</i>; to <i>describe</i> the <i>object</i> and <i>nature</i> of that worship, and the <i>punishment</i> to be inflicted on those who did not join in the worship, and properly assist in the solemnities of the occasion.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+3:4">Daniel 3:4</span>, is the only place in our <i>translation</i>, in which the word <i>herald</i> is used: but the word κηρυξ, used by St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:7">1 Timothy 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:11">2 Timothy 1:11</span>, and by St. Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:5">2 Peter 3:5</span>, is found in the Septuagint, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:43">Genesis 41:43</span>, as well as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+3:4">Daniel 3:4</span>, and the verb κηρυσσω is found in different places of that version, and in a great number of places in the New Testament.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that the office of the κηρυξ, <i>kerux</i>, or <i>herald</i>, must have been anciently known, and indeed established, among the <i>Egyptians</i>: for in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:43">Genesis 41:43</span>, where an account is given of the promotion of Joseph to the <i>second</i> place in the kingdom, where we say, <i>And they cried before him, saying, Bow the knee</i>; the Septuagint has και εκηρυξεν εμπροσθεν αυτου κηρυξ. <i>And a</i> HERALD <i>made proclamation before him</i>. As the Septuagint translated this for Ptolemy Philadelphus, the Egyptian king, and were in Egypt when they translated the law, we may safely infer that the office was not only <i>known</i>, but in <i>use</i> among the Egyptians, being denominated in their language אברק <i>abrek</i>, which our translators, following the Vulgate, have rendered, <i>Bow the knee</i>; but which the Septuagint understood to be the title of an officer, who was the same among the Egyptians as the κηρυξ among the Greeks. This is a probable meaning of the word, which escaped me when I wrote the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:43">Genesis 41:43</span>.</p>
<p>As every kind of office had some peculiar <i>badge</i>, or <i>ensign</i>, by which it was known among the ancients, so the heralds were known by generally carrying a <i>caduceus</i>. This was a rod with <i>two spread</i> <i>wings</i> at the top, and about which <i>two serpents</i> were <i>entwined</i>. The poets fabled that this rod was given by <i>Apollo</i>, the god of <i>wisdom</i> and <i>music</i>, to <i>Mercury</i>, the god of <i>eloquence</i>, and the <i>messenger</i> of the gods. To it wonderful properties are ascribed - especially that it produces <i>sleep</i>, and that it raises the <i>dead</i>. Who does not at once see, that the <i>caduceus</i> and its properties clearly point out the <i>office, honour</i>, and <i>influence</i> of the <i>herald</i>? As persons of <i>strong voice</i>, and <i>ready speech</i>, and <i>copious eloquence</i>, were always chosen for <i>heralds</i>, they were represented as endued with wisdom and eloquence from <i>above</i>. They <i>lulled men to sleep</i>, i.e. by their persuasive powers of speech, they <i>calmed</i> the turbulent dispositions of an inflamed populace, when proceeding to acts of <i>rebellion</i> and <i>anarchy</i>; or they <i>roused</i> the <i>dormant zeal</i> of the community, who, through long oppression, despairing of succour or relief, seemed careless about their best interests being stupidly resolved to sink under their burdens, and expect release only in death.</p>
<p>As to the <i>caduceus</i> itself, it was ever the emblem of peace among the ancients: the <i>rod</i> was the emblem of <i>power</i>; the <i>two serpents</i>, of <i>wisdom</i> and <i>prudence</i>; and the <i>two wings</i>, of <i>diligence</i> and <i>despatch</i>. The first idea of this wonderful <i>rod</i> seems to have been borrowed from the <i>rod of Moses</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:17">Exodus 4:17</span>.</p>
<p>The word κηρυξ <i>kerux</i>, or <i>herald</i>, here used, is evidently derived from κηρυσσειν, to <i>proclaim, call aloud</i>; and this from γηρυς, the <i>voice</i>; because these persons were never employed in any business, but such only as could not be transacted but by the <i>powers of speech</i>, and the energy of <i>ratiocination</i>.</p>
<p>For the derivation of the word <i>herald</i>, we must look to the <i>northern</i> languages. Its meaning in <i>Junius, Skinner</i>, and <i>Minshieu,</i> are various, but not essentially different; they all seem to point out different parts of the herald's office.</p>
<p>1. In the Belgic, <i>heer</i> signifies <i>army</i>. Hence <i>heer-alt</i>, a <i>senior officer</i>, or <i>general</i>, in the <i>army</i>.</p>
<p>2. Or <i>heer-held</i>, the <i>hero</i> of the <i>army</i>: he who had distinguished himself most in his country's behalf.</p>
<p>3. Or from the Gallo-teutonic <i>herr-haut</i>, the <i>high lord</i>, because their persons were so universally respected, as we have already seen.</p>
<p>4. Or from the simple Teutonic <i>herr-hold</i>, he who is <i>faithful</i> to his <i>lord</i>.</p>
<p>5. And, lastly, according to <i>Minshieu</i>, from the verb <i>hier-holden, stop here</i>; because, in proclaiming peace, they <i>arrested</i> bloodshed and death, and prevented the farther <i>progress</i> of war.</p>
<p>These officers act an important part in all heroic history, and particularly in the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, from which, as the subject is of so much importance, I shall make a few extracts.</p>
<p>I. Their character was <i>sacred</i>. Homer gives them the epithet of <i>divine</i>, θειοι. </p>
<p>Χαιρετε, κηρυκες, Διος αγγελοι, ηδε και ανδρων. κ. τ. λ.</p>
<p>"Hail, O ye heralds, messengers of God and of men! come forward. I cannot blame <i>you</i>-Agamemnon only is culpable, who has sent you for the beautiful Briseis. But come, O godlike <i>Patroclus</i>, bring forth the damsel, and deliver her to them, that they may lead her away," c., Iliad i. 334, c.</p>
<p>II. Their functions were numerous they might enter without danger into <i>besieged cities</i>, or even into <i>battles</i>.</p>
<p>III. They convoked the assemblies of the leaders, according to the orders they received from the general or king.</p>
<p>IV. They commanded <i>silence</i>, when kings were to address the assembly, (Iliad xviii. 503. Κηρυκες δ' αρα λαων ερητυον. See also Iliad ii. 280,) and delivered the sceptre into their hands, before they began their harangue.</p>
<p>VI. They were entrusted with the most important missions and accompanied princes in the most difficult circumstances. <i>Priam</i>, when he went to Achilles, took no person besides a herald with him. (Iliad xxiv. 674, 689.) When <i>Ulysses</i> sent two of his companions to treat with the <i>Lestrygons</i>, he sent a <i>herald</i> at the same time. (Odys. x. 102.) Agamemnon, when he wished to soften Achilles, joined Eurybates and Hodius, his <i>heralds</i>, to the deputation of the princes. (Iliad ix. 170.)</p>
<p>VII. <i>Heralds</i> were employed to proclaim and publish whatever was to be known by the people. (Odys. xx. 276.)</p>
<p>VIII. They declared war and proclaimed peace. (Odys. xviii. 334.)</p>
<p>IX. They took part in all sacred ceremonies: they mingled the wine and water in the large bowls for the libations, which were made at the conclusion of treaties. They were the priests of the people in many cases; they led forth the victims, cut them in pieces, and divided them among those engaged in the sacrifices. (Odys. i. 109, c.)</p>
<p>X. In Odyssey lib. xvii., a <i>herald</i> presents a piece of flesh to Telemachus, and pours out his wine.</p>
<p>XI. They sometimes waited on princes at table, and rendered them many other personal services. (Iliad ii. 280 Odys. i. 143, c., 146, 153 ii. 6,38.) In the Iliad, lib. x. 3, <i>Eurybates</i> carries the clothes to Ulysses. And a <i>herald</i> of Alcinous conducts Demodocus, the singer, into the festive hall. (Odys. viii. 470.) Many others of their functions, services, and privileges, the reader may see, by consulting DAMM'S <i>Homeric Lexicon</i>, under κρω.</p>
