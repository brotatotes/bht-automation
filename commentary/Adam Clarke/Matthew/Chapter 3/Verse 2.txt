<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. <i><b>Repent</b></i> — μετανοειτε. This was the <i>matter</i> of the preaching. The verb μετανοεω is either compounded of μετα, <i>after,</i> and νοειν <i>to understand</i>, which signifies that, <i>after hearing</i> such preaching, the sinner is led to <i>understand</i>, that the way he has walked in was the way of misery, death, and hell. Or the word may be derived from μετα <i>after</i>, and ανοια, <i>madness</i>, which intimates that the whole life of a sinner is no other than a continued course of <i>madness</i> and <i>folly</i>: and if to live in a constant opposition to all the dictates of <i>true wisdom</i>; to wage war with his own best interests in time and eternity; to provoke and insult the living God; and, by habitual sin, to prepare himself only for a state of misery, be evidences of <i>insanity</i>, every sinner exhibits them plentifully. It was from this notion of the word, that the Latins termed repentance <i>resipiscentia, a</i> <i>growing wise again</i>, from <i>re</i> and <i>sapere</i>; or, according to Tertullian, Resipiscentia, quasi <i>receptio mentis ad se</i>, restoring the mind to itself: <i>Contra Marcion</i>, lib. ii. Repentance, then, implies that a measure of Divine <i>wisdom</i> is communicated to the sinner, and that he thereby becomes <i>wise</i> to salvation. That his <i>mind, purposes, opinions</i>, and <i>inclinations</i>, are <i>changed</i>; and that, in consequence, there is a total change in his conduct. It need scarcely be remarked, that, in this state, a man feels deep anguish of soul, because he has sinned against God, unfitted himself for heaven, and exposed his soul to hell. Hence, a true penitent has that sorrow, whereby he forsakes sin, not only because it has been ruinous to his own soul, but because it has been offensive to God.</p>
<p><i><b>The kingdom of heaven is at hand</b></i> — Referring to the prophecy of Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</span>, where the reign of Christ among men is expressly foretold. This phrase, and <i>the kingdom of God</i>, mean the same thing, viz. the dispensation of infinite mercy, and manifestation of eternal truth, by Christ Jesus, producing the true knowledge of God, accompanied with that worship which is pure and holy, worthy of that God who is its institutor and its object. But why is this called a <i>kingdom</i>? Because it has its <i>laws</i>, all the moral precepts of the Gospel: its <i>subjects</i>, all who believe in Christ Jesus: and its <i>king</i>, the Sovereign of heaven and earth. N. B. Jesus Christ never saved a soul which he did not <i>govern</i>; nor is this Christ precious or estimable to any man who does not feel a spirit of <i>subjection</i> to the Divine will.</p>
<p>But why is it called the <i>kingdom of</i> HEAVEN? Because God designed that his kingdom of grace here should resemble the kingdom of glory above. And hence our Lord teaches us to pray, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. <i>The kingdom of heaven is not</i> <i>meat and drink</i>, says St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>; does not consist in the gratification of sensual passions, or worldly ambition; <i>but is</i> <i>righteousness, peace, and joy, in the Holy Ghost</i>. Now what can there be <i>more</i> than this in glory? <i>Righteousness</i>, without mixture of <i>sin; peace</i>, without <i>strife</i> or <i>contention; joy</i>, in the Holy Ghost, spiritual joy, without mixture of <i>misery</i>! And all this, it is possible, by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, to enjoy here below. How then does <i>heaven</i> itself differ from this state? Answer. It makes the righteousness <i>eternal</i>, the peace <i>eternal</i>, and the joy <i>eternal</i>. This is the heaven of heavens! The phrase, <i>kingdom of heaven</i>, מלכות שמים malcuth shamayim, is frequently used by the rabbinical writers, and always means, the purity of the Divine worship, and the blessedness which a righteous man feels when employed in it.</p>
<p>It is farther added, This kingdom <i>is at hand</i>. The dispensation of the glorious Gospel was now about to be fully opened, and the Jews were to have the first offers of salvation. This kingdom is also at hand to us; and wherever <i>Christ crucified</i> is preached, there is salvation to be found. JESUS is proclaimed to <i>thee</i>, O man! as infinitely able and willing to save. Believe in his name - cast thy soul upon his atonement, and enter into rest!</p>
