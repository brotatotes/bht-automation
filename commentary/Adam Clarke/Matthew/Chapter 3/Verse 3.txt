<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:3">Matthew 3:3</span>. <i><b>The voice of one crying in the wilderness</b></i> — Or, A voice of a crier in the wilderness. This is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:3">Isaiah 40:3</span>, which clearly proves that John the Baptist was the person of whom the prophet spoke.</p>
<p>The idea is taken from the practice of eastern monarchs, who, whenever they entered upon an expedition, or took a journey through a desert country, sent <i>harbingers</i> before them, to prepare all things for their passage; and <i>pioneers</i> to <i>open</i> the <i>passes</i>, to <i>level</i> the <i>ways</i>, and to <i>remove</i> all <i>impediments</i>. The officers appointed to superintend such preparations were called by the <i>Latins, stratores</i>.</p>
<p><i>Diodorus's</i> account of the march of <i>Semiramis</i> into <i>Media</i> and <i>Persia</i>, will give us a clear notion of the preparation of the way for a royal expedition. "In her march to <i>Ecbatane</i>, she came to the <i>Zarcean</i> mountain, which, extending many furlongs, and being full of <i>craggy precipices</i> and <i>deep hollows</i>, could not be passed without making a great compass about. Being therefore desirous of leaving an everlasting memorial of herself, as well as shortening the way, she ordered the <i>precipices to be digged down</i>, and <i>the</i> <i>hollows to be filled up</i>; and, at a great expense, she made a shorter and more expeditious road, which, to this day, is called from her, <i>The road of Semiramis</i>. Afterwards she went into <i>Persia</i>, and all the other countries of Asia, subject to her dominion; and, wherever she went, she ordered the <i>mountains</i> and <i>precipices</i> to be <i>levelled</i>, raised <i>causeways</i> in the plain country, and, at a great expense, made the ways passable." <i>Diod. Sic</i>. lib. ii. and Bp. <i>Lowth</i>.</p>
<p>The Jewish Church was that <i>desert country</i>, to which John was sent, to announce the coming of the Messiah. It was destitute at that time of all religious cultivation, and of the spirit and practice of piety; and John was sent to prepare the way of the Lord, by preaching the doctrine of <i>repentance</i>. The desert is therefore to be considered as affording a proper emblem of the rude state of the Jewish Church, which is the true <i>wilderness</i> meant by the prophet, and in which John was to prepare the way of the promised Messiah. The <i>awful importance</i> of the <i>matter</i>, and the <i>vehemence</i> of the <i>manner</i> of the Baptist's preaching, probably acquired him the character of <i>the crier</i>, βοων.</p>
