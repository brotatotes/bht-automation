<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:4">Matthew 3:4</span>. <i><b>His raiment of camel's hair</b></i> — A sort of <i>coarse</i> or <i>rough</i> covering, which, it appears, was common to the prophets, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:4">Zechariah 13:4</span>. In such a garment we find <i>Elijah</i> clothed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:8">2 Kings 1:8</span>. And as <i>John</i> had been designed under the name of this prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span>, whose spirit and qualifications he was to possess, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span>, he took the same habit and lived in the same state of self-denial.</p>
<p><i><b>His meat was locusts</b></i> — ακριδες. ακρις may either signify the <i>insect</i> called the <i>locust</i>, which still makes a part of the <i>food</i> in the land of Judea; or the <i>top of a plant</i>. Many eminent commentators are of the latter opinion; but the first is the most likely. The Saxon translator has [Anglo-Saxon] <i>grasshoppers</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Wild honey.</b></i> — Such as he got in the rocks and hollows of trees, and which abounded in Judea: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:26">1 Samuel 14:26</span>. It is most likely that the dried locusts, which are an article of food in Asiatic countries to the present day, were fried in the honey, or <i>compounded</i> in some manner with it. The Gospel according to the Hebrews, as quoted by <i>Epiphanius</i>, seems to have taken a similar view of the subject, as it <i>adds</i> here to the text, Ου η γευσις ην του μαννα, ως εγκρις εν ελαιω. <i>And its taste was like manna, as a</i> <i>sweet cake baked in oil</i>.</p>
