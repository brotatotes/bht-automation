<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span>. <i><b>Were baptized</b></i> — In what form baptism was originally administered, has been deemed a subject worthy of serious dispute. Were the people <i>dipped</i> or <i>sprinkled</i>? for it is certain βαπτω and βαπτιζω mean both. They were all <i>dipped</i>, say some. Can any man suppose that it was possible for John to dip <i>all the inhabitants of</i> <i>Jerusalem and Judea, and of all the country round about the</i> <i>Jordan</i>? Were both men and women dipped, for certainly <i>both</i> came to his baptism? This could never have comported either with safety or with <i>decency</i>. Were they dipped in their <i>clothes</i>? This would have endangered their lives, if they had not with them <i>change</i> of raiment: and as such a baptism as John's (however administered) was, in several respects, a <i>new</i> thing in Judea, it is not at all likely that the people would come thus provided. But suppose these were <i>dipped</i>, which I think it would be impossible to prove, does it follow that, in all regions of the world, men and women must be <i>dipped</i>, in order to be evangelically baptized? In the eastern countries, <i>bathings</i> were frequent, because of the heat of the climate, it being there so necessary to <i>cleanliness</i> and <i>health</i>; but could our climate, or a more <i>northerly</i> one, admit of this with safety, for at least three-fourths of the year? We may rest assured that it could not. And may we not presume, that if John had opened his commission in the north of Great Britain, for many months of the year, he would have <i>dipped</i> neither man nor woman, unless he could have procured a tepid bath? Those who are <i>dipped</i> or <i>immersed</i> in water, in the name of the Holy Trinity, I believe to be evangelically baptized - those who are washed or sprinkled with water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I believe to be equally so; and the <i>repetition</i> of such a baptism I believe to be <i>profane</i>. Others have a right to believe the contrary, if they see good. After all, it is the <i>thing</i> signified, and not the <i>mode</i>, which is the essential part of the sacrament.

<p><i><b>Confessing their sins.</b></i> — εξομολογουμενοι, <i>earnestly</i> <i>acknowledging that their sins were their own</i>. And thus taking the whole blame upon themselves, and laying nothing to the charge of GOD or <i>man</i>. This is essential to true repentance; and, till a man take the <i>whole blame</i> on <i>himself</i>, he cannot feel the absolute need he has of casting his soul on the mercy of God, that he may be saved.</p>
