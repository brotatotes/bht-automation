<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>. <i><b>Pharisees</b></i> — A very numerous sect among the Jews, who, in their <i>origin</i>, were, very probably, a pure and holy people. It is likely that they got the name of Pharisees, i.e. <i>Separatists</i>, (from פרש <i>pharash</i>, to <i>separate</i>,) from their separating themselves from the pollution of the Jewish national worship; and hence, the word in the Anglo-saxon version is [Anglo-Saxon], <i>holy persons</i> who <i>stand apart</i>, or by themselves: but, in process of time, like all <i>religious sects</i> and <i>parties</i>, they <i>degenerated</i>: they lost the <i>spirit</i> of their <i>institution</i>, they ceased to recur to first principles, and had only the <i>form</i> of godliness, when Jesus Christ preached in Judea; for he bore witness, that they did make the <i>outside</i> of the cup and platter clean - they observed the rules of their institution, but the spirit was gone.</p>
<p><i><b>Sadducees</b></i> — A sect who denied the existence of angels and spirits, consequently all <i>Divine influence</i> and <i>inspiration</i>, and also the resurrection of the dead. The Sadducees of that time were the <i>Materialists</i> and <i>Deists</i> of the Jewish nation. When the sect of the Pharisees arose cannot be distinctly ascertained; but it is supposed to have been some time after the Babylonish captivity. The sect of the Sadducees were the followers of one Sadok, a disciple of Antigonus Sochaeus, who flourished about three centuries before Christ. There was a third sect among the Jews, called the <i>Essenes</i> or <i>Essenians</i>, of whom I shall have occasion to speak on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:12">Matthew 19:12</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Come to his baptism</b></i> — The AEthiopic version adds the word <i>privately</i> here, the translator probably having read λαθρα in his copy, which gives a very remarkable turn to the passage. The multitudes, who had no worldly interest to support, no character to maintain by living in their usual way, came <i>publicly</i>, and <i>openly</i> acknowledged that they were SINNERS; and stood in need of mercy. The <i>others</i>, who endeavoured to secure their worldly interests by making a fair show in the flesh, are supposed to have come <i>privately</i>, that they might not be exposed to reproach; and that they might not lose their reputation for <i>wisdom</i> and <i>sanctity</i>, which their consciences, under the preaching of the Baptist, told them they had no right to. See below.</p>
<p><i><b>O generation of vipers</b></i> — γεννηματα εχιδνων. A terribly expressive speech. <i>A serpentine brood, from a serpentine stock</i>. As their fathers <i>were</i>, so were they, children of the <i>wicked</i> one. This is God's estimate of a SINNER, <i>whether he wade in wealth, or</i> <i>soar in fame</i>. The Jews were the seed of the serpent, who should bruise the heel of the woman's seed, and whose head should be bruised by him.</p>
<p><i><b>Who hath warned you</b></i> — Or, <i>privately shown you</i>. τις επεδιξεν - from υπο, <i>under</i>, and δεικνυμαι, <i>to show</i>. Does not this seem to allude to the reading of the <i>AEthiopic</i> noticed above? They came <i>privately</i>: and John may be supposed to address them thus: "Did any person give you a <i>private</i> warning? No, you received your convictions under the <i>public</i> ministry of the word. The multitudes of the poor and wretched, who have been convinced of sin, have <i>publicly</i> acknowledged their crimes, and sought mercy - God will unmask <i>you - you</i> have deceived the people - you have deceived yourselves - you must <i>appear</i> just what you are; and, if you expect mercy from God, act like the penitent multitude, and bring forth FRUIT worthy of repentance. Do not begin to trifle with your convictions, by thinking, that because you are descendants of Abraham, therefore you are entitled to God's favour; God can, out of these stones (pointing probably to those scattered about in the desert, which he appears to have considered as an emblem of the Gentiles) raise up a faithful seed, who, though not natural descendants of your excellent patriarch, yet shall be his worthy children, as being partakers of his faith, and friends of his God." It should be added, that the Greek word also signifies <i>plain</i> or <i>ample information</i>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:47">Luke 6:47</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The wrath to come?</b></i> — The desolation which was about to fall on the Jewish nation for their wickedness, and threatened in the last words of their own Scriptures. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:6">Malachi 4:6</span>. <i>Lest I come and smite the earth</i> את הארץ (et ha-arets, this very <i>land</i>) <i>with a curse</i>. This wrath or curse was coming: they did not prevent it by turning to God, and receiving the Messiah, and therefore the wrath of God came upon them to the uttermost. Let him that readeth understand.</p>
