Verse Matthew 4:10. Get thee hence — Or, behind me, οπισω μου. This is added by a multitude of the best MSS., VERSIONS, and FATHERS. This temptation savouring of nothing but diabolical impudence, Jesus did not treat it as the others; but, with Divine authority, commanded the tempter to return to his own place.In the course of this trial, it appears that our blessed Lord was tempted,1st. To DISTRUST. Command these stones to become bread.2dly. To PRESUMPTION. Cast thyself down.3dly. To worldly AMBITION. All these will I give.4thly. To IDOLATRY. Fall down and worship me, or do me homage. There is probably not a temptation of Satan, but is reducible to one or other of these four articles.From the whole we may learn:First. No man, howsoever holy, is exempted from temptation: for God manifested to the flesh was tempted by the devil.Secondly. That the best way to foil the adversary, is by the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, Ephesians 6:17.Thirdly. That to be tempted even to the greatest abominations (while a person resists) is not sin: for Christ was tempted to worship the DEVIL.Fourthly. That there is no temptation which is from its own nature, or favouring circumstances, irresistible. God has promised to bruise even Satan under our feet.As I wish to speak what I think most necessary on every subject, when I first meet it, and once for all, I would observe,First, That the fear of being tempted may become a most dangerous snare.Secondly, That when God permits a temptation or trial to come he will give grace to bear or overcome it.Thirdly, That our spiritual interests shall be always advanced, in proportion to our trials and faithful resistance.Fourthly, That a more than ordinary measure of Divine consolation shall be the consequence of every victory.
