<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:10">Matthew 4:10</span>. <i><b>Get thee hence</b></i> — Or, <i>behind me</i>, οπισω μου. This is added by a multitude of the best MSS., VERSIONS, and FATHERS. This temptation savouring of nothing but diabolical impudence, Jesus did not treat it as the others; but, with Divine authority, commanded the tempter to return to his own place.</p>
<p>In the course of this trial, it appears that our blessed Lord was tempted,</p>
<p>1st. To DISTRUST. <i>Command these stones to become</i> <i>bread</i>.</p>
<p>2dly. To PRESUMPTION. <i>Cast thyself down</i>.</p>
<p>3dly. To worldly AMBITION. <i>All these will I give</i>.</p>
<p>4thly. To IDOLATRY. <i>Fall down and worship me</i>, or <i>do me homage</i>. There is probably not a temptation of Satan, but is reducible to one or other of these four articles.</p>
<p>From the whole we may learn:</p>
<p>First. No man, howsoever holy, is exempted from temptation: for God manifested to the flesh was tempted by the devil.</p>
<p>Secondly. That the best way to foil the adversary, is by the <i>sword of the Spirit</i>, which is <i>the word of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span>.</p>
<p>Thirdly. That to be tempted even to the greatest abominations (while a person <i>resists</i>) is not sin: for Christ was tempted to <i>worship</i> the DEVIL.</p>
<p>Fourthly. That there is no temptation which is from its own nature, or favouring circumstances, irresistible. God has promised to bruise even <i>Satan</i> under our feet.</p>
<p>As I wish to speak what I think most necessary on every subject, when I first meet it, and once for all, I would observe,</p>
<p>First, That the <i>fear</i> of <i>being tempted</i> may become a most dangerous snare.</p>
<p>Secondly, That when God permits a temptation or trial to come he will give grace to bear or overcome it.</p>
<p>Thirdly, That our spiritual interests shall be always advanced, in proportion to our trials and faithful resistance.</p>
<p>Fourthly, That a more than ordinary measure of Divine consolation shall be the consequence of every victory.</p>
