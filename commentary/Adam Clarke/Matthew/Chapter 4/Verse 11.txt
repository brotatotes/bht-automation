<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:11">Matthew 4:11</span>. <i><b>Behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</b></i> — That is, brought that food which was necessary to support nature.</p>
<p>The name given to Satan in the third verse is very emphatic, ο πειραζων, the <i>tempter</i>, or <i>trier</i>, from πειρω, <i>to pierce</i> <i>through</i>. To this import of the name there seems to be an allusion, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>: <i>The fiery</i> DARTS <i>of the wicked one</i>. This is the precise idea of the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+8:2">Deuteronomy 8:2</span>. <i>To humble thee</i>, and <i>to prove thee</i>, TO KNOW WHAT WAS IN THY HEART: לנסתך <i>linesteca</i>, πειρασησε, LXX. that he might <i>bore thee</i> <i>through</i>. The quality and goodness of many things are proved by <i>piercing</i> or <i>boring through</i>; for this shows what is in the heart. Perhaps nothing tends so much to discover <i>what we are</i>, as trials either from men or devils.</p>
<p><i>Shalt thou serve</i>, or pay <i>religious veneration</i>, λαρρευσεις. This is Mr. Wakefield's translation, and I think cannot be mended. λατρεια comes from λα, <i>very much</i>, and τρεω, <i>I tremble</i>. When a sinner approaches the presence of God, conscious of HIS infinite holiness and justice, and of his own vileness, he will then fully comprehend what this word means. See this religious reverence exemplified in the case of Moses, when in the presence of God; <i>I exceedingly fear</i>, said he, <i>and tremble</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:21">Hebrews 12:21</span>. And yet this fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. See the observations at the end of the chapter.</p>
