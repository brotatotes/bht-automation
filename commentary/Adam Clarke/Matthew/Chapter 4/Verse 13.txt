<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13">Matthew 4:13</span>. <i><b>And leaving Nazareth</b></i> — Or, <i>entirely leaving Nazareth</i>, και καταλιπων την ναζαρετ, from κατα, <i>intensive</i>, and δειπω, <i>I leave</i>. It seems that, from this time, our blessed Lord made <i>Capernaum</i> his ordinary place of residence; and utterly forsook Nazareth, because they had wholly rejected his word, and even attempted to take away his life. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:29">Luke 4:29</span>.</p>
<p><i>Galilee</i> was bounded by mount Lebanon on the north, by the river Jordan and the sea of Galilee on the east, by Chison on the south, and by the Mediterranean on the west.</p>
<p><i>Nazareth</i>, a little city in the tribe of Zebulon, in lower Galilee, with Tabor on the east, and Ptolemais on the west. It is supposed that this city was the usual residence of our Lord for the first thirty years of his life. It was <i>here</i> he became incarnate, lived in subjection to Joseph and Mary, and from which he took the name of a <i>Nazorean</i>.</p>
<p><i>Capernaum</i>, a city famous in the New Testament, but never mentioned in the Old. Probably it was one of those cities which the Jews built after their return from Babylon. It stood on the sea-coast of Galilee, on the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim, as mentioned in the text. This was called his own city, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span>, &amp;c., and here, as a citizen, he paid the half shekel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:24">Matthew 17:24</span>. Among the Jews, if a man became a resident in any city for twelve months, he thereby became a citizen, and paid his proportion of dues and taxes. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. Capernaum is well known to have been the principal scene of our Lord's miracles during the three years of his public ministry.</p>
<p><i>Zabulon</i>, the country of this tribe, in which Nazareth and Capernaum were situated, bordered on the lake of Gennesareth, stretching to the frontiers of Sidon, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:13">Genesis 49:13</span>. Nephthalim was contiguous to it, and both were on the east side of Jordan, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:34">Joshua 19:34</span>.</p>
