<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:15">Matthew 4:15</span>. <i><b>Galilee of the Gentiles</b></i> — Or of the <i>nations</i>. So called, because it was inhabited by <i>Egyptians, Arabians</i>, and <i>Phoenicians</i>, according to the testimony of <i>Strabo</i> and others. The Hebrew גוים <i>goyim</i>, and the Greek εθνων, signify <i>nations</i>; and, in the Old and New Testaments, mean those people who were not descendants of any of the <i>twelve</i> tribes. The word Gentiles, from <i>gens</i>, a <i>nation</i>, signifies the same. It is worthy of remark, that it was a regular tradition among the ancient Jews, that the Messiah should begin his ministry in Galilee. See the proofs in <i>Schoetgen</i>.</p>
