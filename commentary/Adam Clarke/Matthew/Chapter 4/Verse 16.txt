<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:16">Matthew 4:16</span>. <i><b>The people which sat in darkness</b></i> — This is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span>, where, instead of <i>sitting</i>, the prophet used the word <i>walked</i>. The evangelist might on purpose <i>change</i> the term, to point out the <i>increased</i> misery of the state of these persons. <i>Sitting in</i> <i>darkness</i> expresses a greater degree of intellectual blindness, than <i>walking in darkness</i> does. In the time of Christ's appearing, the people were in a much worse state than in the time of the prophet, which was nearly 700 years before; as, during all this period, they were growing more ignorant and sinful.</p>
<p><i><b>The region and shadow of death</b></i> — These words are amazingly descriptive. <i>A region of death </i>- DEATH'S <i>country</i>, where, in a peculiar manner, <i>Death</i> lived, reigned, and triumphed, subjecting all the people to his sway.</p>
<p><i><b>Shadow of death</b></i> — σκια θανατου, used only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79">Luke 1:79</span>, but often in the Old Covenant, where the Hebrew is צל מות <i>tsal</i> <i>maveth</i>, It is not easy to enter fully into the ideal meaning of this term. As in the former clause, <i>death</i> is <i>personified</i>, so here. A <i>shadow</i> is that darkness cast upon a place by a body raised between it and the light or sun. <i>Death</i> is here represented as standing between the land above mentioned, and the <i>light</i> of <i>life</i>, or <i>Sun</i> of <i>righteousness</i>; in consequence of which, all the inhabitants were, involved in a continual cloud of intellectual darkness, misery, and sin. The heavenly sun was continually <i>eclipsed</i> to them, till this glorious time, when Jesus Christ, the <i>true light</i>, shone forth in the beauty of holiness and truth. Christ began his ministry in Galilee, and frequented this uncultivated place more than he did Jerusalem and other parts of Judea: here his preaching was peculiarly needful; and by this was the prophecy fulfilled.</p>
