<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span>. <i><b>Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent</b></i> — See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. Every preacher commissioned by God to proclaim salvation to a lost world, begins his work with preaching the doctrine of <i>repentance</i>. This was the case with all the <i>prophets</i>, <i>John the Baptist, Jesus Christ</i>, all the <i>apostles</i>, and all their genuine <i>successors</i> in the Christian ministry. The reasons are evident in the notes already referred to; and for the explanation of the word κηρυσσειν, <i>preaching</i> or <i>proclaiming as a herald</i>, see at the end of chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:0">Matthew 3:0</span>.</p>
