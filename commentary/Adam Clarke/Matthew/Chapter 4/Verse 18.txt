<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>. <i><b>Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother</b></i> — Why did not Jesus Christ call some of the eminent <i>Scribes</i> or <i>Pharisees</i> to publish his Gospel, and not poor unlearned fishermen, without credit or authority? Because it was the <i>kingdom of heaven</i> they were to preach, and their teaching must come from <i>above</i>: besides, the conversion of sinners, though it be effected instrumentally by the preaching of the Gospel, yet the grand agent in it is the <i>Spirit of God</i>. As the <i>instruments</i> were comparatively <i>mean</i>, and, the work which was accomplished by them was <i>grand</i> and <i>glorious</i>, the excellency of the power at once appeared to be of GOD, and not of <i>man</i>; and thus the glory, due alone to <i>his</i> name, was secured, and the great Operator of all good had the deserved praise. <i>Seminaries</i> of <i>learning</i>, in the order of God's providence and grace, have great and important uses; and, in reference to such uses, they should be treated with great respect: but to make preachers of the Gospel is a matter to which they are utterly inadequate; it is a, prerogative that God never did, and never will, delegate to man.</p>
<p>Where the seed of the kingdom of God is sowed, and a dispensation of the Gospel is committed to a man, a good education may be of great and general use: but it no more follows, because a man has had a good education, that therefore he is qualified to preach the Gospel, than it does, that because he has not had that, therefore he is unqualified; for there may be much ignorance of Divine things where there is much human learning; and a man may be well taught in the things of God, and be able to teach others, who has not had the advantages of a liberal education.</p>
<p><i>Men-made ministers</i> have almost ruined the heritage of God. To prevent this, our Church requires that a man be <i>inwardly moved</i> to take upon himself this ministry, before he can be ordained to it. And he who cannot say, that he <i>trusts</i> (has rational and Scriptural conviction) <i>that he is moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon</i> <i>himself this office</i>, is an intruder into the heritage of God, and his ordination, <i>ipso facto</i>, vitiated and of none effect. See the truly apostolic <i>Ordination Service</i> of the Church of England.</p>
<p><i><b>Fishers.</b></i> — Persons employed in a lawful and profitable avocation, and faithfully discharging their duty in it. It was a tradition of the elders, that one of Joshua's <i>ten</i> precepts was, that all men should have an equal right to spread their nets and fish in the sea of Tiberias, or Galilee. The persons mentioned here were doubtless men of pure morals; for the minister of God should have a good report from them that are without.</p>
