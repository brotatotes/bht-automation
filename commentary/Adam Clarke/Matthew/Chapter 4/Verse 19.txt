<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:19">Matthew 4:19</span>. <i><b>Follow me</b></i> — <i>Come after me</i>, δευτε οπισω μου. Receive my doctrines, imitate me in my conduct - in every respect be my disciples. We may observe that most of the calls of God to man are expressed in a few solemn words, which alarm, the conscience, and deeply impress the heart.</p>
<p><i><b>I will make you fishers of men.</b></i> — Ezekiel <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:8-10">Ezekiel 47:8-10</span>, casts much light on this place; and to this prophet our Lord probably alludes. To follow Christ, and be admitted into a partnership of his ministry, is a great honour; but those only who are by <i>himself</i> fitted for it, God calls. Miserable are those who do not wait for this call - who presume to take the name of <i>fishers of men</i>, and know not how to cast the net of the Divine word, because not brought to an acquaintance with the saving power of the God who bought them. Such persons, having only their <i>secular</i> interest in view, study not to catch men, but to catch money: and though, for charity's sake, it may be said of a pastor of this spirit, he does not enter the sheepfold as a <i>thief</i>, yet he certainly lives as a <i>hireling</i>.
