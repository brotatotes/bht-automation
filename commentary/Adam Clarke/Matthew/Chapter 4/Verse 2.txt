<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:2">Matthew 4:2</span>. <i><b>And when he had fasted forty days</b></i> â€” It is remarkable that <i>Moses</i>, the great lawgiver of the Jews, previously to his receiving the law from God, fasted forty days in the mount; that <i>Elijah</i>, the chief of the prophets, fasted also forty days; and that Christ, the giver of the New Covenant, should act in the same way. Was not all this intended to show, that God's kingdom on earth was to be <i>spiritual</i> and <i>Divine</i>? - that it should not consist in meat and drink, but in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>. Relative to the forty days' fast of Moses, there is a beautiful saying in the Talmudists. "Is it possible that any man can fast forty days and forty nights? To which Rabbi Meir answered, When thou takest up thy abode in any particular city, thou must live according to its customs. Moses ascended to heaven, where they neither eat nor drink therefore he became assimilated to them. We are accustomed to eat and drink; and, when angels descend to us, they eat and drink also." Moses, Elijah, and our blessed Lord could fast forty days and forty nights, because they were in communion with God, and living a heavenly life.</p>
