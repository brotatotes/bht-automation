<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:20">Matthew 4:20</span>. <i><b>They straightway left</b></i><b> their </b><i><b>nets</b></i> â€” A change, as far as it respected secular things, every way to their disadvantage. The proud and the profane may exult and say, "Such preachers as these cannot be much injured by their sacrifices of <i>secular</i> property - they have nothing but <i>nets</i>, c., to leave." Let such carpers at the institution of Christ know, that he who has <i>nothing</i> but a <i>net</i>, and leaves <i>that</i> for the sake of doing good to the souls of men, leaves his ALL: besides, he lived comfortably by his net before but, in becoming the servant of all for Christ's sake, he often exposes himself to the want of even a morsel of bread.
