<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>. <i><b>Teaching in their synagogues</b></i> — <i>Synagogue</i>, συναγωγη, from συν, <i>together</i>, and αγω, <i>I bring</i>, a public assembly of persons, or the <i>place</i> where such persons publicly assembled. <i>Synagogues</i>, among the Jews, were not probably older than the return from the Babylonish captivity. They were erected not only in cities and towns, but in the country, and especially by rivers, that they might have water for the convenience of their frequent washings.</p>
<p>Not less than ten persons of respectability composed a synagogue; as the rabbins supposed that this number of persons, of independent property, and well skilled in the law, were necessary to conduct the affairs of the place, and keep up the Divine worship. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. Therefore, where this number could not be found, no synagogue was built; but there might be many synagogues in one city or town, provided it were populous. Jerusalem is said to have contained 480. This need not be wondered at, when it is considered that every Jew was obliged to worship God in public, either in a <i>synagogue</i> or in the <i>temple</i>.</p>
<p>The chief things belonging to a synagogue were:</p>
<p>1st. The <i>ark</i> or <i>chest</i>, made after the mode of the ark of the covenant, containing the <i>Pentateuch</i>.</p>
<p>2dly. The <i>pulpit</i> and <i>desk</i>, in the middle of the synagogue, on which he stood who read or expounded the law.</p>
<p>3dly. The <i>seats</i> or <i>pews</i> for the men below, and the <i>galleries</i> for the women above.</p>
<p>4thly. The <i>lamps</i> to give light in the evening service, and at the feast of the dedication. And,</p>
<p>5thly. <i>Apartments</i> for the <i>utensils</i> and <i>alms-chests</i>.</p>
<p>The synagogue was governed by a council or assembly, over whom was a president, called in the Gospels, <i>the ruler of the</i> <i>synagogue</i>. These are sometimes called <i>chiefs of the Jews</i>, the <i>rulers</i>, the <i>priests</i> or <i>elders</i>, the <i>governors</i>, the <i>overseers</i>, the <i>fathers of the synagogue</i>. Service was performed in them three times a day - <i>morning, afternoon</i>, and <i>night</i>. Synagogue, among the Jews, had often the same meaning as <i>congregation</i> among us, or place of judicature, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Preaching the Gospel of the kingdom</b></i> — Or, <i>proclaiming the glad</i> <i>tidings of the kingdom</i>. See the preceding notes. Behold here the perfect pattern of an evangelical preacher:</p>
<p>1. He goes about seeking sinners on every side, that he may show them the way to heaven.</p>
<p>2. He proclaims the glad tidings of the kingdom, with a freedom worthy of the King whom he serves.</p>
<p>3. He makes his reputation and the confidence of the people subservient not to his own interest, but to the salvation of souls.</p>
<p>4. To his preaching he joins, as far as he has ability, all works of mercy, and temporal assistance to the bodies of men.</p>
<p>5. He takes care to inform men that diseases, and all kinds of temporal evils, are the effects of sin, and that their hatred to iniquity should increase in proportion to the evils they endure through it.</p>
<p>6. And that nothing but the <i>power of God</i> can save them from <i>sin</i> and its <i>consequences</i>.</p>
<p>For <i>glad tidings</i>, or <i>Gospel</i>, see chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:0">Matthew 1:0</span>. title. <i>Proclaiming</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>, and end; and for the meaning of <i>kingdom</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>All manner of sickness, and all manner of disease</b></i> — There is a difference between νοσος, translated here <i>sickness</i>, and μαλακια, translated <i>disease</i>. The first is thus defined: νοσος, την χρονιαν κακοπαθειαν, a disease of some standing, a <i>chronic</i> disorder.</p>
<p><i>Infirmity</i>, μαλακια, την προσκαιρον ανωμαλιαν· τοι σωματος, a <i>temporary</i> disorder of the body. <i>Theophylact</i>. This is a proper distinction, and is necessary to be observed.</p>
