<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>. <i><b>Sick people</b></i> — Τους, κακως εχοντας, <i>those who felt</i> <i>ill </i>- were afflicted with any species of malady.</p>
<p><i><b>And torments</b></i> — βασανοις, from βασανιζω, to <i>examine by</i> <i>torture</i>, such as <i>cholics, gouts</i>, and <i>rheumatisms</i>, which racked every joint.</p>
<p><i><b>Possessed with devils</b></i> — <i>Daemoniacs</i>. Persons possessed by evil spirits. This is certainly the plain obvious meaning of <i>daemoniac</i> in the Gospels.</p>
<p>Many eminent men think that the sacred writers accommodated themselves to the unfounded prejudices of the common people, in attributing certain diseases to the influence of evil spirits, which were merely the effects of natural causes: but that this explanation can never comport with the accounts given of these persons shall be proved as the places occur.</p>
<p>Our common version, which renders the word, <i>those possessed by</i> <i>devils</i>, is not strictly correct; as the word <i>devil</i>, διαβολος, is not found in the <i>plural</i> in any part of the Sacred Writings, when speaking of evil spirits: for though there are multitudes of <i>daemons</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:9">Mark 5:9</span>, yet it appears there is but <i>one</i> DEVIL, who seems to be <i>supreme</i>, or <i>head</i>, over all the rest. διαβολος signifies an <i>accuser</i> or slanderer, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:3">2 Timothy 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>. Perhaps Satan was called so,</p>
<p>1st. because he <i>accused</i> or <i>slandered</i> God in paradise, as averse from the increase of man's knowledge and happiness, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:5">Genesis 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>; and</p>
<p>2dly. because he is the <i>accuser of men</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9-10">Revelation 12:9-10</span>. <i>See also Clarke on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+1:2">Job 1:2</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p>The word comes from δια, <i>through</i>, and βαλλειν, <i>to cast</i>, or <i>shoot</i>, because of the influence of his evil suggestions; compared, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>, to <i>fiery darts</i>; and thus it is nearly of the same meaning with οπειραζων, he who <i>pierces through</i>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Lunatic</b></i> — Persons afflicted with <i>epileptic</i> or other disorders, which are always known to have a singular increase at the <i>change</i> and <i>full</i> of the <i>moon</i>. This undoubtedly proceeds from the superadded <i>attractive</i> influence of the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i> upon the earth's atmosphere, as, in the periods mentioned above, these two luminaries are both in <i>conjunction</i>; and their united attractive power being exerted on the earth at the same time, not only causes the <i>flux</i> and <i>reflux</i> of the ocean, but occasions a variety of important <i>changes</i> in the bodies of infirm persons, of animals in general, but more particularly in those who are more sensible of these variations. And is this any wonder, when it is well known, that a very slight alteration in the <i>atmosphere</i> causes the most uncomfortable sensations to a number of invalids! But sometimes even these diseases were caused by demons. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:16">Matthew 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:34">Matthew 8:34</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:15">Matthew 17:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Palsy</b></i> — Palsy is defined, <i>a sudden loss of tone and vital power</i> <i>in a certain part of the human body</i>. This may affect a limb, the whole side, the tongue, or the whole body. This disorder is in general <i>incurable</i>, except by the <i>miraculous</i> power of God, unless in its slighter stages.</p>
<p><i><b>He healed them.</b></i> — Either with a word or a touch; and thus proved that all nature was under his control.</p>
