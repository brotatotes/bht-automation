<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span>. <i><b>And when the tempter</b></i> — This onset of Satan was made (speaking after the manner of men) <i>judiciously</i>: he came when Jesus, after having fasted forty days and forty nights, was hungry: now, as hunger naturally diminishes the strength of the body, the mind gets enfeebled, and becomes easily irritated; and if much <i>watching</i> and <i>prayer</i> be not employed, the uneasiness which is occasioned by a lack of food may soon produce <i>impatience</i>, and in this state of mind the tempter has great advantages. The following advice of an Arabian philosopher to his son is worthy of attention. "My son, never go out of the house in the morning, till thou hast eaten something: by so doing, thy mind will be more firm; and, shouldest thou be insulted by any person, thou wilt find thyself more disposed to suffer patiently: for hunger dries up and disorders the brain." Bibliot. Orient. Suppl. p. 449. The state of our bodily health and worldly circumstances may afford our adversary many opportunities of doing us immense mischief. In such cases, the sin to which we are tempted may be justly termed, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>, την ευπεριστατον αμαρτιαν, <i>the well circumstanced sin</i>, because all the circumstances of <i>time, place</i>, and <i>state</i> of <i>body</i> and <i>mind</i>, are favourable to it.</p>
<p><i><b>If thou be the Son of God</b></i> — Or, <i>a son of God</i>, υιος του Θεου. υιος is here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:3">Luke 4:3</span>, written without the article; and therefore should not be translated THE <i>Son</i>, as if it were ουιος, which is a phrase that is applicable to Christ as <i>the Messiah</i>: but it is certain, whatever Satan might <i>suspect</i>, he did not fully <i>know</i> that the person he tempted was the <i>true Messiah</i>. Perhaps one grand object of his temptation was to find this out.</p>
<p><i><b>Command that these stones</b></i> — The meaning of this temptation is: "Distrust the Divine providence and support, and make use of illicit means to supply thy necessities."</p>
