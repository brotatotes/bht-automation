<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:4">Matthew 4:4</span>. <i><b>But by</b></i> (or, <i>upon</i>, επι)<b> </b><i><b>every word</b></i> — ρημα, in Greek, answers to דבר <i>dabar</i> in Hebrew, which means not only <i>a word</i> <i>spoken</i>, but also <i>thing, purpose, appointment</i>, c. Our Lord's meaning seems to be this: God purposes the welfare of his creatures - all his appointments are calculated to promote this end. Some of them may appear to man to have a contrary tendency but even <i>fasting</i> itself, when used in consequence of a Divine injunction, becomes a mean of supporting that life which it seems naturally calculated to impair or destroy.</p>
