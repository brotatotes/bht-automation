<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:5">Matthew 4:5</span>. <i><b>Pinnacle of the temple</b></i> — It is very likely that this was what was called the στοα βασιλικη, <i>the king's gallery</i>; which, as Josephus says, "deserves to be mentioned among the most magnificent things under the sun: for upon a stupendous depth of a valley, scarcely to be fathomed by the eye of him that stands above, Herod erected a gallery of a vast height, from the top of which if any looked down, he would grow dizzy, his eyes not being able to reach so vast a depth." - <i>Ant</i>. l. xv. c. 14. See Dr. <i>Lightfoot</i> on this place.</p>
