<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span>. <i><b>An exceeding high mountain, and showeth him</b></i> — If the words, <i>all the kingdoms of the world</i>, be taken in a literal sense, then this must have been a visionary representation, as the highest mountain on the face of the globe could not suffice to make evident even one hemisphere of the earth, and the other must of necessity be in darkness.</p>
<p>But if we take the <i>world</i> to mean only the land of Judea, and some of the surrounding nations, as it appears sometimes to signify, (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>), then the mountain described by the Abbe <i>Mariti</i> (Travels through Cyprus, c.) could have afforded the prospect in question. Speaking of it, he says, "Here we enjoyed the most beautiful prospect imaginable. This part of the mountain overlooks the <i>mountains of Arabia</i>, the <i>country of Gilead</i>, the <i>country of the Amorites</i>, the <i>plains of Moab</i>, the <i>plains of</i> <i>Jericho</i>, the <i>river Jordan</i>, and the <i>whole extent of the Dead Sea</i>. It was here that the devil said to the Son of God, <i>All these</i> <i>kingdoms will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me</i>." Probably St. Matthew, in the Hebrew original, wrote הארץ <i>haarets</i>, which signifies the <i>world</i>, the <i>earth</i>, and often the <i>land of Judea</i> only. What renders this more probable is, that at this time Judea was divided into several kingdoms, or governments under the three sons of Herod the Great, viz. Archelaus, Antipas, and Philip which are not only called ethnarchs and tetrarchs in the Gospels, but also βασιλεις, <i>kings</i>, and are said βασιλευειν, to <i>reign</i>, as Rosenmuller has properly remarked.
