<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>. <i><b>And seeing the multitudes</b></i> — τους οχλους, <i>these</i> <i>multitudes</i>, viz. those mentioned in the preceding verse, which should make the first verse of this chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>He went up into a mountain</b></i> — That he might have the greater advantage of speaking, so as to be heard by that great concourse of people which followed him. It is very probable that nothing more is meant here than a small hill or eminence. Had he been on a high mountain they could not have heard; and, had he been at a great distance, he would not have <i>sat down</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And when he was set</b></i> — The usual posture of public teachers among the Jews, and among many other people. Hence <i>sitting</i> was a synonymous term for <i>teaching</i> among the rabbins.</p>
<p><i><b>His disciples</b></i> — The word μαθητης signifies literally a <i>scholar</i>. Those who originally followed Christ, considered him in the light of a <i>Divine teacher</i>; and conscious of <i>their</i> ignorance, and the importance of <i>his</i> teaching, they put themselves under his tuition, that they might be instructed in heavenly things. Having been taught the mysteries of the kingdom of God, they became closely attached to their Divine Master, imitating his life and manners; and recommending his salvation to all the circle of their acquaintance. This is <i>still</i> the characteristic of a genuine disciple of Christ.</p>
