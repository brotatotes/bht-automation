<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11">Matthew 5:11</span>. <i><b>When</b></i><b> men </b><i><b>shall revile you, and persecute</b></i> — The persecution mentioned in the preceding verse comprehends all <i>outward</i> acts of <i>violence </i>- all that the <i>hand</i> can do. This comprehends all <i>calumny, slander</i>, &amp;c., all that the <i>tongue</i> can effect. But as διωκειν, which we render <i>to persecute</i>, is a forensic term, and signifies legal persecutions and public accusations, which, though totally unsubstantiated, were the means of destroying multitudes of the primitive Christians, our Lord probably refers to such. No Protestant can think, without horror, of the great numbers burnt alive in this country, on such accusations, under the <i>popish</i> reign of her who is emphatically called <i>Bloody Queen Mary</i>.</p>
