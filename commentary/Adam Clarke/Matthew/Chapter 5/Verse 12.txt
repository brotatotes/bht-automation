Verse Matthew 5:12. Rejoice — In the testimony of a good conscience; for, without this, suffering has nothing but misery in it.Be exceeding glad — αγαλλιασθε, leap for joy. There are several cases on record, where this was literally done by the martyrs, in Queen Mary's days.Great is your reward in heaven — In the Talmudical tract Pirkey Aboth, are these words: "Rabbi Tarpon said, The day is short: the work is great: the labourers are slow: the REWARD IS GREAT: and the father of the family is urgent."The followers of Christ are encouraged to suffer joyfully on two considerations.1. They are thereby conformed to the prophets who went before.2. Their reward in heaven is a great one.God gives the grace to suffer, and then crowns that grace with glory; hence it is plain, the reward is not of debt, but of grace: Romans 6:23.
