<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:12">Matthew 5:12</span>. <i><b>Rejoice</b></i> — In the testimony of a good conscience; for, without this, suffering has nothing but <i>misery</i> in it.</p>
<p><i><b>Be exceeding glad</b></i> — αγαλλιασθε, <i>leap for joy</i>. There are several cases on record, where this was <i>literally</i> done by the martyrs, in Queen Mary's days.</p>
<p><i><b>Great</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>your reward in heaven</b></i> — In the Talmudical tract <i>Pirkey</i> <i>Aboth</i>, are these words: "Rabbi <i>Tarpon</i> said, The day is short: the work is great: the labourers are slow: the REWARD IS GREAT: and the father of the family is urgent."</p>
<p>The followers of Christ are encouraged to suffer joyfully on two considerations.</p>
<p>1. They are thereby conformed to the prophets who went before.</p>
<p>2. Their reward in heaven is a great one.</p>
<p>God gives the grace to suffer, and then crowns that grace with glory; hence it is plain, the reward is not of <i>debt</i>, but of <i>grace</i>: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>.</p>
