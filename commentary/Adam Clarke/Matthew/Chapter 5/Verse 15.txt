<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15">Matthew 5:15</span>. <i><b>Neither do men light a candle and put it under a</b></i><b> </b><i><b>bushel</b></i> — A bushel μοδιος: - a measure both among the Greeks and Romans, containing a little more than a <i>peck</i> English. From some ancient writers we learn, that only those who had bad designs hid a candle under a bushel; that, in the dead of the night, when all were asleep, they might rise up, and have light at hand to help them to effect their horrid purposes of murder, &amp;c. See <i>Wetstein</i>, <i>Kypke, Wolf</i>, &amp;c.</p>
