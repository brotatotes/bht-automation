<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:16">Matthew 5:16</span>. <i><b>Let your light so shine</b></i> — Or more literally, <i>Thus let</i> <i>your light shine</i>, ουτω λαμψατω το φως. As the sun is lighted up in the firmament of heaven to diffuse its light and heat freely to every inhabitant of the earth; and as the lamp is not set under the bushel, but placed upon the lamp-stand that it may give light to all in the house; THUS let every follower of Christ, and especially every preacher of the Gospel, diffuse the <i>light</i> of heavenly knowledge, and the <i>warmth</i> of Divine love through the whole circle of their acquaintance.</p>
<p><i><b>That they may see your good works</b></i> — It is not sufficient to have light - we must walk in the light, and by the light. Our whole conduct should be a perpetual comment on the doctrine we have received, and a constant exemplification of its power and truth.</p>
<p><i><b>And glorify your Father</b></i> — The following curious saying is found in <i>Bammidbar Rabba</i>, s. 15. "The Israelites said to the holy blessed God, Thou commandest us to light lamps to thee; and yet thou art the, Light of the world, and with thee the light dwelleth. The holy blessed God answered, I do not command this because I need light; but that you may reflect light upon me, as I have illuminated you: - that the people may say, Behold, how the Israelites illustrate him, who illuminates them in the sight of the whole earth." See more in <i>Schoettgen</i>. Real Christians are the <i>children</i> of God - they are partakers of his holy and happy nature: they should ever be concerned for their Father's honour, and endeavour so to recommend him, and his salvation, that others may be prevailed on to come to the light, and walk in it. Then God is said to be glorified, when the glorious power of his grace is manifested in the salvation of men.</p>
