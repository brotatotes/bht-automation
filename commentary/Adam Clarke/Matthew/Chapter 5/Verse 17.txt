<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>. <i><b>Think not that I am come to destroy the law</b></i> — <i>Do not</i> <i>imagine that I am come to violate the law</i> καταλυσαι, from κατα, and λυω, <i>I loose, violate</i>, or <i>dissolve </i>- I am not come to make the law of none effect-to <i>dissolve</i> the connection which subsists between its several parts, or the obligation men are under to have their lives regulated by its moral precepts; nor am I come to <i>dissolve</i> the <i>connecting</i> reference it has to the <i>good things</i> <i>promised</i>. But I am come, πληρωσαι, to <i>complete </i>- to perfect its connection and reference, to accomplish every thing shadowed forth in the Mosaic <i>ritual</i>, to fill up its great design; and to give grace to all my followers, πληρωσαι, to <i>fill up</i>, or <i>complete</i>, every moral duty. In a word, Christ completed the law:</p>
<p>1st. In <i>itself</i>, it was only the <i>shadow</i>, the <i>typical representation</i>, of good things to come; and he <i>added</i> to it that which was necessary to make it perfect, HIS OWN SACRIFICE, without which it could neither satisfy God, nor sanctify men.</p>
<p>2dly. He completed it <i>in</i> <i>himself</i> by submitting to its types with an exact obedience, and verifying them by his death upon the cross.</p>
<p>3dly. He completes this law, and the sayings of his prophets, <i>in his members</i>, by giving them grace to love the Lord with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength, and their neighbour as themselves; for this is all the <i>law</i> and the <i>prophets</i>.</p>
<p>It is worthy of observation, that the word גמר <i>gamar</i>, among the rabbins, signifies not only to <i>fulfil</i>, but also to <i>teach</i>; and, consequently, we may infer that our Lord intimated, that the law and the prophets were still to be taught or inculcated by him and his disciples; and this he and they have done in the most pointed manner. See the Gospels and epistles; and see especially this sermon on the mount, the Epistle of James, and the Epistle to the Hebrews. And this meaning of the word gives the clear sense of the apostle's words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:25">Colossians 1:25</span>. <i>Whereof I am made a minister</i>, πληρωσαι τον λογον του Θεου, <i>to</i> <i>fulfil the word of God</i>, i.e. to <i>teach</i> the <i>doctrine</i> of God.</p>
