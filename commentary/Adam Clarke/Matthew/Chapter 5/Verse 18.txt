<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:18">Matthew 5:18</span>. <i><b>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven</b></i> — In the very <i>commencement</i> of his ministry, Jesus Christ teaches the <i>instability</i> of all visible things. "The heaven which you see, and which is so glorious, and the earth which you inhabit and love, <i>shall pass</i> <i>away</i>; for the things which are seen are temporal, προσκαιρα, <i>are</i> <i>for a time</i>; but the things which are not seen are eternal αιωνια, <i>ever-during</i>," <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:18">2 Corinthians 4:18</span>. And the WORD of the Lord endureth for ever.</p>
<p><i><b>One jot or one tittle</b></i> — One yod, (י), the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet. One <i>tittle</i> or <i>point</i>, κεραια, either meaning those <i>points</i> which serve for vowels in this language, if they then existed; or the <i>seraphs</i>, or points of certain letters, such as ר <i>resh</i>, or ד <i>daleth</i>, ה he, or ח <i>cheth</i> (as the change of any of these into the other would make a most essential alteration in the sense, or, as the rabbins say, destroy the world.) Or our Lord may refer to the little ornaments which certain letters assume on their tops, which cause them to appear like small <i>branches</i>. The following letters only can assume coronal <i>apices</i>, ץ tsaddi - ג gimel - ז zain - נ nun - ט teth - ע ayin - ש shin. These, with the <i>coronal apices</i>, often appear in MSS.</p>
<p>That this saying, <i>one jot or one tittle</i>, is a proverbial mode of expression among the Jews, and that it expressed the meaning given to it above, is amply proved by the extracts in <i>Lightfoot</i> and <i>Schoettgen</i>. The reader will not be displeased to find a few of them here, if he can bear with the <i>allegorical</i> and strongly figurative language of the rabbins.</p>
<p>"The book of Deuteronomy came and prostrated itself before the Lord, and said: 'O Lord of the world, thou hast written in me thy law; but now, a Testament defective in some parts is defective in all. Behold, Solomon endeavours to root the letter <i>yod</i> out of me.' (In this text, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+17:5">Deuteronomy 17:5</span>. לא ירבה נשים lo yirbeh, nashim, <i>he shall not multiply wives</i>.) The holy blessed God answered, 'Solomon and a thousand such as he <i>shall perish, but the least word shall not perish out of thee</i>.'"</p>
<p>In <i>Shir Hashirim Rabba</i>, are these words: "Should all the inhabitants of the earth gather together, in order to <i>whiten</i> one feather of a <i>crow</i>, they could not succeed: so, if all the inhabitants of the earth should unite to abolish one י <i>yod</i>, which is the smallest letter in the whole law, they should not be able to effect it."</p>
<p>In <i>Vayikra Rabba</i>, s. 19, it is said: "Should any person in the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4">Deuteronomy 6:4</span>, <i>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is</i> אחד achad, ONE <i>Lord</i>, change the ד <i>daleth</i> into a ר <i>resh</i>, he would ruin the world." [Because, in that case, the word אחר <i>achar</i>, would signify a <i>strange</i> or <i>false God</i>.]</p>
<p>"Should any one, in the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:14">Exodus 34:14</span>, <i>Thou shalt worship no</i> OTHER, אחר <i>achar, God</i>, change ר <i>resh</i> into ד <i>daleth</i>, he would ruin the world." [Because the command would then run, <i>Thou shalt not worship the</i> ONLY or <i>true God</i>.]</p>
<p>"Should any one in the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+22:32">Leviticus 22:32</span>, <i>Neither shall ye</i> PROFANE תחללו <i>techelelu, my holy name</i>, change ח <i>cheth</i> into ה <i>he</i>, he would ruin the world." [Because the sense of the commandment would then be, <i>Neither shall ye</i> PRAISE <i>my</i> <i>holy name</i>.]</p>
<p>"Should any one, in the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+150:6">Psalms 150:6</span>, <i>Let every thing that hath breath</i> PRAISE, תהלל <i>tehalel</i>, the Lord, change ה <i>he</i> into ח <i>cheth</i>, he would ruin the world." [Because the command would then run, <i>Let every thing that hath breath</i> PROFANE <i>the Lord</i>.]</p>
<p>"Should any one, in the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+5:10">Jeremiah 5:10</span>, <i>They lied</i> AGAINST <i>the Lord</i>, ביהוה beihovah, change ב <i>beth</i> into כ <i>caph</i>, he would ruin the world." [For then the words would run, <i>They lied</i> LIKE <i>the Lord</i>.]</p>
<p>"Should any one, in the words of Hosea, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+5:7">Hosea 5:7</span>, <i>They have dealt treacherously</i>, ביהוה beihovah, AGAINST <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i>, change ב <i>beth</i> into כ <i>caph</i>, he would ruin the world." [For then the words would run, <i>They have dealt</i> <i>treacherously</i> LIKE <i>the Lord</i>.]</p>
<p>"Should any one, in the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+2:2">1 Samuel 2:2</span>, <i>There is none holy</i> AS <i>the Lord</i>, change כ <i>caph</i> into ב <i>beth</i>, he would ruin the world." [For then the words would mean, <i>There is no holiness</i> IN <i>the Lord</i>.]</p>
<p>These examples fully prove that the μιακεραια of our Lord, refers to the <i>apices, points</i>, or <i>corners</i>, that distinguish ב <i>beth</i> from כ <i>caph</i>; ח cheth from ה <i>he</i>; and ר <i>resh</i> from ד <i>daleth</i>. For the reader will at once perceive, how easily a כ <i>caph</i> may be turned into a ב <i>beth</i>; a ה <i>he</i> into a ח <i>cheth</i>; and a ר <i>resh</i> into a ד <i>daleth</i>: and he will also see of what infinite consequence it is to <i>write</i> and <i>print</i> such letters <i>correctly</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Till all be fulfilled.</b></i> — Or, <i>accomplished</i>. Though all earth and hell should join together to hinder the accomplishment of the great designs of the Most High, yet it shall all be in vain - even the sense of a single letter shall not be lost. The <i>words</i> of God, which point out his designs, are as unchangeable as his <i>nature</i> itself. Every sinner, who perseveres in his iniquity, shall surely be punished with separation from God and the glory of his power; and every soul that turns to God, through Christ, shall as surely be saved, as that Jesus himself hath died.</p>
