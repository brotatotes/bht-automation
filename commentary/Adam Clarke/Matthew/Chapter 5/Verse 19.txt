<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:19">Matthew 5:19</span>. <i><b>Whosoever - shall break one of these least</b></i><b> </b><i><b>commandments</b></i> â€” The Pharisees were remarkable for making a distinction between weightier and lighter matters in the law, and between what has been called, in a corrupt part of the Christian Church, <i>mortal</i> and <i>venial sins</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:36">Matthew 22:36</span>.</p>
<p><i>Whosoever shall break</i>. What an awful consideration is this! He who, by his mode of <i>acting, speaking</i>, or <i>explaining</i> the words of God, sets the holy precept <i>aside</i>, or explains away its <i>force</i> and <i>meaning, shall be called least </i>- shall have no place in the kingdom of Christ here, nor in the kingdom of glory above. That this is the meaning of these words is evident enough from the following verse.</p>
