<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>. <i><b>Except your righteousness shall exceed</b></i> — περισσευση, <i>Unless your righteousness abound more </i>- unless it take in, not only the <i>letter</i>, but the <i>spirit</i> and <i>design</i> of the <i>moral</i> and <i>ritual</i> precept; the one directing you how to <i>walk</i> so as to please God; the other pointing out Christ, the great Atonement, through and by which a sinner is enabled to do so - <i>more than that of the</i> <i>scribes and Pharisees</i>, who only attend to the <i>letter</i> of the law, and had indeed made even that of no effect by their traditions - <i>ye</i> <i>shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven</i>. This fully explains the meaning of the preceding verse. The old English word is [Anglo-Saxon], <i>right-wiseness</i>, i.e. <i>complete, thorough, excellent</i> WISDOM.
