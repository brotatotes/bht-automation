<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21">Matthew 5:21</span>. <i><b>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time</b></i> — τοις αρχαιοις, <i>to</i> or <i>by the ancients</i>. By the <i>ancients</i>, we may understand those who lived <i>before</i> the law, and those who lived <i>under</i> it; for murder was, in the most solemn manner, forbidden <i>before</i>, as well as <i>under</i>, the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:5-6">Genesis 9:5-6</span>.</p>
<p>But it is very likely that our Lord refers here merely to traditions and glosses relative to the ancient Mosaic ordinance; and such as, by their operation, rendered the primitive command of little or no effect. <i>Murder</i> from the beginning has been punished with death; and it is, probably, the only crime that should be punished with <i>death</i>. There is much reason to doubt, whether the punishment of <i>death</i>, inflicted for any other crime, is not in itself <i>murder</i>, whatever the authority may be that has instituted it. GOD, and the greatest <i>legislators</i> that have ever been in the universe, are of the same opinion. See <i>Montesquieu, Blackstone</i>, and the Marquis <i>Beccaria</i>, and the arguments and testimonies lately produced by Sir <i>Samuel Romilly</i>, in his motion for the amendment of the criminal laws of this kingdom. It is very remarkable, that the criminal code published by Joseph II., late emperor of Germany, though it consists of <i>seventy-one</i> capital crimes, has not <i>death</i> attached to any of them. Even <i>murder</i>, with all intention to <i>rob</i>, is punished only with "<i>imprisonment for</i> thirty <i>years, to lie</i> <i>on the floor, to have no nourishment but bread and water, to be</i> <i>closely chained, and to be publicly whipped once a year, with less</i> <i>than</i> one hundred <i>lashes</i>." See <i>Colquhoun</i> on the Police of the City of London, p. 272.</p>
