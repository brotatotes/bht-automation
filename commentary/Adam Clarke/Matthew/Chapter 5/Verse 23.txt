<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:23">Matthew 5:23</span>. <i><b>Therefore if thou bring thy gift</b></i> â€” Evil must be nipped in the bud. An unkind thought of another may be the <i>foundation</i> of that which leads to actual <i>murder</i>. A Christian, properly speaking, cannot be an enemy to any man; nor is he to consider any man his enemy, without the fullest evidence: for surmises to the prejudice of another can never rest in the bosom of him who has the love of God in his heart, for to him all men are <i>brethren</i>. He sees all men as children of God, and members of Christ, or at least capable of becoming such. If a tender forgiving spirit was required, even in a <i>Jew</i>, when he approached God's altar with a bullock or a lamb, how much more necessary is this in a man who professes to be a follower of the <i>Lamb of God</i>; especially when he receives the symbols of that Sacrifice which was offered for the life of the world, in what is commonly called the sacrament of the Lord's supper!</p>
