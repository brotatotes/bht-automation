<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:24">Matthew 5:24</span>. <i><b>Leave there thy gift before the altar</b></i> — This is as much as to say, "Do not attempt to bring any offering to God while thou art in a spirit of enmity against any person; or hast any difference with thy neighbour, which thou hast not used thy diligence to get adjusted." It is our duty and interest, both to bring our gift, and offer it too; but God will not accept of any act of religious worship from us, while any enmity subsists in our hearts towards any soul of man; or while any subsists in our neighbour's heart towards us, which we have not used the proper means to remove. A religion, the very essence of which is <i>love</i>, cannot suffer at its altars a heart that is revengeful and uncharitable, or which does not use its utmost endeavours to revive love in the heart of another. The original word, δωρον, which we translate <i>gift</i>, is used by the rabbins in Hebrew letters דורון <i>doron</i>, which signifies not only a <i>gift</i>, but a <i>sacrifice</i> offered to God. See several proofs in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Then come and offer thy gift.</b></i> — <i>Then</i>, when either thy brother is reconciled to thee, or thou hast done all in thy power to effect this reconciliation. My own obstinacy and uncharitableness must render me utterly unfit to receive any good from God's hands, or to worship him in an acceptable manner; bat the wickedness of another can be no hinderance to me, when I have endeavoured earnestly to get it removed, though without effect.</p>
