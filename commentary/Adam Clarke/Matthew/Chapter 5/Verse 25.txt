<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:25">Matthew 5:25</span>. <i><b>Agree with thine adversary quickly</b></i> — <i>Adversary</i>, αντιδικος, properly a <i>plaintiff</i> in law - a perfect law term. Our Lord enforces the exhortation given in the preceding verses, from the consideration of what was deemed prudent in ordinary law-suits. In such cases, men should make up matters with the utmost speed, as running through the whole course of a law-suit must not only be vexatious, but be attended with great expense; and in the end, though the <i>loser</i> may be ruined, yet the <i>gainer</i> has nothing. A good use of this very prudential advice of our Lord is this: Thou art a sinner; God hath a controversy with thee. There is but a step between thee and death. Now is the accepted time. Thou art invited to return to God by Christ Jesus. Come <i>immediately</i> at his call, and he will save thy soul. Delay not! Eternity is at hand; and if thou die in thy sins, where God is thou shalt never come.</p>
<p>Those who make the <i>adversary</i>, God; the <i>judge</i>, Christ; the <i>officer</i>, Death; and the <i>prison</i>, Hell, abuse the passage, and highly dishonour God.</p>
