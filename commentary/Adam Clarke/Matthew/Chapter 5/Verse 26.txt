<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:26">Matthew 5:26</span>. <i><b>The uttermost farthing.</b></i> — Κοδραντην. The rabbins have this Greek word corrupted into קרדיונטסס <i>kordiontes</i>, and קונטריק, <i>kontrik</i>, and say, that two פרוטות <i>prutoth</i> make a <i>kontarik</i>, which is exactly the same with those words in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:42">Mark 12:42</span>, λεπτα δυο, ο εστι κοδραντης, <i>two mites, which are one farthing</i>. Hence it appears that the λεπτον <i>lepton</i> was the same as the <i>prutah</i>. The weight of the <i>prutah</i> was half a barley-corn, and it was the smallest coin among the Jews, as the <i>kodrantes</i>, or farthing, was the smallest coin among the <i>Romans</i>. If the matter issue in <i>law</i>, strict justice will be done, and your creditor be allowed the <i>fulness of his just claim</i>; but if; while you are <i>on</i> <i>the way</i>, going to the magistrate, you come to a <i>friendly agreement</i> with him, he will relax in his claims, take a <i>part</i> for the <i>whole</i>, and the composition be, in the end, both to <i>his</i> and <i>your</i> profit.</p>
<p>This text has been considered a proper foundation on which to build not only the doctrine of a <i>purgatory</i>, but also that of <i>universal restoration</i>. But the most unwarrantable violence must be used before it can be pressed into the service of either of the above <i>antiscriptural</i> doctrines. At the most, the text can only be considered as a <i>metaphorical</i> representation of the procedure of the great Judge; and let it ever be remembered, that by the general consent of all (except the basely interested) no <i>metaphor</i> is ever to be <i>produced</i> in proof of any doctrine. In the things that concern our eternal salvation, we need the most <i>pointed</i> and <i>express evidence</i> on which to establish the faith of our souls.</p>
