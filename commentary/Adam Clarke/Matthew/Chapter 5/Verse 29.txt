<p>Verse 29. - 30. <i><b>Pluck it out - cut it off</b></i> — We must shut our senses against dangerous objects, to avoid the occasions of sin, and deprive ourselves of all that is most dear and profitable to us, in order to save our souls, when we find that these dear and profitable things, however innocent in themselves, cause us to sin against God.</p>
<p><i><b>It is profitable for thee that one of thy members</b></i> — Men often part with some members of the body, at the discretion of a surgeon, that they may preserve the trunk, and die a little later; and yet they will not deprive themselves of a look, a touch, a small pleasure, which endanger the eternal death of the soul. It is not enough to <i>shut</i> the eye, or <i>stop</i> the hand; the one must be plucked out, and the other cut off. Neither is this enough, we must <i>cast them</i> both from us. Not one moment's truce with an evil passion, or a sinful appetite. If you indulge them, they will gain strength, and you shall be ruined. The rabbins have a saying similar to this: "It is better for thee to be scorched with a little fire in this world, than to be burned with a devouring fire in the world to come."</p>
