<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>. <i><b>Blessed</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>the poor in spirit</b></i><b>, c.</b>] Or, <i>happy</i>, μακαριοι from μα or μη, <i>not</i>, and κηρ, <i>fate</i>, or <i>death</i>: intimating, that such persons were endued with <i>immortality</i>, and consequently were not liable to the caprices of <i>fate</i>. Homer, Iliad i, 330, calls the supreme gods, Θεων μακαρων, <i>the ever happy</i> <i>and</i> IMMORTAL <i>gods</i>, and opposes them to θνητων ανθρωπων, <i>mortal</i> men. </p>
<p>Taken in this light the meaning is similar to that expressed by the poet when describing a <i>happy</i> man. </p>
<p><i><b>Poor in spirit</b></i> — One who is deeply sensible of his spiritual poverty and wretchedness. πτωχος, <i>a poor man</i>, comes from πτωσσω, <i>to tremble</i>, or <i>shrink with fear</i>. Being destitute of the <i>true</i> <i>riches</i>, he is <i>tremblingly</i> alive to the necessities of his soul, <i>shrinking</i> with fear lest he should perish without the salvation of God. Such Christ pronounces happy, because there is but a step between them and that kingdom which is here promised. Some contend, that μακαριοι should be referred to, πνευματι, and the verse translated thus: <i>Happy</i>, or <i>blessed in spirit, are the poor</i>. But our Lord seems to have the humiliation of the spirit particularly in view.</p>
<p><i><b>Kingdom of heaven.</b></i> — Or, των ουρανων, <i>of the heavens</i>. A participation of all the blessings of the new covenant here, and the blessings of glory above. <i>See this phrase explained, Clarke's notes "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span><i>"</i>. Blessed are the poor! this is God's word; but who believes it? Do <i>we</i> not say, Yea, rather, Blessed is the <i>rich</i>?</p>
<p>The Jewish rabbins have many good sayings relative to that <i>poverty</i> and <i>humility</i> of spirit which Christ recommends in this verse. In the treatise called Bammidbar Rabbi, s. 20, we have these words: There were three (evils) in Balaam: <i>the evil eye</i>, (envy,) <i>the towering spirit</i>, (pride,) and <i>the extensive mind</i> (avarice.)</p>
<p>Tanchum, fol. 84. <i>The law does not abide with those who have</i> <i>the extensive mind</i>, (avarice,) <i>but with him only who has a</i> <i>contrite heart</i>.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina said, "Why are the words of the law compared to <i>water</i>? Because as waters flow from heights, and settle in low places, so the words of the law rest only with him who is of an <i>humble</i> heart." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
