<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Whosoever shall put away his wife</b></i> — The Jewish doctors gave great license in the matter of divorce. Among them, a man might divorce his wife if she displeased him even in the dressing of his victuals!</p>
<p><i>Rabbi Akiba</i> said, "If any man saw a woman handsomer than his own wife, he might put his wife away; because it is said in the law, <i>If she find not favour in his eyes</i>." <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span>.</p>
<p><i>Josephus</i>, the celebrated Jewish historian, <i>in his Life</i>, tells us, with the utmost coolness and indifference, "About this time I put away my wife, <i>who had borne me three children</i>, not being pleased with her manners."</p>
<p>These two cases are sufficient to show to what a scandalous and criminal excess this matter was carried among the Jews. However, it was allowed by the school of <i>Shammai</i>, that no man was to put away his wife unless for adultery. The school of <i>Hillel</i> gave much greater license.</p>
<p><i><b>A writing of divorcement</b></i> — The following is the common form of such a writing. See <i>Maimonides</i> and <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p>"On the day of the week A. in the month B. in the year C. from the beginning of the world, according to the common computation in the province of D., I, N. the son of N. by whatever name I am called, of the city E. with entire consent of mind, and without any compulsion, have divorced, dismissed, and expelled thee-thee, I say, M. the daughter of M. by whatever name thou art called, of the city E. who wast heretofore my wife: but now I have dismissed thee-thee, I say, M. the daughter of M. by whatever name thou art called, of the city E. so as to be free, and at thine own disposal, to marry whomsoever thou pleasest, without hinderance from any one, from this day for ever. Thou art therefore free for any man. Let this be thy bill of divorce from me, a writing of separation and expulsion, according to the law of Moses and Israel.</p>
<p>REUBEN, son of Jacob, Witness.</p>
<p>ELIEZAR, son of Gilead, Witness."</p>
<p>God permitted this evil to prevent a greater; and, perhaps, to typify his repudiating the Jews, who were his first spouse.</p>
