<p>Verse 32. <i><b>Saving for the cause of fornication</b></i> — λογου πορνειας, <i>on account of whoredom</i>. As <i>fornication</i> signifies no more than the unlawful connection of <i>unmarried</i> persons, it cannot be used here with propriety, when speaking of those who are <i>married</i>. I have therefore translated λογου πορνειας, <i>on account of whoredom</i>. It does not appear that there is any other case in which Jesus Christ admits of divorce. A real Christian ought rather to beg of God the grace to bear patiently and quietly the imperfections of his wife, than to think of the means of being parted from her. "But divorce was allowed by Moses;" yes, for the hardness of their hearts it was <i>permitted</i>: but what was permitted to an uncircumcised heart among the Jews, should not serve for a rule to a heart in which the love of God has been shed abroad by the Holy Spirit. Those who form a matrimonial connection in the fear and love of God, and under his direction, will never need a <i>divorce</i>. But those who marry as <i>passion</i> or <i>money</i> lead the way, may be justly considered <i>adulterers</i> and <i>adulteresses</i> as long as they live.</p>
