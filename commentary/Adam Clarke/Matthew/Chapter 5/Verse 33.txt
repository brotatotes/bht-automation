<p>Verse 33. <i><b>Thou shalt not forswear thyself</b></i> — They dishonour the great God, and break this commandment, who use frequent oaths and imprecations, even in reference to things that are true; and those who make vows and promises, which they either cannot perform, or do not design to fulfil, are not less criminal. <i>Swearing</i> in civil matters is become so frequent, that the <i>dread</i> and <i>obligation</i> of an oath are utterly lost in it. In certain places, where oaths are frequently administered, people have been known to kiss their <i>thumb</i> or <i>pen</i>, instead of the book, thinking thereby to avoid the sin of <i>perjury</i>; but this is a shocking imposition on their own souls. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+4:26">Deuteronomy 4:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+4:26">Deuteronomy 4:26</span></span>; <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+6:13">Deuteronomy 6:13</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Perform unto the Lord thine oaths</b></i> — The morality of the Jews on this point was truly execrable: they maintained, that a man might swear with his lips, and annul it in the same moment in his heart. Rab. Akiba is quoted as an example of this kind of swearing. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
