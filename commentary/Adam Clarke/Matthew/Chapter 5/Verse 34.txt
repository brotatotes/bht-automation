<p>Verse 34. - 35. <i><b>Neither by heaven</b></i>, c.] It was a custom among the Scythians, when they wished to bind themselves in the most solemn manner, to swear by the king's throne and if the king was at any time sick, they believed it was occasioned by some one's having taken the oath falsely. <i>Herod</i>. l. iv.</p>
<p>Who is there among the traders and people of this world who obey this law? A common swearer is constantly perjuring himself: such a person should never be trusted. When we make any promise contrary to the command of God, taking, as a pledge of our sincerity, either GOD, or something belonging to him, we engage that which is not ours, without the Master's consent. God manifests his glory in <i>heaven</i>, as upon his <i>throne</i>; he imprints the footsteps of his perfections upon the <i>earth</i>, his <i>footstool</i>; and shows that his holiness and his grace reign in his temple as the place of his residence. Let it be our constant care to seek and honour God in all his works.</p>
