<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head</b></i> â€” For these plain reasons:</p>
<p>1st. God commands thee not to do it.</p>
<p>2dly. Thou hast nothing which is <i>thy own</i>, and thou shouldst not pledge another's property.</p>
<p>3dly. It never did, and never can, answer any good purpose. And</p>
<p>4thly. Being a breach of the law of God, it is the way to everlasting misery.</p>
