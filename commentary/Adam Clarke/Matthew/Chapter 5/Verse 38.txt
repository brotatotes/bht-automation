<p>Verse 38. <i><b>An eye for an eye</b></i> â€” Our Lord refers here to the law of retaliation mentioned <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:24">Exodus 21:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:24">Exodus 21:24</span></span>, (see the note there, and <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+24:20">Leviticus 24:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+24:20">Leviticus 24:20</span></span>,) which obliged the offender to suffer the <i>same injury</i> he had <i>committed</i>. The <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i> had the same law. So strictly was it attended to at <i>Athens</i>, that if a man put out the eye of another who had but <i>one</i>, the offender was condemned to lose <i>both</i> his <i>eyes</i>, as the loss of one would not be an <i>equivalent</i> misfortune. It seems that the Jews had made this law (the execution of which belonged to the civil magistrate) a ground for authorizing private resentments, and all the excesses committed by a vindictive spirit. Revenge was often carried to the utmost extremity, and more evil returned than what had been received. This is often the case among those who are called Christians.</p>
