<p>Verse 39. <i><b>Resist not evil</b></i> — Or, <i>the evil person</i>. So, I am fully persuaded, τω πονηρω ought to be translated. Our Lord's meaning is, "Do not repel one outrage by another." He that does so makes himself precisely what the other is, a <i>wicked person</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Turn to him the other also</b></i> — That is, rather than <i>avenge</i> thyself, be ready to suffer patiently a repetition of the same injury. But these exhortations belong to those principally who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. Let such leave the judgment of their cause to Him for whose sake they suffer. The Jews always thought that every outrage should be resented; and thus the spirit of hatred and strife was fostered.</p>
