<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:4">Matthew 5:4</span>. <i><b>Blessed are they that mourn</b></i> — That is, those who, feeling their <i>spiritual poverty</i>, mourn after God, lamenting the iniquity that separated them from the fountain of blessedness. Every one flies from <i>sorrow</i>, and seeks after <i>joy</i>, and yet true joy must necessarily be the <i>fruit of sorrow</i>. The whole need not (do not <i>feel</i> the need of) the physician, but they that are <i>sick</i> do; i.e. they who are sensible of their disease. Only such persons as are deeply convinced of the sinfulness of sin, feel tho plague of their own heart, and turn with disgust from all worldly consolations, because of their insufficiency to render them <i>happy</i>, have God's promise of solid comfort. <i>They</i> SHALL BE <i>comforted</i>, says Christ, παρακληθησονται, from παρα, <i>near</i>, and καλεω, <i>I</i> <i>call</i>. He will <i>call them to himself</i>, and speak the words of <i>pardon, peace</i>, and <i>life eternal</i>, to their hearts. See this notion of the word expressed fully by our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28">Matthew 11:28</span>, COME UNTO ME <i>all ye who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest</i>.</p>
