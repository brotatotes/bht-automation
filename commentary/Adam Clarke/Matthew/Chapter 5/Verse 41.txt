<p>Verse 41. <i><b>Shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</b></i> — αγγαρευσει. This word is said to be derived from the <i>Persians</i>, among whom the king's <i>messengers</i>, or <i>posts</i>, were called αγγαποι, or <i>angari</i>. This definition is given both by <i>Hesychius</i> and <i>Suidas.</i></p>
<p>The Persian messengers had the royal authority for <i>pressing</i> <i>horses, ships</i>, and even <i>men</i>, to assist them in the business on which they were employed. These <i>angari</i> are now termed <i>chappars</i>, and serve to carry despatches between the court and the provinces. When a <i>chappar</i> sets out, the master of the horse furnishes him with a single horse; and, when that is weary, he dismounts the first man he meets, and takes his horse. There is no pardon for a traveller that refuses to let a <i>chappar</i> have his horse, nor for any other who should deny him the best horse in his stable. See Sir J. Chardin's and Hanway's Travels. For pressing post horses, c., the Persian term is [Persian] <i>Sukhreh geriften</i>. I find no Persian word exactly of the sound and signification of αγγαρος but the Arabic [Arabic] <i>agharet</i> signifies <i>spurring a horse</i>, <i>attacking, plundering</i>, c. The Greek word itself is preserved among the rabbins in Hebrew characters, אנגריא <i>angaria</i>, and it has precisely the same meaning: <i>viz</i>. to be compelled by violence to do any particular service, especially of the public kind, by the king's authority. <i>Lightfoot</i> gives several instances of this in his <i>Horae Talmudicae</i>.</p>
<p>We are here exhorted to patience and forgiveness:</p>
<p><i>First</i>, When we receive in our persons all sorts of insults and affronts, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span>.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, When we are despoiled of our goods, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, When our bodies are forced to undergo all kinds of toils, vexations, and torments, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:41">Matthew 5:41</span>. The way to improve the injustice of man to our own advantage, is to exercise under it meekness, gentleness, and long-suffering, without which disposition of mind, no man can either be happy here or hereafter for he that avenges himself must lose the mind of Christ, and thus suffer an injury ten thousand times greater than he can ever receive from man. <i>Revenge</i>, at such an expense, is <i>dear</i> indeed.</p>
