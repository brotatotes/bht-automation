<p>Verse 42. <i><b>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would</b></i><b> </b><i><b>borrow</b></i> â€” To <i>give</i> and <i>lend</i> freely to all who are in need, is a general precept from which we are only excused by our inability to perform it. Men are more or less obliged to it as they are more or less able, as the want is more or less pressing, as they are more or less burthened with common poor, or with necessitous relatives. In all these matters, both <i>prudence</i> and <i>charity</i> must be consulted. That God, who makes use of the beggar's hand to ask our charity, is the same from whom we ourselves beg our daily bread: and dare we refuse HIM! Let us show at least mildness and compassion, when we can do no more; and if we cannot or will not relieve a poor man, let us never give him an ill word nor an ill look. If we do not <i>relieve</i> him, we have no right to <i>insult</i> him.</p>
<p>To <i>give</i> and to <i>lend</i>, are two duties of charity which Christ joins together, and which he sets on equal footing. A rich man is one of God's stewards: God has given him money for the poor, and he cannot deny it without an act of <i>injustice</i>. But no man, from what is called a principle of charity or generosity, should give that in <i>alms</i> which belongs to his creditors. <i>Generosity</i> is godlike; but <i>justice</i> has ever, both in <i>law</i> and <i>Gospel</i>, the <i>first</i> claim.</p>
<p>A <i>loan</i> is often more beneficial than an absolute <i>gift: first</i>, because it flatters less the vanity of him who lends; <i>secondly</i>, it spares more the shame of him who is in real want; and, <i>thirdly</i>, it gives less encouragement to the idleness of him who may not be very honest. However, no advantage should be taken of the necessities of the <i>borrower</i>: he who does so is, at least, <i>half</i> a murderer. The <i>lending</i> which our Lord here inculcates is that which requires no more than the restoration of the principal in a convenient time: otherwise to live upon <i>trust</i> is the sure way to pay <i>double</i>.</p>
