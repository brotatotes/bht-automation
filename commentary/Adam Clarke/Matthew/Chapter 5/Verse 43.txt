<p>Verse 43. <i><b>Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</b></i> — Instead of πλησιαν <i>neighbour</i>, the Codex Graevii, a MS. of the eleventh century, reads φιλον <i>friend</i>. Thou shalt love thy friend, and hate thine enemy. This was certainly the meaning which the Jews put on it: for neighbour, with them, implied those of the Jewish race, and all others were, considered by them as <i>natural</i> <i>enemies</i>. Besides, it is evident that πλησιον, among the Hellenistic Jews, meant <i>friend</i> merely: Christ uses it precisely in this sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:36">Luke 10:36</span>, in answer to the question asked by a certain lawyer, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>. Who of the three was neighbour (πλησιον friend) to him who fell among the thieves? He who showed him mercy; i.e. he who acted the <i>friendly</i> part. In Hebrew, רע <i>rea</i>, signifies <i>friend</i>, which word is translated πλησιον by the LXX. in more than one hundred places. Among the Greeks it was a very comprehensive term, and signified <i>every</i> man, not even an <i>enemy</i> excepted, as <i>Raphelius</i>, on this verse, has shown from <i>Polybius</i>. The Jews thought themselves authorized to kill any Jew who apostatized; and, though they could not do injury to the Gentiles, in whose country they sojourned, yet they were bound to suffer them to perish, if they saw them in danger of death. Hear their own words: "A Jew sees a Gentile fall into the sea, let him by no means lift him out; for it is written, <i>Thou shalt not rise up</i> <i>against the blood of thy neighbour</i>: - but this is not thy <i>neighbour</i>." Maimon. This shows that by neighbour they understood a <i>Jew</i>; one who was of the same blood and religion with themselves.</p>
