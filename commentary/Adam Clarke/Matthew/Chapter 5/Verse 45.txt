<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:45">Matthew 5:45</span>. <i><b>That ye may be the children of your Father</b></i> — Instead of υιοι children, some MSS., the latter <i>Persic</i> version, and several of the primitive fathers, read ομοιοι, that ye may be <i>like</i> <i>to</i>, or <i>resemble</i>, your Father who is in heaven. This is certainly our Lord's meaning. As a man's child is called <i>his</i>, because a partaker of his own nature, so a holy person is said to be a child of God, because he is a partaker of the Divine nature.</p>
<p><i><b>He maketh his sun to rise on the evil</b></i> — "There is nothing greater than to <i>imitate</i> God in doing good to our enemies. All the creatures of God pronounce the sentence of condemnation on the revengeful: and this sentence is written by the <i>rays</i> of the <i>sun</i>, and with the <i>drops</i> of <i>rain</i>, and indeed by all the natural good things, the use of which God freely gives to his enemies." If God had not loved us while we were his enemies, we could never have become his <i>children</i>: and we shall cease to be such, as soon as we cease to imitate him.</p>
