<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:46">Matthew 5:46</span>. <i><b>For if ye love them which love you</b></i> — He who loves only his <i>friends</i>, does nothing for God's sake. He who loves for the sake of <i>pleasure</i> or <i>interest</i>, pays himself. God has no enemy which he hates but <i>sin</i>; we should have no other.</p>
<p><i><b>The publicans</b></i> — That is, <i>tax-gatherers</i>, τελωναι, from τελος a <i>tax</i>, and ωνεομαι <i>I buy</i> or <i>farm</i>. A <i>farmer</i> or <i>collector</i> of the <i>taxes</i> or <i>public revenues</i>. Of these there were two classes; the <i>superior</i>, who were Romans of the equestrian order; and the <i>inferior</i>, those mentioned in the Gospels, who it appears were mostly <i>Jews</i>.</p>
<p>This class of men was detestable among the Romans, the Greeks, and the Jews, for their intolerable rapacity and avarice. They were abhorred in an especial manner by the Jews, to whom the Roman government was odious: these, assisting in collecting the Roman tribute, were considered as betrayers of the liberties of their country, and abettors of those who enslaved it. They were something like the <i>tythe-farmers</i> of certain college-livings in some counties of England, as Lancashire, c. - a principal cause of the public burthens and discontent. One quotation, of the many produced by <i>Kypke</i>, will amply show in what detestation they were held among the Greeks. <i>Theocritus</i> being asked, Which of the wild beasts were the most cruel? answered, Εν μεν τοις ορεσιν αρκτοι και λεοντες· εν δε ταις πολεσιν, ΤΕΛΩΝΑΙ και συκοφανται. <i>Bears</i> <i>and lions, in the mountains</i> and TAX-GATHERERS <i>and calumniators</i>, <i>in cities</i>.</p>
