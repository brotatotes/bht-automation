<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:5">Matthew 5:5</span>. <i><b>Blessed are the meek</b></i> — Happy, οι πραεις, from ραος, <i>easy</i>, those who are of a <i>quiet, gentle</i> spirit, in opposition to the proud and supercilious Scribes and Pharisees and their disciples. We have a compound word in English, which once fully expressed the meaning of the original, viz. <i>gentleman</i>; but it has now almost wholly lost its original signification. Our word <i>meek</i> comes from the old Anglo-saxon meca, or meccea, a <i>companion</i> or <i>equal</i>, because he who is of a <i>meek</i> or <i>gentle</i> spirit, is ever ready to associate with the meanest of those who fear God, feeling himself <i>superior</i> to none; and well knowing that he has nothing of spiritual or temporal good but what he has received from the mere bounty of God, having never <i>deserved</i> any favour from his hand.</p>
<p><i><b>For they shall inherit the earth.</b></i> — Or, την γην, <i>the land</i>. Under this expression, which was commonly used by the prophets to signify the <i>land of Canaan</i>, in which all temporal good abounded, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+18:9-10">Judges 18:9-10</span>, Jesus Christ points out that abundance of spiritual good, which was provided for men in the Gospel. Besides, Canaan was a <i>type</i> of the kingdom of God; and who is so likely to inherit <i>glory</i> as the man in whom the <i>meekness</i> and <i>gentleness</i> of Jesus dwell? In some good MSS. and several ancient versions, the <i>fourth</i> and <i>fifth</i> verses are transposed: see the authorities in the various readings in Professor Griesbach's edition. The present arrangement certainly is most natural:</p>
<p>1. <i>Poverty</i>, to which the promise of the kingdom is made.</p>
<p>2. <i>Mourning</i> or distress, on account of this impoverished state, to which consolation is promised. And</p>
<p>3. <i>Meekness</i> established in the heart by the <i>consolations</i> received.</p>
