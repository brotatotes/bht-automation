<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6">Matthew 5:6</span>. <i><b>They which do hunger and thirst</b></i> — As the body has its natural appetites of hunger and thirst for the food and drink suited to its nourishment, so has the soul. No being is <i>indestructible</i> or <i>unfailing</i> in its nature but GOD; no being is <i>independent</i> but him: as the body <i>depends</i> for its nourishment, health, and strength upon the <i>earth</i>, so does the soul upon <i>heaven</i>. Heavenly things cannot support the <i>body</i>; they are not suited to its nature: <i>earthly</i> things cannot support the <i>soul</i>, for the same reason. When the uneasy sensation termed <i>hunger</i> takes place in the stomach, we know we must get food or perish. When the soul is awakened to a tense of its wants, and begins to <i>hunger</i> and <i>thirst</i> after righteousness or <i>holiness</i>, which is its proper food, we know that it must be purified by the Holy Spirit, and be made a partaker of that living bread, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span>, or perish everlastingly. Now, as God never inspires a prayer but with a design to answer it, he who hungers and thirsts after the full salvation of God, may depend on being speedily and effectually blessed or <i>satisfied</i>, well-fed, as the word χορτασθησονται implies. Strong and intense desire after any object has been, both by poets and orators, represented metaphorically by <i>hunger</i> and <i>thirst</i>. See the well-known words of Virgil, AEneid iii. 55. </p>

<p>How frequently do we find, <i>inexplebilis honorum</i> FAMES-SITIENS <i>virtutis-famae</i> SITUS, the insatiable <i>hunger</i> after honour, a <i>thirst</i> for virtue, <i>thirst</i> after fame, and such like! <i>Righteousness</i> here is taken for all the blessings of the new covenant - all the graces of the Messiah's kingdom - a full restoration to the image of God!</p>
