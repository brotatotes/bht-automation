<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:7">Matthew 5:7</span>. <i><b>The merciful</b></i> — The word <i>mercy</i>, among the Jews, signified two things: the <i>pardon of injuries</i>, and <i>almsgiving</i>. Our Lord undoubtedly takes it in its fullest latitude here. To know the nature of mercy, we have only to consult the grammatical meaning of the Latin word <i>misericordia</i>, from which ours is derived. It is composed of two words: <i>miserans</i>, pitying, and <i>cor</i>, the heart; or <i>miseria cordis</i>, pain of heart. Mercy supposes two things:</p>
<p>1. A distressed object: and,</p>
<p>2. A disposition of the heart, through which it is affected at the sight of such an object.</p>
<p>This virtue, therefore, is no other than a lively emotion of the heart, which is excited by the discovery of any creature's misery; and such an emotion as manifests itself outwardly, by effects suited to its nature. The merciful man is here termed by our Lord ελεημων, from ελεος, which is generally derived from the Hebrew חיל <i>chil, to be in pain, as a woman in travail</i>: or from ילל <i>galal, to cry</i>, or <i>lament grievously</i>; because a merciful man enters into the miseries of his neighbour, feels for and mourns with him.</p>
<p><i><b>They shall obtain mercy.</b></i> — Mercy is not purchased but at the price of mercy itself; and even this <i>price</i> is a <i>gift</i> of the <i>mercy</i> of God. What mercy can those vindictive persons expect, who forgive nothing, and are always ready to improve every advantage they have of avenging themselves? Whatever mercy a man shows to another, God will take care to show the same to him. The following elegant and nervous saying of one of our best poets is worthy of the reader's most serious attention: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "The quality of mercy is not strained;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Upon the place beneath. It is <i>twice</i> blessed;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> It blesseth <i>him</i> who <i>gives</i>, and <i>him</i> who <i>takes</i>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The throned monarch better than his crown.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> It is an attribute of God himself;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And earthly power doth then show likest God's,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> When <i>mercy</i> seasons <i>justice</i>.--------</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Though <i>justice</i> be thy plea, consider this,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> That, in the <i>course of justice</i>, none of us</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Should see <i>salvation</i>. We do pray for <i>mercy</i>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And that same <i>prayer</i> doth teach us all to render</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The <i>deeds of mercy</i>.--------</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Why, all the souls that are, were forfeit once:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And he who might the 'vantage best have took</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Found out the remedy. How would you be,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> If He who is the top of <i>judgment</i> should</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> But judge you <i>as you are</i>? O! think on that;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And <i>mercy</i> then will breathe within your lips,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Like man, <i>new made</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> How shalt thou <i>hope</i> for <i>mercy</i>, rend'ring <i>none</i>?" </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>In the tract <i>Shabbath</i>, fol. 151, there is a saying very like this of our Lord.</p>
<p>"He who shows mercy to men, God will show mercy to him: but to him who shows no mercy to man, God will show no mercy.</p>
