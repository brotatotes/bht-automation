<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:8">Matthew 5:8</span>. <i><b>Pure in heart</b></i> — In opposition to the Pharisees, who affected outward purity, while their hearts were full of corruption and defilement. A principal part of the Jewish religion consisted in outward <i>washings</i> and <i>cleansings</i>: on this ground they expected to <i>see God</i>, to enjoy eternal glory: but Christ here shows that a purification of the <i>heart</i>, from all vile affections and desires, is essentially requisite in order to enter into the <i>kingdom of God</i>. He whose soul is not delivered from all sin, through the blood of the covenant, can have no Scriptural hope of ever being with God. There is a remarkable illustration of this passage, quoted by Mr. Wakefield from Origen, <i>Contra Cels</i>. lib. vi. "God has no body, and therefore is invisible: but men of contemplation can discern him with the heart and understanding. But A DEFILED HEART CANNOT SEE GOD: but HE MUST BE PURE WHO WISHES TO ENJOY A PROPER VIEW OF A PURE BEING."</p>
<p><i><b>Shall see God.</b></i> — This is a Hebraism, which signifies, <i>possess</i> <i>God, enjoy his felicity</i>: as <i>seeing</i> a thing, was used among the Hebrews for possessing it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:10">Psalms 16:10</span>. <i>Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption</i>, i.e. he shall not <i>be corrupted</i>. So <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>: <i>Except a man be born again, he cannot</i> SEE <i>the kingdom of God</i>, i.e. he cannot <i>enjoy</i> it. So <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>. <i>He that believeth not the Son, shall not</i> SEE <i>life</i>, i. e shall not be put in <i>possession</i> of eternal glory. The Hindoo idolaters vainly boast of what the genuine followers of Christ actually enjoy - having the Divine favour witnessed to their souls by the Holy Spirit. The Hindoos pretend that some of their sages have been favoured with a sight of their guardian deity. - See WARD'S <i>Customs</i>.</p>
<p>Probably our Lord alludes to the advantages those had, who were legally <i>pure</i>, of entering into the sanctuary, into the presence of God, while those who had contracted any legal <i>defilement</i> were excluded from it. This also was obviously <i>typical</i>.</p>
