<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>. <i><b>The peace-makers</b></i> — ειρηνη, <i>peace</i>, is compounded of ειρειν (εις) εν, <i>connecting into one</i>: for as WAR <i>distracts</i> and <i>divides</i> nations, families, and individuals, from each other, inducing them to pursue different objects and different interests, so PEACE restores them to a state of <i>unity</i>, giving them one <i>object</i>, and one <i>interest</i>. A <i>peace-maker</i> is a man who, being endowed with a generous public spirit, labours for the public good, and feels his own interest promoted in promoting that of others: therefore, instead of fanning the fire of strife, he uses his influence and wisdom to reconcile the contending parties, adjust their differences, and restore them to a state of <i>unity</i>. As all men are represented to be in a state of <i>hostility</i> to God and each other, the Gospel is called the Gospel of <i>peace</i>, because it tends to reconcile men to God and to each other. Hence our Lord here terms <i>peace-makers the children of God</i>: for as <i>he</i> is the <i>Father of peace</i>, those who promote it are reputed <i>his children</i>. But whose children are they who foment divisions in the <i>Church</i>, the <i>state</i>, or among <i>families</i>? Surely they are not of that GOD, who is the <i>Father of peace</i>, and lover of concord; of that CHRIST, who is the <i>sacrifice</i> and <i>mediator</i> of it; of that SPIRIT, who is the <i>nourisher</i> and <i>bond</i> of peace; nor of that CHURCH of the Most High, which is the kingdom and family of peace.</p>
<p>St. Clement, Strom. lib. iv. s. 6, <i>in fin</i>. says, that "Some who transpose the Gospels add this verse: <i>Happy they who are</i> <i>persecuted by justice, for they shall be perfect: happy they who</i> <i>are persecuted on my account, for they shall have a place where</i> <i>they shall not be persecuted</i>."</p>
