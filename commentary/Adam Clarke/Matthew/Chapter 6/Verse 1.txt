<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>. <i><b>That ye do not your alms</b></i> — δικαιοσυνην υμων μη ποιειν, <i>perform not your acts of righteousness</i>-such as <i>alms-giving, fasting</i>, and <i>prayer</i>, mentioned immediately after. Instead of δικαιοσυνην, <i>righteousness</i>, or <i>acts of righteousness</i>, the reading in the text, that which has been commonly received is ελεημοσυνην, <i>alms</i>. But the first reading has been inserted in several editions, and is supported by the <i>Codd. Vatican</i>. and <i>Bezae</i>, some others, and several versions, all the <i>Itala</i> except one, and the <i>Vulgate</i>. The Latin fathers have <i>justitiam</i>, a word of the same meaning. Mr. Gregory has amply proved, צדקה <i>tsidekeh</i>, <i>righteousness</i>, was a common word for <i>alms</i> among the Jews. <i>Works</i>, 4to. p. 58, 1671. R. D. Kimchi says that צדקה <i>tsidekeh</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:14">Isaiah 59:14</span>, means <i>alms-giving</i>; and the phrase נתן צדקה <i>natan tsidekah</i>, is used by the Jews to signify the <i>giving of alms</i>. The following passages from Dr. Lightfoot show that it was thus commonly used among the Jewish writers: -</p>
<p>"It is questioned," says he, "whether <i>Matthew</i> writ ελεημοσυνην, <i>alms</i>, or δικαιοσυνην, <i>righteousness</i>. I answer: -</p>
<p>"I. That, our Saviour certainly said צדקה <i>tsidekah</i>, <i>righteousness</i>, (or, in Syriac זדקתא <i>zidkatha</i>,) I make no doubt at all; but, that that word could not be otherwise understood by the common people than of <i>alms</i>, there is as little doubt to be made. For although the word צדקה <i>tsidekah</i>, according to the idiom of the Old Testament, signifies nothing else than <i>righteousness</i>; yet now, when our Saviour spoke these words, it signified nothing so much as <i>alms</i>.</p>
<p>"II. <i>Christ</i> used also the same word זדקתא <i>zidkatha</i>, <i>righteousness</i>, in time three verses next following, and Matthew used the word ελεημοσυνην, <i>alms</i>; but by what right, I beseech you, should he call it δικαιοσυνην, <i>righteousness</i>, in the first verse, and ελεημοσυνην, <i>alms</i>, in the following; when Christ every where used one and the same word? Matthew might not change in <i>Greek</i>, where our Saviour had not changed in <i>Syriac</i>: therefore we must say that the Lord Jesus used the word צדקה <i>tsidekeh</i> or זדקתא <i>zidkatha</i>, in these four first verses; but that, speaking in the dialect of common people, he was understood by the common people to speak of <i>alms</i>. Now they called <i>alms</i> by the name of <i>righteousness</i>, for the fathers of the traditions taught, and the common people believed, that <i>alms</i> contributed very much to justification. Hear the <i>Jewish</i> chair in this matter - </p>
<p><i>For one</i> <i>farthing given to a poor man in alms, a man is made partaker of</i> <i>the beatific vision</i>: where it renders these words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+17:15">Psalms 17:15</span>, <i>I shall behold thy face in righteousness</i>, after this manner, <i>I</i> <i>shall behold thy face</i>, BECAUSE of ALMS. Bava. Bathra.</p>
<p>"<i>This money goeth for alms, that my sons may live, and that I</i> <i>may obtain the world to come</i>. Bab. Rosh. Hashshanah.</p>
<p>"<i>A man's table now expiates by alms, as heretofore the altar did</i> <i>by sacrifice</i>. Beracoth.</p>
<p>"<i>If you afford alms out of your purse, God will keep you from</i> <i>all damage and harm</i>. Hieros. Peah.</p>
<p>"MONOBAZES <i>the king bestowed his goods liberally upon the poor,</i> <i>and had these words spoken to him by his kinsmen and friends -</i></p>
<p><i>'Your</i> <i>ancestors increased both their own riches, and those that were</i> <i>left them by their fathers; but you waste both your own and those</i> <i>of your ancestors.' </i> </p>
<p><i>To whom he answered -</i></p>
<p><i>'My fathers laid up their</i> <i>wealth on earth: I lay up mine in heaven. As it is written</i>, Truth shall flourish out of the earth, but Righteousness shall look down from heaven. <i>My fathers laid up treasures that bear no fruit; but</i> I lay up such as bear fruit. <i>As it is said</i>, It shall be well with the just, for they shall eat the fruit of their own works. <i>My</i> <i>fathers treasured up, when power was in their hands; but I where</i> <i>it is not.</i></p>
<p><i>As it is said</i>, Justice and judgment is the habitation of his throne. <i>My fathers heaped up for others; I for myself</i>. <i>As</i> <i>it is said</i>, And this shall be to thee for righteousness. <i>They</i> <i>scraped together for this world. I for the world to come. As it</i> <i>is said</i>, Righteousness shall deliver from death.' <i>Ibid</i>.</p>
<p>These things are also recited in the <i>Babylonian Talmud</i>.</p>
<p>"You see plainly in what sense he understands <i>righteousness</i>, namely, in the sense of <i>alms</i>: and that sense not so much framed in his own imagination, as in that of the whole nation, and which the royal catachumen had imbibed from the Pharisees his teachers.</p>
<p>"Behold the <i>justifying</i> and saving virtue of <i>alms</i>, from the very work done according to the doctrine of the Pharisaical chair! And hence, the opinion of this efficacy of alms so far prevailed with the deceived people, that they pointed out <i>alms</i> by no other name (confined within one single word) than צדקה <i>tsidekah</i>, <i>righteousness</i>. Perhaps those words of our Saviour are spoken in derision of this doctrine. <i>Yea, give those things which ye have</i> <i>in alms, and behold all things shall be clean to you</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:41">Luke 11:41</span>. With good reason indeed exhorting them to give alms; but yet withal striking at the covetousness of the Pharisees, and confuting their vain opinion of being clean by the washing of their hands, from their own opinion of the efficacy of <i>alms</i>. As if he had said, "Ye assert that alms <i>justifies</i> and <i>saves</i>, and therefore ye call it by the name of righteousness; why therefore do ye affect <i>cleanliness</i> by the washing of hands; and not rather by the performance of <i>charity</i>?" LIGHTFOOT's Works, vol. ii. p. 153.</p>
<p><i><b>Before men</b></i> — Our Lord does not forbid public alms-giving, fasting, and prayer, but simply censures those <i>vain</i> and <i>hypocritical</i> persons who do these things publicly that they <i>may be</i> <i>seen of men</i>, and receive from them the <i>reputation of saints</i>, &amp;c.</p>
