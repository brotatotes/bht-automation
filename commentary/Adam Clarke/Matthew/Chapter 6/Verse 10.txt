<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:10">Matthew 6:10</span>. <i><b>Thy kingdom come.</b></i> — The ancient Jews scrupled not to say: <i>He prays not at all, in whose prayers there is no mention of</i> <i>the kingdom of God</i>. Hence, they were accustomed to say, "Let him cause his kingdom to reign, and his redemption to flourish: and let the Messiah speedily come and deliver his people."</p>
<p>The universal sway of the sceptre of Christ: - God has promised that the kingdom of Christ shall be exalted above all kingdoms. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14-27">Daniel 7:14-27</span>. That it shall overcome all others, and be at last the universal empire. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span>. Connect this with the explanation given of this phrase, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thy will be done</b></i> — This petition is properly added to the preceding; for when the kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy, in the Holy Spirit, is established in the heart, there is then an ample provision made for the fulfilment of the Divine <i>will</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>will of God</i> is infinitely good, wise, and holy; to have it fulfilled in and among men, is to have infinite <i>goodness, wisdom</i>, and <i>holiness</i> diffused throughout the universe; and earth made the counterpart of heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>As it is in heaven.</b></i> — The Jews maintained, that they were the angels of God upon earth, as these pure spirits were angels of God in heaven; hence they said, "As the angels sanctify the Divine name in heaven, so the Israelites sanctify the Divine name, upon earth." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>Observe,</p>
<p>1st. The salvation of the soul is the result of <i>two</i> <i>wills</i> conjoined: the <i>will of God</i>, and the <i>will of man</i>. If God will not the salvation of man, he cannot be saved: If, man will not the salvation God has prepared for him, he cannot be delivered from his sins.</p>
<p>2dly. This petition certainly points out a deliverance from all sin; for nothing that is <i>unholy</i> can consist with the Divine <i>will</i>, and if this be fulfilled in man, surely sin shall be banished from his soul.</p>
<p>3dly. This is farther evident from these words, <i>as it is in heaven</i>; i.e. as the <i>angels</i> do it: viz. with all <i>zeal, diligence, love, delight</i>, and <i>perseverance</i>.</p>
<p>4thly. Does not the petition plainly imply, we may live without sinning against God? Surely the holy angels never mingle iniquity with their loving obedience; and as our Lord teaches us to pray, that we do his will <i>here</i> as they do it in heaven, can it be thought he would put a petition in our mouths, the fulfilment of which was impossible?</p>
<p>5thly. This certainly destroys the assertion: "<i>There is no such state of purification, to be attained</i> <i>here, in which it may be said, the soul is redeemed from sinful</i> <i>passions and desires</i>;" for it is on EARTH that we are commanded to pray that this <i>will</i>, which is our sanctification, may be done.</p>
<p>6thly. Our souls can never be truly happy, till our WILLS be entirely subjected to, and become one with, the will of God.</p>
<p>7thly. How can any person offer this petition to his Maker, who thinks of nothing <i>less</i> than the performance of the <i>will</i> of <i>God</i>, and of nothing <i>more</i> than doing his <i>own</i>?</p>
<p>Some see the mystery of the Trinity in the three preceding petitions. The first being, addressed to the <i>Father</i>, as the source of all holiness. The second, to the <i>Son</i>, who establishes the kingdom of God upon earth. The third, to the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, who by his energy works in men to <i>will</i> and to perform.</p>
<p>To offer these three petitions with success at the throne of God, three graces, essential to our salvation, must be brought into exercise; and, indeed, the petitions themselves necessarily suppose them.</p>
<p>FAITH, <i>Our Father </i>- for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is.</p>
<p>HOPE, <i>Thy kingdom come </i>- For this grace has for its object good things to come.</p>
<p>LOVE, <i>Thy will be done </i>- For <i>love</i> is the <i>incentive</i> to and <i>principle</i> of all obedience to God, and beneficence to man.</p>
