<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:11">Matthew 6:11</span>. <i><b>Give us this day our daily bread</b></i> — The word επιουσιαν has greatly perplexed critics and commentators. I find upwards of thirty different explanations of it. It is found in no Greek writer before the evangelists, and <i>Origen</i> says expressly, <i>that it</i> <i>was formed by them</i>, αλλ' εοικε πεπλασθαι υπο των ευαγγελιστων. The interpretation of <i>Theophylact</i>, one of the best of the Greek fathers, has ever appeared to me to be the most correct, Αρτος επι τη ουσιᾳ και συστασει ημων αυταρκης, <i>Bread, sufficient for our</i> <i>substance and support</i>, i.e. That quantity of food which is necessary to support our health and strength, by being changed into the <i>substance</i> of our bodies. Its composition is of επι and ουσια, <i>proper</i> or <i>sufficient for support</i>. Mr. Wakefield thinks it probable, that the word was originally written επιουσιαν, which coalesced by degrees, till they became the επιουσιον of the MSS. There is probably an allusion here to the custom of travellers in the east, who were wont to reserve a part of the food given them the preceding evening to serve for their breakfast or dinner the next day. But as this was not sufficient for the whole day, they were therefore obliged to depend on the providence of God for the additional supply. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:12-13">Luke 15:12-13</span>, ουσια signifies, what a person has to live on; and nothing can be more natural than to understand the compound επιουσιος, of that additional supply which the traveller needs, to complete the provision necessary for a day's eating, over and above what he had then in his possession.

<p>The word is so very peculiar and expressive, and seems to have been made on purpose by the evangelists, that more than mere <i>bodily</i> nourishment seems to be intended by it. Indeed, many of the primitive fathers understood it as comprehending that daily supply of <i>grace</i> which the soul requires to keep it in health and vigour: He who uses the petition would do well to keep both in view. Observe</p>
<p>1. God is the author and dispenser of all temporal as well as spiritual good.</p>
<p>2. We have merited no kind of good from his hand, and therefore must receive it as a <i>free gift: Give</i> <i>us</i>, c.</p>
<p>3. We must depend on him <i>daily</i> for support we are not permitted to ask any thing for to-morrow: give us <i>to-day</i>.</p>
<p>4. That petition of the ancient Jews is excellent: "Lord, the necessities of thy people Israel are many, and their knowledge small, so that they know not how to disclose their necessities: Let it be thy good pleasure to give to every man, what sufficeth for food!" Thus they expressed their dependence, and left it to God to determine what was best and most suitable.</p>
<p>We must ask only that which is <i>essential</i> to our support, God having promised neither <i>luxuries</i> nor <i>superfluities</i>.</p>
