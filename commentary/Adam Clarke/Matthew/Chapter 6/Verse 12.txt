<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>. <i><b>And forgive us our debts</b></i> — Sin is represented here under the notion of a <i>debt</i>, and as our sins are <i>many</i>, they are called here <i>debts</i>. God made man that he might live to his glory, and gave him a law to walk by; and if, when he does any thing that tends not to glorify God, he contracts a debt with Divine Justice, how much more is he debtor when he breaks the law by actual transgression! It has been justly observed, "All the attributes of God are reasons of obedience to man; those attributes are infinite; every sin is an act of ingratitude or rebellion against all these attributes; therefore sin is infinitely sinful."</p>
<p><i>Forgive us</i>.-Man has nothing to <i>pay</i>: if his debts are not <i>forgiven</i>, they must stand charged against him for ever, as he is absolutely <i>insolvent</i>. Forgiveness, therefore, must come from the free mercy of God in Christ: and how strange is it we cannot have the <i>old</i> debt cancelled, without (by that very means) contracting a <i>new</i> one, as great as the old! but the <i>credit</i> is transferred from <i>Justice</i> to <i>Mercy</i>. While <i>sinners</i> we are in debt to infinite <i>Justice</i>; when <i>pardoned</i>, in debt to endless <i>Mercy</i>: and as a continuance in a state of grace necessarily implies a continual communication of mercy, so the debt goes on increasing <i>ad</i> <i>infinitum</i>. Strange economy in the Divine procedure, which by rendering a man an infinite debtor, keeps him eternally dependent on his Creator! How good is God! And what does this state of dependence imply? A union with, and participation of, the fountain of eternal goodness and felicity!</p>
<p><i><b>As we forgive our debtors.</b></i> — It was a maxim among the ancient Jews, that no man should lie down in his bed, without forgiving those who had offended him. That man condemns himself to suffer eternal punishment, who makes use of this prayer with <i>revenge</i> and <i>hatred</i> in his heart. He who will not attend to a <i>condition</i> so advantageous to himself (remitting a <i>hundred pence</i> to his debtor, that his own creditor may remit him 10,000 <i>talents</i>) is a madman, who, to oblige his neighbour to suffer an hour, is himself determined to suffer everlastingly! This condition of forgiving our neighbour, though it cannot possibly <i>merit</i> any thing, yet it is that condition without which God will pardon no man.
