<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:15">Matthew 6:15</span>. <i><b>But if ye forgive not</b></i> — He who does not awake at the sound of so loud a voice, is not <i>asleep</i> but <i>dead</i>. A <i>vindictive</i> man excludes himself from all hope of eternal life, and himself seals his own damnation.</p>
<p><i><b>Trespasses</b></i> — παραπτωματα, from παρα and πιπτω, <i>to fall</i> <i>off</i>. What a remarkable difference there is between this word and οφειληματα, <i>debts</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>! Men's sins against <i>us</i> are only their <i>stumblings</i>, or <i>fallings off</i> from the duties they owe us; but our's are <i>debts</i> to God's justice, which we can never discharge. It can be no great difficulty to forgive those, especially when we consider that in many respects we have failed as much, in certain duties which we owed to <i>others</i>, as they have done in those which they owed <i>us</i>. "But I have given him no provocation." Perhaps thou art angry, and art not a proper judge in the matter; but, however it may be, it is thy interest to forgive, if thou expectest forgiveness from God. On this important subject I will subjoin an extract from Mason's Self-knowledge, page 248, 1755.</p>
<p>"<i>Athenodorus</i>, the philosopher by reason of his old age, begged leave to retire from the court of <i>Augustus</i>, which the emperor granted. In his compliments of leave, he said, 'Remember, Caesar, whenever thou art angry, that thou say or do nothing before thou hast distinctly repeated to thyself the twenty-four letters of the alphabet.' On which Caesar caught him by the hand, and said, 'I have need of thy presence still:' and kept him a year longer. This was excellent advice from a <i>heathen</i>; but a <i>Christian</i> may prescribe to himself a wiser rule. When thou art angry, answer not till thou hast repeated the <i>fifth</i> petition of our Lord's prayer-<i>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors</i>: and our Lord's comment upon it-<i>For if ye forgive not men their trespasses,</i> <i>neither will your heavenly father forgive your trespasses</i>."</p>
<p>PRAYER <i>to God</i> is considered among the <i>Mohammedans</i> in a very important point of view. It is declared by the <i>Mosliman</i> doctors to be the <i>corner stone of</i> RELIGION, <i>and the pillar of</i> FAITH. It is not, say they, a thing of mere <i>form</i>, but requires that the heart and understanding should accompany it, without which they pronounce it to be of no avail. They direct prayer to be performed <i>five</i> times in the <i>twenty-four</i> hours.</p>
<p>1. Between <i>day-break</i> and <i>sun-rise</i>;</p>
<p>2. Immediately after <i>noon</i>;</p>
<p>3. Immediately before <i>sun-set</i>;</p>
<p>4. In the <i>evening</i> before dark; and</p>
<p>5. Before the <i>first watch</i> of the <i>night</i>.</p>
<p>They hold the following points to be essentially requisite to the <i>efficacy</i> of prayer: -</p>
<p>1. That the person be free from every species of defilement.</p>
<p>2. That all sumptuous and gaudy apparel be laid aside.</p>
<p>3. That the attention accompany the act, and be not suffered to wander to any other object.</p>
<p>4. That the prayer be performed with the face toward the temple of MECCA. HEDAYAH. Prel. Dis. pp. 53, 54.</p>
<p>There are few points here but the follower of Christ may seriously consider and profitably practise.</p>
