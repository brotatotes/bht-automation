<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:16">Matthew 6:16</span>. <i><b>When ye fast</b></i> — A fast is termed by the Greeks νηστις, from νη <i>not</i>, and εσθειν <i>to eat</i>; hence fast means, a <i>total</i> <i>abstinence from food for a certain time</i>. Abstaining from <i>flesh</i>, and living on <i>fish, vegetables</i>, c., is no fast, or may be rather considered a burlesque on fasting. Many pretend to take the true definition of a fast from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:3">Isaiah 58:3</span>, and say that it means <i>a fast from sin</i>. This is a mistake there is no such term in the Bible as <i>fasting from sin</i>; the very idea is ridiculous and absurd, as if <i>sin</i> were a part of our <i>daily food</i>. In the <i>fast</i> mentioned by the prophet, the people were to divide their bread with the hungry, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:7">Isaiah 58:7</span>; but could they <i>eat</i> their bread, and <i>give</i> it too? No man should <i>save</i> by a <i>fast</i>: he should give all the food he might have eaten to the poor. He who <i>saves</i> a day's expense by a fast, commits an abomination before the Lord. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:15">Matthew 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:15">Matthew 9:15</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>As the hypocrites-of a sad countenance</b></i> — σκυθρωποι, either from σκυθρος <i>sour, crabbed</i>, and ωψ the <i>countenance</i>; or from σκυθης a <i>Scythian</i>, a <i>morose, gloomy, austere</i> phiz, like that of a <i>Scythian</i> or <i>Tartar</i>. A hypocrite has always a difficult part to act: when he wishes to appear as a penitent, not having any godly sorrow at heart, he is obliged to counterfeit it the best way he can, by a gloomy and austere look.</p>
