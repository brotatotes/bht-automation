<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:17">Matthew 6:17</span>. <i><b>Anoint thine head and wash thy face</b></i> â€” These were forbidden in the Jewish canon on days of fasting and humiliation; and hypocrites availed themselves of this ordinance, that they might appear to fast. Our Lord, therefore, cautions us against this: as if he had said, <i>Affect</i> nothing - dress in thy ordinary manner, and let the whole of thy deportment prove that thou desirest to recommend my <i>soul</i> to God, and not thy <i>face</i> to <i>men</i>. That factitious mourning, which consists in putting on black clothes, crapes, c., is utterly inconsistent with the <i>simplicity</i> of the Gospel of Christ and if practised in reference to spiritual matters, is certainly forbidden here: but sin is so common, and so boldly persisted in, that not even a <i>crape</i> is put on, as an evidence of deploring its influence, or of sorrow for having committed it.</p>
