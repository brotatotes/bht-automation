<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:18">Matthew 6:18</span>. <i><b>Thy father which seeth in secret</b></i> — Let us not be afraid that our hearts can be concealed from God; but let us fear lest he perceive them to be more desirous of the praise of men than they are of that glory which comes from Him.</p>
<p><i><b>Openly.</b></i> — εν τω φανερω. These words are omitted by nine MSS. in uncial letters; and by more than <i>one hundred</i> others, by most of the versions, and by several of the primitive <i>fathers</i>. As it is supported by no adequate authority, Bengel, Wetstein, Griesbach, and others, have left it out of the text.</p>
