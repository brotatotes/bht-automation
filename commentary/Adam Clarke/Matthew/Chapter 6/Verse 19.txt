<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>. <i><b>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth</b></i> — What blindness is it for a man to lay up that as a <i>treasure</i> which must necessarily perish! A heart designed for God and eternity is terribly degraded by being fixed on those things which are subject to corruption. "But may we not lay up treasure innocently?" Yes.</p>
<p>1st. If you can do it without setting your heart on it, which is <i>almost</i> impossible: and</p>
<p>2dly. If there be neither <i>widows</i> nor <i>orphans</i>, destitute nor distressed persons in the place where you live.</p>
<p>"But there is a portion which belongs to my children; shall I distribute <i>that</i> among the poor?" If it belongs to your children, it is not <i>yours</i>, and therefore you have no right to dispose of it. "But I have a certain sum in stock, c. shall I take that and divide it among the poor?" By no means; for, by doing so, you would put it out of your power to do good after the present division: keep your <i>principal</i>, and devote, if you possibly can spare it, the <i>product</i> to the poor; and thus you shall have the <i>continual</i> ability to do good. In the mean time take care not to shut up your bowels of compassion against a brother in distress; if you do, the love of God cannot dwell in you.</p>
<p><i><b>Rust</b></i> — Or <i>canker</i>, βρωσις, from βρωσκω, <i>I eat, consume</i>. This word cannot be properly applied to <i>rust</i>, but to any thing that <i>consumes</i> or <i>cankers</i> clothes or metals. There is a saying exactly similar to this in the Institutes of MENU: speaking of the presents made to Brahmins, he says, "It is a gem which neither thieves nor foes take away, and which never perishes." <i>Chapter of</i> <i>Government, Institute</i> 83.</p>
<p><i><b>Where thieves do not break through</b></i> — διορυσσουσι, literally <i>dig</i> <i>through</i>, i.e. the wall, in order to get into the house. This was not a difficult matter, as the house was generally made of <i>mud</i> and <i>straw</i>, kneaded together like the <i>cobb</i> houses in Cornwall, and other places. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:27">Matthew 7:27</span>.</p>
