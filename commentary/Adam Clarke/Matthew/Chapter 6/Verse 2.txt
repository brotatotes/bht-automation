<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>. <i><b>Therefore when thou doest thine alms</b></i> — In the first verse the exhortation is general: <i>Take</i> YE <i>heed</i>. In this verse the address is pointed - and THOU - man - woman - who readest - hearest.</p>
<p><i><b>Do not sound a trumpet</b></i> — It is very likely that this was literally practised among the Pharisees, who seemed to live on the public esteem, and were excessively self-righteous and vain. Having something to distribute by way of alms, it is very probable they caused this to be published by blowing a <i>trumpet</i> or <i>horn</i>, under pretence of collecting the poor; though with no other design than to gratify their own ambition. There is a custom in the east not much unlike this. "The <i>derveeshes</i> carry <i>horns</i> with them, which they frequently <i>blow</i>, when any thing is <i>given to them, in</i> <i>honor of the donor</i>. It is not impossible that some of the poor Jews who begged alms might be furnished like the Persian derveeshes, who are a sort of religious beggars, and that these hypocrites might be disposed to confine their alms-giving to those that they knew would pay them this honour." HARMER'S Observat. vol. i. p. 474.</p>
<p>It must be granted, that in the Jewish writings there is no such practice referred to as that which I have supposed above, viz. blowing a trumpet to gather the poor, or the poor blowing a horn when relieved. Hence some learned men have thought that the word <i>shopher</i>, a <i>trumpet</i>, refers to the hole in the public alms chest, into which the money was dropped which was allotted for the service of the poor. Such holes, because they were wide at one end and grew gradually narrow towards the other, were actually termed שופרות <i>shopheroth</i>, trumpets, by the rabbins; of this <i>Schoettgen</i> furnishes several examples. An ostentatious man, who wished to attract the notice of those around him, would throw in his money with some force into these trumpet-resembling holes, and thus he might be said שופר σαλπιζειν, to <i>sound</i> the <i>trumpet</i>. The Jerusalem Gemara, tract <i>Shekalim</i>, describes these שופרות <i>shopheroth</i> thus - <i>These trumpet holes were crooked, narrow above and</i> <i>wide below, in order to prevent fraud</i>. As our Lord only uses the words, μησαλπισης, it may be tantamount to our term <i>jingle</i>. Do not make a public ostentatious <i>jingle</i> of that money which you give to public charities. Pride and hypocrisy are the things here reprehended. The Pharisees, no doubt, felt the weight of the reproof. Still the words may be taken in their literal meaning, as we know that the <i>Moslimans</i>, who nearly resemble the ancient Pharisees in the ostentation, bigotry, and cruelty of their character, are accustomed, in their festival of <i>Muhurram</i>, to erect <i>stages</i> in the public streets, and, by the <i>sound of a trumpet</i>, call the <i>poor</i> together to receive alms of rice, and other kinds of food. See WARD.</p>
<p>Works of charity and mercy should be done as much in private as is consistent with the advancement of the glory of God, and the effectual relief of the poor.</p>
<p><i><b>In the synagogues and in the streets</b></i> — That such chests or boxes, for receiving the alms of well-disposed people, were placed in the synagogues, we may readily believe; but what were the <i>streets</i>? <i>Schoettgen</i> supposes that courts or avenues in the temple and in the synagogues may be intended - places where the people were accustomed to walk, for air, amusement, c., for it is not to be supposed that such chests were fixed in the public streets.</p>
<p><i><b>They have their reward.</b></i> — That is, the honour and esteem of men which they sought. God is under no obligation to them-they did nothing with an eye to his glory, and from HIM they can expect no recompense. They had their recompense in this life and could expect none in the world to come.</p>
