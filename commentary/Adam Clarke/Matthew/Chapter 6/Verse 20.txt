<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span>. <i><b>Lay up - treasures in heaven</b></i> â€” "The only way to render perishing goods <i>eternal</i>, to secure stately furniture from <i>moths</i>, and the richest metals from <i>canker</i>, and precious stones from <i>thieves</i>, is to transmit them to heaven by acts of charity. This is a kind of <i>bill of exchange</i> which cannot fail of <i>acceptance</i>, but through our own fault." <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
<p>It is certain we have not the smallest portion of temporal good, but what we have received from the unmerited bounty of God: and if we give back to him all we have received, yet still there is no <i>merit</i> that can fairly attach to the act, as the goods <i>were</i> the Lord's; for I am not to suppose that I can purchase any thing from a man <i>by his own property</i>. On this ground the doctrine of human merit is one of the most absurd that ever was published among men, or credited by sinners. Yet he who supposes he can purchase heaven by giving that meat which was left at his own table, and that of his servants; or by giving a garment which he could no longer in decency wear, must have a base ignorant soul, and a very mean opinion of the heaven he hopes for. But shall not such works as these be rewarded? Yes, yes, God will take care to give you all that your <i>refuse victuals and old clothes</i> are <i>worth</i>. Yet he, who through love to God and man, divides his bread with the hungry, and covers the naked with a garment, shall not lose his reward; a reward which the mercy of God appoints, but to which, in strict justice, he can lay no claim.</p>
