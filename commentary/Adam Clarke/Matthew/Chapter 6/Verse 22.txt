<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:22">Matthew 6:22</span>. <i><b>The light of the body is the eye</b></i> — That is, the eye is to the body what the sun is to the universe in the day time, or a lamp or candle to a house at night.</p>
<p><i><b>If-thine eye be single</b></i> — απλους, <i>simple, uncompounded</i>; i.e. so perfect in its structure as to see objects <i>distinctly</i> and <i>clearly</i>, and not confusedly, or in different places to what they are, as is often the case in certain disorders of the eye; <i>one</i> object appearing <i>two</i> or <i>more</i>-or else in a different situation, and of a different colour to what it really is. This state of the eye is termed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:23">Matthew 6:23</span>, πονηρος <i>evil</i>, i.e. <i>diseased</i> or <i>defective</i>. An <i>evil eye</i> was a phrase in use, among the ancient Jews, to denote an <i>envious,</i> <i>covetous</i> man or disposition; a man who repined at his neighbour's prosperity, loved his own money, and would do nothing in the way of charity for God's sake. Our blessed Lord, however, extends and sublimes this meaning, and uses the <i>sound eye</i> as a metaphor to point out that <i>simplicity</i> of <i>intention</i>, and <i>purity</i> of <i>affection</i> with which men should pursue the supreme good. <i>We cannot draw</i> <i>more than one straight line between two indivisible points</i>. We aim at happiness: it is found only in one thing, the <i>indivisible</i> and <i>eternal</i> GOD. It the <i>line</i> of <i>simple intention</i> be <i>drawn</i> <i>straight</i> to him, and the soul walk by it, with <i>purity of</i> <i>affection</i>, the whole man shall be <i>light in the Lord</i>; the <i>rays</i> of that excellent glory shall <i>irradiate</i> the mind, and through the whole spirit shall the Divine nature be transfused. But if a person who enjoyed this heavenly treasure permit his <i>simplicity</i> of intention to <i>deviate</i> from heavenly to earthly good; and his <i>purity</i> <i>of affection</i> to be contaminated by worldly ambition, secular profits, and animal gratifications; then, <i>the light which was in</i> <i>him becomes darkness</i>, i.e. his spiritual discernment departs, and his union with God is destroyed: all is only a <i>palpable obscure</i>; and, like a man who has totally lost his sight, he walks without <i>direction, certainty</i>, or <i>comfort</i>. This state is most forcibly intimated in our Lord's exclamation, <i>How great a darkness</i>! Who can adequately describe the misery and wretchedness of that soul which has lost its union with the fountain of all good, and, in losing this, has lost the <i>possibility</i> of happiness till the <i>simple</i> <i>eye</i> be once more given, and the <i>straight line</i> once more drawn.</p>
