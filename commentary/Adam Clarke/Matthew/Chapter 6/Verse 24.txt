<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>. <i><b>No man can serve two masters</b></i> — The master of our heart may be fitly termed the <i>love</i> that reigns in it. We serve that only which we love supremely. A man cannot be in perfect indifference betwixt two objects which are incompatible: he is inclined to despise and hate whatever he does not love supremely, when the <i>necessity</i> of a <i>choice</i> presents itself.</p>
<p><i><b>He will hate the one and love the other.</b></i> — The word <i>hate</i> has the same sense here as it has in many places of Scripture; it merely signifies to love <i>less</i>-so Jacob loved Rachel, but <i>hated</i> Leah; i.e. he loved Leah much less than he loved Rachel. God himself uses it precisely in the same sense: Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I <i>hated</i>; i.e. I have loved the posterity of Esau less than I have loved the posterity of Jacob: which means no more than that God, in the course of his providence, gave to the Jews greater earthly privileges than he gave to the Edomites, and chose to make them the progenitors of the Messiah, though they ultimately, through their own obstinacy, derived no more benefit from this privilege than the Edomites did. How strange is it, that with such evidence before their eyes, men will apply this <i>loving</i> and <i>hating</i> to degrees of inclusion and exclusion, in which neither the justice nor mercy of God are honoured!</p>
<p><i><b>Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</b></i> — ממון <i>mamon</i> is used for <i>money</i> in the <i>Targum</i> of <i>Onkelos</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+18:21">Exodus 18:21</span>; and in that of <i>Jonathan</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+5:19">Judges 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+8:3">1 Samuel 8:3</span>. The Syriac word ממונא <i>mamona</i> is used in the same sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:30">Exodus 21:30</span>. Dr. Castel deduces these words from the Hebrew אמן <i>aman</i>, to <i>trust,</i> <i>confide</i>; because men are apt to trust in riches. <i>Mammon</i> may therefore be considered any thing a man <i>confides</i> in. Augustine observes, "that <i>mammon</i>, in the <i>Punic</i> or Carthaginian language, signified gain." <i>Lucrum Punicè</i> <i>mammon</i> dicitur. The word plainly denotes <i>riches</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:9">Luke 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:11">Luke 16:11</span>, in which latter verse mention is made not only of the <i>deceitful mammon</i>, (τω αδικω), but also of the <i>true</i> (το αληθινον.) St. Luke's phrase, μαμωνα αδικιας, very exactly answers to the Chaldee ממון דשקר <i>mamon dishekar</i>, which is often used in the Targums. See more in <i>Wetstein</i> and <i>Parkhurst</i>.</p>
<p>Some suppose there was an <i>idol</i> of this name, and Kircher mentions such a one in his <i>OEdip. Egyptiacus</i>. See <i>Castel</i>.</p>
<p>Our blessed Lord shows here the utter impossibility of loving the world and loving God at the same time; or, in other words, that a <i>man of the world</i> cannot be a truly religious character. He who gives his heart to the world robs God of it, and, in <i>snatching</i> at the <i>shadow</i> of earthly good, loses substantial and eternal blessedness. How dangerous is it to set our hearts upon riches, seeing it is so easy to make them our God!</p>
