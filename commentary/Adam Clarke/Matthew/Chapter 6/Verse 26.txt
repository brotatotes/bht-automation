<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:26">Matthew 6:26</span>. <i><b>Behold the fowls of the air</b></i> — The <i>second</i> reason why we should not be anxiously concerned about the future, is the example of the smaller animals, which the providence of God feeds without their own labour; though he be not their father. We never knew an earthly father take care of his <i>fowls</i>, and neglect his <i>children</i>; and shall we fear this from our heavenly Father? God forbid! That man is utterly unworthy to have God for his father, who depends less upon his goodness, wisdom, and power, than upon a crop of corn, which may be spoiled either in the field or in the barn. If our great Creator have made us capable of knowing, loving, and enjoying himself eternally, what may we not expect from him, after so great a gift?</p>
<p><i><b>They sow not, neither do they reap</b></i> — There is a saying among the rabbins almost similar to this - "Hast thou ever seen a beast or a fowl that had a workshop? yet they are fed without labour and without anxiety. They were created for the service of man, and man was created that he might serve his Creator. Man also would have been supported without labour and anxiety, had he not corrupted his ways. Hast thou ever seen a <i>lion</i> carrying burthens, a <i>stag</i> gathering summer fruits, a <i>fox</i> selling merchandise, or a <i>wolf</i> selling oil, that they might thus gain their support? And yet they are fed without care or labour. Arguing therefore from the less to the greater, if <i>they</i> which were created that they might serve <i>me</i>, are nourished without labour and anxiety, how much more <i>I</i>, who have been created that I might serve my Maker! What therefore is the cause, why I should be obliged to labour in order to get my daily bread? Answer, SIN." This is a curious and important extract, and is highly worthy of the reader's attention.
