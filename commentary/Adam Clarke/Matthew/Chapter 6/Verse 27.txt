<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:27">Matthew 6:27</span>. <i><b>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto</b></i><b> </b><i><b>his stature?</b></i> — The <i>third</i> reason against these carking cares is the unprofitableness of human solicitude, unless God vouchsafe to bless it. What can our <i>uneasiness</i> do but render us still more unworthy of the Divine care? The passage from distrust to apostasy is very short and easy; and a man is not far from murmuring against Providence, who is dissatisfied with its conduct. We should depend as fully upon God for the <i>preservation</i> of his <i>gifts</i> as for the <i>gifts</i> themselves.</p>
<p><i><b>Cubit unto his stature?</b></i> — I think ηλικιαν should be rendered <i>age</i> here, and so our translators have rendered the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:21">John 9:21</span>, αυτος ηλικιαν εχει <i>he is of age</i>. A very learned writer observes, that no difficulty can arise from applying πηχυν a <i>cubit</i>, a measure of <i>extension</i>, to <i>time</i>, and the <i>age</i> of man: as <i>place</i> and <i>time</i> are both <i>quantities</i>, and capable of <i>increase</i> and <i>diminution</i>, and, as no <i>fixed material</i> standard can be employed in the <i>mensuration</i> of the <i>fleeting</i> particles of <i>time</i>, it was <i>natural</i> and <i>necessary</i>, in the construction of language, to apply parallel terms to the discrimination of <i>time</i> and <i>place</i>. Accordingly, we find the same words indifferently used to denote <i>time</i> and <i>place</i> in every known tongue. Lord, let me know the MEASURE of my days! Thou hast made my days HAND-BREADTHS, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:5">Psalms 39:5</span>. Many examples might be adduced from the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> writers. Besides, it is evident that the phrase of adding one cubit is proverbial, denoting something minute; and is therefore applicable to the <i>smallest possible portion of time</i>; but, in a <i>literal</i> acceptation, the <i>addition</i> of a <i>cubit</i> to the <i>stature</i>, would be a <i>great</i> and <i>extraordinary</i> accession of <i>height</i>.
