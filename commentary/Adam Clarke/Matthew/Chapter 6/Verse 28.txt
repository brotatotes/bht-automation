<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:28">Matthew 6:28</span>. <i><b>And why take ye thought for raiment?</b></i> — Or, <i>why are ye</i> <i>anxiously careful about raiment</i>? The <i>fourth</i> reason against such inquietudes is the example of inanimate creatures: The <i>herbs</i> and <i>flowers</i> of the field have their being, nourishment, exquisite flavours, and beautiful hues from God himself. They are not only without anxious care, but also without care or thought of every kind. Your being, its excellence and usefulness, do not depend on your anxious concern: they spring as truly from the beneficence and continual superintendence of God, as the flowers of the field do; and were you brought into such a situation, as to be as utterly incapable of contributing to your own preservation and support as the <i>lilies</i> of the field are to theirs, your heavenly Father could augment your substance, and preserve your being, when for his glory and your own advantage.</p>
<p><i><b>Consider</b></i> — Diligently consider this, καταμαθετε, <i>lay it</i> <i>earnestly to heart</i>, and let your confidence be unshaken in the God of infinite bounty and love.</p>
