<p>Verse 30. <i><b>If God so clothe the grass of the field</b></i> — Christ confounds both the luxury of the <i>rich</i> in their superfluities, and the distrust of the <i>poor</i> as to the necessaries of life. Let man, who is made for God and eternity, learn from a flower of the field how low the care of Providence stoops. All our inquietudes and distrusts proceed from lack of faith: <i>that</i> supplies all wants. The poor are not really such, but because they are destitute of faith.</p>
<p><i><b>To-morrow is cast into the oven</b></i> — The inhabitants of the east, to this day, make use of <i>dry straw, withered herbs</i>, and <i>stubble</i>, to heat their <i>ovens</i>. Some have translated the original word κλιβανον, <i>a still</i>, and intimate that our Lord alludes to the <i>distillation of herbs</i> for medicinal purposes; but this is certainly contrary to the scope of our Lord's argument, which runs thus: If God covers with so much <i>glory</i> things of no farther value than to serve the <i>meanest</i> uses, will he not take care of his <i>servants</i>, who are so precious in his sight, and designed for such <i>important services</i> in the world? See <i>Harmer's Observations</i>.</p>
