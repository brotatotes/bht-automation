<p>Verse 32. <i><b>For after all these things do the Gentiles seek</b></i> — The <i>fifth</i> reason against solicitude about the future is-that to concern ourselves about these wants with anxiety, as if there was no such thing as a providence in the world; with great affection towards earthly enjoyments, as if we expected no other; and without <i>praying</i> to God or consulting his will, as if we could do any thing without him: this is to imitate the worst kind of <i>heathens</i>, who live without hope, and without God in the world.</p>
<p><i><b>Seek</b></i> — επιζητει from επι, intensive, and ζητεω, <i>I seek,</i> <i>to seek intensely, earnestly, again and again</i>: the true characteristic of the worldly man; his soul is never satisfied-<i>give! give</i>! is the ceaseless language of his earth-born heart.</p>
<p><i><b>Your heavenly Father knoweth</b></i>, c.] The <i>sixth</i> reason against this anxiety about the future is-because God, our heavenly Father, is infinite in wisdom, and knows all our wants. It is the property of a <i>wise</i> and <i>tender</i> father to provide <i>necessaries</i>, and not <i>superfluities</i>, for his children. Not to expect the former is an offence to his <i>goodness</i> to expect the latter is injurious to his <i>wisdom</i>.</p>
