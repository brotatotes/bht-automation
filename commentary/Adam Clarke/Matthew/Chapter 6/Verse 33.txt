<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:33">Matthew 6:33</span>. <i><b>But seek ye first the kingdom of God</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>His righteousness</b></i> — That holiness of heart and purity of life which God requires of those who profess to be subjects of that spiritual kingdom mentioned above. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>seventh</i> reason against these worldly cares and fears is-because the business of our salvation ought to engross us entirely: hither all our desires, cares, and inquiries ought to tend. <i>Grace</i> is the way to <i>glory </i>- holiness the way to happiness. If men be not righteous, there is no heaven to be had: if they be, they shall have heaven and earth too; for godliness has the promise of both lives. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3">1 Timothy 6:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>All these things shall be added unto you.</b></i> — The very blunt note of old Mr. <i>Trapp</i>, on this passage, is worthy of serious attention. All things shall be added. "They shall be cast in as an overplus, or as small advantages to the main bargain; as paper and pack-thread are given where we buy spice and fruit, or an inch of measure to an ell of cloth." This was a very common saying among the Jews: "Seek that, to which other things are necessarily connected." "A king said to his particular friend, 'Ask what thou wilt, and I will give it unto thee.' He thought within himself, 'If I ask to be made a general I shall readily obtain it. I will ask something to which all these things shall be added:' he therefore said, 'Give me thy daughter to wife.' This he did knowing that all the dignities of the kingdom should be added unto this gift." See in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>To this verse, probably, belong the following words, quoted often by <i>Clement, Origen</i>, and Eusebius, as the words of Christ: αιτειτε τα μεγαλα, και τα μικρα υμιν προστεθησεται· και αιτειτε τα επουρανια, και τα επιγεια προστεθησεται υμιν. "Ask great things, and little things shall be added unto you; ask heavenly things, and earthly things shall be added unto you."</p>
