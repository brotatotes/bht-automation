<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:34">Matthew 6:34</span>. <i><b>Take therefore no thought</b></i> — That is, <i>Be not therefore</i> <i>anxiously careful</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>eighth</i> and last reason, against this preposterous conduct, is - that <i>carking care</i> is not only useless in itself, but renders us miserable beforehand. The future falls under the cognizance of God alone: we encroach, therefore, upon his rights, when we would fain foresee all that may happen to us, and secure ourselves from it by our cares. How much good is omitted, how many evils caused, how many duties neglected, how many innocent persons deserted, how many good works destroyed, how many truths suppressed, and how many acts of injustice authorized by those <i>timorous</i> forecasts of <i>what may happen</i>; and those <i>faithless</i> apprehensions concerning the <i>future</i>! Let us do <i>now</i> what God requires of us, and trust the consequences to him. The <i>future</i> time which God would have us foresee and provide for is that of judgment and eternity: and it is about this <i>alone</i> that we are careless!</p>
<p><i><b>Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof</b></i> — Αρκετον τη ἡμερα ἡ κακια αυτης, <i>Sufficient for each day is its own calamity</i>. Each day has its <i>peculiar</i> trials: we should meet them with confidence in God. As we should live but a day at a time, so we should take care to suffer no more evils in one day than are necessarily attached to it. He who neglects the <i>present</i> for the <i>future</i> is acting opposite to the order of God, his own interest, and to every dictate of sound wisdom. Let us live for <i>eternity</i>, and we shall secure all that is valuable in <i>time</i>.</p>
<p>There are many valuable reflections in the <i>Abbe Quesnel's</i> work, on this chapter; and from it several of the preceding have been derived.</p>
