<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:4">Matthew 6:4</span>. <i><b>Which seeth in secret</b></i> — We should ever remember that the eye of the Lord is upon us, and that he sees not only the <i>act</i>, but also every motive that led to it.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall reward thee openly.</b></i> — Will give thee the fullest proofs of his acceptance of thy work of faith, and labour of love, by increasing that substance which, <i>for his sake</i>, thou sharest with the poor; and will <i>manifest</i> his approbation in thy own heart, by the witness of his Spirit.</p>
