<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5">Matthew 6:5</span>. <i><b>And when thou prayest</b></i> — Οταν προσευχη. Προσευχη, <i>prayer</i>, is compounded of προς <i>with</i>, and ευχη a <i>vow</i>, because to pray right, a man <i>binds</i> himself to God, as by a <i>vow</i>, to live to his glory, if he will grant him his grace, c. ευχομαι signifies <i>to pour out prayers</i> or <i>vows</i>, from ευ <i>well</i>, and χεω, <i>I pour out</i> probably alluding to the <i>offerings</i> or <i>libations</i> which were <i>poured out</i> before, or on the altar. A proper idea of prayer is, <i>a pouring out of the soul unto God</i>, as a <i>free-will offering</i>, solemnly and eternally dedicated to him, accompanied with the most <i>earnest desire</i> that it may know, love, and serve him alone. He that comes thus to God will ever be heard and blessed. Prayer is the language of <i>dependence</i>; he who prays not, is endeavouring to live <i>independently</i> of God: this was the <i>first</i> curse, and continues to be the great curse of mankind. In the beginning, Satan said, Eat this fruit; ye shall then be as God; i.e. ye shall be <i>independent</i>: the man hearkened to his voice, sin entered into the world, and notwithstanding the full manifestation of the deception, the ruinous system is still pursued; man will, if possible, live independently of God; hence he either prays not at all, or uses the <i>language</i> without the <i>spirit</i> of prayer. The following verses contain so fine a view, and so just a definition, of prayer, that I think the pious reader will be glad to find them here. </p>
<p><i><b>Love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>the streets</b></i> — The Jewish phylacterical prayers were long, and the canonical hours obliged them to repeat these prayers wherever they happened to be; and the Pharisees, who were full of vain glory, contrived to be overtaken in the streets by the canonical hour, that they might be seen by the people, and applauded for their great and conscientious piety. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. As they had no piety but that which was <i>outward</i>, they endeavoured to let it fully appear, that they might make the most of it among the people. It would not have answered their end to <i>kneel</i> before God, for then they might have been <i>unnoticed</i> by men; and consequently have lost that reward which they had in view: <i>viz</i>. the esteem and applause of the multitude. This <i>hypocritical</i> pretension to devotion is common among the Asiatics. Both <i>Hindoos</i> and <i>Mohammedans</i> love to pray in the most <i>public</i> places, at the <i>landing</i> <i>places of rivers</i>, in the <i>public streets</i>, on the <i>roofs</i> of the <i>covered boats</i>, without the least endeavour to conceal their outside devotion, that they may be seen of men.</p>
