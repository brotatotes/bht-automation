<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:6">Matthew 6:6</span>. <i><b>But thou, when thou prayest</b></i> — This is a very impressive and emphatic address. But THOU! whosoever thou art, Jew, Pharisee, Christian-enter into thy closet. Prayer is the most secret intercourse of the soul with God, and as it were the conversation of one heart with another. The world is too profane and treacherous to be of the secret. We must <i>shut the door</i> against it: endeavour to forget it, with all the affairs which busy and amuse it. Prayer requires retirement, at least of the heart; for this may be fitly termed the <i>closet</i> in the house of God, which house the body of every real Christian is, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>. To this closet we ought to retire even in public prayer, and in the midst of company.</p>
<p><i><b>Reward thee openly.</b></i> — What goodness is there equal to this of God to give, not only <i>what</i> we ask, and <i>more</i> than we ask, but to reward even <i>prayer</i> itself! How great advantage is it to serve a prince who places prayers in the number of services, and reckons to his subjects' account, even their trust and confidence in begging all things of him!</p>
