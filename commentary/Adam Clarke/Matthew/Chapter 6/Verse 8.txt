<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:8">Matthew 6:8</span>. <i><b>Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of</b></i> â€” Prayer is not designed to <i>inform</i> God, but to give <i>man</i> a sight of his misery; to humble his heart, to excite his desire, to inflame his faith, to animate his hope, to raise his soul from earth to heaven, and to put him in mind that THERE is his <i>Father</i>, his <i>country</i>, and <i>inheritance</i>.</p>
<p>In the preceding verses we may see three faults, which our Lord commands us to avoid in prayer:-</p>
<p>1st. HYPOCRISY. <i>Be not as the hypocrites</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5">Matthew 6:5</span>.</p>
<p>2ndly. DISSIPATION. <i>Enter into thy closet</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:6">Matthew 6:6</span>.</p>
<p>3rdly. MUCH SPEAKING, or UNMEANING REPETITION, <i>Be not like the</i> <i>heathens</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:7">Matthew 6:7</span>.</p>
