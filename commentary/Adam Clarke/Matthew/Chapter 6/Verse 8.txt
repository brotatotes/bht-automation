Verse Matthew 6:8. Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of â€” Prayer is not designed to inform God, but to give man a sight of his misery; to humble his heart, to excite his desire, to inflame his faith, to animate his hope, to raise his soul from earth to heaven, and to put him in mind that THERE is his Father, his country, and inheritance.In the preceding verses we may see three faults, which our Lord commands us to avoid in prayer:-1st. HYPOCRISY. Be not as the hypocrites. Matthew 6:5.2ndly. DISSIPATION. Enter into thy closet. Matthew 6:6.3rdly. MUCH SPEAKING, or UNMEANING REPETITION, Be not like the heathens. Matthew 6:7.
