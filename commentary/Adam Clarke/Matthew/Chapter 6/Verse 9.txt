<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9">Matthew 6:9</span>. <i><b>After this manner therefore pray ye</b></i> — Forms of prayer were frequent among the Jews; and every public teacher gave one to his disciples. Some forms were drawn out to a considerable length, and from these <i>abridgments</i> were made: to the latter sort the following prayer properly belongs, and consequently, besides its own very important use, it is a <i>plan</i> for a more extended devotion. What satisfaction must it be to learn from God himself, with <i>what words</i>, and in what <i>manner</i>, he would have us pray to him, so as not to pray in vain! A king, who draws up the petition which he allows to be presented to himself, has doubtless the fullest determination to grant the request. We do not sufficiently consider the value of this prayer; the respect and attention which it requires; the preference to be given to it; its fulness and perfection: the frequent use we should make of it; and the spirit which we should bring with it. "Lord, teach us how to pray!" is a prayer necessary <i>to</i> prayer; for unless we are divinely instructed in the <i>manner</i>, and influenced by the spirit of true devotion, even the prayer taught us by Jesus Christ may be repeated without profit to our souls.</p>
<p><i><b>Our Father</b></i> — It was a maxim of the Jews, that a man should not pray alone, but join with the Church; by which they particularly meant that he should, whether alone or with the synagogue, use the <i>plural</i> number as comprehending all the followers of God. Hence, they say, Let none pray the <i>short prayer</i>, i.e. as the gloss expounds it, the prayer in the <i>singular</i>, but in the <i>plural</i> number. See <i>Lightfoot</i> on this place.</p>
<p>This prayer was evidently made in a peculiar manner for the <i>children of God</i>. And hence we are taught to say, not MY <i>Father</i>, but OUR <i>Father</i>. The heart, says one, of a child of God, is a brotherly heart, in respect of all other Christians: it asks nothing but in the spirit of <i>unity, fellowship</i>, and <i>Christian</i> <i>charity</i>; desiring <i>that</i> for its brethren which it desires for itself.</p>
<p>The word <i>Father</i>, placed here at the beginning of this prayer, includes two grand ideas, which should serve as a foundation to all our petitions:</p>
<p>1st. That tender and respectful love which we should feel for God, such as that which children feel for their fathers.</p>
<p>2dly. That strong confidence in God's love to us, such as fathers have for their children.</p>
<p>Thus all the petitions in this prayer stand in strictest reference to the word <i>Father</i>; the first three referring to the <i>love we have for God</i>; and the three last, to that <i>confidence</i> which we have in the love <i>he bears to us</i>.</p>
<p>The relation we stand in to this first and best of beings dictates to us <i>reverence</i> for his person, <i>zeal</i> for his honour, <i>obedience</i> to his will, <i>submission</i> to his dispensations and chastisements, and <i>resemblance</i> to his nature.</p>
<p><i><b>Which art in heaven</b></i> — The phrase אבינו שבשמים, <i>abinu</i> <i>sheboshemayim</i>, our Father who art in heaven, was very common among the ancient Jews; and was used by them precisely in the same sense as it is used here by our Lord.</p>
<p>This phrase in the Scriptures seems used to express:</p>
<p>1st. His OMNIPRESENCE. <i>The heaven of heavens cannot contain</i> <i>thee</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:27">1 Kings 8:27</span>: that is, Thou fillest immensity.</p>
<p>2dly. His MAJESTY and DOMINION over his creatures. <i>Art thou not</i> <i>God in heaven, and rulest thou not over all the kingdoms of the</i> <i>heathen</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+20:6">2 Chronicles 20:6</span>.</p>
<p>3dly. His POWER and MIGHT. <i>Art thou not God in heaven, and in</i> <i>thy hand is there not power and might, so that no creature is able</i> <i>to withstand thee</i>! <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+20:6">2 Chronicles 20:6</span>. <i>Our God is in heaven, and hath done whatsoever he pleased</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+115:3">Psalms 115:3</span>.</p>
<p>4thly. His OMNISCIENCE. <i>The Lord's throne is in heaven, his</i> <i>eyes behold, his eye-lids try the children of men</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+11:4">Psalms 11:4</span>. <i>The Lord looketh down from heaven, he beholdeth all the sons of</i> <i>men</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+33:13-15">Psalms 33:13-15</span>.</p>
<p>5thly. His infinite PURITY and HOLINESS. <i>Look down from thy holy</i> <i>habitation, c</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+26:15">Deuteronomy 26:15</span>. <i>Thou art the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, whose</i> <i>name is holy</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:15">Isaiah 57:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hallowed</b></i> — Αγιασθητω. Αγιαζω· from a negative, and γη, <i>the</i> <i>earth</i>, a thing <i>separated from the earth</i>, or from <i>earthly purposes</i> and <i>employments</i>. As the word <i>sanctified</i>, or <i>hallowed</i>, in Scripture, is frequently used for the <i>consecration</i> of a thing or person to a holy use or office, as the <i>Levites, first-born,</i> <i>tabernacle, temple</i>, and their utensils, which were all <i>set apart</i> from every earthly, common, or profane use, and employed wholly in the service of God, so the Divine Majesty may be said to be sanctified by us, in analogy to those things, viz. when, we separate him from, and in our conceptions and desires exalt him above, <i>earth</i> and <i>all things</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thy name.</b></i> — That is, GOD <i>himself</i>, with all the <i>attributes</i> of his Divine nature-his power, wisdom, justice, mercy, c.</p>
<p>We hallow God's name,</p>
<p>1st. With our <i>lips</i>, when all our conversation is holy, and we speak of those things which are meet to minister grace to the hearers.</p>
<p>2dly. In our <i>thoughts</i>, when we suppress every rising evil, and have our tempers regulated by his grace and Spirit.</p>
<p>3dly. In our <i>lives</i>, when we begin, continue, and end our works to his glory. If we have an eye to God in all we perform, then every act of our common employment will be an act of religious worship.</p>
<p>4thly. In our <i>families</i>, when we endeavour to bring up our <i>children</i> in the discipline and admonition or the Lord instructing also our <i>servants</i> in the way of righteousness.</p>
<p>5thly. In a particular <i>calling</i> or <i>business</i>, when we <i>separate</i> the falsity, deception, and lying, commonly practised, from it buying and selling as in the sight of the holy and just God.</p>
