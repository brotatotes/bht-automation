<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1">Matthew 7:1</span>. <i><b>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</b></i> â€” These exhortations are pointed against rash, harsh, and uncharitable judgments, the <i>thinking evil, where no evil seems</i>, and speaking of it accordingly. The Jews were highly criminal here, and yet had very excellent maxims against it, as may be seen in <i>Schoettgen</i>. This is one of the most important exhortations in the whole of this excellent sermon. By a secret and criminal disposition of nature, man endeavours to elevate himself above others, and, to do it more effectually, depresses them. His jealous and envious heart wishes that there may be no good quality found but in himself, that he alone may be esteemed. Such is the state of every unconverted man; and it is from this criminal disposition, that <i>evil surmises, rash judgments, precipitate decisions</i>, and all other unjust procedures against our neighbour, flow.</p>
