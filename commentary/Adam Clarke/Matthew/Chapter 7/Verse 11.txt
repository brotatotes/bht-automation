<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:11">Matthew 7:11</span>. <i><b>If ye, then, being evil</b></i> — πονηροι οντες, who are radically and diabolically depraved, yet feel yourselves led, by natural affection, to give those things to your children which are necessary to support their lives, how much more will your Father who is in heaven, whose nature is infinite goodness, mercy, and grace, <i>give good things </i>- his grace and Spirit (πνευμα αγτον, the Holy Ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:13">Luke 11:13</span>,) to them who ask him? What a picture is here given of the goodness of God! Reader, ask thy soul, could this heavenly Father <i>reprobate</i> to <i>unconditional</i> eternal damnation any creature he has made? He who can believe that he has, may believe any thing: but still GOD IS LOVE.</p>
