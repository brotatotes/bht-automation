<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:13">Matthew 7:13</span>. <i><b>Enter ye in at the strait gate</b></i> — Our Saviour seems to allude here to the distinction between the public and private ways mentioned by the Jewish lawyers. The public roads were allowed to be sixteen cubits broad, the private ways only <i>four</i>. The words in the original are very emphatic: Enter in (to the kingdom of heaven) through THIS strait gate, δια της στενης πυλης, i.e. of <i>doing to every one as you would he should do unto you</i>; for this alone seems to be the <i>strait gate</i> which our Lord alludes to.</p>
<p><i><b>For wide is the gate</b></i> — <i>And</i> very <i>broad</i>, ευρυχωρος, from ευρυς, <i>broad</i>, and χωρος, <i>a place</i>, a spacious roomy place, that leadeth forward, απαγουσα, into THAT destruction, εις την απωλειαν, meaning eternal misery; intimating, that it is much more congenial, to the revengeful, covetous heart of fallen man, to take every advantage of another, and to enrich himself at his expense, rather than to walk according to the rule laid down before, by our blessed Lord, and that acting contrary to it is the way to everlasting misery. With those who say it means repentance, and forsaking sin, I can have no controversy. That is certainly a <i>gate</i>, and a <i>strait</i> one too, through which every sinner must turn to God, in order to find salvation. But the doing to every one as we would they should do unto us, is a gate extremely <i>strait</i>, and very difficult, to every unregenerate mind.</p>
