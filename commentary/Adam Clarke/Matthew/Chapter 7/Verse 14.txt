<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:14">Matthew 7:14</span>. <i><b>Because strait</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the gate</b></i> — Instead of οτι <i>because</i>, I should prefer τι <i>how</i>, which reading is supported by a great majority of the best MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers</i>. How <i>strait is that</i> gate! This mode of expression more forcibly points out the difficulty of the way to the kingdom. How strange is it that men should be unwilling to give up their worldly interests to secure their everlasting salvation! And yet no interest need be abandoned, but that which is produced by <i>injustice</i> and <i>unkindness</i>. Reason, as well as God, says, such people should be excluded from a place of blessedness. He who shows no <i>mercy</i> (and much more he who shows no <i>justice</i>) shall have judgment without mercy. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:13">James 2:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Few there be that find it.</b></i> — The strait gate, στενη πυλη, signifies literally what we call a <i>wicket</i>, i.e. a little door in a large gate. Gate, among the Jews, signifies, metaphorically, the entrance, introduction, or means of acquiring any thing. So they talk of the gate of repentance, the gate of prayers, and the gate of tears. When God, say they, shut the gate of paradise against Adam, He opened to him the gate of repentance. The <i>way</i> to the kingdom of God is made sufficiently manifest - the completest assistance is promised in the way, and the greatest encouragement to persevere to the end is held out in the everlasting Gospel. But men are so wedded to their own passions, and so determined to follow the imaginations of their own hearts, that still it may be said: There are <i>few</i> who <i>find</i> the way to heaven; fewer yet who <i>abide</i> any time in it; fewer still who <i>walk</i> in it; and fewest of all who <i>persevere</i> unto the end. Nothing renders this way either <i>narrow</i> or <i>difficult</i> to any person, but <i>sin</i>. Let all the world leave their sins, and all the world may walk <i>abreast</i> in this good way.</p>
