<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>. <i><b>Beware of false prophets</b></i> â€” By false prophets we are to understand <i>teachers</i> of erroneous doctrines, who come professing a commission from God, but whose aim is not to bring the heavenly treasure to the people, but rather to rob them of their earthly good. Teachers who preach for <i>hire</i>, having no motive to enter into the ministry but to get a <i>living</i>, as it is ominously called by some, however they may bear the garb and appearance of the innocent useful sheep, the true pastors commissioned by the Lord Jesus, or to whatever name, class or party they may belong, are, in the sight of the heart-searching God, no other than <i>ravenous</i> <i>wolves</i>, whose design is to feed themselves with the fat, and clothe themselves with the fleece, and thus <i>ruin</i>, instead of <i>save</i>, the flock.</p>
