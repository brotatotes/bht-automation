<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16">Matthew 7:16</span>. <i><b>Ye shall know them by their fruits.</b></i> — Fruits, in the Scripture and Jewish phraseology, are taken for <i>works</i> of any kind. "A man's works," says one, "are the <i>tongue</i> of his <i>heart</i>, and tell honestly whether he is inwardly corrupt or pure." By these works you may <i>distinguish</i> (επιγνωσεσθε) these ravenous wolves from true pastors. The judgment formed of a man by his <i>general</i> conduct is a safe one: if the judgment be not favourable to the person, that is <i>his</i> fault, as you have your opinion of him from his works, i.e. <i>the confession of his own heart</i>.</p>
