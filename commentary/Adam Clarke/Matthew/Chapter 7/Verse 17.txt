<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:17">Matthew 7:17</span>. <i><b>So every good tree</b></i> â€” As the <i>thorn</i> can only produce <i>thorns</i>, not <i>grapes</i>; and the <i>thistle</i>, not <i>figs</i>, but <i>prickles</i>; so an <i>unregenerate heart</i> will produce fruits of <i>degeneracy</i>. As we perfectly know that a <i>good</i> tree will not produce <i>bad</i> fruit, and the <i>bad</i> tree will not, cannot produce <i>good</i> fruit, so we know that the <i>profession</i> of <i>godliness</i>, while the <i>life</i> is <i>ungodly</i>, is imposture, hypocrisy, and deceit. A man cannot be a <i>saint</i> and a <i>sinner</i> at the same time. Let us remember, that as the <i>good tree</i> means a <i>good heart</i>, and the <i>good fruit, a holy life,</i> and that <i>every</i> heart is naturally <i>vicious</i>; so there is none but God who can pluck up the vicious tree, create a good heart, plant, cultivate, water, and make it continually fruitful in righteousness and true holiness.</p>
