<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:18">Matthew 7:18</span>. <i><b>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit</b></i> â€” <i>Love</i> to God and man is the root of the good tree; and from this principle all its fruit is found. To teach, as some have done, that a state of salvation may be consistent with the <i>greatest crimes</i>, (such as <i>murder</i> and <i>adultery</i> in David,) or that the righteous necessarily sin in all their best works, is really to make <i>the good tree bring</i> <i>forth bad fruit</i>, and to give the lie to the Author of eternal truth.</p>
