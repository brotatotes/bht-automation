<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:19">Matthew 7:19</span>. <i><b>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit</b></i> — What a terrible sentence is this against Christless pastors, and Christless hearers! Every tree that produceth not <i>good fruit</i>, εκκοπτεται, is to be now cut down; the <i>act of excision</i> is now taking place: the curse of the Lord is even <i>now</i> on the head and the heart of every <i>false teacher</i>, and <i>impenitent hearer</i>.</p>
