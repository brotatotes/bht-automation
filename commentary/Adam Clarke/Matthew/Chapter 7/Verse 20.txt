<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:20">Matthew 7:20</span>. <i><b>Wherefore by their fruits</b></i>, &amp;c.] This truth is often repeated, because our eternal interests depend so much upon it. Not to have <i>good fruit</i> is to have <i>evil</i>: there can be no innocent sterility in the invisible tree of the heart. He that brings forth <i>no</i> fruit, and he that brings forth <i>bad</i> fruit, are both only fit for the <i>fire</i>.</p>
