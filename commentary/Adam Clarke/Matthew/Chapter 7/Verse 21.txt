<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:21">Matthew 7:21</span>. <i><b>Not every one</b></i> — ου πας, a <i>Hebraism</i>, say some, for <i>no person</i>. It is a <i>Graecism</i> and a <i>Latinism</i> too: ου παντων θεων, <i>not</i> ALL <i>of the gods</i>, i.e. <i>not</i> ANY <i>of the gods</i>, HOM. <i>Odyss</i>. Z. 240. So TERENCE <i>Sine omni periclo</i>, without ALL danger, i.e. without ANY danger. And JUVENAL: <i>Sine omni labe</i>, without ALL imperfection, i.e. without ANY. See more in Mr. <i>Wakefield</i>. The sense of this verse seems to be this: No person, by merely acknowledging my authority, believing in the Divinity of my nature, professing faith in the perfection of my righteousness, and infinite merit of my atonement, <i>shall enter into the kingdom</i> <i>of heaven</i>-shall have any part with God in glory; but <i>he who doeth</i> <i>the will of my Father</i>-he who gets the bad tree rooted up, the good tree planted, and continues to bring forth fruit to the glory and praise of God. There is a good saying among the rabbins on this subject. "A man should be as <i>vigorous</i> as a <i>panther</i>, as <i>swift</i> as an <i>eagle</i>, as <i>fleet</i> as a <i>stag</i>, and as <i>strong</i> as a <i>lion</i>, to do the will of his Creator."</p>
