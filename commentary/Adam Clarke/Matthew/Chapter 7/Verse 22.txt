<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22">Matthew 7:22</span>. <i><b>Many will say to me in that day</b></i> — εκεινη τη ημερα, <i>in</i> <i>that very day</i>, viz. the day of judgment - <i>have we not prophesied</i>, taught, publicly preached, <i>in thy name</i>; acknowledging thee to be the only Saviour, and proclaiming thee as such to others; <i>cast out</i> <i>demons</i>, impure spirits, who had taken possession of the bodies of men; <i>done many miracles</i>, being assisted by supernatural agency to invert even the course of nature, and thus prove the truth of the doctrine we preached?</p>
