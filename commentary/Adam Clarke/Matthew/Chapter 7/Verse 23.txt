<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>. <i><b>Will I profess</b></i> — ομολογησω, <i>I will fully and plainly</i> <i>tell them, I never knew you </i>- I never <i>approved</i> of you; for so the word is used in many places, both in the Old and New Testaments. You held the truth in unrighteousness, while you preached my pure and holy doctrine; and for the sake of my own truth, and through my love to the souls of men, I blessed your preaching; but yourselves I could never esteem, because you were destitute of the spirit of my Gospel, unholy in your hearts, and unrighteous in your conduct. Alas! alas! how many <i>preachers</i> are there who appear <i>prophets</i> in their pulpits; how many <i>writers</i>, and other evangelical workmen, the miracles of whose labour, learning, and doctrine, we admire, who are <i>nothing</i>, and worse than nothing, before God, because they perform not <i>his will</i>, but their <i>own</i>? What an awful consideration, that a man of eminent gifts, whose talents are a source of public utility, should be only as a <i>way-mark</i> or <i>finger-post</i> in the way to eternal bliss, pointing out the road to others, without walking in it himself!</p>
<p><i><b>Depart from me</b></i> — What a terrible word! What a dreadful separation! Depart from ME! from the very Jesus whom you have proclaimed in <i>union</i> with whom alone eternal life is to be found. For, united to Christ, all is <i>heaven</i>; separated from him, all is <i>hell</i>.</p>
