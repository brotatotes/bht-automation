<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:24">Matthew 7:24</span>. <i><b>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine</b></i> — That is, the excellent doctrines laid down before in this and the two preceding chapters. There are several parables or similitudes like to this in the rabbins. I shall quote but the two following: -</p>
<p>Rabbi <i>Eleasar</i> said, "The man whose knowledge exceeds his works, to whom is he like? He is like a tree which had many branches, and only a few roots; and, when the stormy winds came, it was plucked up and eradicated. But he whose good works are greater than his knowledge, to what is he like? He is like a tree which had few branches, and many roots; so that all the winds of heaven could not move it from its place." <i>Pirke Aboth</i>.</p>
<p><i>Elisha</i>, the son of <i>Abuja</i>, said, "The man who studies much in the law, and maintains good works, is like to a man who built a house, laying <i>stones</i> at the foundation, and building <i>brick</i> upon them; and, though many waters come against it, they cannot move it from its place. But the man who studies much in the law, and does not maintain good words, is like to a man who, in building his house, put <i>brick</i> at the foundation, and laid <i>stones</i> upon them, so that even gentle waters shall overthrow that house." <i>Aboth Rab.</i> <i>Nath</i>.</p>
<p>Probably our Lord had this or some parable in his eye: but how amazingly improved in passing through his hands! In our Lord's parable there is dignity, majesty, and point, which we seek for in vain in the Jewish archetype.</p>
<p><i><b>I will liken him unto a wise man</b></i> — To a prudent man - ανδρι φρονιμω, to a <i>prudent</i> man, a man of sense and understanding, who, foreseeing the evil hideth himself, who proposes to himself the <i>best end</i>, and makes use of the <i>proper means</i> to accomplish it. True <i>wisdom</i> consists in getting the building of our salvation completed: to this end we must build on the <i>Rock</i>, CHRIST JESUS, and make the building <i>firm</i>, by keeping close to the maxims of his Gospel, and having our tempers and lives conformed to its <i>word</i> and <i>spirit</i>; and when, in order to this, we lean on nothing but the grace of Christ, we then build upon a <i>solid rock</i>.</p>
