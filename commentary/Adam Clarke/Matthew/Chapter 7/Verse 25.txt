<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:25">Matthew 7:25</span>. <i><b>And the rain descended - floods came - winds blew</b></i> â€” In Judea, and in all countries in the neighbourhood of the tropics, the <i>rain</i> sometimes falls in great <i>torrents</i>, producing rivers, which sweep away the soil from the rocky hills; and the houses, which are built of brick only dried in the sun, of which there are whole villages in the east, literally <i>melt</i> away before those rains, and the land-floods occasioned by them. There are <i>three</i> general kinds of trials to which the followers of God are exposed; and to which, some think, our Lord alludes here: <i>First</i>, those of temporal <i>afflictions</i>, coming in the course of Divine <i>Providence</i>: these may be likened to the torrents of <i>rain</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, those which come from the <i>passions</i> of men, and which may be likened to the <i>impetuous rivers</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>, those which come from <i>Satan</i> and his <i>angels</i>, and which, like <i>tempestuous whirlwinds</i>, threaten to carry every thing before them. He alone, whose soul is built on the <i>Rock of ages</i>, stands all these shocks; and not only <i>stands</i> in, but <i>profits</i> by them.</p>
