<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:26">Matthew 7:26</span>. <i><b>And every one that heareth - and doeth them not</b></i> â€” Was there ever a stricter system of morality delivered by God to man, than in this sermon? He who reads or hears it, and does not look to God to conform his soul and life to it, and notwithstanding is hoping to enter into the kingdom of heaven, is like the <i>fool</i> who <i>built</i> his house on the <i>sand</i>. When the <i>rain</i>, the <i>rivers</i>, and the <i>winds</i> come, his building must fall, and his soul be crushed into the nethermost pit by its ruins. <i>Talking</i> about Christ, his righteousness, merits, and atonement, while the person is not <i>conformed</i> to his <i>word</i> and <i>spirit</i>, is no other than solemn self-deception.</p>
<p>Let it be observed, that it is not the man who <i>hears</i> or <i>believes</i> these sayings of Christ, whose building shall stand, when the earth and its works are burnt up; but the man who DOES them.</p>
<p>Many suppose that the law of Moses is abolished, merely because it is <i>too strict</i>, and <i>impossible to be observed</i>; and that the Gospel was brought in to <i>liberate</i> us from <i>its obligations</i>; but let all such know, that in the whole of the old covenant nothing can be found so exceedingly <i>strict</i> and <i>holy</i> as this sermon, which Christ lays down as the <i>rule</i> by which we are to walk. "Then, the fulfilling of these precepts is the purchase of glory." No, it is the WAY <i>only</i> to that glory which has already been <i>purchased</i> by the blood of the Lamb. To him that believes, all things are possible.</p>
