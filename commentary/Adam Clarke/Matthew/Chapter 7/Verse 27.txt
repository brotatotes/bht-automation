<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:27">Matthew 7:27</span>. <i><b>And the rain descended, and the floods came, c.</b></i> â€” A fine illustration of this may be seen in the case of the fishermen in <i>Bengal</i>, who, in the dry season, build their huts on the <i>beds of</i> <i>sand</i> from which the rivers had retired: but when the rain sets in suddenly as it often does, accompanied with violent northwest winds, and the waters pour down in <i>torrents</i> from the mountains; in one night, multitudes of these buildings are swept away, and the place where they stood is on the next morning indiscoverable.</p>
