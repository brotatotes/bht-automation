<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:28">Matthew 7:28</span>. <i><b>The people were astonished</b></i> — οι οχλοι, <i>the</i> <i>multitudes</i>; for vast crowds attended the ministry of this most popular and faithful of all preachers. They <i>were astonished at</i> <i>his doctrine</i>. They heard the law defined in such a manner as they had never thought of before; and this sacred system of morality urged home on their consciences with such clearness and <i>authority</i> as they had never felt under the teaching of their <i>scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>. Here is the grand difference between the teaching of <i>scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>, the <i>self-created</i> or <i>men-made</i> ministers, and those whom GOD <i>sends</i>. The first may preach what is called very good and very sound doctrine; but it comes with no <i>authority</i> from God to the souls of the people: therefore, the unholy is unholy still; because preaching can only be effectual to the conversion of men, when the unction of the Holy Spirit is in it; and as these are not sent by the Lord, therefore they shall not profit the people at all. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:32">Jeremiah 23:32</span>.</p>
<p>From one of the royal household of George III., I have received the following anecdote: - </p>
<p>The late Bishop F. of Salisbury having procured a young man of promising abilities to preach before the king, and the young man having, to his lordship's apprehension, acquitted himself well, the Bishop, in conversation with the king afterwards, wishing to get the king's opinion, took the liberty to say, "Does not your majesty think that the young man who had the honour to preach before your majesty, is likely to make a good clergyman, and has this morning delivered a very good sermon?" To which the king, in his <i>blunt</i> manner, hastily replied, "<i>It might</i> <i>have been a good sermon, my lord, for aught I know; but I consider</i> <i>no sermon good that has nothing of Christ in it</i>!"</p>
