<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:29">Matthew 7:29</span>. <i><b>Having authority</b></i> — They felt a commanding power and authority in his word, i.e. his doctrine. His statements were perspicuous; his exhortations persuasive; his doctrine sound and rational; and his arguments irresistible. These they never felt in the trifling teachings of their most celebrated doctors, who consumed their own time, and that of their disciples and hearers, with frivolous cases of conscience, ridiculous distinctions, and puerile <i>splittings</i> of controversial <i>hairs</i>-questions not calculated to minister grace to the hearers.</p>
<p>Several excellent MSS. and almost all the ancient versions read, και οι φαρισαιοι, <i>and the Pharisees</i>. He taught them as one having authority, like the most eminent and distinguished teacher, <i>and</i> <i>not as the scribes and Pharisees</i>, who had no part of that unction which he in its plenitude possessed. Thus ends a sermon the most strict, pure, holy, profound, and sublime, ever delivered to man; and yet so amazingly simple is the whole that almost a child may apprehend it! Lord! write all these thy sayings upon our hearts, we beseech thee! Amen.</p>
