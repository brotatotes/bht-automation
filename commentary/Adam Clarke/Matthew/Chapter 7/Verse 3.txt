<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:3">Matthew 7:3</span>. <i><b>And why beholdest thou the mote</b></i> — Καρφος might be translated the <i>splinter</i>: for <i>splinter</i> bears some analogy to <i>beam,</i> but <i>mote</i> does not. I should prefer this word (which has been adopted by some learned men) on the authority of <i>Hesychius</i>, who is a <i>host</i> in such matters; Καρφος, κεραια ξυλου λεπτη, <i>Karphos is a</i> <i>thin piece of wood, a splinter</i>. It often happens that the faults which we consider as of the first enormity in others are, to our own iniquities, as a <i>chip</i> is, when compared to a large <i>beam</i>. On one side, self-love blinds us to ourselves; and, on the other, envy and malice give us piercing eyes in respect of others. When we shall have as much zeal to correct ourselves, as we have inclination to reprove and correct others, we shall know our own defects better than now we know those of our neighbour. There is a caution very similar to this of our Lord given by a heathen: -</p>
<p><i>Cum tua praevideas oculis mala lippus inunctis:</i></p>
<p><i>Cur in amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum,</i></p>
<p><i>Quam aut aquila, aut serpens Epidaurius?</i></p>
<p>Hor. Sat. lib. 1. sat. 3. l. 25-27.</p>
<p>"When you can so readily overlook your own <i>wickedness</i>, why are you more clear-sighted than the eagle or serpent of Epidaurus, in spying out the <i>failings</i> of your friends?"</p>
<p>But the saying was very common among the Jews, as may be seen in <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
