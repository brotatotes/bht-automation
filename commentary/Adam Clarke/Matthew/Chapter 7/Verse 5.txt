<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:5">Matthew 7:5</span>. <i><b>Thou hypocrite</b></i> — A hypocrite, who professes to be what he is not, (viz. a true Christian,) is obliged, for the support of the character he has assumed, to imitate all the dispositions and actions of a Christian; consequently he must reprove sin, and endeavour to show an uncommon affection for the glory of God. Our Lord unmasks this vile pretender to saintship, and shows him that his hidden hypocrisy, covered with the garb of external sanctity, is more abominable in the sight of God than the openly professed and practised iniquity of the profligate.</p>
<p>In after times, the Jews made a very bad use of this saying: "I wonder," said Rabbi Zarphon, "whether there be any in this age that will suffer reproof? If one say to another, <i>Cast out the</i> <i>mote out of thine eye</i>, he is immediately ready to answer, <i>Cast out</i> <i>the beam that is in thine own eye</i>." This proverbial mode of speech the Gloss interprets thus: "Cast out? קסים <i>kisim</i>, the <i>mote,</i> that is, the <i>little sin</i>, that is in thy hand: to which he answered, Cast out the <i>great sin</i> that is in thine. So they could not reprove, because all were sinners." See <i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
