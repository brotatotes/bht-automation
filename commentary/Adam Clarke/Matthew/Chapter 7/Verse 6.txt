<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span>. <i><b>Give not that which is holy</b></i> — το αγιον, <i>the holy or</i> <i>sacred thing</i>; i.e. any thing, especially, of the <i>sacrificial</i> kind, which had been consecrated to God. The members of this sentence should be transposed thus: - </p>
<p>As a general meaning of this passage, we may just say: "The sacrament of the Lord's supper, and other holy ordinances which are only instituted for the genuine followers of Christ, are not to be dispensed to those who are continually returning like the <i>snarling ill-natured dog</i> to their easily predominant sins of rash judgment, <i>barking at</i> and <i>tearing</i> the characters of others by <i>evil</i> <i>speaking, back biting</i> and <i>slandering</i>; nor to him who, like the <i>swine</i>, is frequently returning to <i>wallow</i> in the <i>mud</i> of <i>sensual</i> <i>gratifications</i> and <i>impurities</i>."</p>
