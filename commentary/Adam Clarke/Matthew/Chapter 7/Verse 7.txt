<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>. <i><b>Ask - seek - knock</b></i> â€” These three words include the ideas of <i>want, loss</i>, and <i>earnestness</i>. <i>Ask</i>: turn, beggar at, the door of mercy; thou art <i>destitute</i> of all spiritual good, and it is God alone who can give it to thee; and thou hast no claim but what his <i>mercy</i> has given thee on <i>itself</i>.</p>
<p><i>Seek</i>: Thou hast <i>lost</i> thy God, thy paradise, thy soul. - Look about thee - leave no stone unturned there is no peace, no final salvation for thee till thou get thy soul restored to the favour and image of God.</p>
<p><i>Knock</i>: Be in <i>earnest </i>- be <i>importunate</i>: Eternity is at hand! and, if thou die in thy sins, where God is thou shalt never come.</p>
<p><i>Ask</i> with confidence and humility.</p>
<p><i>Seek</i> with care and application.</p>
<p><i>Knock</i> with earnestness and perseverance.</p>
