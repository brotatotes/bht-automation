<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:8">Matthew 7:8</span>. <i><b>For every one that asketh receiveth</b></i> â€” Prayer is always heard after one manner or other. No soul can pray in vain that prays as directed above. The truth and faithfulness of the Lord Jesus are pledged for its success. - Ye SHALL receive - ye SHALL find-it SHALL be opened. These words are as strongly binding on the side of God, as <i>thou shalt do no murder</i> is on the side of man. Bring Christ's <i>word</i>, and Christ's <i>sacrifice</i> with thee, and not one of Heaven's blessings can be denied thee. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:9">Luke 11:9</span>.</p>
