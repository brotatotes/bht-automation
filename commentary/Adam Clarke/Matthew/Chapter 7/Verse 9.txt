<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:9">Matthew 7:9</span>. <i><b>Or what man is there - whom if his son</b></i> — Men are exhorted to come unto God, with the persuasion that he is a most gracious and compassionate Parent, who <i>possesses</i> all heavenly and earthly <i>good, knows</i> what is necessary for each of his creatures, and is infinitely <i>ready</i> to communicate that which they need most.</p>
<p><i><b>Will he give him a stone?</b></i> — Will he not readily give him bread if he have it? This was a proverb in other countries; a benefit grudgingly given by an avaricious man is called by <i>Seneca, panem</i> <i>lapidosum</i>, stony bread. Hence that saying in Plautus: <i>Altera</i> <i>manu, fert lapidem, panem ostentat altera</i>. - In one hand he brings a stone, and stretches out bread in the other.</p>
