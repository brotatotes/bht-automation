<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:10">Matthew 8:10</span>. <i><b>I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</b></i> â€” That is, I have not found so great an instance of confidence and faith in my power, even among the <i>Jews</i>, as this <i>Roman</i>, a Gentile, has shown himself to possess.</p>
<p>From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:5">Luke 7:5</span>, where it is said of this centurion, "he loved our nation, and has built us a synagogue," we may infer that this man was like the centurion mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>; a devout Gentile, a <i>proselyte of the gate</i>, one who believed in the God of Israel, without conforming to the Jewish <i>ritual</i> or receiving <i>circumcision</i>. Though the military life is one of the most improper nurses for the Christian religion, yet in all nations there have been found several instances of genuine humility, and faith in God, even in soldiers; and perhaps never more, in the British <i>military</i>, than at present, A. D. 1831.</p>
