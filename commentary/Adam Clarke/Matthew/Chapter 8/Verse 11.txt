<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:11">Matthew 8:11</span>. <i><b>Many shall come from the east and west</b></i> — Men of every <i>description</i>, of all <i>countries</i>, and of all <i>professions</i>; and shall <i>sit down</i>, that is, <i>to meat</i>, for this is the proper meaning of ανακλιθησονται, intimating the <i>recumbent</i> posture used by the easterns at their <i>meals</i>. The rabbins represent the blessedness of the kingdom of God under the notion of a banquet. See several proofs of this in Schoettgenius. This was spoken to soften the unreasonable prejudices of the Jews, which they entertained against the Gentiles, and to prepare them to receive their brethren of mankind into religious fellowship with themselves, under the Christian dispensation.</p>
<p><i><b>With Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob</b></i> — In the closest communion with the most eminent followers of God. But if we desire to inherit the promises, we must be <i>followers</i> of them who through faith and patience enjoy them. Let us therefore imitate <i>Abraham</i> in his <i>faith, Isaac</i> in his <i>obedience</i> unto death, and <i>Jacob</i> in his <i>hope</i> and <i>expectation</i> of good things to come, amidst all the evils of this life, if we desire to reign with them.</p>
