<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:12">Matthew 8:12</span>. <i><b>Shall be cast out into outer darkness</b></i> — As the enjoyment of that salvation which Jesus Christ calls the kingdom of heaven is here represented under the notion of a nuptial festival, at which the guests sat down in a <i>reclining posture</i>, with the master of the feast; so the state of those who were excluded from the banquet is represented as <i>deep darkness</i>; because the nuptial solemnities took place at <i>night</i>. Hence, at those suppers, the house of reception was filled with lights called δαδεςλαμπαδεςλυκνειαφανοι, <i>torches, lamps, candles</i>, and <i>lanthorns</i>, by <i>Athenaeus</i> and <i>Plutarch</i>: so they who were admitted to the banquet had the benefit of the <i>light</i>; but they who were <i>shut out</i> were in <i>darkness</i>, called here <i>outer darkness</i>, i.e. the darkness on the <i>outside</i> of the house in which the guests were; which must appear more abundantly <i>gloomy</i>, when compared with the <i>profusion</i> of light within the guest-chamber. And because they who were <i>shut out</i> were not only exposed to <i>shame</i>, but also to <i>hunger</i> and <i>cold</i>; therefore it is added, <i>there shall be weeping and</i> <i>gnashing of teeth</i>. As these feasts are often alluded to by the evangelists, I would observe, once for all:-that they who were invited to them entered by a <i>gate</i> designed to receive them; whence Christ, by whom we enter into the marriage feast, compares himself to a <i>gate</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-2">John 10:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:9">John 10:9</span>. This <i>gate</i>, at the time the guests were to come, was made narrow, the <i>wicket</i> only being left open, and the porter standing there, that they who were not bidden to the marriage might not rush into it. Hence Christ exhorts the Jews to enter in at the strait gate, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:13">Matthew 7:13</span>, c. When all that were invited were once come, the door was presently shut, and was not to be opened to any who came <i>too</i> <i>late</i>, and stood knocking without so after the <i>wise virgins</i> had entered with the bridegroom, the <i>gate was shut</i>, and was not opened to the <i>foolish virgins</i>, who stood knocking without, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:11">Matthew 25:11</span>. And in this sense we are to understand the words of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24-25">Luke 13:24-25</span>. Many shall seek to enter in, but shall not be able. Why? because <i>the master of the house hath risen up and shut</i> <i>to the door</i>; they would not come to him <i>when</i> they might, and now the day of probation is ended, and they must be judged according to the deeds done in the body. See <i>Whitby</i> on the place. How many of those who are called <i>Christians</i> suffer the kingdom, the graces, and the salvation which they had in their hands, to be lost; <i>while</i> West-India negroes, American Indians, Hindoo polytheists, and atheistic Hottentots obtain salvation! An <i>eternity</i> of darkness, fears, and pains, for comparatively a moment of sensual gratification, how terrible the thought! What <i>outer darkness</i>, or το σκοτος το εξωτερον, <i>that darkness, that which is outermost</i>, may refer to, in eternal damnation, is hard to say: what it <i>alludes</i> to I have already mentioned: but as the words βρυγμος των οδοντων, <i>gnashing or</i> CHATTERING <i>of teeth</i>, convey the idea, not only of extreme anguish, but of extreme cold; some have imagined that the punishment of the damned consists in sudden <i>transitions</i> from <i>extreme heat</i> to <i>extreme cold</i>; the extremes of both I have found to produce exactly the same sensation.</p>

<p>In the Zend Avesta, the place of wicked spirits is termed, "The <i>places</i> of <i>darkness</i>, the germs of the <i>thickest darkness</i>." An uncommonly significant expression: Darkness has its <i>birth</i> there: there are its <i>seeds</i> and <i>buds</i>, there it <i>vegetates</i> everlastingly, and its eternal <i>fruit</i> is - <i>darkness</i>!</p>

<p>And is this, or, any thing as <i>bad</i> as this, HELL? Yes, and <i>worse</i> than the <i>worst</i> of all that has already been mentioned. Hear Christ himself. <i>There their worm dieth not, and the fire is</i> NOT QUENCHED! Great God! save the reader from this damnation!</p>
