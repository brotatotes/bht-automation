<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:13">Matthew 8:13</span>. <i><b>As thou hast believed</b></i><b>; so </b><i><b>be it done</b></i> — Let the mercy thou requestest be <i>equal</i> to the <i>faith</i> thou hast brought to receive it by. ACCORDING <i>to thy faith be it done unto thee</i>, is a general measure of God's dealings with mankind. To get an increase of <i>faith</i> is to get an increase of every grace which constitutes the mind that was in Jesus, and prepares <i>fully</i> for the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. God is the <i>same</i> in the present time which he was in ancient days; and miracles of <i>healing</i> may be wrought on our own bodies and souls, and on those of <i>others</i>, by the instrumentality of our faith. But, alas! <i>where</i> is faith to be found!</p>
<p><i><b>And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</b></i> — εν τη ωρα εκεινη, in that very hour. Faith is never exercised in the power and goodness of God till it is needed; and, <i>when</i> it is exercised, God works the miracle of healing. Christ never says, Believe <i>now</i> for a salvation which thou <i>now</i> needest, and I will give it to thee in some <i>future</i> time. That salvation which is expected through <i>works</i> or <i>sufferings</i> must of necessity be <i>future</i>, as there must be time to <i>work</i> or <i>suffer</i> in; but the salvation which is by <i>faith</i> must be for the <i>present moment</i>, for this simple reason, IT IS BY FAITH, that God may be <i>manifested</i> and <i>honoured</i>; and not by <i>works</i> or by <i>sufferings</i>, lest any man should <i>boast</i>. To say that, though it is of faith, yet it may; and, must in many cases, be <i>delayed</i>, (though the person is coming in the most genuine humility, deepest contrition, and with the liveliest faith in the blood of the Lamb,) is to say that there is still something necessary to be <i>done</i>, either on the part of the <i>person</i>, or on the part of <i>God</i>, in order to procure it; neither of which positions has any truth in it.</p>
