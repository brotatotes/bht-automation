<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:15">Matthew 8:15</span>. <i><b>He touched her hand</b></i> — Can any thing on this side the unlimited power of God effect such a cure with only a touch? If the Scriptures had not spoken of the divinity of Christ, these proofs of his power must have demonstrated it to the common sense of every man whose <i>creed</i> had not previously blinded him.</p>
<p><i><b>Ministered unto them.</b></i> — αυτοις, <i>them</i>, is the reading of most of the <i>printed</i> editions, but αυτω, <i>to him</i>, has the utmost evidence in its support from MSS., versions, and fathers. Serving Christ in his ordinances and in his members is the best proof we can give to others of our being soundly restored to spiritual health.</p>
