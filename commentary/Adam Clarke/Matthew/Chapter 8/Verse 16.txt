<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:16">Matthew 8:16</span>. <i><b>When the even was come</b></i> — The Jews kept their sabbath from evening to evening, according to the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+23:32">Leviticus 23:32</span>, <i>From evening to evening shall ye celebrate your sabbath</i>. And the rabbins say, <i>The sabbath doth not enter but when the sun is set</i>. Hence it was that the sick were not brought out to our Lord till after sun-set, because then the sabbath was ended.</p>
<p><i><b>Many that were possessed with devils</b></i> — Dr. Lightfoot gives two sound reasons why Judea, in our Lord's time, abounded with <i>demoniacs</i>. First, Because they were then advanced to the very height of impiety. See what Josephus, their own historian, says of them: There was not (said he) a nation under heaven more wicked than they were. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span></span>. Secondly, Because they were then strongly addicted to <i>magic</i>, and so, as it were, invited evil spirits to be familiar with them. It seems strange to find men at this distance of time questioning the truth of that which neither scribes nor Pharisees then doubted; nor did they ever object against the pretensions of Christ and his apostles to cast them out. And, if the whole business of <i>demonism</i> had been only a <i>vulgar error</i>, (as <i>wise</i> men <i>now</i> tell us,) what a fine opportunity had the <i>wise</i> men <i>then</i>, to unmask the whole matter, and thus pour contempt on the pretensions of our blessed Lord and his followers, who held it to be one proof of their Divine mission, <i>that demons</i> <i>were subject to them</i>!</p>
<p><i><b>And healed all that were sick</b></i> — Not a soul did the Lord Jesus ever reject, who came to him soliciting his aid. Need any sinner despair who comes to him, conscious of his spiritual malady, to be healed by his merciful hand?</p>
