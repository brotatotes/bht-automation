<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:17">Matthew 8:17</span>. <i><b>Himself took our infirmities</b></i> â€” The quotation is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:4">Isaiah 53:4</span>, where the verb <i>nasa</i> signifies to <i>bear sin</i>, so as to <i>make</i> <i>atonement for it</i>. And the rabbins understand this place to speak of the sufferings of the Messiah for the sins of Israel; and say that all the diseases, all the griefs, and all the punishments due to Israel shall be borne by him. See <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>. Christ fulfils the prophecies in <i>all</i> respects, and is himself the completion and truth of them, as being the <i>lamb</i> and <i>victim</i> of God, which, <i>bears</i> and <i>takes away</i> the sin of the world. The text in Isaiah refers properly to the <i>taking away of sin</i>; and this in the evangelist, to the <i>removal of corporeal</i> afflictions: but, as the diseases of the body are the emblems of the sin of the soul, Matthew, referring to the prediction of the prophet, considered the miraculous healing of the <i>body</i> as an emblem of the <i>soul's</i> <i>salvation</i> by Christ Jesus.</p>
