<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:19">Matthew 8:19</span>. <i><b>A certain scribe</b></i> — Though εις γραμματευς, ONE <i>scribe,</i> may be considered as a Hebraism, yet it is probable that the <i>literal</i> construction of it was intended, to show that few of this class came to the Lord Jesus for instruction or salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Master</b></i> — Rather, <i>teacher</i>, διδασκαλε from διδασκω, <i>I</i> <i>teach</i>, which itself seems to be derived from δεικω, <i>I show</i>, and means the person who <i>shows</i> or <i>points out</i> a particular <i>way</i> or <i>science</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</b></i> — A man who is <i>not</i> illuminated by the Spirit of God thinks himself capable of <i>any</i> <i>thing</i>: he alone who is divinely taught knows he can do <i>nothing</i> but through Christ strengthening him. Every teacher among the Jews had disciples, and some especially that followed or accompanied them <i>wherever they went</i>, that they might have some person at hand with whom they might converse concerning the Divine law.</p>
