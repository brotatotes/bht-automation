<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:2">Matthew 8:2</span>. <i><b>And, behold, there came a leper</b></i> — The leprosy λεπρα, from λεπις, <i>a scale</i>, was an inveterate cutaneous disease, appearing in dry, thin, white scurfy scales or scabs, either on the whole body, or on some part of it, usually attended with violent itching, and often with great pain. The eastern leprosy was a distemper of the most loathsome kind, highly contagious, so as to infect garments, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+13:47">Leviticus 13:47</span>, c.), and houses, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+14:34">Leviticus 14:34</span>, c.), and was deemed incurable by any human means. Among the Jews, GOD alone was applied to for its removal and the cure was ever attributed to his sovereign power.</p>
<p>The various symptoms of this dreadful disorder, which was a striking emblem of <i>sin</i>, may be seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+13:14">Leviticus 13:14</span>:, where also may be read the legal ordinances concerning it which, as on the one hand, they set forth how <i>odious</i> sin is to God, so, on the other, they represent the cleansing of our <i>pollutions</i> by the <i>sacrifice</i> and <i>resurrection</i> of Christ, by the <i>sprinkling</i> and application of his blood, and by the sanctifying and <i>healing</i> <i>influences</i> of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>.</p>
<p>The Greek name λεπρα, seems to have been given to this distemper, on account of the <i>thin, white</i> SCALES (λεπιδες) with which the bodies of the leprous were sometimes so covered as to give them the appearance of <i>snow</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:6">Exodus 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:10">Numbers 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:27">2 Kings 5:27</span>.</p>
<p>Herodotus, lib. 1, mentions this disorder as existing, in his time, among the <i>Persians</i>. He calls it λευκην, the <i>white</i> scab; and says, that those who were affected with it were prohibited from mingling with the other citizens; and so dreadful was this malady esteemed among them that they considered it a punishment on the person, from their great god, the <i>sun</i>, for some evil committed against him. Dr. <i>Mead</i> mentions a remarkable case of this kind which came under his own observation. "A countryman whose whole body was so miserably seized with it that his <i>skin was</i> <i>shining as covered with flakes of snow</i>, and as the furfuraceous or bran-like <i>scales</i> were daily rubbed off, the flesh appeared <i>quick</i> or <i>raw</i> underneath." See the doctor's <i>Medica Sacra</i>, chap. 2. It was probably on account of its tendency to produce this disorder, in that warm climate, that God forbade the use of <i>swine's flesh</i> to the Jews. Feeding on this crude aliment, in union with the intemperate use of <i>ardent spirits</i>, is, in all likelihood, the grand cause of the <i>scurvy</i>, which is so common in the British nations, and which would probably assume the form and virulence of a <i>leprosy</i>, were our climate as hot as that of Judea. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:6">Exodus 4:6</span>, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+13:0">Leviticus 13:0</span>: and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+14:0">Leviticus 14:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</b></i> — As this leper may be considered as a fit emblem of the corruption of man by sin; so may his cure, of the redemption of the soul by Christ. A sinner, truly penitent, seeks God with a respectful faith; approaches him in the spirit of adoration; humbles himself under his mighty hand, acknowledging the greatness of his fall, and the vileness of his sin; his prayer, like that of the leper, should be humble, plain, and full of confidence in that God who <i>can do</i> all things, and of dependence upon his <i>will</i> or mercy, from which all good must be derived. It is peculiar to God that he need only <i>will</i> what he intends to perform. His power is his will. The <i>ability</i> of God to do what is necessary to be done, and his <i>willingness</i> to make his creatures happy, should be deeply considered by all those who approach him in prayer. The leper had no doubt of the former, but he was far from being equally satisfied in respect of the latter.</p>
