<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:20">Matthew 8:20</span>. <i><b>The foxes have holes</b></i>, c.] Reader! art thou a <i>poor</i> <i>man</i>? and dost thou fear God? Then, what comfort must thou derive from the thought, that thou so nearly resemblest the Lord Jesus! But how unlike is the <i>rich man</i>, who is the votary of pleasure and slave of sin, to this heavenly pattern!</p>
<p><i><b>Son of man</b></i> â€” A Hebrew phrase, expressive of <i>humiliation</i> and <i>debasement</i> and, on that account, applied emphatically to himself, by the meek and lowly Jesus. Besides, it seems here to be used to point out the incarnation of the Son of God, according to the predictions of the prophets, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:5">Psalms 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>. And as our Lord was now showing forth his eternal <i>Divinity</i> in the miracles he wrought, he seems studious to prove to them the certainty of his <i>incarnation</i>, because on this depended the atonement for sin. Indeed our Lord seems more intent on giving the proofs of his <i>humanity</i>, than of his <i>divinity</i>, the latter being necessarily manifested by the miracles which he was continually working.</p>
