<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:21">Matthew 8:21</span>. <i><b>Another of his disciples</b></i> â€” This does not mean any of the <i>twelve</i>, but one of those who were constant hearers of our Lord's preaching; the name of <i>disciple</i> being common to all those who professed to believe in him, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:66">John 6:66</span>. <i>Bury my father</i>: probably his father was old, and apparently near death; but it was a maxim among the Jews, that, if a man had any duty to perform to the <i>dead</i>, he was, for that time, free from the observance of any other precept or duty. The children of Adam are always in extremes; some will rush into the ministry of the Gospel <i>without a call</i>, others will delay long after they are called; the middle way is the only safe one: not to move a finger in the work till the call be given, and not to delay a moment after.</p>
