<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:22">Matthew 8:22</span>. <i><b>Let the dead bury their dead.</b></i> â€” It was usual for the Jews to consider a man as <i>dead</i> who had departed from the precepts of the law; and, on this ground, every transgressor was reputed a <i>dead man</i>. Our Lord's saying, being in common use, had nothing difficult in it to a Jew. Natural death is the separation of the body and soul; spiritual death, the separation of God and the soul: men who live in sin are dead to God. Leave the <i>spiritually</i> dead to bury their <i>natural</i> dead. All the common offices of life may be performed by <i>any</i> person; to preach the glad tidings of the kingdom of God is granted but to a <i>few</i>, and to these only by an <i>especial call</i>; these should immediately abandon worldly concerns and employments, and give themselves wholly up to the work of the ministry.</p>
