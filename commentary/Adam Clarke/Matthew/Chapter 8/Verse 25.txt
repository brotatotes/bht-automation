<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:25">Matthew 8:25</span>. <i><b>And his disciples</b></i> — THE disciples. In the common printed editions, as well as in our translation, it is HIS disciples, but αυτου, <i>his</i>, is omitted by the very best MSS., and by <i>Bengel, Wetstein</i>, and <i>Griesbach</i>. This is a matter of very small importance, and need not be noticed; only every translator and commentator should aim, to the uttermost of his knowledge and power, to give every <i>particle</i> of the language of the inspired penman that can be expressed, and to insert no one word which he has reason to believe did not come by the inspiration of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Lord, save us: we perish.</b></i> — One advantage of trials is to make us know our weakness, so as to oblige us to have recourse to God by faith in Christ. It is by <i>faith</i> alone that we may be said to <i>approach</i> him; by <i>love</i> we are <i>united</i> to him, and by <i>prayer</i> we <i>awake</i> him. All good <i>perishes</i> in us without Christ: without his grace, there is not so much as one moment in which we are not in danger of utter ruin. How proper, then, is this short prayer for us, and how familiar should it be to us! Taken in the extensive Christian sense it is exceedingly expressive: it comprehends all the <i>power</i> of our Lord's <i>might</i>, all the merit of his <i>atonement</i>, and all the <i>depth of our misery</i> and <i>danger</i>. See <i>Quesnel</i>.</p>
