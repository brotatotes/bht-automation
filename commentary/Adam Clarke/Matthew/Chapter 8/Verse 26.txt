Verse Matthew 8:26. Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? — Faith is ever bold - incredulity always timid. When faith fails in temptation, there is the utmost danger of shipwreck. Lord, increase our faith! is a necessary prayer for all who desire to be saved.Then he arose and rebuked the winds, c.] As the agitation of the sea was only the effect of the wind, it was necessary to remove the cause of the disturbance, that the effect might cease. Joshua did not say to the earth, Earth, stand thou still, because the earth is not the cause of its own motion: but, Sun, stand thou still, שמש דום shemesh dom, Sun, be silent, or restrain thy influence, which is a proper cause of the revolutions of all the planets. When the solar influence was by the miraculous power of God suspended, the standing still of the earth was a necessary consequence. Both Christ and Joshua spoke with the strictest philosophical precision. See the notes on Joshua 10:12-14.There was a great calm. — One word of Christ can change the face of nature one word of his can restore calm and peace to the most troubled and disconsolate soul. Prayer and faith, if sincere, shall be heard, though they may be weak.1. That our imperfections may not hinder us from praying to God.2. That we may be persuaded it is not our merits which make our prayers effectual.3. That we may offer them up with great humility: and,4. That we may be fully united to Christ, without which union there is no salvation.There was at first a great agitation; then a great calm. Thus God ever proportions the comfort to the affliction.
