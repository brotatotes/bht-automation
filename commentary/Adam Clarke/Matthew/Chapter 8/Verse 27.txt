Verse Matthew 8:27. The men marvelled — Every part of the creation (man excepted) hears and obeys the Creator's voice. Sinners have an ear for the world, the devil, and the flesh: till this ear is shut, God's voice is not discerned; for when it is shut to its enemies it is open to its friends.What manner of man is this — ποταπος εστιν ουτος, How great is this person! Here was God fully manifest; but it was in the flesh-there were the hidings of his power.
