<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:27">Matthew 8:27</span>. <i><b>The men marvelled</b></i> — Every part of the creation (man excepted) hears and obeys the Creator's voice. Sinners have an ear for the world, the devil, and the flesh: till this ear is shut, God's voice is not discerned; for when it is shut to its enemies it is open to its <i>friends</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>What manner of man is this</b></i> — ποταπος εστιν ουτος, <i>How great is</i> <i>this person</i>! Here was God fully manifest; but it was in the <i>flesh</i>-there were the hidings of his power.</p>
