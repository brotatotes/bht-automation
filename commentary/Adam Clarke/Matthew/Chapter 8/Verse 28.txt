<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>. <i><b>The country of the Gergesenes</b></i> — This word is variously written in the MSS, and versions; <i>Gergasenes, Gerasenes,</i> <i>Gadarenes, Gergesions</i>, and <i>Gersedonians</i>, The three first are supported by the greater authorities. They might have all been names of the <i>same</i> place or district; but, if we depend on what <i>Origen</i> says, the people mentioned here could not have been the inhabitants of <i>Gerasa</i>, which, says he, is a city of Arabia, ουτε θαλασσαν, ουτε λιμνην πλησιον εχοντα, <i>which has neither sea nor</i> <i>lake nigh to it</i>. "Gadara was, according to <i>Josephus</i>, the metropolis of <i>Perea</i>, or the region beyond <i>Jordan</i>: both the city and villages belonging to it lay in the country of the <i>Gergasenes</i>; whence Christ going into the country of the <i>Gadarenes</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:1">Mark 5:1</span>, is said to go into the region of the <i>Gergasenes</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>."

<p><i><b>Two possessed with devils</b></i> — Persons possessed by evil demons. Mark and Luke mention only <i>one</i> demoniac, probably the fiercer of the <i>two</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Coming out of the tombs</b></i> — It is pretty evident that cupolas were generally builded over the graves among the Jews, and that these demoniacs had their dwellings under such: the evil spirits which were in them delighting more in these abodes of desolation and ruin, as being more congenial to their <i>fierce</i> and <i>diabolic</i> nature, and therefore would drive the possessed into them.</p>
