Verse 29. What have we to do with thee — The literal translation of τι ημιν και σοι, is, What is it to us and to thee; which perhaps might be understood to imply their disclaiming any design to interfere with the work of Christ, and that he should not therefore meddle with them; for it appears they exceedingly dreaded his power.What have we to do with thee, is a Jewish phrase, which often occurs in the Old Testament, signifying an abrupt refusal of some request, or a wish not to be troubled with the company or importunity of others. Jehu said to the messenger who was sent by Joram to meet him, What hast thou to do with peace? David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Compare Judges 11:12; 2 Samuel 16:10; 2 Kings 9:18; Ezra 4:3; John 2:4. Mark 1:24.Jesus, thou Son of God — Griesbach omits the word Jesus, on the authority of several MSS. of the greatest antiquity and respectability; besides some versions, and several of the fathers. I heartily concur with these MSS., c., for this simple reason, among others, that the word Jesus, i.e. Saviour, was of too ominous an import to the Satanic interest to be used freely, in such a case, by any of his disciples or subalterns.Art thou come hither to torment us before the time? — From this it appears that a greater degree of punishment awaited these demons than they at that time endured and that they knew there was a time determined by the Divine Judge, when they should be sent into greater torments.
