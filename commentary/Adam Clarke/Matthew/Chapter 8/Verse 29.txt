<p>Verse 29. <i><b>What have we to do with thee</b></i> — The literal translation of τι ημιν και σοι, is, <i>What</i> is it <i>to us and to thee;</i> which perhaps might be understood to imply their disclaiming any design to interfere with the work of Christ, and that <i>he</i> should not therefore meddle with <i>them</i>; for it appears they exceedingly dreaded his power.</p>
<p><i>What have we to do with thee</i>, is a Jewish phrase, which often occurs in the Old Testament, signifying an abrupt refusal of some request, or a wish not to be troubled with the company or importunity of others. Jehu said to the messenger who was sent by Joram to meet him, <i>What hast thou to do with peace</i>? David said, <i>What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah</i>?

<p><i><b>Jesus, thou Son of God</b></i> — Griesbach omits the word <i>Jesus</i>, on the authority of several MSS. of the greatest antiquity and respectability; besides some <i>versions</i>, and several of the <i>fathers</i>. I heartily concur with these MSS., c., for this simple reason, among others, that the word <i>Jesus</i>, i.e. <i>Saviour</i>, was of too ominous an import to the Satanic interest to be used freely, in such a case, by any of his disciples or subalterns.</p>
<p><i><b>Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</b></i> — From this it appears that a greater degree of punishment awaited these demons than they at that time endured and that they knew there was a time determined by the Divine Judge, when they should be sent into greater torments.</p>
