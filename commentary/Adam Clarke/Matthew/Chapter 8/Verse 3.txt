<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:3">Matthew 8:3</span>. <i><b>Jesus put forth his hand - I will; be thou clean.</b></i> — The most sovereign authority is assumed in this speech of our blessed Lord-I WILL: there is here no supplication of any power <i>superior</i> to his own; and the event proved to the fullest conviction, and by the clearest demonstration, that his authority was absolute, and his power unlimited. <i>Be thou cleansed</i>, καθαρισθητι; a single word is enough.</p>
<p><i><b>And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</b></i> — What an astonishing sight! A man whose whole body was covered over with the most loathsome disease, cleansed from it in a moment of time! Was it possible for any soul to resist the <i>evidence</i> of this fact? This action of Christ is a representation of that <i>invisible hand</i> which makes itself <i>felt</i> by the most <i>insensible heart</i>; of that <i>internal</i> <i>word</i> which makes itself <i>heard</i> by the most <i>deaf</i>; and of that <i>supreme will</i> which <i>works</i> every thing according to its <i>own counsel.</i></p>
