<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:31">Matthew 8:31</span>. <i><b>Suffer us to go away</b></i> — επιτρεψον ημιν απελθειν: this is the common reading; but αποστειλον ημας, <i>send us away</i>, appears more likely to be genuine. This latter reading <i>Griesbach</i> has adopted, on the authority of three ancient MSS., the <i>Coptic,</i> <i>Sahidic, Ethiopic, Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, Saxon</i>, most of the <i>Itala</i>, and the <i>Vulgate</i>. <i>Send us away</i> seems to express more fully the absolute power Jesus Christ had over them - <i>permission</i> alone was not sufficient; the very <i>power</i> by which they were <i>to go away</i>, must come from Christ himself! How vain was the boast of Satan, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:9">Matthew 4:9</span>, when we find he could not possess the body of one of the <i>vilest animals</i> that God has made, without immediate authority from the Most High! Since a demon cannot enter even into a <i>swine</i> without being <i>sent</i> by God himself, how little is the <i>power</i> or <i>malice</i> of any of them to be dreaded by those who have God for their portion and protector!</p>
