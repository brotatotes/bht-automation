<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:32">Matthew 8:32</span>. <i><b>They went into the herd of swine</b></i> — Instead of την αγελην των χοιρων, <i>the herd of swine, Griesbach</i> reads τους χοιρους, <i>the swine</i>, on the authority of many MSS. and versions.</p>
<p><i><b>The whole herd of swine</b></i> — των χοιρων, <i>of swine</i>, is omitted by many MSS. and versions. See <i>Griesbach</i>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:20">Luke 8:20</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Ran violently down a steep place</b></i>, c.] The <i>prayer</i> of these demons is heard and answered! Strange! But let it be noted, that God only hears demons and certain sinners when their prayer is the echo of his own justice. Here is an emblem of the final impenitence and ruin into which the <i>swinish sinners</i>, the habitually <i>unpure</i>, more commonly fall than other sinners. Christ permits the demons to do that in the <i>swine</i> which he did not permit them to do in the <i>possessed</i>, on purpose to show us what rage they would exercise on us if left to their liberty and malice. Many are the Divine favours which we do not consider, or know only in general. "But the owners of the swine lost their property." Yes and learn from this of how small value temporal riches, are in the estimation of God. He suffers them to be lost, sometimes to disengage us from them through <i>mercy</i> sometimes out of <i>justice</i>, to punish us for having <i>acquired</i> or <i>preserved</i> them either by <i>covetousness</i> or <i>injustice</i>.</p>
