<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:34">Matthew 8:34</span>. <i><b>The whole city came out</b></i> â€” Probably with the intention to destroy Jesus for having destroyed their swine; but, having seen him, they were awed by his presence; and only besought him to depart from their borders. Many rather chose to lose Jesus Christ than those temporal goods by which they gratify their passions at the expense of their souls. They love even their <i>swine</i> better than their <i>salvation</i>.</p>
<p>Certain <i>doctors</i> in both sciences, <i>divinity</i> and <i>physic</i>, gravely tell us that these demoniacs were only common <i>madmen</i>, and that the disease was supposed, by the superstitious Jews, to be occasioned by demons. But, with due deference to great characters, may not a plain man be permitted to ask, by what figure of speech can it be said that "two diseases <i>besought - went out - filled a herd of</i> <i>swine - rushed down a precipice</i>?" c. What silly trifling is this! Some people's creeds will neither permit God nor the devil to work and, in several respects, hardly to exist. For he who denies Divine inspiration, will scarcely acknowledge diabolic influence. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:16">Matthew 8:16</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:21">Luke 7:21</span>.</p>
<p>It is said, <i>The whole city came out to meet Jesus</i>. This means no more than all the inhabitants of that place, which, most probably, was no more than a small country village; or perhaps but a few houses. I have observed that the inhabitants of the Zetland Isles, in the North Seas, denominate any collection of houses a <i>town</i>, even where there are but three or four: and thus I think that the Jews denominated their villages, often calling them <i>cities</i>.</p>
