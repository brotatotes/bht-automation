<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:4">Matthew 8:4</span>. <i><b>Jesus saith - See thou tell no man</b></i> — Had our Lord, at this early period, fully manifested himself <i>as the Messiah</i>, the people in all likelihood would have proclaimed him King; this, however, refused by him, must have excited the hatred of the Jewish rulers, and the jealousy of the Roman government; and, speaking after the manner of men, his farther preachings and miracles must have been impeded. This alone seems to be the reason why he said to the leper, <i>See thou tell no man</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Show thyself to the priest</b></i> — This was to conform to the law instituted in this case, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+14:1">Leviticus 14:1</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Offer the gift</b></i> — This gift was <i>two living, clean birds, some</i> <i>cedar wood, with scarlet and hyssop</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+14:4">Leviticus 14:4</span>, which were to be brought <i>for</i> his cleansing and, <i>when</i> clean, <i>two he lambs, one ewe</i> <i>lamb, three tenth deals of flour, and one log of oil</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+14:10">Leviticus 14:10</span>; but if the person was <i>poor</i>, then he was to bring <i>one lamb, one</i> <i>tenth deal of flour, one log of oil and two turtle doves, or young</i> <i>pigeons</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+14:21-22">Leviticus 14:21-22</span>.

<p>Now all this was to be done <i>for a testimony to them</i>; to prove that this leper, who was doubtless well known in the land, had been thoroughly cleansed; and thus, <i>in this private way</i>, to give full proof to the <i>priesthood</i> that Jesus was the true Messiah. The Jewish rabbins allowed that curing the lepers should be a <i>characteristic</i> of the Messiah; (see Bishop Chandler's Vindication;) therefore the obstinacy of the priests, &amp;c., in rejecting Christ, was utterly inexcusable.</p>
