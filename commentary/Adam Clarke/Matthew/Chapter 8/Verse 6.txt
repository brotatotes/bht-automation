<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:6">Matthew 8:6</span>. <i><b>Lord</b></i> — Rather, <i>Sir</i>, for so the word κυριε should always be translated when a <i>Roman</i> is the speaker.</p>

This centurion did not act as many masters do when their servants are afflicted, have them immediately removed to an <i>infirmary</i>, often to a <i>work-house</i>; or sent home to friends or relatives, who probably either care nothing for them, or are unable to afford them any of the comforts of life. In case of a contagious disorder, it may be necessary to remove an infected person to such places as are best calculated to cure the distemper, and prevent the spread of the contagion. But, in all common cases, the servant should be considered as a child, and receive the same friendly attention. If, by a hasty, unkind, and unnecessary removal, the servant die, are not the master and mistress murderers before God?</p>
