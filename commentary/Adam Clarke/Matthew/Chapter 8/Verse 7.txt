<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:7">Matthew 8:7</span>. <i><b>I will come and heal him.</b></i> — εγω ελοθων θεραπευσω αυτον, <i>I am coming, and will heal him</i>. This saying is worthy of observation. Jesus did not positively say, <i>I will came and heal</i> <i>him</i>; this could not have been strictly true, because our Lord healed him without going to the house: and the issue shows that the words ought to be taken in the most literal sense: thus understood, they contained a promise which it seems none of them distinctly comprehended. Foreseeing the exercise of the centurion's faith, he promises that while he is coming, ere he arrives at the house, he will heal him, and this was literally done, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:13">Matthew 8:13</span>. There is much beauty in this passage.</p>
