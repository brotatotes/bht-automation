<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span>. <i><b>But speak the word only</b></i> — Or instead of ειπε λογον read ειπε λογω, speak <i>by word</i> or <i>command</i>. This reading is supported by the most extensive evidence from MSS., versions, and fathers. See here the pattern of that living faith and genuine humility which ought always to accompany the prayer of a sinner: Jesus can <i>will away</i> the <i>palsy</i>, and <i>speak away</i> the most <i>grievous</i> <i>torments</i>. The <i>first</i> degree of humility is to acknowledge the necessity of God's mercy, and our own inability to help ourselves: the <i>second</i>, to confess the freeness of his grace, and our own utter unworthiness. Ignorance, unbelief, and presumption will ever retard our spiritual cure.</p>
