<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:10">Matthew 9:10</span>. <i><b>Sat at meat in the house</b></i> — Viz. of Matthew, who it appears, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:29">Luke 5:29</span>, made a great feast on the occasion, thus testifying his gratitude for the honour done him; and that his friends and acquaintances might profit by the teaching of his new master, he invites them to the entertainment that was honoured by the presence of Christ. His companions, it appears, were not of the most creditable kind. They were <i>tax-gatherers</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:29- :">Luke 5:29- :</span>) <i>and sinners</i>, αμαρτωλοι, a word which I believe in general signifies heathens, throughout the Gospels, and in several other parts of the New Testament.
