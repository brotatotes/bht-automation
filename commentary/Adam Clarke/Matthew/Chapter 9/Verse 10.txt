Verse Matthew 9:10. Sat at meat in the house — Viz. of Matthew, who it appears, from Luke 5:29, made a great feast on the occasion, thus testifying his gratitude for the honour done him; and that his friends and acquaintances might profit by the teaching of his new master, he invites them to the entertainment that was honoured by the presence of Christ. His companions, it appears, were not of the most creditable kind. They were tax-gatherers (Luke 5:29- :) and sinners, αμαρτωλοι, a word which I believe in general signifies heathens, throughout the Gospels, and in several other parts of the New Testament. See, among others, Matthew 11:19; Matthew 26:45; Mark 2:15-17; Mark 14:41; Luke 5:30-32; Luke 6:32-34; Luke 7:34; Luke 7:37; Luke 7:39; Luke 15:1-2; Luke 15:7; Luke 15:10; Luke 19:7; Luke 24:7; John 9:16; John 9:24; John 9:25; John 9:31; Romans 5:8; Galatians 2:15; Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 4:18; in most, if not all of which places, it evidently refers to the character or state of a Gentile, or Heathen.
