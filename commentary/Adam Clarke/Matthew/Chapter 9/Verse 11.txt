<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:11">Matthew 9:11</span>. <i><b>When the Pharisees saw it</b></i> â€” He who, like a Pharisee, never felt himself indebted to infinite mercy for his own salvation, is rarely solicitous about the salvation of others. The grace of Christ alone inspires the soul with true benevolence. The self-righteous Pharisees considered it equal to legal defilement to sit in company with tax-gatherers and heathens. It is certain that those who fear God should not associate, through choice, with the workers of iniquity, and should only be found with them when transacting their secular business requires it, or when they have the prospect of doing good to their souls.</p>
