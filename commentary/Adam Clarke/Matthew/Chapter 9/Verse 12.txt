Verse Matthew 9:12. They that be whole need not a physician â€” A common proverb, which none could either misunderstand or misapply. Of it the reader may make the following use:-1. Jesus Christ represents himself here as the sovereign Physician of souls.2. That all stand in need of his healing power.3. That men must acknowledge their spiritual maladies, and the need they have of his mercy, in order to be healed by him.4. That it is the most inveterate and dangerous disease the soul can be afflicted with to imagine itself whole, when the sting of death, which is sin, has pierced it through in every part, infusing its poison every where.
