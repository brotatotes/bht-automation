<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:12">Matthew 9:12</span>. <i><b>They that be whole need not a physician</b></i> â€” A common proverb, which none could either misunderstand or misapply. Of it the reader may make the following use:-</p>
<p>1. Jesus Christ represents himself here as the sovereign Physician of souls.</p>
<p>2. That all stand in need of his healing power.</p>
<p>3. That men must acknowledge their spiritual maladies, and the need they have of his mercy, in order to be healed by him.</p>
<p>4. That it is the most inveterate and dangerous disease the soul can be afflicted with to imagine itself <i>whole</i>, when the <i>sting of</i> <i>death, which is sin</i>, has pierced it through in every part, infusing its poison every where.</p>
