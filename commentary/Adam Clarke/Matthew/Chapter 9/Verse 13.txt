<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>. <i><b>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice</b></i> — Quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:22">1 Samuel 15:22</span>. These are remarkable words. We may understand them as implying,</p>
<p>1st. That God prefers an act of mercy, shown to the necessitous, to any act of religious worship to which the person might be called at that time. Both are good; but the former is the greater good, and should be done in preference to the other.</p>
<p>2dly. That the whole sacrificial system was intended only to point out the infinite mercy of God to fallen man, in his redemption by the blood of the new covenant. And</p>
<p>3dly. That we should not rest in the <i>sacrifices</i>, but look for the <i>mercy</i> and salvation prefigured by them. This saying was nervously translated by our ancestors, [---------Anglo-Saxon----------], <i>I will mild-heartedness, and not</i> <i>sacrifice</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Go ye and learn</b></i> — צא ולמד <i>tse velimmed</i>, a form of speech in frequent use among the rabbins, when they referred to any fact or example in the Sacred Writings. Nothing tends more to humble pretenders to devotion than to show them that they understand neither Scripture nor religion, when, relying on external performances, they neglect love to God and man, which is the very soul and substance of true religion. True holiness has ever consisted in <i>faith working by love</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners</b></i> — Most of the common editions add, εις μετανοιαν, <i>unto repentance</i>; but this is omitted in the <i>Codex Vatic</i>. and <i>Bezae</i>, sixteen others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, both the <i>Persic, Ethiop. Armen. Gothic, Anglo-Saxon</i>, all the <i>Itala</i> except three, the <i>Vulgate, Clemens Roman, Origen, Basil,</i> <i>Jerome, Augustin, Ambrose</i>, and <i>Barnabas</i>. The omission is approved by <i>Mill</i> and <i>Bengel</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it out of the text.</p>
