<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:14">Matthew 9:14</span>. <i><b>Thy disciples fast not?</b></i> â€” Probably meaning that they did not fast so <i>frequently</i> as the others did, or for the same purposes, which is very likely, for the Pharisees had many superstitious fasts. They fasted in order to have lucky <i>dreams</i>, to obtain the interpretation of a dream, or to avert the evil import of a dream. They also fasted often, in order to obtain the things they wished for. The tract, <i>Taanith</i> is full of these <i>fasts</i>, and of the wonders performed thus by the Jewish doctors.</p>
