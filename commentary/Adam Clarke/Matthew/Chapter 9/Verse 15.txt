<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:15">Matthew 9:15</span>. <i><b>Can the children of the bride-chamber</b></i> — νυμφωνος. Or, νυμφιου, <i>bridegroom</i>, as the <i>Cod. Bezae</i> and several <i>versions</i> have it. These persons were the companions of the bridegroom, who accompanied him to the house of his father-in-law when he went to bring the bride to his own home. The marriage-feast among the Jews lasted <i>seven</i> days; but the new married woman was considered to be a bride for <i>thirty</i> days. Marriage feasts were times of extraordinary festivity, and even of <i>riot</i>, among several people of the east.</p>
<p><i><b>When the bridegroom shall be taken from them</b></i>, c.] There was one <i>annual</i> fast observed in the primitive Church, called by our ancestors [Anglo-Saxon] the <i>spring fast</i>, and, by us, LENT by the Greeks τεσσερακοστη, and by the Latins, <i>Quadrigessima</i>. This fast is pretended to be kept by many, in the present day, in commemoration of our Lord's <i>forty</i> days' fast in the wilderness; but it does not appear that, in the purest ages of the <i>primitive</i> <i>Church</i>, genuine Christians ever pretended that their <i>quadrigessimal</i> fast was kept for the above purpose. Their fast was kept merely to commemorate the <i>time</i> during which Jesus Christ lay under the power of death, which was about FORTY HOURS; and it was in this sense they understood the words of this text: <i>the days</i> <i>will come</i>, c. With them, the <i>bridegroom</i> meant <i>Christ</i>: the time in which he was <i>taken away</i>, his crucifixion, death, and the time he lay in the grave. Suppose him dying about twelve o'clock on what is called <i>Friday</i>, and that he rose about <i>four</i> on the morning of his own day, (St. John says, <i>Early, while it was yet dark</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:1">Matthew 20:1</span>,) the interim makes <i>forty hours</i>, which was the true primitive <i>Lent</i>, or <i>quadrigessimal fast</i>. It is true that many in the primitive Church were not agreed on this subject, as <i>Socrates</i>, in his Church History, book v. chap. 22, says, "Some thought they should fast <i>one day</i> others <i>two</i>; others <i>more</i>." Different Churches also were divided concerning the length of the time, some keeping it <i>three</i>, others <i>five</i>, and others <i>seven</i> weeks; and the historian himself is puzzled to know why they all agreed in calling these fasts, differing so much in their <i>duration</i>, by the name of <i>Quadrigessima</i>, or <i>forty</i> days' fast: the plain obvious reason appears to me to have been simply this: They put DAYS in the place of HOURS; and this absurdity continues in some Christian Churches to the present day.
