<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:19">Matthew 9:19</span>. <i><b>Jesus arose, and followed him</b></i> â€” Our blessed Lord could have acted as well at a <i>distance</i> as <i>present</i>; but he goes to the place, to teach his ministers not to spare either their steps or their pains when the salvation of a soul is in question. Let them not think it sufficient to pray for the sick in their closets; but let them go to their bed-sides, that they may instruct and comfort them. He can have little unction in <i>private</i>, who does not also give himself up to <i>public</i> duties.</p>
