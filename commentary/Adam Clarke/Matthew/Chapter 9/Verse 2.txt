Verse Matthew 9:2. Sick of the palsy — See Matthew 4:24.Lying on a bed — κλινης, a couch or sofa, such as they reclined on at meals.Seeing their faith — The faith of the paralytic person, and the faith of those who brought him; Mark 2:4.Be of good cheer — θαρσει τεκνον, Son, take courage! Probably he began to despond, and Christ spoke thus to support his faith.Thy sins be forgiven thee. — Moral evil has been the cause of all the natural evil in the world. Christ goes to the source of the malady, which is sin; and to that as the procuring cause we should refer in all our afflictions. It is probable that this paralytic person had, in the earnest desires of his heart, entreated the cure of his soul, leaving his body to the care of others, as the first miracle of healing is wrought on his soul. In a state of helplessness, when we seek above all things to please God, by giving him our hearts, he often inspires others with the care of our temporal necessities. It may be necessary to be observed, that it was a maxim among the Jews that no diseased person could be healed till all his sins were blotted out. See Nedarim, fol. 41. Hence our Lord first forgives the sins, and then heals the body of the paralytic person. This appears to have been founded on Psalms 103:3. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and healeth all thy diseases. Here pardon precedes health. See also Psalms 41:3-4. It may be observed, also, that most people are more in earnest about their souls when in sickness than in health, and therefore are more earnest in prayer for salvation.
