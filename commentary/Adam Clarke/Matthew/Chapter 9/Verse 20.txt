Verse Matthew 9:20. A woman which was diseased with an issue of blood — γυνη αιμορρουσα. Mulier sanguinis profluvio laborans. Significatur hoc loco, fluxus muliebris, in SANIS, menstruus; in HAC perpetuus. It would be easy to explain the nature and properties of the disease here mentioned; but, when it is said that prudence forbids it, the intimation itself may be thought sufficiently explanatory of the disorder in question. There are some remarkable circumstances relative to this case mentioned by St. Mark, Mark 5:25, &c., which shall be properly noticed in the notes on that place.The hem of his garment — The ציצית tsitsith, or fringes, which the Jews were commanded to wear on their garments. See Numbers 15:38, and the note there.
