<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:21">Matthew 9:21</span>. <i><b>She said within herself, If I may but touch his</b></i><b> </b><i><b>garment</b></i> â€” Her disorder was of that delicate nature that modesty forbade her to make any public acknowledgment of it; and therefore she endeavoured to transact the whole business in private. Besides, the touch of such a person was by the law reputed unclean. By faith in Christ Jesus, little things are often rendered efficacious to our salvation. What more simple than a <i>morsel</i> of <i>bread</i>, and a <i>few drops</i> of <i>wine</i>, in the Lord's Supper! And yet, they who receive them by faith in the sacrifice they represent, are made partakers of the blessings purchased by the crucified body and spilled blood of the Lord Jesus!</p>
