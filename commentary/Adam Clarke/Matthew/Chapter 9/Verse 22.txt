<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:22">Matthew 9:22</span>. <i><b>Daughter, be of good comfort</b></i> — θαρσει θυγατερ, <i>Take</i> <i>courage, daughter</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2">Matthew 9:2</span>. The reason of this kind speech was-Jesus, finding that virtue had proceeded from him; made inquiry who had touched him. The woman, finding that she could not be hid, came <i>fearing</i> and <i>trembling</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:33">Mark 5:33</span>,) and confessed the truth: to dispel these <i>fears</i> and to comfort her mind, Jesus said, <i>Daughter, take courage</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</b></i> — η πιστις σου σεσωκε σε, <i>This</i> <i>thy faith hath saved thee</i>: i.e. thy faith in my power has interested that power in thy behalf, so that thou art <i>saved</i> from thy disorder, and from all its consequences. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:46">Luke 8:46</span>.</p>
