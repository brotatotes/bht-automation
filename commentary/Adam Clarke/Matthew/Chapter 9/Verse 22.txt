Verse Matthew 9:22. Daughter, be of good comfort — θαρσει θυγατερ, Take courage, daughter. Matthew 9:2. The reason of this kind speech was-Jesus, finding that virtue had proceeded from him; made inquiry who had touched him. The woman, finding that she could not be hid, came fearing and trembling, (Mark 5:33,) and confessed the truth: to dispel these fears and to comfort her mind, Jesus said, Daughter, take courage.Thy faith hath made thee whole. — η πιστις σου σεσωκε σε, This thy faith hath saved thee: i.e. thy faith in my power has interested that power in thy behalf, so that thou art saved from thy disorder, and from all its consequences. Luke 8:46.
