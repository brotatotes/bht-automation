<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:23">Matthew 9:23</span>. <i><b>Saw the minstrels and the people making a noise</b></i> — αυλητας, <i>pipers</i>; Anglo-Saxon, [Anglo-Saxon] <i>the whistlers</i>; Gothic, <i>haurngans haurngandans</i>, the <i>horn-blowers blowing with</i> <i>their horns</i>. Nearly the same as the <i>pipublasara</i>, pipe-blowers of the <i>Islandic</i>: for among all those nations funeral lamentations accompanied with such rude instruments, were made at the death of relatives. That <i>pipes</i> were in use among the <i>Jews</i>, in times of calamity or death, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+48:36">Jeremiah 48:36</span>. And among the <i>Greeks</i>, and <i>Romans</i>, as well as among the Jews, persons were <i>hired</i> on purpose to follow the funeral processions with <i>lamentations</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:17-21">Jeremiah 9:17-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+5:16">Amos 5:16</span>. Even the poorest among the Jews were required to have two <i>pipers</i>, and one mourning woman. At these funeral solemnities it was usual with them to drink considerably; even <i>ten</i> cups of wine each, where it could be got. See <i>Lightfoot</i>. This custom is observed among the native Irish to this day, in what is called their CAOINAN. The body of the deceased, dressed in grave-clothes and ornamented with flowers, is placed in some eminent place; the relations and <i>caoiners</i> range themselves in two divisions, one at the head and the other at the feet of the corpse. Anciently, where the deceased was a great personage, the <i>bards</i> and <i>croteries</i> prepared the <i>caoinan</i>. The chief bard of the head chorus began by singing the first stanza in a low doleful tone; which was softly accompanied by the harp. At the conclusion, the <i>foot</i> semichorus began the lamentation, or ULLALOO, from the final note of the preceding stanza, in which they were answered by the head <i>semichorus</i>; then both united in one general chorus.</p>
<p>The chorus of the first stanza being ended, the chief bard of the <i>foot</i> semichorus sung the second stanza, the strain of which was taken from the concluding note of the preceding chorus, which ended, the head semichorus began the GOL, or lamentation, in which they were answered by that of the <i>foot</i>, and then, as before, both united in the general full chorus. Thus alternately were the song and choruses performed during the night. I have seen a number of women, sometimes fourteen, twenty-four, or more, accompany the deceased from his late house to the grave-yard, divided into two parties on each side the corpse, singing the ULLALOO, alternately, all the way. That drinking, in what is called the <i>wake</i>, or watching with the body of the deceased, is practised, and often carried to a shameful excess, needs little proof. This kind of intemperance proceeded to such great lengths among the Jews that the Sanhedrin were obliged to make a decree, to restrain the drinking to <i>ten</i> cups each. I mention these things more particularly, because I have often observed that the customs of the aboriginal Irish bear, a very striking resemblance to those of the ancient Jews, and other Asiatic nations. The application of these observations I leave to others.</p>
<p>It was a custom with the Greeks to make a great noise with brazen vessels; and the Romans made a general <i>outcry</i>, called <i>conclamatio</i>, hoping either to stop the soul which was now taking its flight, or to awaken the person, if only in a state of <i>torpor</i>. This they did for eight days together, calling the person incessantly by his name; at the expiration of which term the phrase, <i>Conclamatum est-all is over-there is no hope</i>-was used. See the words used in this sense by <i>Terence</i>, EUN. l. 347. In all probability this was the θορυβουμενον, the making a <i>violent</i> <i>outcry</i>, mentioned here by the evangelist. How often, on the death of relatives, do men incumber and perplex themselves with vain, worldly, and tumultuous ceremonies, instead of making profitable reflections on death!</p>
