<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:25">Matthew 9:25</span>. <i><b>He - took her by the hand, and the maid arose.</b></i> â€” The fountain of life thus communicating its vital energy to the dead body. Where death has already taken place, no power but that of the great God can restore to life; in such a case, vain is the help of man. So the soul that is dead in trespasses and sins-that is, sentenced to death because of transgression - and is thus dead in law, can only be restored to spiritual life by the mighty power of the Lord Jesus; because HE alone has made the atonement, and HE alone can pardon transgression. If the spiritually dead person be utterly unconcerned about the <i>state</i> and <i>fate</i> of his soul, let a converted relative either <i>bring him to Christ by leading him to</i> <i>hear the unadulterated Gospel of the kingdom</i>; or <i>bring Christ to</i> <i>him by fervent, faithful, and persevering</i> prayer.</p>
