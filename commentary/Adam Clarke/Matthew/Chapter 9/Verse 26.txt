<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:26">Matthew 9:26</span>. <i><b>And the fame hereof went abroad</b></i> â€” In this business Jesus himself scarcely appears, but the <i>work</i> effected by his sovereign power is <i>fully manifested</i>; to teach us that it is the business of a successful preacher of the Gospel to conceal <i>himself</i> as much as possible, that God <i>alone</i> may have the glory of his own grace. This is a proper miracle, and a full exemplification of the unlimited power of Christ.</p>
