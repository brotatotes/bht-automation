<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:27">Matthew 9:27</span>. <i><b>Son of David</b></i> — This was the same as if they had called him <i>Messiah</i>. Two things here are worthy of remark:</p>
<p>1st. That it was a generally received opinion at this time in Judea, that the Messiah should be son of David. (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:42">John 7:42</span>.)</p>
<p>2dly. That Jesus Christ was generally and incontestably acknowledged as coming from this stock. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:23">Matthew 12:23</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Have mercy on us.</b></i> — That man has already a measure of heavenly light who knows that he has no <i>merit</i>; that his cry should be a cry for <i>mercy</i>; that he must be <i>fervent</i>, and that in <i>praying</i> he must <i>follow</i> Jesus Christ as the true Messiah, the <i>son of David</i>, expected from heaven.</p>
