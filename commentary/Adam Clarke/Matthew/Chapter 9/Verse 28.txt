<p><i><b>Believe ye that I am able to do this?</b></i> — Without <i>faith</i> Jesus does nothing to men's souls <i>now</i>, no more than he did to their bodies in the days of his flesh.</p>
<p><i><b>They said unto him, Yea, Lord.</b></i> — Under a sense of our spiritual blindness we should have,</p>
<p>1st. A lively faith in the almighty grace of Christ.</p>
<p>2dly. A <i>fervent, incessant cry</i> for the communication of this grace.</p>
<p>3dly. A proper view of his <i>incarnation</i>, because it is through his union with our nature, and by his sufferings and death, we are to expect salvation.</p>
