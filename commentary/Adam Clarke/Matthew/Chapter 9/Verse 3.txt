<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:3">Matthew 9:3</span>. <i><b>This</b></i><b> man </b><i><b>blasphemeth.</b></i> — βλασφημεω comes either from βλαπτειν την φημην, <i>to hurt</i> or <i>blast the reputation</i> or <i>credit</i> of another, or from βαλλειν ταις φημαις, <i>to smite with reports</i>. Whenever it is used in reference to GOD, it simply signifies, <i>to</i> <i>speak impiously</i> of his <i>nature</i>, or attributes, or works. <i>Injurious</i> <i>speaking</i> is its proper translation when referred to <i>man</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>scribes</i> were the <i>literati</i> of that time; and their learning, because not used in dependence on God, rendered them proud, envious, and obstinate. Unsanctified knowledge has still the same effect: that light serves only to blind and lead men out of the way which is not joined with uprightness of heart. The most sacred truths often become an occasion of delusion, where men are under the government of their evil passions.</p>
