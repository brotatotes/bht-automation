Verse 32. A dumb man possessed with a devil. â€” Some demons rendered the persons they possessed paralytic, some blind, others dumb, &c. It was the interest of Satan to hide his influences under the appearance of natural disorders. A man who does not acknowledge his sin to God, who prays not for salvation, who returns no praises for the mercies he is continually receiving, may well be said to be possessed with a dumb demon.
