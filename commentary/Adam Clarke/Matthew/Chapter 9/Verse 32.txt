<p>Verse 32. <i><b>A dumb man possessed with a devil.</b></i> â€” Some demons rendered the persons they possessed <i>paralytic</i>, some <i>blind</i>, others <i>dumb</i>, &amp;c. It was the interest of Satan to hide his influences under the appearance of <i>natural</i> disorders. A man who does <i>not</i> <i>acknowledge</i> his sin to God, who <i>prays not</i> for salvation, who <i>returns no praises</i> for the mercies he is continually receiving, may well be said <i>to be possessed with a dumb demon</i>.</p>
