<p>Verse 33. <i><b>And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake</b></i> — The very miracle which was now wrought was to be the demonstrative proof of the Messiah's being manifested in the flesh. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:5-6">Isaiah 35:5-6</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>It was never so seen in Israel.</b></i> — The greatest of the prophets has never been able to do such miracles as these. This was the remark of the people; and thus we find that the poor and the simple were more ready to acknowledge the hand of God than the <i>rich</i> and the <i>learned</i>. Many miracles had been wrought in the course of this one day, and this excited their surprise.</p>
