<p>Verse 34. <i><b>He casteth out devils through the prince of the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>devils.</b></i> â€” This verse is wanting in both the Greek and Latin of the <i>C. Bezae</i>, in another copy of the <i>Itala</i>, and in <i>Hilary</i> and <i>Juvencus</i>. But <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>.</p>
<p>It is a consummate piece of <i>malice</i> to attribute the <i>works of God</i> to the <i>devil</i>. <i>Envy</i> cannot suffer the approbation which is given to the excellencies of others. Those whose hearts are possessed by this vice speak the very language of the devil. <i>Calumny</i> is but a little distance from <i>envy</i>. Though all persons may not have as much <i>envy</i> as the <i>Pharisees</i>, yet they should fear having some degree of it, as all have the <i>principle</i> from whence it proceeds, viz. <i>sin</i>.</p>
