<p>Verse 35. <i><b>Jesus went about all the cities and villages</b></i> — Of Galilee. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>. A real minister of Jesus Christ, after his example, is neither detained in one place by a comfortable provision made by some, nor discouraged from pursuing his work by the calumny and persecution of others. It is proper to remark, that, wherever Christ comes, the proofs of his presence evidently appear: he works none but salutary and beneficial miracles, because his ministry is a ministry of salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>Among the people.</b></i> — εν τω λαω. This clause is omitted by about <i>fifty</i> MSS., several of them of the first antiquity and authority; by the <i>Complutensian</i>, and by <i>Bengel</i>; by both the <i>Syriac</i>, both the <i>Arabic</i>, both the <i>Persic</i>; the <i>Ethiopic, Gothic, Saxon</i>, and all the <i>Itala</i>, except four. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text.</p>
