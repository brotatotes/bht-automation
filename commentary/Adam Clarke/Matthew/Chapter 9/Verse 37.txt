<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:37">Matthew 9:37</span>. <i><b>The harvest</b></i> â€” The souls who are ready to receive the truth are very numerous; <i>but the labourers are few</i>. There are <i>multitudes</i> of scribes, Pharisees, and priests, of <i>reverend</i> and <i>right reverend</i> men; but there are few that <i>work</i>. Jesus wishes for <i>labourers</i>, not <i>gentlemen</i>, who are either <i>idle</i> drones, or <i>slaves</i> to pleasure and sin, and <i>nati consumere fruges</i>. "Born to consume the produce of the soil."</p>
<p>It was customary with the Jews to call their rabbins and students <i>reapers</i>; and their work of instruction, the <i>harvest</i>. So in <i>Idra Rabba</i>, s. 2. "The days are few; the creditor is urgent; the crier calls out incessantly; and the <i>reapers are few</i>." And in <i>Pirkey Aboth</i>: "The day is short, the work great, the <i>workmen</i> idle, the reward abundant, and the <i>master of the household</i> is urgent." In all worldly concerns, if there be the prospect of much gain, most men are willing enough to labour; but if it be to save their own souls, or the souls of others, what indolence, backwardness, and carelessness! While their adversary, the devil, is going about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; and a careless soul, and especially a careless minister is his especial prey.</p>
<p>The <i>place</i> of the <i>harvest</i> is the <i>whole earth</i>: it signifies little <i>where</i> a man works, provided it be by the <i>appointment</i>, in the <i>Spirit</i>, and with the <i>blessing</i> of God.</p>
