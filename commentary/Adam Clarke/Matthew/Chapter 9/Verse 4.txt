<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:4">Matthew 9:4</span>. <i><b>Jesus knowing</b></i> (ιδων <i>seeing</i>)<b> </b><i><b>their thoughts</b></i> — In telling them what the thoughts of their hearts were, (for they had expressed nothing publicly,) he gave them the fullest proof of his power to forgive sins; because God only can forgive sins, and God only can <i>search</i> and <i>know</i> the heart. Jesus pronounced the man's sins forgiven; and gave the scribes the fullest proof of his power to do so, by telling them what, <i>in the secret of their souls</i>, they <i>thought</i> on the subject.</p>
<p>God sounds the secrets of all hearts-no sin escapes his notice; how senseless then is the sinner to think he sins securely when unseen by men! Let us take heed to our hearts, as well as to our conduct, for God searches out and condemns all that does not spring from, and leads not to himself.</p>
