<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:5">Matthew 9:5</span>. <i><b>For whether is easier</b></i><b>, to say, </b><i><b>Thy sins be forgiven</b></i><b> </b><i><b>thee;</b></i><b> or to say, </b><i><b>Arise, and walk?</b></i> â€” Both are <i>equally easy</i>, and <i>equally difficult</i>; for both require <i>unlimited</i> power to produce them. And every thing is equally easy to that power which is unlimited. A universe can be as easily produced by a single act of the Divine <i>will</i> as the smallest elementary part of matter.</p>
<p>The common punctuation of the above passage almost destroys the sense: the comma should be placed after <i>easier</i>, and <i>to say</i>, made the first part of the question.</p>
