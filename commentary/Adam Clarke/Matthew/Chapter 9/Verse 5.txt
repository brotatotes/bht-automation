Verse Matthew 9:5. For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk? â€” Both are equally easy, and equally difficult; for both require unlimited power to produce them. And every thing is equally easy to that power which is unlimited. A universe can be as easily produced by a single act of the Divine will as the smallest elementary part of matter.The common punctuation of the above passage almost destroys the sense: the comma should be placed after easier, and to say, made the first part of the question.
