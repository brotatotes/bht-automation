<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:6">Matthew 9:6</span>. <i><b>But that ye may know, c.</b></i> — <i>External</i> miracles are the proofs of <i>internal ones</i>. <i>Three</i> miracles are wrought in this case. (I mean, by miracle, something <i>produced</i> or <i>known</i> that no power is capable of but that which is <i>omnipotent</i>, and no <i>knowledge</i> adequate to but that which is <i>omniscient</i>.) The miracles are these:</p>
<p>1st. The remission of the poor man's sins.</p>
<p>2d. The discernment of the secret thoughts of the scribes.</p>
<p>3d. The restoring of the paralytic, in an instant, to perfect soundness.</p>
<p>Thus one miracle becomes the proof and establishment of another. Never was a clearer proof of omnipotent energy and mercy brought under the senses of man. Here is an absolutely perfect miracle wrought and here are absolute incontestable proofs that the miracle <i>was</i> wrought; and the conclusion is the fullest demonstration of the Divinity of the ever-blessed Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>Arise, take up thy bed</b></i> — Being enabled to obey this command was the public proof that the man was made whole. Such a circumstance should not pass without improvement. A man gives proof of his conversion from sin to God who imitates this paralytic person. He who does not <i>rise</i> and <i>stand upright</i>, but either continues <i>grovelling</i> on the earth, or <i>falls back</i> as soon as he is <i>got up</i>, is not yet cured of his spiritual palsy. When we see a penitent enabled to rejoice in hope of God's glory, and to walk in the way of his commandments, he affords us all the proof which we can reasonably require, that his conversion is <i>real</i>: the proof sufficient to satisfy <i>himself</i> is the <i>witness of the Holy Spirit in</i> <i>his own heart</i>; but this is a matter of which those who are without cannot judge: they must form their opinion from his <i>conduct</i>, and judge of the <i>tree</i> by its <i>fruits</i>.</p>
