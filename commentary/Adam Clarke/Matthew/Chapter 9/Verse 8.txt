<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:8">Matthew 9:8</span>. <i><b>When the multitudes saw</b></i><b> it, </b><i><b>they marvelled</b></i> — Instead of εθαυμασαν, <i>wondered</i>, the Codex <i>Vatic</i>. and Cod. <i>Bezae</i>, with several other MSS. and versions, have εφοβηθησαν, <i>feared</i>. In the <i>Gothic</i>, and one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, both readings are conjoined, thus: <i>And the multitudes seeing it, wondered and feared, and</i> <i>glorified God. Wondered</i> at the <i>miracle; feared</i> to <i>offend</i> against such <i>power</i> and <i>goodness</i>; and <i>glorified God</i> for the works of <i>mercy</i> which he had wrought.</p>
<p>That which to the <i>doctors of the law</i>, the worldly-wise and prudent, is a matter of scandal, is to the humble an occasion of glorifying the Most High. Divine things make a deeper impression on the hearts of the simple multitude than on those of the doctors, who, puffed up with a sense of their own wisdom, refuse to receive the truth <i>as it is in Jesus</i>. The conversion of one rebellious soul is a greater miracle, and more to be admired than all that can be wrought on inanimate creatures. He who sees a sinner converted from the error of his way sees a miracle wrought by eternal power and goodness. May such miracles be <i>multiplied</i>!</p>
