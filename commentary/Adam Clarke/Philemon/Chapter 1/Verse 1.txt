<p>NOTES ON PHILEMON.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:1">Philemon 1:1</span>. <i><b>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ</b></i> — It has already been noted, in the preface, that Paul was a prisoner at Rome when he wrote this epistle, and those to the Colossians and Philippians. But some think that the term <i>prisoner</i> does not sufficiently point out the apostle's <i>state</i>, and that the original word δεσμιος should be translated <i>bound with a chain</i>: this is certainly its meaning; and it shows us in some measure his circumstances-one arm was bound with a chain to the arm of the soldier to whose custody he had been delivered.</p>
<p>It has also been remarked that Paul does not call himself an <i>apostle</i> here, because the letter was a letter of <i>friendship</i>, and on <i>private concerns</i>. But the MSS. are not entirely agreed on this subject. Two MSS. have δουλος, a <i>servant</i>; the <i>Codex Claromontanus</i> and the <i>Codex Sangermanensis</i>, both in the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>, have αποστολος, <i>apostle</i>; and <i>Cassiodorus</i> has αποστολος δεσμιος, Paul, <i>an imprisoned apostle</i> of Jesus Christ. They, however, generally agree in the omission of the word αποστολος.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto Philemon our dearly beloved</b></i> — There is a peculiarity in the use of <i>proper names</i> in this epistle which is not found in any other part of St. Paul's writings. The names to which we refer are <i>Philemon, Apphia, Archippus</i>, and <i>Onesimus</i>.</p>
<p>PHILEMON, φιλημων. <i>Affectionate</i> or <i>beloved</i>, from φιλημα, a <i>kiss</i>; this led the apostle to say: <i>To Philemon</i> our DEARLY BELOVED.</p>
