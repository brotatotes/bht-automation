<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:13">Philemon 1:13</span>. <i><b>That in thy stead he might have ministered unto me</b></i> â€” As Philemon was one of Paul's converts, he became thereby his spiritual father, and had a right to his services when in need. This was a strong argument, not only to induce Philemon to forgive his servant, but to send him back to the apostle, that he might minister to him in his master's stead.</p>
