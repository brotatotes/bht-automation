<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:14">Philemon 1:14</span>. <i><b>That thy benefit should not be as it were of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>necessity</b></i> â€” If the apostle had kept Onesimus in his service, and written to Philemon to forgive him and permit him to stay, to this it is probable he would have agreed; but the <i>benefit</i> thus conceded might have lost much of its real worth by the consideration that, had he been at Colosse, Philemon would not have sent him to Rome; but, being there and in the apostle's service, he could not with propriety order him home: thus the benefit to the apostle would have appeared to have been of <i>necessity</i>. The apostle, therefore, by sending him back again, gave Philemon the opportunity to do all as if <i>self-moved</i> to it. This is a very delicate touch.</p>
