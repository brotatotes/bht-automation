<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:15">Philemon 1:15</span>. <i><b>He-departed for a season</b></i> â€” This is another most delicate stroke. He departed thy <i>slave</i>, thy <i>unfaithful slave</i>; he departed <i>for a short time</i>; but so has the mercy of God operated in his behalf, and the providence of God in thine, that he now returns, not an unfaithful <i>slave</i>, in whom thou couldst repose no confidence, but as a <i>brother</i>, a <i>beloved brother in the Lord</i>, to be in the same heavenly family with thee for <i>ever</i>. Thou hast, therefore, reason to be thankful to God that he did depart, that he might be restored to thee again infinitely better than he was when be left thee. God has permitted his unfaithfulness, and overruled the whole both to his advantage and thine. The apology for Onesimus is very similar to that made by Joseph for his brethren, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+45:5">Genesis 45:5</span>.</p>
