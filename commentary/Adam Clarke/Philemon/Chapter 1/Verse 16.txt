<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:16">Philemon 1:16</span>. <i><b>Not now as a servant?</b></i> — Do not receive him merely as thy <i>slave</i>, nor treat him according to that condition; <i>but as a</i> <i>brother</i>-as a genuine Christian, and particularly dear to me.</p>
<p><i><b>Both in the flesh and in the Lord?</b></i> — There is no reason to believe that Onesimus was of the <i>kindred</i> of Philemon; and we must take the term <i>flesh</i>, here, as referring to the <i>right</i> which Philemon had in him. He was a <i>part</i> of his <i>property</i> and of his <i>family</i>; as a <i>slave</i>, this was his condition; but he now stood in a twofold relation to Philemon:</p>
<p>1. According to the <i>flesh</i>, as above explained, he was one of his family. </p>
<p>2. <i>In the Lord</i>; he was now also a member of the <i>heavenly family</i>, and of the <i>Church</i> at Philemon's house. Philemon's interest in him was now doubled, in consequence of his conversion to Christianity.</p>
