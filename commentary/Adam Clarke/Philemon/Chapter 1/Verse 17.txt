<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:17">Philemon 1:17</span>. <i><b>If thou count me therefore a partner</b></i> â€” If thou dost consider me as a <i>friend</i>; if I have still the place of a friend in thy affection, <i>receive him as myself</i>; for, as I feel him as my own soul, in receiving <i>him</i> thou receivest <i>me</i>.</p>

It is written with much art; but is greatly exceeded by that of St. Paul. As it is very short I shall insert it: - </p>
<p>This is not only greatly outdone by St. Paul, but also by a letter of <i>Pliny</i> to his friend <i>Sabinianus</i>, in behalf of his servant, who, by some means, had incurred his master's displeasure. See it at the conclusion of these notes.</p>
