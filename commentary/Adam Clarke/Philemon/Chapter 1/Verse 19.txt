<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:19">Philemon 1:19</span>. <i><b>I Paul have written</b></i><b> it </b><i><b>with mine own hand</b></i> — It is likely that the whole of the letter was written by St. Paul himself, which was not his usual custom.

But by thus speaking he bound Philemon to do what he requested, as an act of common civility, if he could not feel a higher motive from what he had already urged.</p>
<p><i><b>Albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me</b></i> — I ask thee to do this thing to <i>oblige</i> me, though I will not say how much thou owest unto me; <i>even thine own self</i>, as having been the means of thy conversion.</p>
