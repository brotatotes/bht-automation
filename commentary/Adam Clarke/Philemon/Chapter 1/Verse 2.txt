<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span>. APPHIA. απφια. Under the word απφα <i>Suidas</i> says: Αδελφης και αδελφου ὑπακορισμα· <i>Appha</i> is the affectionate address of a brother or sister; or the diminutive of a brother and sister, used to express kindness and affection. Hence the apostle, referring to the meaning of the word, says: Και Απφιᾳ τῃ αδελφῃ αγαπητῃ· <i>And to Apphia the beloved sister</i>. Though αδελοη <i>sister</i>, be not in our common text, it is found in AD*EFG, several others, the <i>Itala, Vulgate, Slavonic</i>, c. and is undoubtedly genuine.</p>
<p>ARCHIPPUS, αρχιπηος. The <i>ruler</i> or <i>master of the horse</i>; from αρχων, <i>a chief</i>, and ιππος, <i>a horse</i>. HEROES of old were, both among the Greeks and Trojans, celebrated for their skill in <i>managing</i> and <i>taming the horse</i>, and employing him in <i>war</i>; this frequently occurs in Homer. The import of the name of <i>Archippus</i> might suggest this idea to the apostle's mind, and lead him to say: <i>Archippus our</i> FELLOW SOLDIER.</p>
<p>Suidas mentions a person of this name, who was once <i>victor</i> at the games, in the <i>ninety-first</i> Olympiad.</p>
<p>There was one of the pupils of Pythagoras of this name; and I introduce him here for the sake of a quotation from St. Jerome, (Apol. adv. Ruffin.,) relative to the doctrines taught by him and his fellow disciple, <i>Lysis</i>: Φευκτεον πανταπασι και εκκοπτεον ασθενειαν μεν του σωματος, απαιδευσιαν δε της ψυχης, ακολασιαν δε της γαστρος, στασιν δε της πολεως, την δε διαφωνιαν απο της οικιας, και κοινῃ απο παντων το ακρατες· "By all means and methods these evils are to be shunned and cut off: <i>effeminacy</i> from the <i>body</i>; IGNORANCE from the <i>soul; delicacies</i> from the <i>belly;</i> <i>sedition</i> from the <i>city; discord</i> from the <i>house</i>; and, in general, <i>intemperance</i> from <i>all things</i>." Vid. FAB. Thes. Erud. Schol.</p>
<p>ONESIMUS, ονησιμος. <i>Useful</i> or <i>profitable</i>; from ονημι, <i>to help</i>. The import of this name led the apostle to play upon the word thus: <i>I beseech thee for any son Onesimus - which in time past</i> <i>was to thee</i> UNPROFITABLE, <i>but now</i> PROFITABLE <i>to thee and me</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To the Church in thy house</b></i> — The congregation of Christians frequently assembling in Philemon's house; for at this time the Christians had neither temples, churches, nor chapels. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>, and the reference there.</p>
<p>It is very probable that <i>Apphia</i> was the wife of Philemon, and Archippus, their son, the pastor of the Church at Philemon's house.</p>
