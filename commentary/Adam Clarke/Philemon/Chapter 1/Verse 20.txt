Verse Philemon 1:20. Yea, brother — It is even so, that thou art thus indebted to me. Let me have joy of thee, in forgiving Onesimus, and receiving him into thy favour. In the words εγε σου οναιμην, which we should translate, let me have PROFIT of thee, there is an evident paronomasia, or play on the name of Onesimus. See on Philemon 1:2; Philemon 1:11.Refresh my bowels — Gratify the earnest longing of my soul in this. I ask neither thy money nor goods; I ask what will enrich, not impoverish, thee to give.
