<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:22">Philemon 1:22</span>. <i><b>But withal prepare me also a lodging</b></i> — Does not the apostle mention this as conferring an obligation on Philemon? I will begin to repay thee by taking up my abode at thy house, as soon as I shall be enlarged from prison. But some think he wished Philemon to <i>hire</i> him a house, that he might have a <i>lodging of his</i> <i>own</i> when he returned to Colosse.</p>
<p><i><b>For I trust that through your prayers</b></i> — It is very likely that this epistle was written a short time before the liberation of the apostle from his first imprisonment at Rome. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:30">Acts 28:30</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:24">Philippians 2:24</span>; and that he had that liberation now in full prospect.</p>
