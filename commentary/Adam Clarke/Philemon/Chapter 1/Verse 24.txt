Some think that Marcus was either the evangelist, or John Mark, the nephew of Barnabas, Acts 12:12; Acts 12:25. Aristarchus was probably the same with him mentioned Acts 19:29; Acts 20:4; Acts 27:2. See Colossians 4:10.Demas — Is supposed to be the same who continued in his attachment to Paul till his last imprisonment at Rome; after which he left him for what is supposed to have been the love of the world, 2 Timothy 4:10; but see the note.Lucas — Is supposed to be Luke the evangelist, and author of the Acts of the Apostles. On these suppositions little confidence can be placed: they may be correct; they may be otherwise.
