<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:5">Philemon 1:5</span>. <i><b>Hearing of thy love and faith</b></i> â€” His <i>faith</i> in Christ Jesus, his <i>love</i> to the saints. Several excellent MSS. and some versions put <i>faith</i> before <i>love</i>, which makes a more natural reading. There is no figure of speech which would vindicate our saying <i>faith in the saints</i>; so that, if we do not allow of the arrangement in the MSS. referred to, we shall be obliged to have recourse to the transposition, because <i>faith</i> must refer to <i>Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i>, and <i>love</i> to the <i>saints</i>.</p>
