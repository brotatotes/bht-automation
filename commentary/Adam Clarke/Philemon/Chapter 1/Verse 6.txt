<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:6">Philemon 1:6</span>. <i><b>That the communication of thy faith</b></i> — The words ἡ κοινωνια της πιστεως σου, the <i>fellowship</i> or <i>communication of thy</i> <i>faith</i>, may be understood as referring to the <i>work</i> of <i>love</i> towards the <i>saints</i>-the poor Christians, which his <i>faith</i> in Christ enabled him to perform, <i>faith</i> being taken here for its <i>effects</i>; and indeed the word κοινωνια itself is not unfrequently used to denote <i>liberality, almsgiving</i>; and this is very properly remarked by <i>Theophylact</i> here: Κοινωνιαν πιστεως ελεημοσυνην καλει, ὡς απο πιστεως πολλης γενομενην· He terms <i>almsgiving</i> the <i>communication</i> <i>of faith</i>, because it is the fruit of much faith."</p>
<p><i><b>May become effectual</b></i> — Dr. Macknight understands these words thus: "That the many good offices which thou dost to the saints <i>may become effectual</i> in bringing others <i>to the acknowledgment of</i> <i>every good</i> disposition which is in you towards Christ Jesus, or towards his members."</p>
<p>Instead of ενεργης, <i>energetic</i> or <i>effectual</i>, the <i>Vulgate</i> and some of the <i>fathers</i>, as well as several Latin MSS., have read εναργης, <i>evident</i>. This makes a very good sense, and seems to agree best with the scope of the place.</p>
<p>Instead of ενυμιν, <i>in</i> YOU, ενημιν <i>in</i> US, is the reading of all the best MSS., as well as of several versions and fathers.</p>
