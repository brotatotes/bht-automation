<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:9">Philemon 1:9</span>. <i><b>Paul the aged</b></i> — If we allow St. Paul to have been about 25 years of age at the utmost, in the year 31, when he was assisting at the martyrdom of Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>; as this epistle was written about A. D. 62, he could not have been at this time more than about 56 years old. This could not constitute him an <i>aged</i> man in our sense of the term; yet, when the whole length of his life is taken in, being martyred about four years after this, he may not improperly be considered an <i>aged</i> or <i>elderly man</i>, though it is generally allowed that his martyrdom took place in the 66th year of our Lord.</p>
<p>But the word πρεσβυς signifies, not only an <i>old man</i>, but also an <i>ambassador</i>; because <i>old</i> or <i>elderly</i> men were chosen to fulfil such an office, because of their experience and solidity; and πρεσβυτης, for πρεσβευτης, is used in the same sense and for the same reason by the Septuagint; hence some have thought that we should translate here, <i>Paul the ambassador</i>. This would agree very well with the scope and even the design of the place.</p>
