<p>Verse 10. <i><b>That ye may approve things that are excellent</b></i> — Εις το δοκιμαζειν ὑμας τα διαφεροντα· <i>To the end that ye may put to</i> <i>proof the things that differ</i>, or the things that are in are more profitable. By the pure and abundant love which they received from God they would be able to <i>try</i> whatever <i>differed</i> from the <i>teaching</i> they had received, and from the <i>experience</i> they had in spiritual things.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye may be sincere</b></i> — Ἱνα ητε ειλικρινεις. The word ειλικρινεια, which we translate <i>sincerity</i>, is compounded of ειλη, the <i>splendour of the sun</i>, and κρινω, <i>I judge</i>; a thing which may be examined in the clearest and strongest light, without the possibility of detecting a single flaw or imperfection. "A metaphor," says Mr. <i>Leigh</i>, "taken from the usual practice of chapmen, in the view and choice of their wares, that bring them forth into the light and hold up the cloth against the sun, to see if they can espy any default in them. <i>Pure</i> as the <i>sun</i>." Be so purified and refined in your souls, by the indwelling Spirit, that even the <i>light</i> of God shining into your hearts, shall not be able to discover a fault that the <i>love</i> of God has not purged away.</p>
<p>Our word <i>sincerity</i> is from the Latin <i>sinceritas</i>, which is compounded of <i>sine</i>, without, and <i>cera</i>, wax, and is a metaphor taken from clarified honey; for the <i>mel sincerum</i>, pure or clarified honey, is that which is <i>sine cera</i>, without wax, no part of the <i>comb</i> being left in it. <i>Sincerity</i>, taken in its full meaning, is a word of the most extensive import; and, when applied in reference to the state of the soul, is as strong as the word <i>perfection</i> itself. The soul that is sincere is the soul that is <i>without sin</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Without offence</b></i> — απροσκοποι. Neither offending God nor your neighbour; neither being stumbled yourselves, nor the cause of stumbling to others.</p>
<p><i><b>Till the day of Christ</b></i> — Till he comes to judge the world, or, till the day in which you are called into the eternal world. According to this prayer, a man, under the power and influence of the grace of God, may so love as never to offend his Maker, to the latest period of his life. Those who deny this, must believe that the Spirit of God either cannot or will not do it; or, that the blood of Christ cannot cleanse from all unrighteousness. And this would be not only <i>antiscriptural</i>, but also <i>blasphemous</i>.</p>
