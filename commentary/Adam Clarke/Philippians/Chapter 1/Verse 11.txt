<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness</b></i> — By <i>righteousness</i> we may understand, here, the whole work of the Spirit of God, in the soul of a believer; and by the <i>fruits</i> of righteousness, all holy <i>tempers</i>, holy <i>words</i>, and right <i>actions</i>. And with these they are to be <i>filled</i>, πεπληρωμενοι, <i>filled up,</i> <i>filled full</i>; the whole soul and life occupied with them, ever doing something by which glory is brought to God, or good done to man.</p>
<p><i><b>By Jesus Christ</b></i> — That is, according to his <i>doctrine</i>, through the power of his <i>grace</i>, and by the agency of his <i>Spirit</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto the glory and praise of God.</b></i> — God being honoured when the work of his grace thus appears to men in the fruits of righteousness; and God is praised by all the faithful when his work thus appears. Every genuine follower of God has his glory in view by all that he does, says, or intends. He loves to glorify God, and he glorifies him by showing forth in his conversion the glorious working of the glorious power of the Lord.</p>
