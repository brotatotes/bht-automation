<p>Verse 12. <i><b>That the things</b></i><b> which happened </b><i><b>unto me</b></i> â€” St. Paul was at this time a prisoner at Rome, and it appears probable that he had already been called to make a defence for himself, and to vindicate the doctrines of the Gospel; and this he had been enabled to do in such a manner that the honour of the Gospel had been greatly promoted by it. As the Philippians loved him greatly, he felt it right to give them this information relative to his state, and how God had turned his bonds to the advantage of that cause on account of which he was bound.</p>
