<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Some - preach Christ even of envy and strife</b></i> — These must have been the Judaizing teachers, who insisted on the necessity of connecting the Mosaic rites with the Christian institutions; and, probably, denounced Paul to the Jews dwelling at Rome as not only an enemy to the law and the prophets, but also as a very imperfect Christian, because he declared strongly against the doctrine of circumcision, c. and no doubt endeavoured to prejudice him with the heathen Romans.</p>
<p>The word <i>preach</i> is not to be taken here as implying that the different persons mentioned were what we call <i>preachers of the</i> <i>Gospel</i>: all that we can understand from St. Paul's use of the word is, that they <i>proclaimed</i> Christ as the promised <i>Messiah</i>, espoused the Christian cause, and contended, whether in public or private, that this Jesus was the Christ; but nothing of this kind appears to have been intended in reference to the <i>conversion of sinners</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Some also of good will.</b></i> — Some, through mere benevolence to the apostle, both espoused his doctrine and vindicated his cause.</p>
