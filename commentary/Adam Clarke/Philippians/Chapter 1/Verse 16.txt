<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Preach Christ of contention</b></i> — The Judaizing teachers, they also preach Christ; they acknowledge that Jesus is the Christ or promised <i>Messiah</i>, and preach him as such.</p>
<p><i><b>Not sincerely</b></i> — ουχ αγνως. <i>Not chastely</i>, garbling the Gospel; not speaking the whole truth, but just what served their purpose; and at the same time they denounced the apostle as an enemy to the Divine institutions, because he spoke against circumcision.</p>
