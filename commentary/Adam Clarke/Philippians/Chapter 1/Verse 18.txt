<p>Verse 18. <i><b>What then?</b></i> â€” It is a matter of little importance to me <i>how</i> Christ is preached, provided he be preached. I rejoice that any thing is known of him; and am truly glad that the Gospel is even made partially known, for this will lead to farther inquiries, and in the end be of service to the truth.</p>
