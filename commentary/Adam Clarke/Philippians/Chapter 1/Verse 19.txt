<p>Verse 19. <i><b>This shall turn to my salvation</b></i> — That is: It will be the means of my temporal <i>safety</i>; of my <i>deliverance</i>; for so the word σωτηρια is here to be understood. The Jews had denounced the apostle as an enemy to Caesar; but he knew that, when the nature of the Gospel should be fully known, the Romans would see that <i>he</i> could be no enemy to Caesar who proclaimed a prince whose kingdom was not of this world; and who had taught, in the most unequivocal manner, that all Christians were to give tribute to whom tribute was due, and while they feared God to honour also the king, though that king was <i>Nero</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Through your prayer</b></i> — Knowing them to be genuine followers of Christ, he was satisfied that their prayers would be very available in his behalf; and under God he places much dependence upon them.</p>
<p><i><b>The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</b></i> — The word επιχορηγια, which we translate <i>supply</i>, signifies also <i>furnishing whatever is</i> <i>necessary</i>. The Spirit of God he expected to help all his infirmities, and to furnish him with all the wisdom, prudence, strength of reason, and argument, which might be necessary for him in the different trials he had to pass through with his persecutors, and the civil powers, at whose judgment-seat he stood.</p>
