<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Earnest expectation</b></i> — He had the most confident expectation that God would stand by him, so that he should be enabled, with the <i>utmost liberty of speech</i>, εν πασῃ παρῥησια, to testify the Gospel of the grace of God; and, should he have the liberty of doing so, he was utterly regardless what the issue might be relative to himself. Whether life or death, was to him perfectly equal, and perfectly indifferent, providing Christ were magnified - his person, nature, doctrine, &amp;c., shown to be, what they really are, most noble, most excellent, most necessary, and most glorious.</p>
