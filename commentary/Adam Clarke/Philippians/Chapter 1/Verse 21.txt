<p>Verse 21. <i><b>For to me to live</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>Christ</b></i> â€” <i>Whether I live or die,</i> <i>Christ is gain to me</i>. While I live I am Christ's property and servant, and Christ is my portion; if I die-if I be called to witness the truth at the expense of my life, this will be gain; I shall be saved from the remaining troubles and difficulties in life, and be put immediately in possession of my heavenly inheritance. As, therefore, it respects myself, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether I be taken off by a violent death, or whether I be permitted to continue here longer; in either case I can lose nothing.</p>
