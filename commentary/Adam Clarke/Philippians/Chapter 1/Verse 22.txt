<p>Verse 22. <i><b>But if I live in the flesh</b></i> — Should I be spared longer, I shall labour for Christ as I have done; and <i>this is the</i> <i>fruit of my labour</i>, that Christ shall be magnified by my longer life, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Yet what I shall choose I wot not.</b></i> — Had I the two conditions left to my own choice, whether to die now and go to glory, or whether to live longer in persecutions and affliction, (glorifying Christ by spreading the Gospel,) I could not tell which to prefer.</p>
