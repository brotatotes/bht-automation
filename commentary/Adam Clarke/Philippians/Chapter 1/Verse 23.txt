<p>Verse 23. <i><b>For I am in a strait betwixt two</b></i> — Viz. the dying now, and being immediately with God; or living longer to preach and spread the Gospel, and thus glorify Christ among men.</p>
<p><i><b>Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ</b></i> — Την επιθυμιαν εχων εις το αναλυσαι. It appears to be a metaphor taken from the commander of a vessel, in a foreign port, who feels a strong desire αναλυσαι, to set sail, and get to his own country and family; but this desire is counterbalanced by a conviction that the general interests of the voyage may be best answered by his longer stay in the port where his vessel now rides; for he is not in dock, he is not aground, but rides at anchor in the port, and may any hour <i>weigh</i> and be gone. Such was the condition of the apostle: he was not at <i>home</i>, but although he was abroad it was on his employer's business; he wishes to return, and is cleared out and ready to set sail, but he has not received his last orders from his owner, and whatever desire he may feel to be at <i>home</i> he will faithfully wait till his final orders arrive.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is far better</b></i> — Πολλῳ - μαλλον κρεισσον· <i>Multo magis</i> <i>melior</i>, VULGATE; <i>much more better</i>. The reader will at once see that the words are very emphatic.</p>
