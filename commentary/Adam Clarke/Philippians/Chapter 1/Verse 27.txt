Verse 27. Let your conversation be as it becometh the Gospel — The apostle considers the Church at Philippi as a free or imperial city, which possesses great honours, dignities, and privileges; and he exhorts them to act, αξιως, worthy of or suitably to those honours and privileges. This is the idea that is expressed by the word πολιτευεσθε, act according to the nature of your political situation, the citizenship and privileges which you possess in consequence of your being free inhabitants of Christ's imperial city, the Church. The apostle resumes the same metaphor, Philippians 3:20: ἡμων - το πολιτευμα εν ουρανοις ὑπαρχει· For our citizenship is in heaven; but in this last verse he puts heaven in the place of the Church, and this is all right; for he, who is not a member of the Church of Christ on earth, can have no right to the kingdom of heaven, and he who does not walk worthy of the Gospel of Christ cannot be counted worthy to enter through the gates into the city of the eternal King.Whether I come and see you — Leaving the matter still in doubt as to them, whether he should again visit them.In one spirit — Being all of one mind under the influence of the Holy Ghost.Striving together — συναθλουντες. Wrestling together, not in contention with each other, but in union against the enemies of the Gospel faith-the doctrine of Christ crucified, and freedom from all Mosaic rites and ceremonies, as well as from sin and perdition, through his passion and sacrifice.
