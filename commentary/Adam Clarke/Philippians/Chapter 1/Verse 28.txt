<p>Verse 28. <i><b>In nothing terrified by your adversaries</b></i> — So it appears that the Church at Philippi was then under persecution.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is to them</b></i> — Ἡτις αυτοις εστιν. Some very judicious critics consider ητις as referring to πιστις, the faith of the Gospel, which they, the heathen, considered to be a token of perdition to all them who embraced it; but, as the apostle says, it was to them the Philippians, on the contrary, the most evident token of salvation; for, having embraced the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, they were incontestably in the way to eternal blessedness.</p>
