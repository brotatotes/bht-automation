Verse 29. Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ — Ὑμιν εχαρισθη· To you it is graciously given; it is no small privilege that God has so far honoured you as to permit you to suffer on Christ's account. It is only his most faithful servants that he thus honours. Be not therefore terrified by your enemies; they can do nothing to you which God will not turn to your eternal advantage. We learn from this that it is as great a privilege to suffer for Christ as to believe on him; and the former in certain cases (as far as the latter in all cases) becomes the means of salvation to them who are thus exercised.
