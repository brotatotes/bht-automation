Verse Philippians 1:30. Having the same conflict â€” When Paul preached the Gospel at Philippi he was grievously persecuted, as we learn from Acts 16:19-40, being stripped, scourged, thrown into prison, even into the dungeon, and his feet made fast in the stocks. This was the conflict they had seen in him; and now they heard that he had been sent prisoner to Rome as an evil doer, and that he was at present in bonds, and shortly to be tried for his life before the Roman emperor to whom he had been obliged to appeal.1. IT was no small encouragement to these persons,(1.) That whatever sufferings they met with they were supported under them.(2.) That they suffered in the same cause in which their illustrious apostle was suffering.(3.) That they suffered, not because they had done any evil, or could be accused of any, but because they believed in the Son of God, who died for them and for all mankind.(4.) That all these sufferings were sanctified to their eternal good.2. And God is able to make the same grace abound towards us in like circumstances; it is for this purpose that such consolatory portions are left on record. He who is persecuted or afflicted for Christ's sake, is most eminently honoured by his Creator.
