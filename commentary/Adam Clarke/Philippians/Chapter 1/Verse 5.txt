<p>Verse 5. <i><b>For your fellowship in the Gospel</b></i> — if we consider κοινωνια as implying spiritual <i>fellowship</i> or <i>communion</i>, then it signifies, not only their attention to the Gospel, their readiness to continue it, and perseverance in it, but also their <i>unity</i> and affection among themselves. Some understand the word as expressing their <i>liberality</i> to the apostle, and to the Gospel in general; for the term may not only be applied to communion among themselves, but to <i>communications</i> to others. This sense, though followed by <i>Chrysostom</i> and <i>Theophylact</i>, does not appear to be the best; though we know it to be a fact that they were liberal in supplying the apostle's necessities, and, no doubt, in ministering to the support of others.</p>
