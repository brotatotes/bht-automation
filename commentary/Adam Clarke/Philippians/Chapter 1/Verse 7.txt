<p>Verse 7. <i><b>It is meet for me to think this</b></i> — εστι δικαιον. It is just that I should think so, because I have you in my heart-you live in my warmest love and most affectionate remembrance.</p>
<p><i><b>Inasmuch as both in my bonds</b></i> — Because you have set your hearts upon me in my bonds, sending Epaphroditus to minister to me in my necessities, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>, and contributing of your own substance to me, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:14">Philippians 4:14</span>, sending once and again to me while I was in bonds for the defence of the faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15">Philippians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span>; those things which being <i>a sweet savour, a sacrifice well pleasing and acceptable to</i> <i>God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span>, confirm my hope concerning you; especially when I find you yet standing firm under the like afflictions, <i>having the</i> <i>same conflict which ye saw in me</i>, when I was among you, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:12">Acts 16:12</span>, &amp;c., <i>and now hear to be in me</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:30">Philippians 1:30</span>. <i>Whitby</i>.</p>
