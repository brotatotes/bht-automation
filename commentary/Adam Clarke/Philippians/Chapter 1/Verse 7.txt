Verse 7. It is meet for me to think this — εστι δικαιον. It is just that I should think so, because I have you in my heart-you live in my warmest love and most affectionate remembrance.Inasmuch as both in my bonds — Because you have set your hearts upon me in my bonds, sending Epaphroditus to minister to me in my necessities, Philippians 2:25, and contributing of your own substance to me, Philippians 4:14, sending once and again to me while I was in bonds for the defence of the faith, Philippians 4:15; Philippians 4:16; those things which being a sweet savour, a sacrifice well pleasing and acceptable to God, Philippians 4:18, confirm my hope concerning you; especially when I find you yet standing firm under the like afflictions, having the same conflict which ye saw in me, when I was among you, Acts 16:12, &c., and now hear to be in me, Philippians 1:30. Whitby.
