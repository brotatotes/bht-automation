<p>Verse 9. <i><b>This I pray</b></i> — This is the substance of all my prayers for you, <i>that your love</i> to God, to one another, and to all mankind, <i>may abound yet more and more</i>, ετι μαλλον και μαλλον περισσευη, that it may be like a river, perpetually fed with rain and fresh streams so that it continues to swell and increase till it fills all its banks, and floods the adjacent plains.</p>
<p><i><b>In knowledge</b></i> — Of God's nature, perfections, your own duty and interest, his work upon your souls, and his great designs in the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>And</b></i><b> in </b><i><b>all judgment</b></i> — Και πασῃ αισθησει· In all <i>spiritual</i> or <i>moral feeling</i>; that you may at once have the clearest perception and the fullest enjoyment of those things which concern your salvation; that ye may not only know but <i>feel</i> that you are of God, by the Spirit which he has given you; and that your feeling may become more exercised in Divine things, so that it may he increasingly <i>sensible</i> and <i>refined</i>.</p>
