<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>. <i><b>If</b></i><b> there be </b><i><b>therefore any consolation</b></i> — The ει, <i>if,</i> does not express any <i>doubt</i> here, but on the contrary is to be considered as a <i>strong affirmation</i>; as <i>there is</i> consolation in Christ, as there is comfort of love, c.</p>
<p>The word παρακλησις, translated here <i>consolation</i>, is in other places rendered <i>exhortation</i>, and is by several critics understood so here as if he had said: If <i>exhorting</i> you in the name of Christ have any influence with you, c. It is extremely difficult to give the force of these expressions they contain a torrent of most affecting eloquence, the apostle pouring out his whole heart to a people whom with all his heart he loved, and who were worthy of the love even of an apostle.</p>
<p><i><b>If any comfort of love</b></i> — If the followers of Christ, by giving proofs of their ardent love to each other in cases of distress, alleviate the sufferings of the persecuted;</p>
<p><i><b>If any fellowship of the Spirit</b></i> — If there be an intimate relation established among all Christians, by their being made mutual partakers of the holy Ghost;</p>
<p><i><b>If any bowels and mercies</b></i> — If you, as persons whom I have brought to God at the hazard of my life, feel sympathetic tenderness for me now, in a farther state of suffering;</p>
