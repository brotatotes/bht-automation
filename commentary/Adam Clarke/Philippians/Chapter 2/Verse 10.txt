<p>Verse 10. <i><b>That at the name of Jesus every knee should how</b></i> — That all human beings should consider themselves redeemed unto God by his blood, and look for an application of this redemption price; and that all who are saved from their sin should acknowledge him the author of their salvation. In a word, that παν επουρανιων, all the <i>spirits of just men made perfect</i>, now in a state of <i>blessedness</i>; και επιγειων, all human beings still in their state of <i>probation on earth</i>; και καταχθονιων, and all that are in the <i>shades below</i>, who have, through their own fault, died without having received his salvation; should acknowledge him.</p>
