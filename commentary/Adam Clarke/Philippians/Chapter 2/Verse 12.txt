<p>Verse 12. <i><b>As ye have always obeyed</b></i> — Continue to act on the same <i>principles</i> and from the same <i>motives</i>; having the <i>same</i> <i>disposition</i> which was in Christ; labouring so as to promote his glory.</p>
<p><i><b>Work out your own salvation</b></i> — Go on, walking by the same rule, and minding the same thing, till your salvation be completed: till, filled with love to God and man, ye walk unblamably in all his testimonies, having your fruit unto holiness, and your end everlasting life.</p>
<p><i><b>With fear and trembling</b></i> — Considering the <i>difficulty</i> of the <i>work</i>, and the <i>danger</i> of <i>miscarriage</i>. If you do not watch, pray and continually depend on God, your enemies will surprise you, and your light and life will become extinct; and then consider what an awful account you must give to Him whose Spirit ye have grieved, and of whose glory ye have come short.</p>
