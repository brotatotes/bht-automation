<p>Verse 13. <i><b>For it is God which worketh in you</b></i> — Every holy purpose, pious resolution, good word, and good work, must come from him; ye must be <i>workers together with him</i>, that ye receive not his grace in vain; <i>because he worketh in you</i>, therefore work with him, and work out your own salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>To will and to do</b></i> — το θελειν και το ενεργειν. The <i>power</i> to <i>will</i> and the <i>power</i> to <i>act</i> must necessarily come from God, who is the author both of the <i>soul</i> and <i>body</i>, and of all their powers and energies, but the <i>act</i> of <i>volition</i> and the <i>act</i> of <i>working</i> come from the <i>man</i>. God gives <i>power</i> to will, man wills through that power; God gives <i>power</i> to <i>act</i>, and <i>man</i> acts through that power. Without the <i>power</i> to <i>will</i>, man can <i>will nothing</i>; without the <i>power</i> to <i>work</i>, man can <i>do nothing</i>. God neither wills <i>for</i> man, nor <i>works</i> in <i>man's stead</i>, but he furnishes him with power to do both; he is therefore accountable to God for these powers.</p>
<p>Because God works in them the power to will and the power to do, therefore the apostle exhorts them <i>to work out their own</i> <i>salvation</i>; most manifestly showing that the <i>use</i> of the powers of <i>volition</i> and <i>action</i> belongs to <i>themselves</i>. They cannot do God's work, they cannot produce in themselves a power <i>to will and to do</i>; and God will not do their work, <i>he</i> will not work out <i>their</i> salvation <i>with fear and trembling</i>.</p>
<p>Though men have grievously puzzled themselves with questions relative to the <i>will</i> and <i>power</i> of the human being; yet no case can be plainer than that which the apostle lays down here: the <i>power</i> to <i>will</i> and <i>do</i> comes from GOD; the <i>use</i> of that power belongs to <i>man</i>. He that has not got this power can neither will nor work; he that has this power can do both. But it does not necessarily follow that he who has these powers will use them; the <i>possession</i> of the powers does not necessarily imply the <i>use</i> of those powers, because a man might have them, and not use or abuse them; therefore the apostle exhorts: <i>Work out your own salvation</i>.</p>
<p>This is a general exhortation; it may be applied to all men, for to all it is applicable, there not being a rational being on the face of the earth, who has not from God both <i>power</i> to <i>will</i> and <i>act</i> in the things which concern his salvation. Hence the <i>accountableness of man</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>good pleasure.</b></i> — Every good is freely given of God; no man <i>deserves</i> any thing from him; and as it <i>pleaseth</i> him, so he deals out to men those <i>measures</i> of <i>mental</i> and <i>corporeal</i> energy which he sees to be necessary; giving to some <i>more</i>, to others <i>less</i>, but to all what is sufficient for their salvation.</p>
