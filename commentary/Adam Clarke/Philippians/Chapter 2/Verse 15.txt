<p>Verse 15. <i><b>That ye may be blameless</b></i> — In yourselves, and <i>harmless</i> to others.</p>
<p><i><b>The sons of God</b></i> — Showing by your holy conduct that ye are partakers of the <i>Divine nature</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Without rebuke</b></i> — Persons against whom no charge of transgression can justly be laid.</p>
<p><i><b>A crooked and perverse</b></i> — Probably referring to the <i>Jews</i>, who were the chief opponents and the most virulent enemies which the Christian Church had.</p>
<p><i><b>Among whom ye shine</b></i> — Be like the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i>; bless even the perverse and disobedient by your light and splendour. Let your light shine before men; some will walk in that light, and by its shining God will be glorified. It is evident that the apostle, by φωστηρες εν κοσμω, <i>lights in the world</i>, refers to the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i> particularly, and perhaps to the <i>heavenly bodies</i> in general.</p>
