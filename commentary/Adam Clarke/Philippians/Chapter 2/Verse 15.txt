Verse 15. That ye may be blameless — In yourselves, and harmless to others.The sons of God — Showing by your holy conduct that ye are partakers of the Divine nature.Without rebuke — Persons against whom no charge of transgression can justly be laid.A crooked and perverse — Probably referring to the Jews, who were the chief opponents and the most virulent enemies which the Christian Church had.Among whom ye shine — Be like the sun and moon; bless even the perverse and disobedient by your light and splendour. Let your light shine before men; some will walk in that light, and by its shining God will be glorified. It is evident that the apostle, by φωστηρες εν κοσμω, lights in the world, refers to the sun and moon particularly, and perhaps to the heavenly bodies in general.
