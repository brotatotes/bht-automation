<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Holding forth the word of life</b></i> — An allusion, some think, to those <i>towers</i> which were built at the entrance of harbours, on which <i>fires</i> were kept during the night to direct ships into the port. Genuine Christians, by their holy lives and conversation, are the means of <i>directing</i> others, not only how to escape those <i>dangers</i> to which they are exposed on the tempestuous ocean of human life, but also of leading them into the <i>haven</i> of <i>eternal safety</i> and <i>rest</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That I have not run in vain</b></i> — This appears to be a part of the same metaphor; and alludes to the case of a <i>weather-beaten</i> mariner who has been <i>long tossed</i> on a tempestuous sea, in <i>hazy weather</i> and <i>dark nights</i>, who has been obliged to run on different <i>tacks</i>, and <i>labour</i> intensely to keep his ship from <i>foundering</i>, but is at last, by the assistance of the <i>luminous fire</i> on the top of the <i>tower</i>, directed safely into port. Live so to glorify God and do good to men, that it shall appear that I have not run and laboured in vain for your salvation.</p>
