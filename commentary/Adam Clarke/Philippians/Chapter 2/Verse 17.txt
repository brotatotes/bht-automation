<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and</b></i><b> </b><i><b>service</b></i> — The metaphor appears to be still carried on. As it was customary for the weather-beaten mariner, when he had gained his port, to offer a sacrifice, θυσια, to God, of some particular animal which he had vowed while in his state of danger, and this was considered to be a <i>religious service</i>, λειτουργια. the apostle, pursuing the idea, states himself to be willing to become the <i>libation</i>, (for so much the word σπενδομαι imports,) that was to be <i>poured upon the sacrifice</i>. Parkhurst observes that the apostle compares the faith of the Philippians to the sacrificial victim, and <i>his own blood shed in martyrdom</i> to the libation, i.e. <i>the</i> <i>wine poured out</i> on occasion of the sacrifice. <i>Raphelius</i> observes that <i>Arrian</i> uses the phrase σπενδειν επι τη θυσια for <i>pouring out</i> <i>the libation after the sacrifice</i>. The apostle <i>had</i> guided them safely into port; their faith in the atoning death of Christ was their sacrifice; and he was willing that his blood in martyrdom should be poured out as a libation on that sacrificial offering.</p>
