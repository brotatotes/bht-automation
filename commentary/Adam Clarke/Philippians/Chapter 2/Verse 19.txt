<p>Verse 19. <i><b>But I trust in the Lord Jesus</b></i> — He is governor and disposer of all events, being above all principality and power; and I humbly confide in his power and goodness that I shall be a little longer spared to visit you again, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:24">Philippians 2:24</span>, and to be able to send Timothy shortly to you.</p>
<p><i><b>When I know your state.</b></i> — By the correct information which I shall receive from Timothy.</p>
