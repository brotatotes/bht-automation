Verse 22. Ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me â€” The Philippians had full proof of the affectionate attachment of Timothy to Paul, for he had laboured with him there, as we learn from Acts 16:1-3; Acts 17:14; and we find from what is said here that Timothy was not a servant to the apostle, but that he had served with him. They both laboured together in the word and doctrine; for apostles and Christian bishops, in those times, laboured as hard as their deacons. There were no sinecures; every one was a labourer, every labourer had his work, and every workman had his wages.
