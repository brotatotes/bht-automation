<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>father, he hath served with me</b></i> â€” The Philippians had <i>full proof</i> of the affectionate attachment of Timothy to Paul, for he had laboured with him there, as we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1-3">Acts 16:1-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>; and we find from what is said here that Timothy was not a servant <i>to</i> the apostle, but that he had served <i>with</i> him. They both laboured together in the word and doctrine; for <i>apostles</i> and Christian <i>bishops</i>, in those times, laboured as hard as their <i>deacons</i>. There were no <i>sinecures</i>; every one was a <i>labourer</i>, every labourer had his <i>work</i>, and every <i>workman</i> had his <i>wages</i>.</p>
