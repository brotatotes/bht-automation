<p>4. He was <i>their apostle</i>-a man whom God had honoured with apostolical gifts, apostolical graces, and apostolical fruits; and,</p>
<p>5. He was an <i>affectionate friend</i> to the apostle; knew his soul in adversity, acknowledged him in prison, and contributed to his comfort and support.</p>
