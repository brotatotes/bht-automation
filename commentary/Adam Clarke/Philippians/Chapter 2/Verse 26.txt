<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Ye had heard that he had been sick.</b></i> â€” "In this passage," says Dr. Paley, "no intimation is given that the recovery of Epaphroditus was <i>miraculous</i>, it is plainly spoken of as a <i>natural event</i>. This instance, together with that in the Second Epistle to Timothy, <i>Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick</i>, affords a proof that the power of performing cures, and, by parity of reason, of working other miracles, was a power which only visited the apostles occasionally, and did not at all depend upon their own will. Paul undoubtedly would have healed Epaphroditus if he could; nor would he have left Trophimus at Miletum sick, had the power of working cures awaited his disposal. Had this epistle been a forgery, forgery on this occasion would not have spared a <i>miracle</i>; much less would it have introduced St. Paul professing the utmost anxiety for the safety of his friend, yet acknowledging himself unable to help him, which he does almost expressly in the case of Trophimus, <i>Him have I left sick</i>; and virtually in the passage before us, in which he felicitates himself on the recovery of Epaphroditus in terms which almost exclude the supposition of any supernatural means being used to effect it. This is a reverse which nothing but <i>truth</i> would have imposed." <i>Horae Paulinae</i>, page 234.</p>
