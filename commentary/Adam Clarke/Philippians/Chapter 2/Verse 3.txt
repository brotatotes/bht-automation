Verse Philippians 2:3. Let nothing be done through strife — Never be opposed to each other; never act from separate interests; ye are all brethren, and of one body; therefore let every member feel and labour for the welfare of the whole. And, in the exercise of your different functions, and in the use of your various gifts, do nothing so as to promote your own reputation, separately considered from the comfort, honour, and advantage of all.But in lowliness of mind — Have always an humbling view of yourselves, and this will lead you to prefer others to yourselves; for, as you know your own secret defects, charity will lead you to suppose that your brethren are more holy, and more devoted to God than you are; and they will think the same of you, their secret defects also being known only to themselves.
