<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:4">Philippians 2:4</span>. <i><b>Look not every man on his own things</b></i> â€” Do nothing through self-interest in the things of God; nor arrogate to yourselves <i>gifts, graces</i>, and <i>fruits</i>, which belong to <i>others</i>; ye are all called to promote God's glory and the salvation of men. Labour for this, and every one shall receive the honour that comes from God; and let each rejoice to see another, whom God may be pleased to use in a <i>special</i> way, acquiring much reputation by the successful application of his talents to the great work.</p>
