<p>Verse 5. <i><b>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Jesus</b></i> â€” Christ laboured to promote no separate interest; as man he studied to promote the glory of God, and the welfare and salvation of the human race. See then that ye have the same <i>disposition</i> that was in Jesus: he was ever <i>humble, loving, patient</i>, and <i>laborious</i>; his meat and drink was to do the will of his Father, and to finish his work.</p>
