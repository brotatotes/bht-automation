<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Who, being in the form of God</b></i> — This verse has been the subject of much criticism, and some controversy. Dr. <i>Whitby</i> has, perhaps, on the whole, spoken best on this point; but his arguments are too diffuse to be admitted here. Dr. <i>Macknight</i> has abridged the words of Dr. <i>Whitby</i>, and properly observes that, "As the apostle is speaking of what Christ <i>was before he took the form</i> <i>of a servant</i>, the <i>form of God</i>, of which he divested himself when he became man, cannot be any thing which he <i>possessed</i> during his <i>incarnation</i> or in his divested state; consequently neither the opinion of <i>Erasmus</i>, that the form of God consisted in those <i>sparks</i> <i>of divinity</i> by which Christ, during his incarnation, manifested his Godhead, nor the opinion of the <i>Socinians</i>, that it consisted in the <i>power of working miracles</i>, is well founded; for Christ did not divest himself either of one or the other, but possessed both all the time of his public ministry. In like manner, the opinion of those who, by the <i>form of God</i> understand the <i>Divine nature</i> and the government of the world, cannot be admitted; since Christ, when he became <i>man</i>, could not divest himself of the nature of God; and with respect to the government of the world, we are led, by what the apostle tells, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>, to believe that he did not part with even that; but, in his divested state, still continued <i>to</i> <i>uphold all things by the word of his power</i>. By the <i>form of God</i> we are rather to understand that <i>visible, glorious light</i> in which the Deity is said to dwell, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</span>, and by which he manifested himself to the patriarchs of old, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+5:22">Deuteronomy 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+5:24">Deuteronomy 5:24</span>; which was commonly accompanied with a <i>numerous retinue of angels</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:17">Psalms 68:17</span>, and which in Scripture is called The <i>Similitude</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8">Numbers 12:8</span>; The <i>Face</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+31:16">Psalms 31:16</span>: The <i>Presence</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:15">Exodus 33:15</span>; and The <i>Shape</i> of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span>. This interpretation is supported by the term μορφη, <i>form</i>, here used, which signifies a person's external <i>shape</i> or <i>appearance</i>, and not his <i>nature</i> or <i>essence</i>. Thus we are told, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:12">Mark 16:12</span>, that Jesus appeared to his disciples in another μορφη, <i>shape</i>, or <i>form</i>. And, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span>, μετεμορφωθη, <i>he was transfigured before them</i>-his outward <i>appearance</i> or <i>form</i> was <i>changed</i>. Farther this interpretation agrees with the fact: the <i>form of God</i>, that is, his <i>visible glory</i>, and the <i>attendance of</i> <i>angels</i>, as above described, the Son of God enjoyed with his Father before the world was, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; and on that as on other accounts he is the <i>brightness of the Father's glory</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>. Of this he divested himself when he became flesh; but, having resumed it after his ascension, he will come with it in the human nature to judge the world; so he told his disciples, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>: <i>The Son of man will come in the glory of his Father, with his</i> <i>angels</i>, c,. Lastly, this sense of μορφη θεου, is confirmed by the meaning of μορθη δουλου, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span> which evidently denotes the <i>appearance</i> and <i>behaviour</i> of a <i>servant</i> or <i>bondman</i>, and not the <i>essence</i> of such a person." See <i>Whitby</i> and <i>Macknight</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thought it not robbery to be equal with God</b></i> — If we take these words as they stand here, their meaning is, that, as he was from the <i>beginning</i> in the same infinite glory with the Father, to appear in <i>time</i>-during his humiliation, as God and equal with the Father, was no encroachment on the Divine prerogative; for, as he had an <i>equality</i> of <i>nature</i>, he had an <i>equality</i> of <i>rights</i>.</p>
<p>But the word αρπαγμον, which we translate <i>robbery</i>, has been supposed to imply <i>a thing eagerly to be seized, coveted, or</i> <i>desired</i>; and on this interpretation the passage has been translated: <i>Who, being in the form of God, did not think it a</i> <i>matter to be earnestly desired to appear equal to God; but made</i> <i>himself of no reputation</i>, c. However the word be translated, it does not affect the eternal Deity of our Lord. Though he was from eternity in the form of God-possessed of the same glory, yet he thought it right to <i>veil</i> this glory, and not to <i>appear with it</i> among the children of men and therefore he was made in the <i>likeness of men</i>, and took upon him the <i>form</i> or <i>appearance</i> of a <i>servant</i>: and, had he retained the appearance of this ineffable glory, it would, in many respects, have prevented him from accomplishing the work which God gave him to do; and his <i>humiliation</i>, as necessary to the salvation of men, could not have been complete. On this account I prefer this sense of the word αρπαγμον before that given in our text, which does not agree so well with the other expressions in the context. In this sense the word is used by <i>Heliodorus</i>, in his <i>AEthiopics</i>, lib. vii. cap. 19, &amp;c., which passage <i>Whitby</i> has produced, and on which he has given a considerable paraphrase. The reader who wishes to examine this subject more particularly, may have recourse to <i>Heliodorus</i> as above, or to the notes of Dr. <i>Whitby</i> on the passage.</p>
