<p>Verse 8. <i><b>And being found in fashion as a man</b></i> — Και σχηματι εὑρεθεις ὡς ανθρωπος. This clause should be joined to the preceding, and thus translated: <i>Being made in the likeness of man,</i> <i>and was found in fashion as a man</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He humbled himself</b></i> — Laid himself as low as possible:</p>
<p>1. In <i>emptying himself-laying aside the effulgence</i> of his <i>glory</i>.</p>
<p>2. In being <i>incarnate</i>-taking upon him the <i>human form</i>.</p>
<p>3. In becoming a <i>servant</i>-assuming the <i>lowest</i> innocent character, that of being the servant of all.</p>
<p>4. In condescending to <i>die</i>, to which he was not naturally liable, as having <i>never sinned</i>, and therefore had a right in his human nature to immortality, without passing under the empire of death.</p>
<p>5. In condescending, not only to death, but to the <i>lowest</i> and most <i>ignominious kind of death</i>, the <i>death of the</i> <i>cross</i>; the punishment of the meanest of slaves and worst of felons.</p>
<p>What must sin have been in the sight of God, when it required such abasement in Jesus Christ to make an atonement for it, and <i>undo</i> its influence and malignity!</p>
