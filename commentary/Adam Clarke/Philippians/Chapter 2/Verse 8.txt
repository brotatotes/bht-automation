Verse 8. And being found in fashion as a man — Και σχηματι εὑρεθεις ὡς ανθρωπος. This clause should be joined to the preceding, and thus translated: Being made in the likeness of man, and was found in fashion as a man.He humbled himself — Laid himself as low as possible:1. In emptying himself-laying aside the effulgence of his glory.2. In being incarnate-taking upon him the human form.3. In becoming a servant-assuming the lowest innocent character, that of being the servant of all.4. In condescending to die, to which he was not naturally liable, as having never sinned, and therefore had a right in his human nature to immortality, without passing under the empire of death.5. In condescending, not only to death, but to the lowest and most ignominious kind of death, the death of the cross; the punishment of the meanest of slaves and worst of felons.What must sin have been in the sight of God, when it required such abasement in Jesus Christ to make an atonement for it, and undo its influence and malignity!
