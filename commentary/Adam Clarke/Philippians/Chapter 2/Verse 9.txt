<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him</b></i> — If by his <i>humiliation</i> he has merited pardon and final salvation for the whole world, is it to be wondered that the human body, in which this fulness of the Godhead dwelt, and in which the punishment due to our sins was borne upon the tree, should be exalted above all human and all created beings? And this is the fact; <i>for he hath</i> <i>given him a name</i>, το ονομα, <i>the</i> name, <i>which is above every</i> <i>name</i>: το is prefixed to ονομα here by ABC, 17, <i>Origen,</i> <i>Dionysius Alexandrinus, Eusebius, Cyril</i>, and <i>Procopius</i>. This makes it much more emphatic. According to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-21">Ephesians 1:20-21</span>, the man Christ Jesus <i>is exalted to the right hand of God, far above all</i> <i>principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name</i> <i>that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is</i> <i>to come</i>. From which it appears that no creature of God is so far exalted and so glorious as the <i>man</i> Christ Jesus, <i>human nature</i> being in him dignified infinitely beyond the <i>angelic nature</i>; and that this nature has an authority and pre-eminence which no being, either in heaven or earth, enjoys. In a word, as man was in the beginning at the head of all the creatures of God, Jesus Christ, by assuming human nature, suffering and dying in it, has raised it to its <i>pristine state</i>. And this is probably what is here meant by this high exaltation of Christ, and giving him a name which is above every name. But if we refer to any particular <i>epithet</i>, then the name JESUS or <i>Saviour</i> must be that which is intended; as no being either in heaven or earth can possess this name as he who is the <i>Redeemer</i> of the world does, for he is the only <i>Saviour</i>; none has or could <i>redeem</i> us to God but he; and throughout eternity he will ever appear as the sole <i>Saviour</i> of the human race. Hence, before his birth, Gabriel stated that <i>his name should be called</i> JESUS; giving for reason, <i>he shall</i> SAVE <i>his people from their</i> <i>sins</i>. The <i>qualifications</i> of the Saviour of the world were so extraordinary, the <i>redeeming acts</i> so stupendous, and the <i>result</i> of all so glorious both to God and man, that it is impossible to conceive a higher <i>name</i> or <i>title</i> than that of JESUS, or <i>Saviour of</i> <i>the world</i>.</p>
