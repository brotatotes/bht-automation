<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:1">Philippians 3:1</span>. <i><b>Rejoice in the Lord.</b></i> — Be always <i>happy</i>; but let that happiness be such as you derive from <i>the Lord</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To write the same things</b></i> — He means those which he had formerly preached to them or to other Churches, for he had but one Gospel; and we may rest assured that the doctrine of this epistle was the same with his preaching.</p>
<p><i><b>For you</b></i><b> it is </b><i><b>safe.</b></i> — It is much better to have these Divine things committed to <i>writing</i> than confided to <i>memory</i>. By the <i>latter</i> they may be either lost or corrupted, by the <i>former</i> they will be preserved.</p>
