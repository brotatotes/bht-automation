<p>Verse 10. <i><b>That I may know him</b></i> — To be the true and promised Messiah, and <i>experience</i> all that salvation which he has bought by his blood.</p>
<p><i><b>The power of his resurrection</b></i> — In having this <i>body of my</i> <i>humiliation</i> raised from death, and <i>made like unto his glorious</i> <i>body</i>. This seems to be the sole meaning of the apostle; for it is in virtue of Christ's resurrection that we are to be raised incorruptible and immortal.</p>
<p><i><b>And the fellowship of his sufferings</b></i> — Christ died, not only as a <i>victim</i> for sin, but as a <i>martyr</i> to the truth. No creature can have <i>fellowship</i> with him in his <i>vicarious</i> sufferings; as a <i>martyr</i> to the truth, St. Paul wished to imitate him. Not only in the apostle, but in the primitive Christians generally, there seems to have been a strong desire after martyrdom.</p>
