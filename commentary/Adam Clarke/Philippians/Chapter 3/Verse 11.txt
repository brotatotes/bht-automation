<p>Verse 11. <i><b>The resurrection of the dead.</b></i> — That is, the resurrection of those who, having died in the Lord, rise to glory and honour; and hence St. Paul uses a peculiar word which occurs no where else in the New Testament, εξαναστασις. The words, as they stand in the best MSS., are as follow: εις την εξαναστασιν την εκ νεκρων, <i>to that resurrection which is of the dead</i>. This glorious resurrection, and perhaps peculiarly glorious in the case of <i>martyrs</i>, is that to which St. Paul aspired. The word αναστασις signifies the <i>resurrection</i> in general, both of the just and unjust; εξαναστασις may signify that of the <i>blessed</i> only.</p>
