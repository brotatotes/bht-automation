<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Not as though I had already attained</b></i> — Ουχ ὁτι ηδη ελαβον· <i>For I have not yet received</i> the prize; I am not glorified, for I have not finished my course; and I have a <i>conflict</i> still to maintain, and the issue will prove whether I should be crowned. From the beginning of the 11th to the end of the 17th verse there is one continued allusion to the contests at the Olympic games; exercises with which, and their laws, the Philippians were well acquainted. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11-17">Philippians 3:11-17</span></p>
<p><i><b>Either were already perfect</b></i> — Η ηδη τετελειωμαι· <i>Nor am I yet</i> <i>perfect</i>; I am not yet crowned, in consequence of having suffered martyrdom. I am quite satisfied that the apostle here alludes to the Olympic games, and the word τετελειωμαι is the proof; for τελειωθηναι is spoken of those who have <i>completed their race,</i> <i>reached the goal</i>, and are <i>honoured</i> with the <i>prize</i>. Thus it is used by <i>Philo</i>, Allegoriar. lib. iii. page 101, edit. Mangey: Ποτε ουν, ω ψυχη, μαλιστα νεκροφορειν (νικοφορειν) σεαυτην ὑποληψη· αραγε ουχ ὁταν τελειωθῃς και βραβειων και στεφανων αξιωθῃς "When is it, O soul, that thou shalt appear to have the victory? Is it not when thou <i>shalt be perfected</i>, (have completed thy course by death,) and be honoured with prizes and crowns?"</p>
<p>That τελειωσις signified <i>martyrdom</i>, we learn most expressly from <i>Clemens Alexand</i>., Stromata, lib. iii. page 480, where he has these remarkable words:-</p>
<p>So <i>Basil</i> the great, Hom. in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:13">Psalms 116:13</span>:</p>
<p>And in <i>Balsamon</i>, Can. i. Ancyran., page 764:</p>
<p>St. Paul, therefore, is not speaking here of any <i>deficiency</i> in his own grace, or spiritual state he does not mean by not being yet <i>perfect</i>, that he had a <i>body of sin and death</i> cleaving to him, and was still polluted with <i>indwelling sin</i>, as some have most falsely and dangerously imagined; he speaks of his not having terminated his course by martyrdom, which he knew would sooner or later be the case. This he considered as the τελειωσις, or <i>perfection</i>, of his whole career, and was led to view every thing as <i>imperfect</i> or <i>unfinished</i> till this had taken place.</p>
<p><i><b>But I follow after</b></i> — διοωκω δε. <i>But I pursue</i>; several are gone before me in this glorious way, and have obtained the crown of martyrdom; I am hurrying after them.</p>
<p><i><b>That I may apprehend</b></i> — That I may receive those blessings to which I am called by Christ Jesus. There is still an allusion here to the <i>stadium</i>, and <i>exercises</i> there: the apostle considers Christ as the <i>brabeus</i>, or judge in the games, who proclaimed the victor, and distributed the prizes; and he represents himself as being introduced by this very <i>brabeus</i>, or judge, into the contest; and this <i>brabeus</i> brought him in with the design to crown him, if he contended faithfully. To complete this faithful contention is what he has in view; that he may <i>apprehend</i>, or <i>lay hold</i> on that for which he had been <i>apprehended</i>, or <i>taken by the hand</i> by Christ who had converted, strengthened, and endowed him with apostolical powers, that he might fight the good fight of faith, and <i>lay hold</i> on eternal life.</p>
