<p>Verse 13. <i><b>I count not myself to have apprehended</b></i> — Whatever gifts, graces, or honours I may have received from Jesus Christ, I consider every thing as incomplete till I have finished my course, got this crown, and have my body raised and fashioned after his glorious body.</p>
<p><b>This </b><i><b>one thing</b></i><b> I do</b>] This is the concern, as it is the sole business, of my life.</p>
<p><i><b>Forgetting those things which are behind</b></i> — My conduct is not regulated nor influenced by that of others; I consider my <i>calling</i>, my <i>Master</i>, my <i>work</i>, and my <i>end</i>. If others think they have time to loiter or trifle, I have none: <i>time</i> is <i>flying; eternity</i> is at <i>hand</i>; and my <i>all</i> is at <i>stake</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Reaching forth</b></i> — The Greek word επεκτεινομενος points out the strong exertions made in the <i>race</i>; every muscle and nerve is exerted, and he puts forth every particle of his strength in <i>running</i>. He was running for life, and running for his life.</p>
