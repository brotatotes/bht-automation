<p>Verse 14. <i><b>I press toward the mark</b></i> — κατα σκοπον διωκω. <i>I</i> <i>pursue along the line</i>; this is a reference to the <i>white line</i> that marked the ground in the stadium, from the <i>starting</i> place to the <i>goal</i>, on which the <i>runners</i> were obliged to keep their eye fixed; for they who transgressed or <i>went beyond</i> this line did not <i>run</i> <i>lawfully</i>, and were not <i>crowned</i>, even though they got <i>first</i> to the goal. See the concluding observations on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p>What is called σκοπος, <i>mark</i> or <i>scope</i>, here, is called κανων the <i>line</i>, i.e. the <i>marked line</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:16">Philippians 3:16</span>. When it was said to <i>Diogenes</i>, the cynic, "Thou art now an old man, rest from thy labours;" to this he answered: Ει δολιχον εδραμον, προς τῳ τελει εδει με ανειναι, και μη μαλλον επιτειναι; "If I have run long in the race, will it become me to <i>slacken</i> my pace when come near the end; should I not rather <i>stretch forward</i>?" <i>Diog. Laert</i>., lib. vi. cap. 2. sec. 6.</p>
<p><i><b>For the prize of the high calling of God</b></i> — The reward which God from above calls me, by Christ Jesus, to receive. The apostle still keeps in view his crown of martyrdom and his glorious resurrection.</p>
