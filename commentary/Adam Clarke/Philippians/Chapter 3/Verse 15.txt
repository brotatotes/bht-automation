<p>Verse 15. <i><b>As many as be perfect</b></i> — As many as are <i>thoroughly</i> <i>instructed</i> in Divine things, who have cast off all dependence on the law and on every other system for salvation, and who discern God calling them from <i>above</i> by Christ Jesus; <i>be thus minded</i>; be intensely in earnest for eternal life, nor ever halt till the race is finished.</p>
<p>The word τελειοι, <i>perfect</i>, is taken here in the same sense in which it is taken <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span>:- <i>Be not</i> CHILDREN <i>in understanding-but in understanding be ye</i> MEN, τελειοι γινεσθε, <i>be ye perfect</i>-thoroughly instructed, deeply experienced. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>:- <i>We speak wisdom among the perfect</i>, εν τοις τελειοις, among those who are <i>fully instructed, adults</i> in Christian knowledge. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>:- <i>Till we all come-unto a perfect man</i>, εις ανδρα τελειον, to the state of <i>adults</i> in Christianity. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>:- <i>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age</i>, τελειων, <i>the perfect</i>-those who are thoroughly instructed and experienced in Divine things. <i>Let us therefore</i>, says the apostle, <i>as many as be</i> <i>perfect</i>-as have entered fully into the spirit and design of the Gospel, <i>be thus minded</i>, viz. <i>Forget the things which are behind,</i> <i>and stretch forward along the mark for the prize</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>If in any thing ye be otherwise minded</b></i> — If ye have not yet entered into the full spirit and design of this Gospel, if any of you have yet remaining any doubts relative to Jewish ordinances, or their expediency in Christianity, <i>God shall reveal even this</i> <i>unto you</i>; for while you are sincere and upright, God will take care that ye shall have full instruction in these Divine things.</p>
