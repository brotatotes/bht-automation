<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Whereto we have already attained</b></i> — Let us not lose that part of the race which we have already run, <i>let us walk by</i> <i>the same rule</i>-let us keep the <i>white line</i> continually in view, <i>let</i> <i>us mind the same thing</i>, always considering the glorious prize which is held out by God through Christ Jesus to animate and encourage us.</p>
<p>The MSS., versions and fathers of the Alexandrian <i>recension</i> or <i>edition</i>, and which are supposed by <i>Griesbach</i> and others to contain the purest text, omit the words κανονι το αυτο προνειν, and read the verse thus: <i>Whereunto we have already attained let us walk</i>; or, <i>according to what we have already attained, let us regulate</i> <i>our life</i>, There is so much disagreement about the above words in the MSS., c., that most critics consider them as a sort of gloss, which never made an original part of the text. Dr. <i>White</i> says, <i>Certissime</i> delenda "Most certainly they should be obliterated."</p>
