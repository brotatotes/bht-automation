<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For many walk</b></i>, c.] The Judaizing teachers continue to preach, who wish to incorporate circumcision, and other ordinances of the law, with the Gospel.</p>
<p>They are <i><b>the enemies of the cross of Christ</b></i> â€” They rather attribute justification to the <i>Levitical sacrifices</i>, than to the <i>sacrificial death</i> of Christ and thus they are enemies to that cross, and will not suffer persecution for its sake. They please the world, and are in no danger of reproach.</p>
