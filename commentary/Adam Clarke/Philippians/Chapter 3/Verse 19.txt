<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Whose end</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>destruction</b></i> â€” This is the <i>issue</i> of their doctrine and of their conduct. They are here described by <i>three</i> characters:</p>
<p>1. <i>Their god</i> is their <i>belly</i>-they live not in any reference to <i>eternity</i>; their religion is for <i>time</i>; they make a gain of godliness; and live only to <i>eat, drink</i>, and be <i>merry</i>.</p>
<p>2. <i>Their glory is in their shame</i>-they lay it down as a proof of their address, that they can fare sumptuously every day, in consequence of preaching a doctrine which flatters the passions of their hearers.</p>
<p>3. They <i>mind earthly things</i>-their whole study and attention are taken up with earthly matters; they are given to the <i>flesh</i> and its <i>lusts</i>; they have no spirituality, nor do they believe that there is or can be any intercourse between God and the souls of men. But their <i>lasciviousness</i> and <i>uncleanness</i> seem to be principally intended. See <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p>Despicable as these men were, the apostle's heart was deeply pained on their account:</p>
<p>1. Because they held and taught a false creed;</p>
<p>2. Because they perverted many by that teaching; and,</p>
<p>3. Because they themselves were perishing through it.</p>
