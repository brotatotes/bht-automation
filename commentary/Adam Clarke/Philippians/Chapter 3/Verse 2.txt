<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span>. <i><b>Beware of dogs</b></i> — The <i>Jews</i>, who have here the same appellative which they formerly gave to the <i>Gentiles</i>: because the Gentiles were not included in the covenant, they called <i>them</i> DOGS; and themselves, the <i>children of the Most High</i>. Now, <i>they</i> are cast out of the covenant and the Gentiles taken in; therefore <i>they</i> are the <i>dogs</i>, and the <i>Gentiles</i> the <i>children</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Evil workers</b></i> — Judaizing teachers, who endeavoured to pervert the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>The concision.</b></i> — κατατομην. The <i>cutting</i> or <i>excision</i>; not περιτομην, the <i>circumcision</i>: the word is used by the apostle to degrade the pretensions which the Jews made to sanctity by the <i>cutting</i> in their flesh. <i>Circumcision</i> was an honourable thing, for it was a <i>sign</i> of the <i>covenant</i>; but as they now had rejected the <i>new covenant</i>, their circumcision was rendered uncircumcision, and is termed a <i>cutting</i>, by way of degradation.</p>
