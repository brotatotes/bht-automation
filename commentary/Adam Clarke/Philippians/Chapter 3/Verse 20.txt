<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Our conversation is in heaven</b></i> — Ἡμως - το πολιτευμα· <i>Our city</i>, or <i>citizenship</i>, or <i>civil rights</i>. The word properly signifies the administration, government, or form of a republic or state; and is thus used by <i>Demosthenes</i>, page 107, 25, and 262, 27. Edit. <i>Reiske</i>. It signifies also a <i>republic</i>, a <i>city</i>, or the <i>inhabitants</i> of any city or place; or a <i>society</i> of persons living in the <i>same place</i>, and under the <i>same rules</i> and <i>laws</i>. See more in <i>Schleusner</i>.</p>
<p>While those gross and Jewish teachers have no <i>city</i> but what is on <i>earth</i>; no <i>rights</i> but what are derived from their <i>secular</i> connections; no society but what is made up of men <i>like</i> <i>themselves</i>, who <i>mind earthly things</i>, and whose <i>belly is their</i> <i>god</i>, WE have a <i>heavenly city</i>, the New Jerusalem; we have <i>rights</i> and <i>privileges</i> which are <i>heavenly</i> and <i>eternal</i>; and our <i>society</i> or <i>fellowship</i> is with God the Father, Son, and Spirit, the spirits of just men made perfect, and the whole Church of the first-born. We have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts; and regard not the body, which we know must perish, but which we confidently expect shall be raised from death and corruption into a state of immortal glory.</p>
