Verse Philippians 3:3. We are the circumcision — WE, who have embraced the faith of Christ crucified, are now entered into the new covenant, and according to that new covenant, worship God in the Spirit, exulting, καυχωμενοι, making our boast of Christ Jesus, as our only Saviour, having no confidence in the flesh-in any outward rite or ceremony prescribed by the Jewish institutions.
