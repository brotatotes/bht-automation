<p>Verse 5. <i><b>Circumcised the eighth day</b></i> — This was the time that the law required the males to be circumcised; and we find, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:14">Genesis 17:14</span>, both in the <i>Samaritan</i> Pentateuch and in the <i>Septuagint</i>, though the clause is now lost out of the common Hebrew text, that <i>the male</i> <i>child, which is not circumcised the eighth day, shall be cut off</i> <i>from among his people</i>: this precept was literally observed in the case of St. Paul.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the stock of Israel</b></i> — Regularly descended from the patriarch Jacob.</p>
<p><b>Of </b><i><b>the tribe of Benjamin</b></i> — The most favourite son of that patriarch and a tribe that did not revolt with Jeroboam, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+12:21">1 Kings 12:21</span>, nor pollute the worship of God by idolatry.</p>
<p><i><b>A Hebrew of the Hebrews</b></i> — Though born in a heathen country, Tarsus, yet both my parents were Hebrews; nor has there ever been any strange blood mixed with that of our family.</p>
<p><i><b>Touching the law, a Pharisee</b></i> — One that not only received the law and the prophets as coming from God; but belonged to that <i>sect</i> which, of all others, was most scrupulously attached to it.</p>
