<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Concerning zeal</b></i> — As to my zeal for Pharisaism, I gave the fullest proof of it by persecuting the Church of Christ; and this is known to all my countrymen.</p>
<p><i><b>Touching the righteousness</b></i> — And as to that <i>plan</i> of <i>justification</i>, which justification the Jews say is to be obtained by an observance of the law, I have done every thing so conscientiously from my youth up, that in this respect I am <i>blameless</i>; and may, with more confidence than most of <i>them</i>; expect that justification which the law appears to promise.</p>
