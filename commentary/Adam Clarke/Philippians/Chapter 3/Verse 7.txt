<p>Verse 7. <i><b>But what things were gain</b></i> â€” The <i>credit</i> and <i>respect</i> which I had, as being zealously attached to the law, and to the traditions of the elders, <i>I counted loss for Christ </i>- I saw that this could stand me in no stead; that all my acts of righteousness were nothing on which I could depend for salvation; and that <i>Christ crucified</i> could alone profit me; for I found that it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sin.</p>
