<p>Verse 8. <i><b>I count all things</b></i><b> but </b><i><b>loss</b></i> — Not only my Jewish privileges, but all others of every kind; with every thing that men count valuable or gainful, or on which they usually depend for salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ</b></i> — That superior light, information, and blessedness which come through the Gospel of Jesus Christ; justification through his blood, sanctification by his Spirit, and eternal glory through his merits and intercession. These are the blessings held out to us by the Gospel, of which, and the law, Jesus Christ is the sum and substance.</p>
<p><i><b>I have suffered the loss of all things</b></i> — Some translate δι ον τα παντα εζημιωθην, <i>for whom I have thrown away all things</i>-I have made a voluntary choice of Christ, his cross, his poverty, and his reproach; and for these I have freely sacrificed all I had from the world, and all I could expect from it.</p>
<p><i><b>And do count them</b></i><b> but </b><i><b>dung</b></i> — The word σκυβαλα means the vilest dross or <i>refuse</i> of any thing; the worst excrement. The word shows how utterly insignificant and unavailing, in point of salvation, the apostle esteemed every thing but the Gospel of Jesus. With his best things he freely parted, judging them all <i>loss</i> while put in the place of Christ crucified; and Christ crucified he esteemed infinite <i>gain</i>, when compared with all the rest. Of the utter unavailableness of any thing but <i>Christ</i> to save the soul the Apostle Paul stands as an incontrovertible proof. Could the law have done any thing, the apostle must have known it. He tried, and found it vanity; he tried the Gospel system, and found it the power of God to his salvation. By <i>losing all</i> that the world calls excellent, he <i>gained</i> Christ, and endless salvation through him. Of the glorious influence of the Gospel he is an unimpeachable witness. See the concluding observations on the 9th chapter of the Acts, on the character of St. Paul. <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:43">Acts 9:43</span><i>"</i></p>
