<p>Verse 9. <i><b>And be found in him</b></i> — Be found a believer in Christ, <i>not having mine own righteousness</i>-not trusting in any thing I have done or could do, in order to my salvation; relying on no scheme of justification, set up either formerly by myself or by others.</p>
<p><i><b>But that which is through the faith of Christ</b></i> — That justification which is received by faith through the atonement made by Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>The righteousness which is of God</b></i> — God's method of justifying sinners through faith in his Son.
