<p>Verse 10. <i><b>But I rejoiced in the Lord</b></i> — Every good comes from God, either immediately from his providence or from his grace; therefore the apostle thanks God for the kindness of the Philippians towards him; for it was God that gave them the power, and directed their hearts to use it.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath flourished again</b></i> — They had helped him before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>; they had ceased for a time, and now they began again. This is evidently designed by the apostle, as the word ανεθαλετε implies, which is a metaphor taken from the <i>reviviscence</i> of flowers in <i>spring</i> which seemed dead in <i>winter</i>. For the time in which they were apparently remiss he makes a delicate apology: <i>Ye were</i> <i>careful, but ye lacked opportunity</i>; or rather ηκαιρεισθε, ye <i>had</i> <i>not ability</i>, ye <i>wanted the means</i>; as the word sometimes implies.</p>
