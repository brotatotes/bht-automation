<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Not that I speak in respect of want</b></i> — I am quite unconcerned in this respect; leaving the whole of my support, while bound for the testimony of Jesus, to the providence of God.</p>
<p><i><b>For I have learned</b></i> — I am so satisfied with the wise providence and goodness of God, that I know whatever he determines is the best; and therefore I am perfectly contented that he should govern the world in that way which seems best to his godly wisdom. How true is the proverb, <i>A contented mind is a continual feast</i>! What do we get by murmuring and complaining?</p>
