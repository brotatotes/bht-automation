<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:2">Philippians 4:2</span>. <i><b>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche</b></i> â€” These were two pious women, as it is generally supposed, who were deaconesses in the Church at Philippi, and who in some points of doctrine and discipline had disagreed. He exhorts them to be of the same mind, that is, to compose their differences; and, if they could not perfectly agree to think and let think, and to avoid all public opposition, as their dissension would strengthen the hands of the common enemy, and stumble those who were weak. But it is more likely that <i>Euodias</i> was a woman, and <i>Syntyche</i> a man, and probably the husband of <i>Euodias</i>; and that it is <i>Syntyche</i> whom the apostle calls <i>true yokefellow</i> in the next verse.</p>
