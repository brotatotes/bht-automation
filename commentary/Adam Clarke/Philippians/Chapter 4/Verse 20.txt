<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Now unto God and our Father</b></i> â€” God is our <i>Father</i> in Christ Jesus; and such pity as a father hath for his children, such has the Lord for them that fear him; as a father is concerned for the support and life of his children, so is God concerned for you. A father may be poor, and unable to help his most beloved children; God, your Father, is infinite in his riches of his grace and glory, and out of his abundance we have all received, and grace for grace. Therefore, <i>to God our Father, be glory for ever</i> <i>and ever</i>!</p>
