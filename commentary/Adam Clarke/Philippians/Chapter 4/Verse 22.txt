<p>Verse 22. <i><b>All the saints</b></i> — All the Christians now at Rome.</p>
<p><i><b>They that are of Caesar's household.</b></i> — Nero was at this time emperor of Rome: a more worthless, cruel, and diabolic wretch never disgraced the name or form of man; yet in <i>his family</i> there were Christians: but whether this relates to the members of the <i>imperial family</i>, or to <i>guards</i>, or <i>courtiers</i>, or to <i>servants</i>, we cannot tell. If even some of his <i>slaves</i> were converted to Christianity, it would he sufficiently marvellous. Converts to Christianity in this family there certainly were; and this shows how powerfully the Divine word had been preached and spread. That the Empress <i>Poppaea</i> may have been favourably inclined to Christianity is possible; for Josephus relates of her, Antiq., lib. xx. cap. 7: θεοσεβης γαρ ην. <i>She was a worshipper of the</i> <i>true God</i>; it is not likely, therefore, that she threw any hinderances in the way of her servants who might wish to embrace the Christian faith. St. <i>Jerome</i>, in Philemon, states that St. Paul had converted many in Caesar's family; <i>A Caesare missus in</i> <i>carcerem, notior familiae ejus factus, persecutoris Christi domum</i> <i>fecit ecclesiam</i>. "Being by the emperor cast into prison, he became the more known to his family, and he turned the house of Christ's persecutor into a church." Some imagine that <i>Seneca</i>, the preceptor of Nero and the poet <i>Lucan</i>, were converted by St. Paul; and there are still extant, and in a MS. now before me, letters which profess to have passed between Paul and <i>Seneca</i>; but they are worthy of neither. They have been printed in some editions of <i>Seneca's</i> works. See the remarks below.</p>
