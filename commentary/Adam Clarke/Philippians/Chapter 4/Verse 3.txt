<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</span>. <i><b>Help those women which laboured with me</b></i> — Both in the Grecian and Asiatic countries women were kept much secluded, and is was not likely that even the apostles had much opportunity of conversing with them; it was therefore necessary that they should have some experienced Christian <i>women</i> with them, who could have access to families, and preach Jesus to the female part of them. The apostle tells us that certain women <i>laboured with him in the</i> <i>Gospel</i>, and were assistants to others also who had assisted him.</p>
<p>Some think the women here were <i>Euodias</i> and <i>Syntyche</i>; but I rather incline to the opinion that Syntyche was a male, and Euodias his wife. EUODIAS signifies a <i>pleasant scent</i>; SYNTYCHE, <i>fortunate</i>. There have been a number of conjectures who these persons were, and who is meant by the <i>true yokefellow</i>; but as there is nothing certain known on the subject, it is useless to propagate conjecture.</p>
<p><i><b>With Clement also</b></i> — Supposed to be the same who was afterwards bishop of Rome, and who wrote an epistle to the <i>Corinthians</i>, which is still extant.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose names</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>in the book of life.</b></i> — Who are genuine Christians; who are <i>enlisted</i> or <i>enrolled</i> in the armies of the Lord, and have received a title to eternal glory.
