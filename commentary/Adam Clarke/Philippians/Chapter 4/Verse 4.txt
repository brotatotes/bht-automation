<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:4">Philippians 4:4</span>. <i><b>Rejoice in the Lord alway</b></i> â€” Be continually happy; but this happiness you can find only <i>in the Lord</i>. Genuine happiness is <i>spiritual</i>; as it can only come from God, so it infallibly tends to him. The apostle repeats the exhortation, to show, not only his earnestness, but also that it was God's will that it should be so, and that it was their <i>duty</i> as well as <i>interest</i>.</p>
