<p>Verse 5. <i><b>Let your moderation be known</b></i> — The word επιεικες is of very extensive signification; it means the same as επιεικεια, mildness, patience, yieldingness, gentleness, clemency, <i>moderation</i>, unwillingness to litigate or contend; but <i>moderation</i> is expressive enough as a general term. "Moderation," says Dr. Macknight, "means meekness under provocation, readiness to forgive injuries, equity in the management of business, candour in judging of the characters and actions of others, sweetness of disposition, and the entire government of the passions."</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord is at hand.</b></i> — A phrase something similar to the <i>Maranatha</i> of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:22">1 Corinthians 16:22</span>: The Lord is Judge, and is at hand to punish. <i>Schoettgen</i> supposes, from this verse, taken in connection with the preceding, that Euodias and Syntyche were of a <i>quarrelsome</i> disposition; and hence the exhortation and threatening in the third and fifth verses.</p>
