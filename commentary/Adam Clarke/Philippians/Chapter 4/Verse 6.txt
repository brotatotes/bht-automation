Verse 6. Be careful for nothing — μηδεν μεριμνατε. Be not anxiously solicitous; do not give place to carking care, let what will occur; for anxiety cannot chance the state or condition of any thing from bad to good, but will infallibly injure your own souls.By prayer and supplication — God alone can help you; he is disposed to do it, but you must ask by prayer and supplication; without this he has not promised to help you.By prayer - solemn application to God from a sense of want. Supplication - continuance in earnest prayer. With thanksgiving, for innumerable favours already received; and for dangers, evils, and deaths turned aside. And let your souls be found in this exercise, or in the disposition in which this exercise can be performed, at all times, on all occasions, and in all places.
