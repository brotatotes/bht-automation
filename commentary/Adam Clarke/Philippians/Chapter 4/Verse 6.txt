<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Be careful for nothing</b></i> — μηδεν μεριμνατε. Be not anxiously solicitous; do not give place to carking care, let what will occur; for anxiety cannot chance the state or condition of any thing from bad to good, but will infallibly injure your own souls.</p>
<p><i><b>By prayer and supplication</b></i> — God alone can help you; he is disposed to do it, but you must ask by prayer and supplication; without this he has not promised to help you.</p>
<p><i>By prayer</i> - solemn application to God from a sense of want. <i>Supplication</i> - continuance in earnest prayer. <i>With thanksgiving</i>, for innumerable favours already received; and for dangers, evils, and deaths turned aside. And let your souls be found in this exercise, or in the <i>disposition</i> in which this exercise can be performed, at all <i>times</i>, on all <i>occasions</i>, and in all <i>places</i>.</p>
