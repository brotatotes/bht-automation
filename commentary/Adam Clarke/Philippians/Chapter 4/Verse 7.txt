<p>Verse 7. <i><b>And the peace of God</b></i> — That harmonizing of all passions and appetites which is produced by the Holy Spirit, and arises from a sense of pardon and the favour of God;</p>
<p><i><b>Shall keep your hearts</b></i> — φρουρησει. Shall keep them as in a strong place or castle. <i>Your hearts</i>-the seat of all your affections and passions, <i>and minds</i>-your understanding, judgment, and conscience <i>through Christ Jesus; by</i> whom ye were brought into this state of favour, <i>through</i> whom ye are preserved in it, and in whom ye possess it; for Christ keeps that heart in peace in which he dwells and rules. This peace passeth all understanding; it is of a very different nature from all that can arise from human occurrences; it is a peace which Christ has purchased, and which God dispenses; it is felt by all the truly godly, but can be explained by none; it is communion with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ, by the power and influence of the Holy Ghost.</p>
