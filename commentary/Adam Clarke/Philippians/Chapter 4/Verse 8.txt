Verse 8. Finally, brethren — The object of the apostle is to recommend holiness and righteousness to them in every point of view; and to show that the Gospel of Christ requires all its professors to have the mind that was in Christ, and to walk as he himself also walked. That they were not to attend to one branch of righteousness or virtue only, but to every thing by which they might bring honour to God, good to their fellow creatures, and credit to themselves.Whatsoever things are true — οσα αληθη. All that is agreeable to unchangeable and eternal truth. Whether that which is to be learned from the nature and state of created things, or that which comes immediately from God by revelation.Whatsoever things are honest — οσα σιμνα. Whatever is grave, decent, and venerable. Whatever becomes you as men, as citizens, and as Christians.Whatsoever things are just — οσα δικαια. Whatsoever is agreeable to justice and righteousness. All that ye owe to God, to your neighbour, and to yourselves.Whatsoever things are pure — οσα αγνα. Whatsoever is chaste. In reference to the state of the mind, and to the acts of the body.Whatsoever things are lovely — οσα προσφιλη. Whatsoever is amiable on its own account and on account of its usefulness to others, whether in your conduct or conversation.Whatsoever things are of good report — οσα ευφημα. Whatsoever things the public agree to acknowledge as useful and profitable to men; such as charitable institutions of every kind, in which genuine Christians should ever take the lead.If there be any virtue — If they be calculated to promote the general good of mankind, and are thus praiseworthy;Think on these things. — Esteem them highly, recommend them heartily, and practise them fervently.Instead of ει τις επαινος, if there be any praise, several eminent MSS., as D*EFG, add επιστημης, of knowledge; and the Vulgate and the Itala have disciplinae, of discipline; but none of these appear to be an original reading.
