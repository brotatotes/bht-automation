<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Finally, brethren</b></i> — The object of the apostle is to recommend holiness and righteousness to them in every point of view; and to show that the Gospel of Christ requires all its professors to have the <i>mind</i> that was in Christ, and to <i>walk</i> as he himself also walked. That they were not to attend to one branch of righteousness or virtue only, but to every thing by which they might bring honour to God, good to their fellow creatures, and credit to themselves.</p>
<p><i><b>Whatsoever things are true</b></i> — οσα αληθη. All that is agreeable to unchangeable and eternal <i>truth</i>. Whether that which is to be learned from the <i>nature</i> and <i>state</i> of created things, or that which comes immediately from God by <i>revelation</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whatsoever things</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>honest</b></i> — οσα σιμνα. Whatever is <i>grave, decent</i>, and <i>venerable</i>. Whatever <i>becomes</i> you as men, as citizens, and as Christians.</p>
<p><i><b>Whatsoever things</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>just</b></i> — οσα δικαια. Whatsoever is agreeable to justice and righteousness. All that ye owe to God, to your neighbour, and to yourselves.</p>
<p><i><b>Whatsoever things are pure</b></i> — οσα αγνα. Whatsoever is <i>chaste</i>. In reference to the <i>state</i> of the <i>mind</i>, and to the <i>acts</i> of the <i>body</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whatsoever things</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>lovely</b></i> — οσα προσφιλη. Whatsoever is <i>amiable</i> on its own account and on account of its usefulness to others, whether in your conduct or conversation.</p>
<p><i><b>Whatsoever things</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>of good report</b></i> — οσα ευφημα. Whatsoever things the <i>public</i> agree to acknowledge as <i>useful</i> and <i>profitable</i> to men; such as <i>charitable institutions</i> of every kind, in which genuine Christians should ever take the lead.</p>
<p><i><b>If</b></i><b> there be </b><i><b>any virtue</b></i> — If they be calculated to promote the general good of mankind, and are thus <i>praiseworthy</i>;</p>
<p><i><b>Think on these things.</b></i> — Esteem them highly, recommend them heartily, and practise them fervently.</p>
<p>Instead of ει τις επαινος, <i>if there be any praise</i>, several eminent MSS., as D*EFG, add επιστημης, <i>of knowledge</i>; and the <i>Vulgate</i> and the <i>Itala</i> have <i>disciplinae</i>, of <i>discipline</i>; but none of these appear to be an original reading.</p>
