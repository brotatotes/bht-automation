Verse 9. Those things, which ye have - learned — From my preaching and writing;And received — By faith, as a revelation from God;And heard — From my preaching, and that of those who laboured with me; and heard from me, in my private communications with you; and heard of me from other Churches;And seen in me — While living and labouring among you;Do — Take them for the rule of your faith and practice.And the God of peace — He who is the author of peace, the lover of peace, and the maintainer of peace; he who has made peace between heaven and earth, by the mission and sacrifice of his Son, shall be ever with you while you believe and act as here recommended.
