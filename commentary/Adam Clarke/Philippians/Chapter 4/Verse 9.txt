<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Those things, which ye have - learned</b></i> — From my preaching and writing;</p>
<p><i><b>And received</b></i> — By faith, as a revelation from God;</p>
<p><i><b>And heard</b></i> — From my preaching, and that of those who laboured with me; <i>and heard from</i> me, in my private communications with you; and heard <i>of</i> me from other Churches;</p>
<p><i><b>And seen in me</b></i> — While living and labouring among you;</p>
<p><i><b>Do</b></i> — Take them for the <i>rule</i> of your <i>faith</i> and <i>practice</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And the God of peace</b></i> — He who is the author of peace, the lover of peace, and the maintainer of peace; he who has made peace between heaven and earth, by the mission and sacrifice of his Son, shall be ever with you while you believe and act as here recommended.</p>
