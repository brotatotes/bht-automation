<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>. <i><b>The Revelation of Jesus Christ</b></i> — The word αποκαλυψις, from which we have our word <i>Apocalypse</i>, signifies literally, a <i>revelation</i>, or <i>discovery</i> of what was <i>concealed</i> or <i>hidden</i>. It is here said that this <i>revelation</i>, or <i>discovery</i> of hidden things, was given by GOD to <i>Jesus Christ</i>; that Christ gave it to his <i>angel</i>; that this angel showed it to JOHN; and that John sent it to the CHURCHES. Thus we find it came from God to Christ, from Christ to the angel, from the angel to John, and from John to the Church. It is properly, therefore, <i>the Revelation of God</i>, sent by these various agents <i>to his servants</i> at large; and this is the proper title of the book.</p>

But if we consider the book as referring to the state of the Church in all ages, the words here, and those in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>, must be understood of the <i>commencement</i> of the events predicted; as if he had said: In a short time the train of these visions will be put in motion: - </p>
