<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>. <i><b>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and</b></i> — This whole clause is wanting in ABC, thirty-one others; some editions; the <i>Syriac, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Slavonic,</i> <i>Vulgate, Arethas, Andreas</i>, and <i>Primasius</i>. Griesbach has left it out of the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Saying-What thou seest, write in a book</b></i> — Carefully note down every thing that is represented to thee. John had the visions from heaven; but he described them in his own language and manner.</p>
<p><i><b>Send</b></i> it <i>unto the seven Churches</i>] The names of which immediately follow. <i>In Asia</i>. This is wanting in the principal MSS. and <i>versions</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text.</p>
<p><i><b>Ephesus</b></i> — This was a city of Ionia, in Asia Minor, situated at the mouth of the river <i>Cayster</i>, on the shore of the AEgean Sea, about fifty miles south of <i>Smyrna</i>. See <i>preface</i> to the Epistle to the <i>Ephesians</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Smyrna</b></i> — Now called also <i>Ismir</i>, is the largest and richest city of Asia Minor. It is situated about one hundred and eighty-three miles west by south of <i>Constantinople</i>, on the shore of the AEgean Sea. It is supposed to contain about one hundred and forty thousand inhabitants, of whom there are from fifteen to twenty thousand Greeks, six thousand Armenians, five thousand Roman Catholics, one hundred and forty Protestants, eleven thousand Jews, and fifteen thousand Turks. It is a beautiful city, but often ravaged by the plague, and seldom two years together free from earthquakes. In 1758 the city was nearly desolated by the plague; scarcely a sufficient number of the inhabitants survived to gather in the fruits of the earth. In 1688 there was a terrible earthquake here, which overthrew a great number of houses; in one of the shocks, the rock on which the castle stood opened, swallowed up the castle and five thousand persons! On these accounts, nothing but the <i>love of gain</i>, so natural to man, could induce any person to make it his residence; though, in other respects, it can boast of many advantages. In this city the <i>Turks</i> have nineteen mosques; the <i>Greeks</i>, two churches; the <i>Armenians</i>, one; and the <i>Jews</i>, eight synagogues; and the <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i> factories have each a chaplain. Smyrna is one hundred miles north of the island of Rhodes, long. 27° 25' E., lat. 38° 28' N.</p>
<p><i><b>Pergamos</b></i> — A town of Mysia, situated on the river <i>Caicus</i>. It was the royal residence of <i>Eumenes</i>, and the kings of the race of the <i>Attali</i>. It was anciently famous for its library, which contained, according to Plutarch, two hundred thousand volumes. It was here that the <i>membranae Pergameniae</i>, Pergamenian skins, were invented; from which we derive our word <i>parchment</i>. Pergamos was the birthplace of <i>Galen</i>; and in it <i>P. Scipio</i> died. It is now called <i>Pergamo</i> and <i>Bergamo</i>, and is situated in long. 27° 0' E., lat. 39° 13' N.</p>
<p><i><b>Thyatira</b></i> — Now called <i>Akissat</i> and <i>Ak-kissar</i>, a city of Natolia, in Asia Minor, seated on the river <i>Hermus</i>, in a plain eighteen miles broad, and is about fifty miles from <i>Pergamos</i>; long. 27° 49' E., lat. 38° 16' N. The houses are chiefly built of earth, but the mosques are all of marble. Many remarkable ancient inscriptions have been discovered in this place.</p>
<p><i><b>Sardis</b></i> — Now called <i>Sardo</i> and <i>Sart</i>, a town of Asia, in Natolia, about forty miles east from Smyrna. It is seated on the side of mount <i>Tmolus</i>, and was once the capital of the <i>Lydian kings</i>, and here <i>Croesus</i> reigned. It is now a poor, inconsiderable village. Long. 28° 5' E., lat. 37° 51' N.</p>
<p><i><b>Philadelphia</b></i> — A city of Natolia, seated at the foot of mount <i>Tmolus</i>, by the river <i>Cogamus</i>.

Long. 28° 15' E., lat. 38° 28' N.</p>
<p><i><b>Laodicea</b></i> — A town of Phrygia, on the river <i>Lycus</i>; first called <i>Diospolis</i>, or the city of Jupiter.
