<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:12">Revelation 1:12</span>. And I turned For he had heard the voice behind him. <i>To</i> <i>see the voice</i>; i.e., the person from whom the voice came.</p>
<p><i><b>Seven golden candlesticks</b></i> — Ἑπτα λυχνιας χρυσας· <i>Seven golden</i> <i>lamps</i>. It is absurd to say, a golden silver, or brazen candle<i>stick</i>. These seven lamps represented the <i>seven Churches</i>, in which the <i>light</i> of God was continually <i>shining</i>, and the <i>love</i> of God continually <i>burning</i>. And they are here represented as <i>golden</i>, to show how precious they were in the sight of God. This is a reference to the temple at Jerusalem, where there was a <i>candlestick</i> or <i>chandelier</i> of <i>seven branches</i>; or rather six branches; three springing out on either side, and <i>one</i> in the centre. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:31-37">Exodus 25:31-37</span>. This reference to the temple seems to intimate that the temple of Jerusalem was a type of the whole Christian Church.</p>
