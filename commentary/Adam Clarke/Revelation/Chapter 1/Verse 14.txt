<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:14">Revelation 1:14</span>. <i><b>His head and</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>hairs</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>white like wool</b></i> — This was not only an emblem of his <i>antiquity</i>, but it was the evidence of his <i>glory</i>; for the <i>whiteness</i> or splendour of his head and hair doubtless proceeded from the <i>rays of light</i> and <i>glory</i> which encircled his head, and darted from it in all directions. The <i>splendour</i> around the head was termed by the Romans <i>nimbus</i>, and by us a <i>glory</i>; and was represented round the heads of gods, deified persons, and saints. It is used in the same way through almost all the nations of the earth.</p>
<p><i><b>His eyes</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>as a flame of fire</b></i> — To denote his omniscience, and the all-penetrating nature of the Divine knowledge.</p>
