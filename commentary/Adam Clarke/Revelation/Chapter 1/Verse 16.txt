<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>. <i><b>In his right hand seven stars</b></i> — The <i>stars</i> are afterwards interpreted as representing the <i>seven angels</i>, messengers, or bishops of the <i>seven Churches</i>. Their being in the <i>right hand</i> of Christ shows that they are under his special care and most powerful protection. See below.</p>
<p><i><b>Out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword</b></i> — This is no doubt intended to point out the <i>judgments</i> about to be <i>pronounced</i> by Christ against the rebellious <i>Jews</i> and persecuting <i>Romans</i>; God's judgments were just now going to fall upon <i>both</i>. The <i>sharp</i> <i>two-edged sword</i> may represent the <i>word of God</i> in general, according to that saying of the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>: <i>The word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any</i> <i>two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and</i> <i>spirit</i>, c. And <i>the word of God</i> is termed <i>the sword of the Spirit</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And his countenance</b></i> was <i>as the sun shineth in his strength.</i>] His face was like the disk of the sun in the brightest summer's day, when there were no clouds to abate the splendour of his rays. A similar form of expression is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+5:31">Judges 5:31</span>: <i>Let them that love him be as the sun when he GOETH FORTH IN HIS</i> <i>MIGHT</i>. And a similar description may be found, <i>Midrash</i> in <i>Yalcut</i> <i>Simeoni</i>, part I., fol. 55, 4: "When Moses and Aaron came and stood before Pharaoh, they appeared like the <i>ministering angels</i> and their stature, like the cedars of Lebanon:- חמה לגלגלי דומים עיניהם וגלגלי vegalgilley eyneyhem domim legalgilley chammah, <i>and the pupils of their eyes were like the</i> <i>wheels of the sun</i>; and their beards were as the grape of the palm trees:- חמה כזיו פניהם וזיו veziv peneyhem keziv chammah, <i>and the</i> <i>SPLENDOUR of THEIR FACES was as the SPLENDOUR of the SUN</i>."</p>
