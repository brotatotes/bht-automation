<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:17">Revelation 1:17</span>. <i><b>I fell at his feet as dead.</b></i> â€” The appearance of the <i>glory</i> of the Lord had then same effect upon Ezekiel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:28">Ezekiel 1:28</span>: and the appearance of Gabriel had the same effect on Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+8:17">Daniel 8:17</span>. The terrible splendour of such majesty was more than the apostle could bear, and he fell down deprived of his senses, but was soon enabled to behold the vision by a communication of strength from our Lord's right hand.</p>
