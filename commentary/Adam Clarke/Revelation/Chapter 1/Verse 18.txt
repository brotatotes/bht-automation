<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>. I am <i><b>he that liveth, and was dead</b></i> — I am Jesus the Saviour, who, though the fountain of life, have died for mankind; and being raised from the dead I shall die no more, the great sacrifice being consummated. <i>And have the keys of death and the</i> <i>grave</i>, so that I can destroy the living and raise the dead. The <i>key</i> here signifies the <i>power</i> and authority over life, death, and the grave. This is also a rabbinical form of speech. In the Jerusalem <i>Targum</i>, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+30:22">Genesis 30:22</span>, are these words: "There are four KEYS in the hand of God which he never trusts to angel or seraph. 1. The <i>key</i> of the <i>rain</i>; 2. The <i>key</i> of <i>provision</i>; 3. The <i>key</i> of the <i>grave</i>; and 4. The <i>key</i> of the <i>barren womb</i>."</p>
<p>In <i>Sanhedrin</i>, fol. 113, 1, it is said: "When the son of the woman of Sarepta died, Elijah requested that to him might be given the <i>key</i> of the <i>resurrection of the dead</i>. They said to him, there are <i>three KEYS</i> which are not given into the hand of the apostle, the <i>key</i> of <i>life</i>, the <i>key</i> of the <i>rain</i>, and the <i>key</i> of the <i>resurrection of the dead</i>." From these examples it is evident that we should understand αδης, <i>hades</i>, here, not as <i>hell</i>, nor the place of <i>separate spirits</i>, but merely as the <i>grave</i>; and the <i>key</i> we <i>find</i> to be merely the emblem of <i>power</i> and <i>authority</i>. Christ can both <i>save</i> and <i>destroy</i>, can <i>kill</i> and make <i>alive</i>. Death is still under his dominion, and he can recall the dead whensoever he pleases. He is the resurrection and the life.</p>
