Verse Revelation 1:2. Who bare record of the word of God â€” Is there a reference here to the first chapter of John's gospel, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, &c.? Of this Word John did bear record. Or, does the writer mean the fidelity with which he noted and related the word-doctrines or prophecies, which he received at this time by revelation from God? This seems more consistent with the latter part of the verse.
