<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:2">Revelation 1:2</span>. <i><b>Who bare record of the word of God</b></i> â€” Is there a reference here to the first chapter of John's <i>gospel, In the</i> <i>beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God</i>, &amp;c.? Of this <i>Word</i> John did bear record. Or, does the writer mean the <i>fidelity</i> with which he noted and related the <i>word</i>-doctrines or prophecies, which he received at this time by revelation from God? This seems more consistent with the latter part of the verse.</p>
