<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>. <i><b>The mystery</b></i> — That is, the <i>allegorical</i> explanation of the <i>seven stars</i> is the <i>seven angels</i> or ministers of the Churches; and the allegorical meaning of the <i>seven golden lamps</i> is the <i>seven</i> <i>Churches</i> themselves.</p>
<p>1. IN the <i>seven stars</i> there may be an allusion to the <i>seals</i> of different offices under potentates, each of which had its <i>own</i> <i>particular seal</i>, which verified all instruments from that office; and as these seals were frequently set in <i>rings</i> which were worn on the fingers, there may be an allusion to those <i>brilliants</i> set in rings, and worn επι της δεξιας, <i>UPON the right hand</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+22:24">Jeremiah 22:24</span>, Coniah is represented as a <i>signet</i> on the <i>right hand of the Lord</i>; and that such signets were in <i>rings</i> see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:18">Genesis 38:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:25">Genesis 38:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+18:11">Exodus 18:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+6:17">Daniel 6:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hag+2:23">Haggai 2:23</span>. On close examination we shall find that all the <i>symbols</i> in this book have their foundation either in <i>nature, fact, custom</i>, or <i>general opinion</i>. One of the cutchery seals of the late <i>Tippoo</i> <i>Saib</i>, with which he stamped all the commissions of that office, lies now before me; it is cut on <i>silver</i>, in the <i>Taaleck</i> character, and the piece of silver is set in a large <i>gold ring</i>, heavy, but roughly manufactured.</p>
<p>2. The <i>Churches</i> are represented by these lamps; they hold the <i>oil</i> and the <i>fire</i>, and dispense the <i>light</i>. A lamp is not <i>light</i> <i>in itself</i>, it is only the <i>instrument</i> of dispensing light, and it must receive both <i>oil</i> and <i>fire</i> before it can dispense any; so no Church has in itself either <i>grace</i> or <i>glory</i>, it must receive all from Christ its head, else it can dispense neither light nor life.</p>
<p>3. The ministers of the Gospel are <i>signets</i> or <i>seals</i> of Jesus Christ; he uses them to <i>stamp</i> his truth, to <i>accredit</i> it, and give it <i>currency</i>. But as a seal can mark nothing of itself unless applied by a proper hand, so the ministers of Christ can do no good, <i>seal no truth, impress no soul</i>, unless the great owner condescend to use them.</p>
<p>4. How careful should the Church be that it have the <i>oil</i> and the <i>light</i>, that it continue to <i>burn</i> and send forth Divine knowledge! In vain does any Church pretend to be a Church of Christ if it dispense no light; if souls are not enlightened, quickened, and converted in it. If Jesus walk in it, its light will shine both <i>clearly</i> and <i>strongly</i>, and sinners will be converted unto him; and the members of that Church will be children of the light, and walk as children of the light and of the day, and there will be no occasion of stumbling in them.</p>
<p>5. How careful should the ministers of Christ be that they <i>proclaim</i> nothing as truth, and <i>accredit</i> nothing as truth, but what comes from their master!</p>
<p>They should also take heed lest, after having preached to others, themselves should be cast-aways; lest God should say unto them as he said of Coniah, <i>As I live, saith the Lord, though</i> <i>Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, were the SIGNET UPON MY RIGHT HAND,</i> <i>yet would I pluck thee thence</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> On the other hand, if they be faithful, their labour shall not be in vain, and their safety shall be great. He that toucheth them toucheth the apple of God's eye, and none shall be able to pluck them out of his hand. they are the angels and ambassadors of the Lord; their persons are sacred; they are the messengers of the Churches, and the glory of Christ. Should they lose their lives in the work, it will be only a speedier entrance into an eternal glory. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The <i>rougher</i> the way, the <i>shorter</i> their stay,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> The troubles that rise</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Shall gloriously <i>hurry</i> their souls to the skies. </p>
