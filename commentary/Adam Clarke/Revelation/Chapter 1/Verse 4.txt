<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>. <i><b>John to the seven Churches</b></i> — The apostle begins this much in the manner of the Jewish prophets. They often name themselves in the messages which they receive from God to deliver to the people; e.g. "The vision of ISAIAH, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem." "The words of JEREMIAH, the son of Hilkiah; to whom the word of the Lord came." "The word of the Lord came expressly unto EZEKIEL, the priest." "The word of the Lord that came unto HOSEA, the son of Beeri." "The word of the Lord that came to JOEL." "The words of AMOS, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa." "The vision of OBADIAH; thus saith the Lord." "The word of the Lord came unto JONAH." So, "The revelation of Jesus Christ, which he sent and signified to his servant JOHN." "JOHN to the seven Churches," c.</p>
<p>The <i>Asia</i> here mentioned was what is called <i>Asia Minor</i>, or the <i>Lydian</i> or <i>Proconsular Asia</i> the <i>seven Churches</i> were those of <i>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia</i>, and <i>Laodicea</i>. Of these as they occur. We are not to suppose that they were the only Christian Churches then in Asia Minor; there were several others then in Phrygia, Pamphylia, Galatia, Pontus, Cappadocia, c., c. But these seven were those which lay nearest to the apostle, and were more particularly under his care though the message was sent to the Churches in general, and perhaps it concerns the whole Christian world. But the number <i>seven</i> may be used here as the <i>number of perfection</i> as the Hebrews use the <i>seven</i> names of the <i>heavens</i>, the <i>seven</i> names of the <i>earth</i>, the <i>seven patriarchs, seven suns, seven kinds, seven years, seven</i> <i>months, seven days</i>, c., c. in which the rabbins find a great variety of mysteries.</p>
<p><i><b>Grace be unto you</b></i> — This form of apostolical benediction we have often seen in the preceding epistles.</p>
<p><i><b>From him which is, and which was, and which is to come</b></i> — This phraseology is purely Jewish, and probably taken from the Tetragrammaton, יהוה YEHOVAH which is supposed to include in itself all time, <i>past, present</i>, and <i>future</i>. But they often use the phrase of which the ὁ ων, και ὁ ην, και ὁ ερχομενος, of the apostle, is a literal translation. So, in <i>Sohar Chadash</i>, fol. 7, 1: "Rabbi Jose said, By the name Tetragrammaton, (i.e. יהוה Yehovah,) the higher and lower regions, the heavens, the earth, and all they contain, were perfected; and they are all before him reputed as nothing:- והוא היה והוא הוה והוא יהיה <i>vehu hayah, vehu</i> <i>hoveh, vehu yihyeh</i>; and HE WAS, and HE IS, and HE WILL BE. So, in <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sec. 3, fol. 105, 2: "The holy blessed God said to Moses, tell them: - אני שהייתי ואני הוא עכשיו ואני הוא לעתיד לבוא <i>ani shehayithi, veani hu achshaiu, veani hu laathid labo</i>; I WAS, I NOW AM, and I WILL BE IN FUTURE."</p>
<p>In <i>Chasad Shimuel</i>, Rab. Samuel ben David asks: "Why are we commanded to use <i>three hours of prayer</i>? Answer: These hours point out the holy blessed God:- שהוא היה הוה ויהיה <i>shehu hayah, hoveh,</i> <i>veyihyeh</i>; he who WAS, who IS, and who SHALL BE. The MORNING prayer points out him who WAS before the foundation of the world; the NOONDAY prayer points out him who IS; and the EVENING prayer points out him who IS TO COME." This phraseology is exceedingly appropriate, and strongly expresses the <i>eternity</i> of God; for we have no other idea of <i>time</i> than as <i>past</i>, or <i>now existing</i>, or <i>yet to exist</i>; nor have we any idea of <i>eternity</i> but as that duration called by some <i>aeternitas a parte ante</i>, the eternity that was before time, and <i>aeternitas a parte post</i>, the endless duration that shall be when time is no more. That which WAS, is the eternity <i>before time</i>; that which IS, is <i>time itself</i>; and that which IS TO COME, is the eternity which shall be when <i>time is no</i> <i>more</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The seven Spirits-before his throne</b></i> — The ancient Jews, who represented the throne of God as the <i>throne of an eastern monarch</i>, supposed that there were <i>seven ministering angels</i> before this throne, as there were <i>seven ministers</i> attendant on the throne of a Persian monarch. We have an ample proof of this, <i>Tobit 12:15</i>: <i>I am</i> <i>Raphael, one of the SEVEN HOLY ANGELS which present the prayers of</i> <i>the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy</i> <i>One</i>. And in <i>Jonathan ben Uzziel's</i> Targum, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:7">Genesis 11:7</span>: <i>God said to the SEVEN ANGELS which stand before him, Come now</i>, c.</p>
<p>In <i>Pirkey Eliezer</i>, iv. and vii: "The angels which were first created minister before him without the veil." Sometimes they represent them as <i>seven cohorts</i> or <i>troops of angels</i>, under whom are <i>thirty</i> inferior orders.</p>
<p>That <i>seven</i> ANGELS are here meant, and not the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, is most evident from the <i>place</i>, the <i>number</i>, and the <i>tradition</i>. Those who imagine the <i>Holy Ghost</i> to be intended suppose the number <i>seven</i> is used to denote his manifold <i>gifts</i> and <i>graces</i>. That these <i>seven spirits</i> are <i>angels</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5">Revelation 4:5</span>; and particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>, where they are called <i>the seven spirits of God</i> SENT FORTH INTO ALL THE EARTH.</p>
