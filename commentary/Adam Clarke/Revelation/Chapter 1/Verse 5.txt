<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>. <i><b>The faithful witness</b></i> — The true teacher, whose testimony is infallible, and whose sayings must all come to pass.</p>
<p><i><b>The first-begotten of the dead</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The prince of the kings</b></i> — ο αρχων, The <i>chief</i> or <i>head</i>, of all earthly potentates; who has them all under his dominion and control, and can dispose of them as he will.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto him that loved us</b></i> — This should begin a new verse, as it is the commencement of a new subject. Our salvation is attributed to the love of God, who gave his Son; and to the love of Christ, who died for us. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Washed us from our sins</b></i> — The redemption of the soul, with the remission of sins, and purification from unrighteousness, is here, as in all the New Testament, attributed to the <i>blood of Christ</i> <i>shed on the cross for man</i>.</p>
