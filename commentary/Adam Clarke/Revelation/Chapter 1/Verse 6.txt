<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>. <i><b>Kings and priests</b></i> — See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>. But instead of βασιλεις και ιερεις, <i>kings and priests</i> the most reputable MSS., versions, and fathers have βασιλειαν ιερεις, <i>a kingdom</i> and <i>priests</i>; i.e. a kingdom of priests, or a royal priesthood. The <i>regal</i> and <i>sacerdotal dignities</i> are the two highest that can possibly exist among men; and these two are here mentioned to show the glorious prerogatives and state of the children of God.</p>
<p><i><b>To him</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>glory</b></i> — That is, to Christ; for it is of him that the prophet speaks, and of none other.</p>
<p><i><b>For ever and ever</b></i> — Εις τους αιωνας των αιωνων· <i>To ages of ages</i>; or rather, <i>through all indefinite periods; through all time</i>, and <i>through eternity</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Amen.</b></i> — A word of <i>affirmation</i> and <i>approbation</i>; so it <i>shall</i> be, and so it <i>ought</i> to be.</p>
