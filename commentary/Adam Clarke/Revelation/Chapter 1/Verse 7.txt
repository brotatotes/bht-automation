<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>. <i><b>Behold, he cometh with clouds</b></i> — This relates to his coming to execute judgment on the enemies of his religion; perhaps to his coming to destroy Jerusalem, as he was to be particularly manifested to them that <i>pierced him</i>, which must mean the incredulous and rebellious Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>And all kindreds of the earth</b></i> — Πασαι αἱ φυλαι της γης· <i>All the</i> <i>tribes of the land</i>. By this the <i>Jewish people</i> are most evidently intended, and therefore the whole verse may be understood as predicting the destruction of the Jews; and is a presumptive proof that the Apocalypse was written <i>before</i> the final overthrow of the Jewish state.</p>
<p><i><b>Even so, Amen.</b></i> — ναι, αμην <i>Yea, Amen</i>. <i>It is true, so be it</i>. Our Lord will come and execute judgment on the Jews and Gentiles. This the Jews and Romans particularly felt.</p>
