<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span>. <i><b>I am Alpha and Omega</b></i> — I am from eternity to eternity. This mode of speech is borrowed from the Jews, who express the <i>whole compass of things</i> by א <i>aleph</i> and ת <i>tau</i>, the <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> letters of the <i>Hebrew</i> alphabet; but as St. John was writing in <i>Greek</i>, he accommodates the whole to the <i>Greek</i> alphabet, of which Α <i>alpha</i> and Ω <i>omega</i> are the first and last letters. With the rabbins מא ועד ת <i>meeleph vead tau</i>, "<i>from aleph to</i> <i>tau</i>," expressed the whole of a matter, <i>from the beginning to the</i> <i>end</i>. So in <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 17, 4: <i>Adam transgressed the</i> <i>whole law from aleph to tau</i>; i.e., from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>., fol. 48, 4: <i>Abraham observed the law, from aleph to tau</i>; i.e., he kept it <i>entirely</i>, from <i>beginning to end</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ibid</i>., fol. 128, 3: <i>When the holy blessed God pronounced a</i> <i>blessing on the Israelites, he did it from aleph to tau</i>; i.e., he did it <i>perfectly</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The beginning and the ending</b></i> — That is, as <i>aleph</i> or <i>alpha</i> is the beginning of the alphabet, so am I the author and cause of all things; as <i>tau</i> or <i>omega</i> is the <i>end</i> or last letter of the alphabet, so am I the end of all thinks, the destroyer as well as the establisher of all things. This clause is wanting in almost every MS. and version of importance. It appears to have been added first as an explanatory note, and in process of time crept into the text. Griesbach has left it out of the text. It is worthy of remark, that as the union of א <i>aleph</i> and ת <i>tau</i> in Hebrew make את <i>eth</i>, which the rabbins interpret of the <i>first matter</i> out of which all things were formed, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>;) so the union of Α <i>alpha</i> and Ω <i>omega</i>, in Greek, makes the verb αω, <i>I breathe</i>, and may very properly, in such a symbolical book, point out Him in whom we <i>live</i>, and <i>move</i>, and have our <i>being</i>; for, having formed man out of the dust of the earth, he <i>breathed</i> into his nostrils the <i>breath</i> of <i>life</i>, and he became a <i>living soul</i>; and it is by the <i>inspiration</i> or <i>inbreathing</i> of his Spirit that the souls of men are quickened, made alive from the dead, and fitted for life eternal. He adds also that he is the <i>Almighty</i>, the <i>all-powerful framer of the universe</i>, and the <i>inspirer of men</i>.</p>
