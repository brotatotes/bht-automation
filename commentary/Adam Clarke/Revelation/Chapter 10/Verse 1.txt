<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</span>. <i><b>Another mighty angel</b></i> — Either Christ or his representative; <i>clothed with a cloud</i>; a symbol of the Divine majesty.</p>
<p><i><b>A rainbow</b></i><b> was </b><i><b>upon his head</b></i> — The token of God's merciful covenant with mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>His face</b></i><b> was </b><i><b>as it were the sun</b></i> — So intensely glorious that it could not be looked on.</p>
<p><i><b>His feet as pillars of fire</b></i> — To denote the rapidity and energy of his motions, and the stability of his counsels.</p>
