Verse Revelation 10:1. Another mighty angel — Either Christ or his representative; clothed with a cloud; a symbol of the Divine majesty.A rainbow was upon his head — The token of God's merciful covenant with mankind.His face was as it were the sun — So intensely glorious that it could not be looked on.His feet as pillars of fire — To denote the rapidity and energy of his motions, and the stability of his counsels.
