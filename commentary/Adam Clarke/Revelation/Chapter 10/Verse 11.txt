<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+10:11">Revelation 10:11</span>. <i><b>Thou must prophesy again</b></i> — Thou must write, not only for the instruction of the Jews in Palestine, but of those in the different provinces, as well as the heathens and heathen emperors and potentates in general.</p>
<p>THE reader will find, on comparing this chapter with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+8:1-27">Daniel 8:1-27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1-13">Daniel 12:1-13</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+2:1-27">Ezekiel 2:1-27</span>, that there are several things similar in both; and the writer of the Apocalypse appears to keep these two prophets continually in view. I must once more say that I do not understand these prophecies, therefore I do not take upon me to explain them. I see with regret how many learned men have mistaken their way here. Commentators, and even some of the <i>most modern</i>, have strangely trifled in these solemn things; all trumpets, vials, woes, c., are perfectly easy to <i>them</i> yet from their descriptions, none get wise either to common sense or to the things that make for their peace.</p>
<p>On the same ground I cannot admit the interpretation that is given of the word χρονος, translated <i>time</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+10:6">Revelation 10:6</span>, which some have construed into an artificial period of 1,111 years, which they term <i>chronos</i>; hence we have the <i>chronos, half-chronos</i>, and <i>non-chronos</i>. Bengel has said much on these points, but to very little purpose; the word in the above place seems to signify <i>delay</i> simply, and probably refers to the long-suffering of God being ended in reference to Jerusalem; for I all along take for probable that this book was written <i>previously</i> to the destruction of that city.</p>
