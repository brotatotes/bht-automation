<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+10:2">Revelation 10:2</span>. <i><b>A little book open</b></i> — Meaning probably some <i>design</i> of God long concealed, but now about to be made manifest. But who knows what it means?</p>
<p><i><b>His right foot upon the sea, and</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>left-on the earth</b></i> — To show that he had the command of each, and that his power was universal, all things being under his feet.</p>
