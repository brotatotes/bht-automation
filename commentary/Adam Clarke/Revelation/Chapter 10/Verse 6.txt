Verse Revelation 10:6. By him that liveth for ever and ever — The eternal, self-existent Jehovah, the Maker of all things.That there should be time no longer — That the great counsels relative to the events already predicted should be immediately fulfilled, and that there should be no longer delay. This has no reference to the day of judgment.
