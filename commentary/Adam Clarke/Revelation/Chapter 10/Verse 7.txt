<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span>. <i><b>The mystery of God should be finished</b></i> — What this mystery refers to who knows? Nor have we more knowledge concerning the sounding of the seventh angel. On these points there is little agreement among learned men. Whether it mean the destruction of Jerusalem, or the destruction of the papal power, or something else, we know not. And yet with what confidence do men speak of the meaning of these hidden things!</p>
<p><i><b>Declared to his servants the prophets.</b></i> — It is most likely, therefore, that this trumpet belongs to the <i>Jewish</i> state.</p>
