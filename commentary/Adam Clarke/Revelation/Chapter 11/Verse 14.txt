<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+11:14">Revelation 11:14</span>. <i><b>The seconds wo is past</b></i> — That which took place under the <i>sixth trumpet</i>, and has been already described.</p>
<p><i><b>The third wo cometh</b></i> — Is about to be described under the <i>seventh</i> <i>trumpet</i>, which the angel is now prepared to sound.</p>
<p>Of the <i>three woes</i> which were denounced, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>, the first is described, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1-12">Revelation 9:1-12</span>; the second, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:13-21">Revelation 9:13-21</span>. These woes are supposed by many learned men to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem. <i>The first wo</i>-the seditions among the Jews themselves. <i>The second wo</i>-the besieging of the city by the Romans. <i>The third</i> <i>wo</i>-the taking and sacking of the city, and burning the temple. This was the greatest of all the woes, as in it the city and temple were destroyed, and nearly a million of men lost their lives.</p>
