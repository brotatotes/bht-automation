Verse Revelation 11:14. The seconds wo is past — That which took place under the sixth trumpet, and has been already described.The third wo cometh — Is about to be described under the seventh trumpet, which the angel is now prepared to sound.Of the three woes which were denounced, Revelation 8:13, the first is described, Revelation 9:1-12; the second, Revelation 9:13-21. These woes are supposed by many learned men to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem. The first wo-the seditions among the Jews themselves. The second wo-the besieging of the city by the Romans. The third wo-the taking and sacking of the city, and burning the temple. This was the greatest of all the woes, as in it the city and temple were destroyed, and nearly a million of men lost their lives.
