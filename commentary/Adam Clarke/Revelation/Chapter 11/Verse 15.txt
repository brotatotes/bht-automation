<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>. <i><b>There were great voices in heaven</b></i> â€” All the heavenly host-angels and redeemed human spirits, joined together to magnify God; that he had utterly discomfited his enemies and rendered his friends glorious. This will be truly the case when the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of God and of his Christ, But <i>when</i> shall this be? Some say, that is meant by these words has already taken place in the destruction of the Jewish state, and sending the Gospel throughout the Gentile world. Others say that it refers to the millennium, and to the consummation of all things.</p>
