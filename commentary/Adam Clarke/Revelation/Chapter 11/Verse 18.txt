Verse Revelation 11:18. The nations were angry — Were enraged against thy Gospel, and determined to destroy it.Thy wrath is come — The time to avenge thy servants and to destroy all thy enemies.The time of the dead, that they should be judged — The word κρινειν, to judge, is often used in the sense of to avenge. The dead, here, may mean those who were slain for the testimony of Jesus, and the judging is the avenging of their blood.Give reward unto thy servants — Who have been faithful unto death.The prophets — The faithful teachers in the Church, the saints-the Christians.And them that fear thy name — All thy sincere followers.Destroy them which destroy the earth. — All the authors, fomenters, and encouragers of bloody wars.
