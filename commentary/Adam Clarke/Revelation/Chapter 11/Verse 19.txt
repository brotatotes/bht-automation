<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>. <i><b>The temple of God was opened in heaven</b></i> â€” The true worship of God was established and performed in the Christian Church; this is the true temple, that at Jerusalem being destroyed.</p>
<p><i><b>And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an</b></i><b> </b><i><b>earthquake, and great hail</b></i><i>.</i>] These great commotions were intended to introduce the following vision; for the 12th chapter is properly a continuation of the 11th, and should be read in strict connection with it.</p>
<p>I NOW come to a part of this book that is deemed of the greatest importance by the Protestant Church, but is peculiarly difficult and obscure. I have often acknowledged my own incapacity to illustrate these prophecies. I might have availed myself of the labours of others, but I know not who is right; or whether any of the writers on this book have hit the sense is more than I can assert, and more than I think. The illustration of the xiith, xiiith, and xviith chapters, which I have referred to in the <i>preface</i>, drawn up and displayed with great industry and learning, I shall insert in its place, as by far the most probable I have yet seen; but I leave the learned author responsible for his own particular views of the subject.</p>
