<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+11:2">Revelation 11:2</span>. <i><b>But the court-is given unto the Gentiles</b></i> â€” The measuring of the temple probably refers to its approaching <i>destruction</i>, and the <i>termination</i> of the whole <i>Levitical service</i>; and this we find was to be done by the Gentiles, (Romans,) who were to tread it down forty-two months; i.e., just <i>three years and a half</i>, or <i>twelve hundred and sixty days</i>. This must be a symbolical period.</p>
