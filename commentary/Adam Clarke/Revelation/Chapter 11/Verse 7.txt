<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span>. <i><b>The beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit</b></i> â€” This may be what is called <i>antichrist</i>; some power that is opposed to genuine Christianity. But <i>what</i> or <i>whence</i>, except <i>from the</i> <i>bottomless pit</i>, i.e., under the influence and appointment of the devil, we cannot tell; nor do we know by what name this power or being should be called. The conjectures concerning the <i>two</i> <i>witnesses</i> and the <i>beast</i> have been sufficiently multiplied. If the whole passage, as some think, refer to the persecution raised by the <i>Jews</i> against the <i>Christians</i>, then some <i>Jewish power</i> or <i>person</i> is the <i>beast</i> from the bottomless pit. If it refer to the early ages of Christianity, then the <i>beast</i> may be one of the persecuting <i>heathen emperors</i>. If it refer to a later age of Christianity, then the <i>beast</i> may be the <i>papal power</i>, and the <i>Albigenses</i> and <i>Waldenses</i> the <i>two witnesses</i>, which were nearly extinguished by the horrible persecutions raised up against them by the Church of Rome. Whatever may be <i>here</i> intended, the earth has not yet covered <i>their</i> blood.</p>
