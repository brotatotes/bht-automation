<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span>. <i><b>The great city</b></i> â€” Some say <i>Rome</i>, which may be spiritually called <i>Sodom</i> for its <i>abominations, Egypt</i> for its <i>tyrannous</i> <i>cruelty</i>, and the <i>place where our Lord was crucified</i>, because of its persecution of the members of Christ; but <i>Jerusalem</i> itself may be intended. All these things I must leave to others.</p>
