<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+11:9">Revelation 11:9</span>. <i><b>Shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in</b></i><b> </b><i><b>graves</b></i><i>.</i>] They shall be treated with the greatest <i>barbarity</i>. Refusal of burial to the dead was allowed to be the sum of brutality and cruelty. In popish lands they will not suffer a Protestant to have <i>Christian burial</i>, or to have a grave in a churchyard! Contemptible wretches!</p>
