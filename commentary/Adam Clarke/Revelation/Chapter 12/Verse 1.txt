<p>Before I introduce the comment mentioned at the close of the preceding chapter, I think it necessary to state that the <i>phraseology</i> of the whole chapter is peculiarly <i>rabbinical</i>, and shall insert a few selections which may serve to illustrate some of the principal <i>figures</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Sohar Exod</i>., fol. 47, col. 187, we find a mystical interpretation of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:22">Exodus 21:22</span>: <i>If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit</i> <i>depart-he shall be surely punished, as the woman's husband will</i> <i>lay upon him</i>. "If men strive, i.e. <i>Michael</i> and <i>Samael</i>, and hurt a woman with child, i.e. <i>the Israelitish Church</i>, so that her fruit depart, <i>hoc fit in exilio</i>, he shall surely be punished, i.e., <i>Samael</i>. <i>As the woman's husband</i>, that is, the holy and blessed God."</p>
<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>. <i><b>There appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed</b></i><b> </b><i><b>with the sun</b></i> — That the woman here represents the true Church of Christ most commentators are agreed. In other parts of the Apocalypse, the pure Church of Christ is evidently portrayed by a woman. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>, a great multitude are represented as saying, "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his WIFE hath made herself ready." In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>, an angel talks with St. John, saying, "Come hither, I will show thee the BRIDE, the Lamb's wife." That the Christian Church is meant will appear also from her being <i>clothed</i> <i>with the sun</i>, a striking emblem of Jesus Christ, the Sun of righteousness, the light and glory of the Church; for the countenance of the Son of God is <i>as the sun shineth in his</i> <i>strength</i>. The woman has:-</p>
<p><i><b>The moon under her feet.</b></i> — Bishop Newton understands this of the Jewish typical worship and indeed the Mosaic system of rites and ceremonies could not have been better represented, for it was the <i>shadow of good things to come</i>. The moon is the less light, ruling over the night, and deriving all its illumination from the sun; in like manner the Jewish dispensation was the bright moonlight night of the world, and possessed a portion of the glorious light of the Gospel. At the rising of the sun the night is ended, and the lunar light no longer necessary, as the sun which enlightens her shines full upon the earth; exactly in the same way has the whole Jewish system of types and shadows has been superseded by the birth, life, crucifixion, death, resurrection, ascension, and intercession of Jesus Christ. Upon the head of the woman is:-</p>
<p><i><b>A crown of twelve stars.</b></i> — A very significant representation of the <i>twelve apostles</i>, who were the first founders of the Christian Church, and by whom the Gospel was preached in great part of the Roman empire with astonishing success. "They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the STARS for ever and ever." <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+12:3">Daniel 12:3</span>.</p>
