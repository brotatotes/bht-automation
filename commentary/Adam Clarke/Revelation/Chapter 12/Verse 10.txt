And the very same word κατηγορος, <i>accuser</i>, or, as it is in the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, κατηγωρ, is used by them in Hebrew letters, קטיגור katigor; e. gr., <i>Pirkey</i> <i>Eliezer</i>, c. 46, speaking of the day of expiation; "And the holy blessed God hears their testimony <i>from their accuser</i>, הקטיגור מן min hakkatigor; and expiates the altar, the priests, and the whole multitude, from the greatest to the least."</p>
<p>In <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sec. 31, fol. 129, 2, are these words; "If a man observes the precepts, and is a son of the law, and lives a holy life, then <i>Satan stands and accuses him</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Every day</i>, except the day of expiation <i>Satan is the accuser of</i> <i>men</i>."-<i>Vayikra Rabba</i>, sec. 21, fol. 164.</p>

<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Ver. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10">Revelation 12:10</span>. <i><b>And I heard a loud voice, saying,-Now is come salvation</b></i>, c.] This is a song of triumph of the Christian Church over the heathen idolatry, and is very expressive of the great joy of the Christians upon this most stupendous event. The loud voice of triumph is said to be heard in <i>heaven</i>, to show that the Christian religion was now exalted to the <i>heaven</i> or <i>throne</i> of the Roman. empire. "It is very remarkable," as Bishop Newton observes, "that Constantine himself, and the Christians of his time, describe his conquests under the image of a <i>dragon</i>, as if they had understood that this prophecy had received its accomplishment in him. Constantine himself, in his epistle to Eusebius and other bishops concerning the re-edifying and repairing of the churches, saith that 'liberty being now restored, and that the <i>dragon</i> being removed from the administration of public affairs, by the providence of the great God and by my ministry, I esteem the great power of God to have been made manifest to all.' Moreover, a picture of Constantine was set up over the palace gate, with the cross over his head, and under his feet the great enemy of mankind, who persecuted the Church by means of impious tyrants, <i>in</i> <i>the form of a dragon</i>, transfixed with a dart through the midst of his body, and falling headlong into the depth of the sea." See <i>Eusebius</i> de Vita Constantini, lib. ii. c. 46 and lib. iii. c. 3, and <i>Socratis</i> Hist. Eccles., lib. i. c. 9. Constantine added to the other Roman ensigns the <i>labarum</i>, or standard of the cross, and constituted it the principal standard of the Christian Roman empire. To this <i>labarum</i> Prudentius refers, when speaking of the Christian soldiers, in his first hymn περι στεφανων, </p>
<p>When the apostle saw the woman in <i>heaven</i>, well might he call it, in the spirit of prophecy, <i>a great wonder</i>.</p>
