NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.Verse Revelation 12:11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb — Here is given the reason why the followers of Christ prevailed at this time against all their adversaries. It was because they fought against the dragon in the armour of God. They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb-by proclaiming salvation to sinners through Christ crucified, and by their continual intercession at the throne of grace for the conversion of the heathen world.And by the word of their testimony — By constantly testifying against the errors and follies of mankind.And they loved not their lives unto the death. — They regarded not their present temporal estate, but even gladly delivered up their lives to the fury of their persecutors, and thus sealed the truth of what they spake with their blood.
