<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:12">Revelation 12:12</span>. <i><b>Therefore rejoice</b></i><b>, ye </b><i><b>heavens, and ye that dwell in</b></i><b> </b><i><b>them</b></i><i>.</i>] Let the Christians, who are now partakers of the present temporal prosperity, and advanced to places of trust in the empire, praise and magnify the Lord who has thus so signally interfered in their behalf. But it is added:-</p>
<p><i><b>Wo to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil</b></i><b> </b><i><b>is come down unto you</b></i> — By <i>the inhabiters of the earth</i> are meant the people in subjection to the Roman empire; and by the <i>sea</i>, those parts of the Roman dominions appear to be intended that were reduced to a state of anarchy by the incursions of the barbarous nations. It is not without precedent to liken great hosts of nations combined together to the sea. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+26:3">Ezekiel 26:3</span>. Here then is a wo denounced against the whole Roman world which will be excited by the devil, the father of lies, the heathen party being thus denominated from the method they pursued in their endeavours to destroy the religion of Jesus. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:15">Revelation 12:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short</b></i><b> </b><i><b>time.</b></i> — The Christian religion, the pagan party see with great regret, is rapidly gaining ground everywhere; and, if not timely checked, must soon brave all opposition.</p>
