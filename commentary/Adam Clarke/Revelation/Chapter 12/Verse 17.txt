<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:17">Revelation 12:17</span>. <i><b>And the dragon was wroth with the woman</b></i> — The heathen party, foiled in their subtle attempt to destroy Christianity, were greatly enraged, and endeavoured to excite the hatred of the multitude against the religion of Jesus. "They alleged that before the coming of Christ the world was blessed with peace and prosperity; but that since the progress of their religion everywhere, the gods, filled with indignation to see their worship neglected and their altars abandoned, had visited the earth with those plagues and desolations which increased every day." See Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, cent. V., part 1, and other works on this subject.</p>
<p><i><b>Went to make war with the remnant of her seed</b></i> — The dragon απηλθε, departed, i.e., into the wilderness, whither the woman had fled; and in another form commenced a new species of persecution, directed <i>only</i> against <i>the remnant of her seed, who</i> <i>keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i>. See on verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:13">Revelation 12:13</span> of the following chapter for an illustration of this remarkable passage. <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:13">Revelation 13:13</span><i>"</i></p>
