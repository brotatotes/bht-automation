<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:4">Revelation 12:4</span>. <i><b>And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven</b></i> — It is not unusual in Scripture, as Dr. Mitchell observes, to call the hindmost of an enemy the <i>tail</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jos+10:19">Joshua 10:19</span>: <i>Ye shall cut off the hindmost of them</i>, which is literally in Hebrew, אותם וזנבתם "Ye shall cut off their <i>tail</i>." See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+25:18">Deuteronomy 25:18</span>. It is also observable that the word ουρα, in this verse, has been used by the Greeks in the same sense with the Hebrew word זנב already referred to. Thus ουρα στρατου, which we would translate the <i>rear of an army</i>, is literally the <i>tail</i> of an army. See the Thesaurus of Stephens, in loc. The <i>tail</i> of the dragon is therefore the heathen Roman power in its <i>seventh</i> or <i>last</i> form of government, viz., <i>the imperial</i> <i>power</i>; and is not, as Dr. Mitchell supposes, to be restricted to the <i>last</i> heathen Roman emperors. The heathen imperial power is said to draw <i>the third part of the stars of heaven</i>, by which has generally been understood that the Roman empire subjected the third part of the princes and potentates of the earth. But that this is not a correct statement of the fact is evident from the testimony of ancient history. The Roman empire was always considered and called <i>the empire of the world</i> by ancient writers. See <i>Dionys. Halicar</i>., Antiq. Rom. lib. i., prope principium; <i>Pitisci</i> Lexicon Antiq. Roman., sub voc. imperium; <i>Ovidii</i> Fast., lib. ii. l. 683; <i>Vegetius</i> de Re Militari, lib. i. c. 1., c., c. And it is even so named in Scripture, for St. Luke, in the second chapter of his gospel, informs us that <i>there went out a decree</i> <i>from Caesar Augustus that THE WHOLE WORLD should be taxed</i>, by which is evidently meant <i>the Roman empire</i>. The whole mystery of this passage consists in the misapprehension of its symbolical language. In order therefore to understand it, the symbols here used must be examined. By <i>heaven</i> is meant the <i>most eminent</i> or <i>ruling part</i> of any nation. This is evident from the very nature of the symbol, for "<i>heaven</i> is God's throne" they therefore who are advanced to the supreme authority in any state are very properly said to be <i>taken up into heaven</i>, because they are raised to this eminence by the favour of the Lord, and are <i>ministers of</i> <i>his to do his pleasure</i>. And the calamity which fell upon Nebuchadnezzar was to instruct him in this important truth, that <i>the heavens do rule</i> that is, that all monarchs possess their kingdoms by Divine appointment, and that no man is raised to power by what is usually termed the chances of war, but that "the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men." The meaning of <i>heaven</i> being thus ascertained, it cannot be difficult to comprehend the meaning of <i>earth</i>, this being evidently its opposite, that is, every thing in subjection to the <i>heaven</i> or <i>ruling part</i>. <i>Stars</i> have already been shown to denote <i>ministers</i> <i>of religion</i>; and this is more fully evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span> of this book, where <i>the seven stars</i> which the Son of God holds in his right hand are explained to signify <i>the seven angels</i> (or messengers) <i>of the seven Churches</i>, by whom must be meant the <i>seven</i> <i>pastors</i> or <i>ministers</i> of these Churches. The resemblance of ministers to stars is very striking; for as the stars give light upon the earth, so are ministers the lights of the cause they advocate; and their position in <i>heaven</i>, the symbol of domination, very fitly betokens the spiritual authority of priests or ministers over their flocks. Hence, as the woman, or Christian Church, has upon her head a <i>crown</i> of twelve stars, which signifies that she is under the <i>guidance</i> of the twelve apostles, who are the twelve principal lights of the Christian world, so has the dragon also his <i>stars</i> or <i>ministers</i>. The stars therefore which the dragon draws with his tail must represent the whole body of pagan priests, who were the <i>stars</i> or <i>lights</i> of the heathen world. But in what sense can it be said that the heathen Roman empire, which ruled over the whole known world, only draws a <i>third part</i> of the stars of heaven? The answer is: The religious world in the time of St. John was divided into three grand branches, viz., the Christian world, the Jewish world, and the heathen and pagan world: consequently, as <i>a dragon</i>, a fabulous animal, is an emblem of a civil power supporting <i>a religion founded in fable</i>; it necessarily follows that the <i>stars</i> or <i>ministers</i> of the Jews and Christians cannot be numbered among those which he draws with his tail, as they were not the advocates of his idolatry, but were ministers of a religion founded by the God of heaven, and consequently formed no part of the pagan world, though they were in subjection in secular matters to the pagan Roman empire. The tail of the dragon therefore draweth after him <i>the whole heathen</i> <i>world</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And did cast then to the earth</b></i> — That is, reduced all the pagan priests under the Roman yoke. The words of the prophecy are very remarkable. It is said the tail of the dragon <i>draweth</i>, (for so συρει should be translated,) but it is added, <i>and HATH CAST then</i> <i>upon the earth</i>, to show that at the time the Apocalypse was written the world was divided into the three grand religious divisions already referred to; but that the tail of the dragon, or the pagan Roman power under its <i>last</i> form of government, had brought the whole heathen world (which was a third part of the religious world in the apostolic age) into subjection previously to the communication of the Revelation to St. John. It is the dragon's <i>tail</i> that draws the third part of the stars of heaven, therefore it was during the dominion of his <i>last</i> form of government that Christianity was introduced into the world; for in the time of the six preceding draconic forms of government, the world was divided religiously into only two grand branches, Jews and Gentiles. That the sense in which the <i>third part</i> is here taken is the one intended in the prophecy is put beyond all controversy, when it is considered that this very division is made in the first and third verses, in which mention is made of the <i>woman clothed</i> <i>with the sun</i>-the Christian Church, <i>the moon under her feet</i>, or Jewish Church, and the <i>dragon</i>, or heathen power. Thus the <i>heathen</i> <i>IMPERIAL government</i> is doubly represented, first, by <i>one</i> of the seven draconic heads, to show that it was one of those seven heathen forms of government which have been successively at the <i>head</i> of the Roman state; and secondly, by the dragon's <i>tail</i>, because it was the <i>last</i> of those seven. For a justification of this method of interpretation, see on the angel's double explanation of the heads of the beast, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:10">Revelation 17:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:16">Revelation 17:16</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And the dragon stood before the woman</b></i>, c.] Constantius Chlorus, the father of Constantine, abandoned the absurdities of paganism, and treated the Christians with great respect. This alarmed the pagan priests, whose interests were so closely connected with the continuance of the ancient superstitions, and who apprehended that to their great detriment the Christian religion would become daily more universal and triumphant throughout the empire. Under these anxious fears they moved Diocletian to persecute the Christians. Hence began what is termed the <i>tenth</i> and last general persecution, which was the most severe of all, and continued nearly ten years (see <i>Mosheim's</i> Ecclesiastical History of the Third Century;) and as it was the Divine pleasure that, at this time, a great deliverer should be raised up in behalf of his suffering people, the <i>woman</i>, or Christian Church, is very appropriately represented as overtaken with the pangs of labour, <i>and ready to be delivered</i>. Before the death of Constantius, the heathen party, aware that Constantine would follow the example of his father, who so much favoured the Christians, beheld him with a watchful and malignant eye. Many were the snares that, according to Eusebius, were laid for him by Maximin and Galerius: he relates the frequent and dangerous enterprises to which they urged him, with the design that he might lose his life. When Galerius heard of the death of Constantius, and that he had appointed Constantine his successor, he was filled with the most ungovernable rage and indignation, notwithstanding he did not dare to take any steps contrary to the interest of Constantine. The dread of the armies of the west, which were mostly composed of Christians, was a sufficient check to all attempts of that kind. Thus the dragon, or heathen power, stood before the woman, or Christian Church, to devour her son, or deliverer, as soon as he was born.
