They trod upon her, and the child came out of her bowels, and lay under the bed; <i>Michael descended, and took him up to the throne of</i> <i>glory</i>. On that same night the first born of Egypt were destroyed."</p>
<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Ver. 5. <i><b>And she brought forth a man child</b></i> — The Christian Church, when her full time came, obtained a <i>deliverer</i>, who, in the course of the Divine providence, was destined:-</p>
<p><i><b>To rule all nations</b></i> — The heathen Roman empire,</p>
<p><i><b>With a rod of iron</b></i> — A strong figure to denote the <i>very great</i> <i>restraint</i> that should be put upon paganism, so that it should not be able longer to persecute the Christian Church. The <i>man child</i> mentioned in this verse is <i>the dynasty of Christians emperors</i>, beginning with Constantine's public acknowledgment of his belief in the divinity of the Christian religion, which happened in the latter part of A.D. 312, after the defeat of the Emperor Maxentius.</p>
<p><i><b>And her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</b></i> — A succession of Christian emperors was raised up to the Church; for the Roman throne, as Bishop Newton observes, is here called the throne of God, because there is no power but of God: <i>the powers</i> <i>that be are ordained of God</i>.</p>
