<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7">Revelation 12:7</span>. <i><b>There was war in heaven</b></i> — In the same treatise, fol. 87, 2, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:7">Exodus 14:7</span>, <i>Pharaoh took six hundred chariots</i>, we have these words: "There was war among those <i>above</i> and among those <i>below</i>, בשמים חזקה היתה והמלחמה vehammilchamah hayethah chazakah bashshamayim, <i>and there was great war in heaven</i>."</p>
<p>Of <i>Michael</i> the rabbins are full. See much in <i>Schoettgen</i>, and see the note on Jude, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The dragon-and his angels</b></i> — The same as <i>Rab. Sam. ben David</i>, in <i>Chasad Shimuel</i>, calls וחיילותיו סמאל Samael vechayilothaiv, "<i>Samael and his troops</i>;" fol. 28, 2.</p>
<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Ver. 7. <i><b>And there was war in heaven</b></i> — As <i>heaven</i> means here the <i>throne</i> of the Roman empire, the war in heaven consequently alludes to the breaking out of civil commotions among the governors of this empire.</p>
<p><i><b>Michael and his angels fought against the dragon</b></i> — Michael was the man child which the woman brought forth, as is evident from the context, and therefore signifies, as has been shown already, the dynasty of Christian Roman emperors. This dynasty is represented by Michael, because he is "the great prince which standeth for the children of God's people." <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And the dragon fought and his angels</b></i> — Or ministers.</p>
