<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:8">Revelation 12:8</span>. <i><b>And prevailed not</b></i> — Against the cause of Christianity.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither was their place found any more in heaven.</b></i> — The advocates of the heathen idolatry were prevented from having any farther share in the government of the empire. The wonderful success of Constantine over all his enemies, and his final triumph over Licinius, correspond exactly to the symbolical language in this verse.</p>
