<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Ver. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>. <i><b>And the great dragon was cast out</b></i>, c.] By the terms <i>Devil</i> and <i>Satan</i> mentioned in this verse, Pareus, Faber, and many other commentators, understand literally the great spiritual enemy of mankind. But this view of the passage cannot be correct, from the circumstance that it is the <i>dragon</i> which is thus called. Now, if by the <i>dragon</i> be meant the <i>devil</i>, then use are necessarily led to this conclusion, that the great apostate spirit is a monster, having seven heads and ten horns and also that he has a <i>tail</i>, with which he drags after him the third part of the stars of heaven. The appellations, <i>old serpent, devil</i>, and <i>Satan</i>, must, therefore, be understood figuratively. The heathen power is called <i>that old serpent which deceived the whole world</i>, from its subtlety against the Christians, and its causing the whole Roman world, as far as it was in its power, to embrace the absurdities of paganism. It is called the <i>devil</i>, from its continual false accusations and slanders against the true worshippers of God, for the devil is <i>a liar from the beginning</i>; and it is also called <i>Satan</i>, שטן, which is a Hebrew word signifying <i>an adversary</i>, from its frequent persecutions of the Christian Church. The dragon and his angels are said to be <i>cast out</i>, which is more than was said in the preceding verse. There mention is made of his being found no longer in <i>heaven</i>, or on the throne of the Roman empire, here he is entirely cast out from all offices of trust in the empire; his religion is first only tolerated, and then totally abolished, by the imperial power. This great event was not the work of a reign; it took up many years, for it had to contend with the deep-rooted prejudices of the heathen, who to the very last endeavoured to uphold their declining superstition. Paganism received several mortal strokes in the time of Constantine and his sons Constans and Constantius. It was farther reduced by the great zeal of Jovian, Valentinian, and Valens; and was finally suppressed by the edicts of Gratian, Theodosius I., and his successors. It was not till A.D. 388 that Rome itself, the residence of the emperor, was generally reformed from the absurdities of paganism; but the total suppression of paganism soon followed the conversion of the metropolitan city, and about A.D. 395 the dragon may be considered, in an eminent sense, to have been <i>cast into the earth</i>, that is, into a state of utter subjection to the ruling dynasty of Christian emperors.</p>
