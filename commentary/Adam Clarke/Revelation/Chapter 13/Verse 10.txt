<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>. <i><b>He that leadeth into captivity shall go into</b></i><b> </b><i><b>captivity</b></i> — The Latin empire here spoken of must <i>go into</i> <i>captivity</i>, because it has led into captivity, by not only propagating among the various nations its abominable antichristian system, but also in compelling them to embrace it under the penalty of forfeiting the protection of the empire.</p>
<p><i><b>He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.</b></i> — The Latin empire must be also broken to pieces by the sword, because it has killed the saints of God. This prophecy will not receive its full accomplishment till <i>the kingdoms of this world</i> <i>become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</b></i> — By these words, as Dr. Mitchell observes, "God calls upon his saints to keep in view, under all their persecutions, his retributive justice; there is no violence that has been exercised upon them but what shall be retaliated upon the cruel and persecuting government and governors of the Latin empire."</p>
