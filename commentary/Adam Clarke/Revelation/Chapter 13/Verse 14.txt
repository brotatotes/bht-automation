<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>. <i><b>Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they</b></i><b> </b><i><b>should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>and did live.</b></i> â€” The <i>image of the beast</i> must designate a person who represents in himself the whole power of the Latin empire, therefore it cannot be the emperor; for though he was, according to his own account, <i>supremum caput Christianitatis</i>, the supreme head of Christendom, yet he was only the chief of the Germanic confederation, and consequently was only sovereign of the principal power of the Latin empire. The image of the beast must be the supreme ruler of the Latin empire, and as it is through the influence of the false prophet that this image is made for the first beast, this great chief must be an ecclesiastic. Who this is has been ably shown by Bishop Newton in his comment on the following verse.</p>
