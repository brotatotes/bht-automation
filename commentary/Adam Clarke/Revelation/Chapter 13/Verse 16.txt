<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>. <i><b>And he caused all, both small and great, rich and</b></i><b> </b><i><b>poor, free and bond, to receive a mark</b></i> — To ascertain the meaning of the <i>mark</i> which the two-horned beast causes all orders and degrees of men in the Latin world to receive, we need only refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:11">Revelation 14:11</span>, where the mark imposed by the two-horned beast is called <i>the mark of his name</i>. The <i>name of the beast</i> is <i>the Latin</i> <i>empire</i>: the <i>mark of his name</i> must therefore be <i>his LATIN worship</i>: for this very reason, that it is the two-horned beast, or false prophet, who causes all descriptions of persons to receive it. Now it is well known that the continual employment of the Latin clergy is to enforce the Latin idolatry upon their flocks. The mass and offices of the Church, which are in Latin, and contain the sum and substance of their idolatrous worship, are of different kinds, and abound in impious prayers to the Virgin Mary, and the saints and angels. In a word, <i>the LATIN worship</i> is the universal badge of distinction of <i>the LATIN Church</i>, from all other Churches on the face of the earth; and is therefore the only infallible MARK by which a genuine papist can be distinguished from the rest of mankind. But the two-horned beast causes all to receive this mark:-</p>
<p><i><b>In their right hand, or in their foreheads</b></i> — <i>Right hand</i> in Scripture language, when used figuratively, represents the physical power of the person of whom it is spoken; and when applied to God designates a signal manifestation of Divine power against his enemies, and in behalf of his people. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+17:7">Psalms 17:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+20:6">Psalms 20:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:8">Psalms 21:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:3">Psalms 45:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:4">Psalms 45:4</span>, c. The reception of the mark in the right hand must therefore mean, that all so receiving it devote the whole powers of their mind and body to the propagation of the Latin worship, and to the eradication of all they denominate heresies out of their Church. But some receive the mark <i>in their foreheads</i>. By any thing being impressed upon <i>the</i> <i>forehead</i>, is meant the public profession of whatever is inscribed or marked upon it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:4">Revelation 9:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span>, c. The mark of the beast being received on the <i>forehead</i>, therefore, means that all those so marked make a public profession of <i>the Latin worship</i> whereby it is evident to all that they form a part of the Latin Church. Many may be marked in the right hand who are also marked on their foreheads, but it does not follow that those marked on their foreheads are also marked in their right hand; that is to say, it is not every individual that complies with the Latin worship who, to the utmost of his power, endeavours to propagate his religious system. Hence the propriety of the words, "He causeth all-to receive a mark in their right hand, OR in their foreheads."</p>
