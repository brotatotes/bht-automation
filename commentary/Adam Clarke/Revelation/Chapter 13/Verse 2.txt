<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>. <i><b>And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard</b></i> — This similitude of the beast to a leopard appears to be an allusion to the third beast of Daniel, which is well known to represent the empire of the Greeks. The Latin empire greatly resembled the modern empire of the Greeks; for that the power of the Greeks was still said to be like a leopard, even after its subjugation by the Romans, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:12">Daniel 7:12</span>: "As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time." The Latin empire was, in the first place, like to its contemporary, because both adhered to an idolatrous system of worship, professedly Christian, but really antichristian; and it is well known that the Greek and Latin Churches abound in monstrous absurdities. <i>Secondly</i>, Both empires were similar in their opposition to the spread of pure Christianity; though it must be allowed that the Latins far outstripped the Greeks in this particular. <i>Thirdly</i>, Both empires were similar in respect to the civil authority being powerfully depressed by the ecclesiastical; though it must be granted the authority of the Latin Church was more strongly marked, and of much longer continuance. The excommunication of the Greek emperor by the Patriarch Arsenius, and the consequences of that excommunication, afford a remarkable example of the great power of the Greek clergy. But the beast of St. John, though in its general appearance it resembles a leopard, yet differs from it in having feet like those <i>of a bear</i>. The second beast of Daniel was likened to a bear, and there can be no doubt that the kingdom of the Medes and Persians was intended; and it is very properly likened to this animal, because it was one of the most inhuman governments that ever existed, and a <i>bear</i> is the well known Scripture emblem of <i>cruelty</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+17:8">2 Samuel 17:8</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:8">Hosea 13:8</span>. Is not <i>cruelty</i> a striking characteristic of the papal Latin empire? Have not the subjects of this empire literally trampled to death all those in their power who would not obey their idolatrous requisitions? In Fox's Book of Martyrs, and other works which treat upon this subject, will be found a melancholy catalogue of the horrid tortures and most lingering deaths which they have obliged great numbers of Christians to suffer. In this sense the feet of the beast <i>were as the feet of a bear</i>. Another particular in which the beast differed from a leopard was, in having a mouth like a <i>lion</i>. "It is," says Dr. More, "like the Babylonish kingdom (the first beast of Daniel, which is likened to a lion) in its <i>cruel decrees</i> against such as will not obey their idolatrous edicts, nor worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Their stubbornness must be punished by a hot fiery furnace; fire and fagot must be prepared for them that will not submit to this new Roman idolatry."</p>
<p><i><b>And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great</b></i><b> </b><i><b>authority.</b></i> — It was said of the dragon, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:8">Revelation 12:8</span>, that his place was found <i>no more</i> in heaven; the dragon here cannot therefore be the heathen Roman empire, as this was abolished previously to the rising up of the beast. It must then allude to the restoration of one of the DRACONIC heads of the beast, as will be seen in the explanation of the following verse, and more fully in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1-18">Revelation 17:1-18</span>.</p>
