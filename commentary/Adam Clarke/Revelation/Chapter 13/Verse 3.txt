<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3">Revelation 13:3</span>. <i><b>And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death</b></i> — This is the second and last place where the heads of the beast are mentioned with any description; and therefore the meaning here must be <i>forms of government</i>, as these were noticed last in the angel's double explanation. The head that was wounded to death can be no other than the seventh draconic head, which was the sixth head of the beast, viz,, <i>the imperial power</i>; for "this head," as Bishop Newton observes, "was, as it were, wounded to death when the Roman empire was overturned by the northern nations, and an end was put to the very name of emperor in Momyllus Augustulus." It was so wounded that it was wholly improbable that it could ever rise again to considerable power, for the western empire came into the possession of several barbarous nations of independent interests.</p>
<p><i><b>And his deadly wound was healed</b></i> — This was effected by Charlemagne, who with his successors assumed all the marks of the ancient emperors of the west, with the titles of Semper Augustus, Sacred Majesty, First Prince of the Christian World, Temporal Chief of the Christian People, and Rector or Temporal Chief of the Faithful in Germany; Mod. Universal History, vol. xxxii., p. 79. But it is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span> that the dragon gave the beast <i>his power</i>, δυναμιν, <i>his armies</i> or <i>military strength</i>; i.e., he employed all his imperial power in defense of the Latin empire, which supported the Latin Church. He also gave <i>his seat</i>, θρονον, literally <i>his throne</i>, to him: that is, his whole empire formed an integral part of the Latin empire, by its conversion to the Roman Catholic faith. He also gave him <i>great authority</i>. This is literally true of the Roman empire of Germany, which, by its great power and influence in the politics of Europe, extended the religion of the empire over the various states and monarchies of Europe, thus incorporating them as it were in one vast empire, by uniting them in one common faith.</p>
<p><i><b>And all the world wondered after the beast.</b></i> — ολη η γη <i>All the</i> <i>earth</i>. As the original word signifies <i>earth</i>, and not <i>world</i> as in our translation, the Latin world, which is the <i>earth</i> of the beast, is here intended; and the meaning of the passage consequently is, that the whole body of the Roman Catholics were affected with great astonishment at the mighty sway of the Latin empire, considering it as a great and holy power.</p>
