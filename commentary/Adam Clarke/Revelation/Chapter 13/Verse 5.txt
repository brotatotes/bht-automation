<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:5">Revelation 13:5</span>. <i><b>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great</b></i><b> </b><i><b>things</b></i> — That is, There was given to the rulers of the Latin empire, who are the <i>mouth</i> of the beast, (and particularly the Roman emperors of Germany,) power to assume great and pompous titles, indicative of their mighty sway over many subjugated countries, (see the imperial instruments of the middle centuries in the Corps Diplomatique,) and also to utter against their opponents the most terrible edicts.</p>
<p><i><b>And blasphemies</b></i> — The system of worship supported by the beast is a system of blasphemy, as there will be occasion to show presently.</p>
<p><i><b>And power was given unto him to continue forty</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>two months</b></i><i>.</i>] As these forty-two months are prophetic, they must mean so many <i>years</i> as there are <i>days</i> contained in them; <i>viz</i>., 1260, each month containing 30 days. The beast, therefore, will continue in existence at least 1260 years; but when the termination of this period will take place is difficult to say, as the beginning cannot be at present indubitably ascertained.</p>
