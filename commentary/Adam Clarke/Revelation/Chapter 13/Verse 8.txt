<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>. <i><b>And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb</b></i> — The <i>earth</i> here is the <i>Latin world</i>, as has been observed before in similar cases. The meaning therefore is, that all the corrupt part of mankind who are inhabitants of the Latin world shall submit to the religion of the empire, except, as Bishop Newton expresses it, "those faithful few whose names, as citizens of heaven, were enrolled in the registers of life."</p>
<p><i><b>Slain from the foundation of the world.</b></i> — That is, of the Christian world; for this has been shown to be the meaning of <i>all</i> <i>kindreds, and tongues, and nations</i>. The year of the crucifixion is properly the commencement of Christianity, as the apostles then first began to promulgate the religion of Christ with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven. But as Jesus Christ was in the Divine purpose appointed from the foundation of the world to redeem man by his blood, he therefore is, in a very eminent sense, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, i.e., from the creation.</p>
