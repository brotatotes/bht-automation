<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>. <i><b>A Lamb stood on the mount Sion</b></i> — This represents Jesus Christ in his <i>sacrificial office; mount Sion</i> was a type of the Christian Church.</p>
<p><i><b>And with him a hundred forty</b></i> and <i>four thousand</i>] Representing those who were converted to Christianity from among the <i>Jews</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+7:4">Revelation 7:4</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>His Father's name written in their foreheads.</b></i> — They were professedly, openly, and practically, the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus. Different <i>sects</i> of idolaters have the <i>peculiar mark</i> of their god on their foreheads. This is practised in the east to the present day, and the mark is called the <i>sectarial mark</i>. Between eighty and ninety different figures are found on the foreheads of different Hindoo deities and their followers.</p>
<p>Almost every MS. of importance, as well as most of the <i>versions</i> and many of the <i>fathers</i>, read this clause thus: <i>Having HIS NAME</i> <i>and his Father's name written upon their foreheads</i>. This is undoubtedly the true reading, and is properly received by <i>Griesbach</i> into the text.</p>
