<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>. <i><b>Here is the patience of the saints</b></i> — Here the faith of the true Christians shall be proved; they <i>will</i> follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, they keep the commandments of God, and are steadfast in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Sometimes ηυπομονη, <i>patience</i> or <i>perseverance</i>, is taken for the <i>reward</i> of these virtues; the text therefore may be thus understood: Here is the reward of the perseverance of the true Christians; for although they die for the testimony of Jesus, yet they shall be unutterably blessed. See the next verse.</p>
