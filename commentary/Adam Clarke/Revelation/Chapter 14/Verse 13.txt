<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span>. <i><b>I heard a voice from heaven</b></i> — As the information now to be given was of the utmost importance, it is solemnly communicated by a voice from heaven; and the apostle is commanded to write or record what is said.</p>
<p><i><b>Blessed are the dead</b></i> — Happy are they. They are <i>happy</i> in <i>two</i> respects: 1. They do not see the evil that shall come upon the world, and are exempted from any farther sufferings. 2. They actually and conscientiously enjoy happiness in a state of blessedness.</p>
<p>In the first sense, <i>Happy are the dead</i>! is a proverb frequently to be met in the Greek and Roman poets. <i>Ex. gr.</i></p>
<p><i><b>From henceforth</b></i> — απαρτι <i>From this time; now; immediately</i>. This word is joined to the following by many MSS. and some <i>versions</i>. It was a maxim among the Jews, that as soon as the souls of the just departed from this life they ascended <i>immediately</i> to heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>Yea, saith the Spirit</b></i> — The Holy Spirit confirms the declaration from heaven, and assigns the reasons of it.</p>
<p><i><b>That they may rest from their labours</b></i> — Have no more tribulation and distress.</p>
<p><i><b>And their works do follow there.</b></i> — εργααυτωνακολουθειμετ αυτων <i>And their works follow WITH them</i>. They are in <i>company</i>. Here is an elegant prosopopoeia or personification; their good works, sufferings, c., are represented as so many <i>companions</i> escorting them on their way to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>There are some good and pertinent things in the Jewish writers on this subject. "<i>Rabbi Jonathan</i> taught, If a man perform one righteous action in this life, <i>it goes before him</i> into the world to come. But if a man commit one crime, it <i>cleaves</i> to him, and <i>drags him to the day of judgment</i>." <i>Sota</i>, fol. 3, 2. <i>Avoda Sara</i>, fol. 5, 1.</p>
<p>"Come and see, If any man observe a precept, that work ascends to God, and says, <i>Such a one performed me</i>. But if a man transgress the law, that sin ascends to the holy blessed God, and says, <i>I</i> <i>came from</i> such a one, <i>who has performed me</i>." <i>Sohar Levit</i>., fol. 34, col. 136. Here the same personification is observed as that in the text.</p>
<p>"In that hour in which a man passes from this life into eternity, <i>all his works precede him</i> and there they say unto him, 'This and that thou hast done in such a place on such a day.' This he shall acknowledge. They shall require that he shall subscribe this with his own hand, as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+37:7">Job 37:7</span>; each man shall subscribe with his own hand; and not only this, but he shall acknowledge that the sentence brought against him is most just." <i>Taanith</i>, fol. 11, 1.</p>
<p>The following elegant similitude <i>Schoettgen</i> gives from <i>Sepher</i> <i>Hachayim</i>, Part II., fol. 47, 1, 2. "A certain man had three friends, <i>two</i> of whom he loved; but the <i>third</i> he did not highly esteem. On a time the king commanded him to be called before him; and being alarmed, he sought to find an advocate. He went to that <i>friend</i> whom he loved most, but he utterly refused to go with him. The <i>second</i> offered to go with him as far as the door of the king's palace, but refused to speak a word in his behalf. The <i>third</i>, whom he loved least, not only went with him, but pleaded his cause so well before the king that he was cleared from all blame. In like manner, every man has three friends, when he is cited by death to appear before God. The <i>first</i> friend, whom he loved most, viz., his <i>money</i>, cannot accompany him at all. His <i>second</i>, viz., his <i>relations</i> and <i>neighbours</i>, accompanied him only to the <i>grave</i>, and then returned; but could not deliver him from the Judge. The <i>third</i> friend, whom he held but in little esteem, viz., the law and his good works, <i>went with him</i> to the king, and delivered him from judgment." The meaning of this most plainly is, that nothing except the <i>deeds</i> of good and evil men shall accompany them to the judgment-seat of God, and that a man's lot will be in the other world as his conduct has been in this; <i>Their works</i> <i>follow with them</i>.</p>
