<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:20">Revelation 14:20</span>. <i><b>Even unto the horse bridles</b></i> â€” A hyperbolical expression, to denote a <i>great effusion of blood</i>. The Jews said, "When Hadrian besieged the city called Bitter, he slew so many that the horses waded in blood up to their mouths." The same kind of hyperbole with that above. See Wetstein on this verse.</p>
<p><i><b>The space of a thousand</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>six hundred furlongs</b></i><i>.</i>] It is said that the <i>state of the Church</i>, or St. Peter's patrimony, extends from Rome to the Po, <i>two hundred Italian miles</i>, which make exactly <i>one thousand six hundred furlongs</i>! If this be really so, the coincidence is certainly surprising, and worthy of deep regard.</p>
<p>On these two last verses pious Quesnel thus speaks: "As the favourable sickle of Jesus Christ reaps his wheat when ripe for heaven, so that of the executioners of his justice cuts off from this life the tares which are only fit for the fire of hell. Then shall the blood of Christ cease to be trampled on by sinners; and that of the wicked shall be eternally trodden down in hell, which is the <i>winepress of the wrath of God</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>And the winepress was trodden without the city</i>, eternally without the city of the heavenly Jerusalem, and far from the presence of God; eternally crushed and trodden down by his justice; eternally tormented in body and soul, without any hope either of living or dying! This is the miserable lot and portion of those who shall have despised the law of God, and died in impenitence. My God, pierce my heart with a salutary dread of thy judgments!"</p>
<p>Whatever these passages may mean, this is a prudent and Christian use of them.</p>
