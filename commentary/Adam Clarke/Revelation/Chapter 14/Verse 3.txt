Verse Revelation 14:3. They sung-a new song — Revelation 5:9; Revelation 5:9.No man could learn that song — As none but genuine Christians can worship God acceptably, because they approach him through the only Mediator, so none can understand the deep things of God but such; nor can others know the cause why true believers exult so much in God through Christ, because they know not the communion which such hold with the Father and the Son through the Holy Ghost.
