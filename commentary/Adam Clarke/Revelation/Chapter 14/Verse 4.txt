<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span>. <i><b>These are they which were not defiled with women</b></i> — They are pure from idolatry, and are presented as unspotted <i>virgins</i> to their Lord and Saviour Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>. There may be an allusion here to the Israelites committing idolatry, through the means of their criminal connection with the Midianitish women.

<p><i><b>Follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth</b></i> — They go through good and through evil report, bear his reproach, and love not their lives even to the death.</p>
<p><i><b>The first fruits unto God</b></i> — The reference appears to be to those <i>Jews</i> who were the <i>first converts to</i> Christianity.</p>
