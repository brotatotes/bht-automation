<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>. <i><b>Another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>everlasting Gospel</b></i> â€” Whether this angel mean any more than a particular dispensation of providence and grace, by which the Gospel shall be rapidly sent throughout the whole world; or whether it mean any especial messenger, order of preachers, people, or society of Christians, whose professed object it is to send the Gospel of the kingdom throughout the earth, we know not. But the vision seems truly descriptive of a late institution, entitled THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN BIBLE SOCIETY, whose object it is to print and circulate the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, through all the habitable world, and in all the languages spoken on the face of the earth. Already they have been the instruments, by actually printing (or by affording the means to different nations to print for themselves) the Bible in a vast number of languages and dialects, so that it has been sent in hundreds of thousands of copies, in whole or in part, to almost every part of the globe: viz., in their native language to the <i>Welsh</i>; in <i>Erse</i> to the <i>Irish</i>; in <i>Gaelic</i> to the <i>Highlands</i> of Scotland; in <i>Manks</i> to the <i>Isle of Man</i>; in <i>French, Italian,</i> <i>Portuguese</i>, and <i>Spanish</i>, to those countries and <i>Switzerland</i>; in <i>Low Dutch</i> to <i>Holland</i>, c. in <i>High Dutch</i> to <i>Germany, Prussia</i>, c. Through them a similar society has been established at St. Petersburgh, by which the Bible has been sent in <i>Slavonic</i> to the Russians and in different dialects to the people of that vast empire; besides the <i>Turkish, Tartaric</i>, and <i>Calmuck</i>. They have also sent the Holy Scriptures in <i>ancient</i> and <i>modern Greek</i> to <i>Asia Minor</i> and the different <i>isles</i> of the <i>Mediterranean Sea</i>; in <i>Arabic</i> and <i>AEthiopic</i> to <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Abyssinia</i>; in <i>Syriac</i> to the <i>Holy</i> <i>Land</i>, and to the <i>Christians</i> at <i>Travancore</i>. They have also greatly and effectually assisted a very worthy society in the East Indies, whose indefatigable and incomparable missionaries, the Rev. Messrs. Carey, Marshman, and Ward, have translated the Scriptures into the principal languages of India; and they have furnished the means of printing a complete translation of the New Testament in the Chinese language at Canton, by the Rev. Mr. Morrison. In short, almost every nation in the universe has, through this society, <i>directly</i> or <i>indirectly</i> received, or is receiving, the words of eternal life; so that it appears to answer the description of the Apocalyptic "angel, flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."</p>
