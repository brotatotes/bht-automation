<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>. <i><b>Babylon is fallen, is fallen</b></i> — This is generally understood to be a prediction concerning <i>Rome</i>; and it is certain that <i>Rome</i>, in the rabbinical writings, is termed <i>Babylon</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That great city</b></i> — Among the same writers this city is styled קרתא רבתא karta rabbetha, <i>the great city</i>; and רומי רבתא Romi rabbetha, <i>the great Rome</i>. But <i>which</i> Rome is meant? <i>Pagan</i> or <i>Papal</i> Rome? Some parts of the description apply best to the former.</p>
<p><i><b>The wine of the wrath of her fornication.</b></i> — There is an allusion here to a custom of impure women, who give <i>philtres</i> or <i>love</i> <i>potions</i> to those whom they wish to seduce and bind to their will; and these potions are generally of an <i>intoxicating</i> nature, greatly inflaming the blood, and disturbing the intellect.</p>
<p><i>Fornication</i> and <i>adultery</i> are frequently used in Scripture as emblems of idolatry and false worship.</p>
<p><i>The wine of the wrath</i> is another expression for the <i>envenomed</i> or <i>poisoned cup</i> given by such women.</p>
<p>No nation of the earth spread their <i>idolatries</i> so far as the <i>ancient Romans</i>; they were as extensive as their conquests. And <i>papal Rome</i> has been not less active in disseminating her superstitions. She has given her <i>rituals</i>, but not the <i>everlasting</i> <i>Gospel</i>, to most nations of the earth.</p>
