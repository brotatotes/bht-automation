<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>. <i><b>Seven angels having the seven last plagues</b></i> — Under the emblems of <i>harvest</i> and <i>vintage</i> God's judgments on the enemies of his Church have already been pointed out: but these are farther signified by the <i>seven vials</i>, which are called the seven last plagues of God. The seven last plagues appear to fall under the seventh and last <i>trumpet</i>. As the <i>seventh seal</i> contained the <i>seven</i> <i>trumpets</i>, so the seventh trumpet contains the <i>seven vials</i>. And as seven angels sounded the seven trumpets, so seven angels are appointed to pour out the seven vials, angels being always the ministers of Providence. This chapter contains the opening vision which is preparatory to the pouring out of the vials.</p>
