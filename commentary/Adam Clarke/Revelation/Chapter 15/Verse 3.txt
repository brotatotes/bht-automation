Verse Revelation 15:3. They sing the song of Moses — That which Moses sang, Exodus 15:1, when he and the Israelites, by the miraculous power of God, had got safely through the Red Sea, and saw their enemies all destroyed.And the song of the Lamb — The same song adapted to the state of the suffering, but now delivered Christians.Great and marvellous are thy works] God's works are descriptive of his infinite power and wisdom.Lord God Almighty — Nearly the same as Jehovah, God of hosts.Just and true are thy ways — Every step God takes in grace or providence is according to justice, and he carefully accomplishes all his threatenings and all his promises; to this he is bound by his truth.
