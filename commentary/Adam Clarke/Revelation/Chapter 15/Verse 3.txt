<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+15:3">Revelation 15:3</span>. <i><b>They sing the song of Moses</b></i> — That which Moses sang, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:1">Exodus 15:1</span>, when he and the Israelites, by the miraculous power of God, had got safely through the Red Sea, and saw their enemies all destroyed.</p>
<p><i><b>And the song of the Lamb</b></i> — The same song adapted to the state of the suffering, but now delivered Christians.</p>
<p><i><b>Great and marvellous</b></i> are <i>thy works</i>] God's works are descriptive of his <i>infinite power</i> and <i>wisdom</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Lord God Almighty</b></i> — Nearly the same as <i>Jehovah, God of hosts</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Just and true</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>thy ways</b></i> — Every step God takes in grace or providence is according to <i>justice</i>, and he carefully accomplishes all his <i>threatenings</i> and all his <i>promises</i>; to this he is bound by his truth.</p>
