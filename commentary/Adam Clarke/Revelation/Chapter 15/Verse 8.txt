<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+15:8">Revelation 15:8</span>. <i><b>The temple was filled with smoke</b></i> â€” So was the tabernacle when consecrated by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:34-35">Exodus 40:34-35</span>, and the temple when consecrated by Solomon, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:10-11">1 Kings 8:10-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ch+5:14">2 Chronicles 5:14</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:4">Isaiah 6:4</span>. This account seems at least partly copied from those above.</p>
<p>When the high priest entered into the holy of holies, and the ordinary priest into the holy place, they always carried with them a great deal of <i>smoking incense</i>, which filled those places with smoke and darkness, which prevented them from considering too attentively the parts and ornaments of those holy places, and thus served to produce an air of majesty in the temple, which none dared to approach without the deepest reverence. To this <i>Calmet</i> thinks the allusion may be here.</p>
