<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:1">Revelation 16:1</span>. <i><b>Go your ways, and pour out</b></i> â€” These ministers of the Divine justice were ready to execute vengeance upon transgressors, having full power; but could do nothing in this way till they received <i>especial commission</i>. Nothing can be done without the <i>permission</i> of God; and in the manifestation of justice or mercy by Divine agency, there must be positive command.</p>
