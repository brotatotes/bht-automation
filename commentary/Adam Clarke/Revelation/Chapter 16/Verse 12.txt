Verse Revelation 16:12. Upon the great river Euphrates — Probably meaning the people in the vicinity of this river; though some think that the Tiber is intended.The water thereof was dried up — The people discomfited, and all impediments removed.The kings of the east — There seems to be an allusion here to the ruin of Babylon by Cyrus, predicted by the Prophet Jeremiah, Jeremiah 50:1-64. But what city or people is pointed out by this Babylon it is in vain to conjecture.
