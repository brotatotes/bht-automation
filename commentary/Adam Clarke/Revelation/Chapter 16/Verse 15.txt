<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>. <i><b>Behold, I come as a thief.</b></i> — Here is a sudden but timely warning to put every man on his guard, when this sudden and generally unexpected tribulation should take place.</p>
<p><i><b>Keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked</b></i> — Here is a plain allusion to the office of him who was called the <i>prefect</i> or <i>overseer, of the mountain of the temple</i>. His custom was to go his rounds during the watches of the night; and if he found any of the Levites sleeping on his watch, he had authority to beat him with a stick, and burn his vestments. See <i>Middoth</i>, fol. 34, 1, and <i>Tamid</i>. fol. 27, 2; 28, 1. Such a person being found on his return home <i>naked</i>, it was at once known that he had been found <i>asleep at</i> <i>his post</i>, had been <i>beaten</i>, and his <i>clothes burnt</i>; thus his <i>shame</i> was seen-he was reproached for his infidelity and irreligion.</p>
