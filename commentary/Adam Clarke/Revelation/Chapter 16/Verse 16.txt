<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:16">Revelation 16:16</span>. <i><b>Armageddon.</b></i> — The original of this word has been variously formed, and variously translated. It is הר־מגדון <i>har-megiddon</i>, "the mount of the assembly;" or חרמה גדהון <i>chormah</i> <i>gedehon</i>, "the destruction of their army;" or it is הר־מגדו <i>har-megiddo</i>, "Mount Megiddo," the valley of which was remarkable for two great slaughters: one of the Israelites, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:29">2 Kings 23:29</span>, the other of the Canaanites, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+4:16">Judges 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+5:19">Judges 5:19</span>. But <i>Mount Megiddo</i>, that is Carmel, is the place, according to some, where these armies should be collected.</p>
<p>But what is the <i>battle of Armageddon</i>? How ridiculous have been the conjectures of men relative to this point! Within the last twenty years this battle has been fought at various places, according to our purblind seers and self-inspired prophets! At one time it was <i>Austerlitz</i>, at another <i>Moscow</i>, at another <i>Leipsic</i>, and now <i>Waterloo</i>! And thus they have gone on, and will go on, confounding and being confounded.</p>
