Verse Revelation 16:21. A great hail-about the weight of a talent — Has this any reference to cannon balls and bombs? It is very doubtful; we are all in the dark in these matters.The words ως ταλαντιαια, as a talent, are used to express something great, excessively oppressive; as νοσηματων ταλαντιαιων, terrible diseases, not diseases of the weight of a talent. See Rosenmuller.
