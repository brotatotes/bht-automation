<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:3">Revelation 16:3</span>. <i><b>As the blood of a dead man</b></i> â€” Either meaning blood in a state of <i>putrescency</i>, or an effusion of blood in <i>naval conflicts</i>; even the sea was tinged with the blood of those who were slain in these wars. This is most probably the meaning of this vial. These engagements were so sanguinary that both the conquerors and the conquered were nearly destroyed; <i>every living soul died in the</i> <i>sea</i>.</p>
