<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:4">Revelation 16:4</span>. <i><b>Upon the rivers and fountains of waters</b></i> â€” This is an allusion to the <i>first</i> Egyptian plague, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:20">Exodus 7:20</span>; and to those plagues in general there are allusions throughout this chapter. It is a sentiment of the rabbins that "whatever plagues God inflicted on the Egyptians in former times, he will inflict on the enemies of his people in all later times." See a long quotation on this subject from <i>Rabbi Tanchum</i> in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
