<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:5">Revelation 16:5</span>. <i><b>The angel of the waters</b></i> â€” The rabbins attribute angels, not only to the four elements so called, but to almost every thing besides. We have already seen the <i>angel</i> of the <i>bottomless pit</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</span>, and <i>the angel of the fire</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:18">Revelation 14:18</span>. The <i>angel</i> of the <i>earth</i> is spoken of in <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 13, 2, and is called <i>Admael</i>. They have also an <i>angel</i> that presides over the <i>grass</i>; another that presides over the <i>cattle</i> which feed upon the grass.</p>
<p>They say that God employed the <i>angel of the sea</i> to swallow up the waters at the creation, that the dry land might appear. He disobeyed, and God slew him; the name of the angel of the sea is <i>Rahab</i>. See <i>Baba bathra</i>, fol. 74, 2. It is plain from several places that the writer of the Apocalypse keeps these notions distinctly in view.</p>
