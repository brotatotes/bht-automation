<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+16:8">Revelation 16:8</span>. <i><b>Poured out his vial upon the sun</b></i> â€” Mr. Robert Fleming, more than <i>one hundred</i> years ago, in his <i>View of Scripture</i> <i>Prophecy</i>, supposed that the <i>sun</i> here meant the <i>French empire</i>, and conjectured that this vial would be poured out on that empire about the year 1794. And it is remarkable that in 1793 the French king was beheaded by the National Assembly; and great and unparalleled miseries fell upon the French nation, which nearly extinguished all their nobility, and brought about a war that lasted twenty-three years, and nearly ruined that country and all the nations of Europe.</p>
