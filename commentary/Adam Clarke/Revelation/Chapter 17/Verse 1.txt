<p>NOTES ON CHAP. XVII., BY J. E. C.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>. <i><b>And there came one of the seven angels which had the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither I</b></i><b> </b><i><b>will show unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth</b></i><b> </b><i><b>upon many waters</b></i> â€” That idolatrous worship is frequently represented in Scripture under the character of <i>a whore</i> or <i>whoredom</i>, is evident from numerous passages which it is unnecessary to quote. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ch+5:25">1 Chronicles 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:1-63">Ezekiel 16:1-63</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+23:1-49">Ezekiel 23:1-49</span>, &amp;c. The woman mentioned here is called <i>a great whore</i>, to denote her excessive depravity, and the artful nature of her idolatry. She is also represented as <i>sitting upon many waters</i>, to show the vast extent of her influence. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:13">Revelation 17:13</span>.</p>
