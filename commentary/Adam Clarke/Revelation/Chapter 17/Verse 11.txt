<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:11">Revelation 17:11</span>. <i><b>And the beast, that was, and is not, even he is the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</b></i> — That is to say, the Latin kingdom that has already been, but is now no longer nominally in existence, shall immediately follow the dissolution of the seventh form of Latin government; and this dominion is called ογδοος, <i>an eighth</i>, because it succeeds to the seventh. Yet it is not an eighth <i>head</i> of the beast, because the beast has only <i>seven</i> heads; for to constitute a new head of the beast the form of government must not only differ in <i>nature</i>, but also in <i>name</i>. This head of the beast is, therefore, εκτωνεπτα, <i>ONE of the</i> <i>seven</i>. Consequently the form of government represented by this head is the restoration of one of the preceding seven. The restored head can be therefore no other than the regal state of the Latins, or in other words <i>the Latin kingdom</i>, (ηλατινη βασιλεια,) which followed the patriciate or seventh head of Latin government. But the beast in his eighth state, or under his first head restored, <i>goeth into perdition</i>. No other form of Latin government shall succeed; but the beast in his last or antichristian condition shall be taken together with the false prophet that wrought miracles in his sight, "and cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."</p>
<p>It is observable that the eighth Latin power is called by the angel <i>the beast</i>, and also <i>one</i> of his heads. This apparent discordance arises from the double signification of the heads, for if we take the beast upon which the woman sits to be merely a representation of that secular power which supports the Latin Church, then the seven heads will represent the seven electorates of the Germanic empire; but if by the beast we understand the general Latin empire from first to last, then what is, according to the angel's first interpretation of the heads, called <i>the</i> <i>beast</i>, is in this case only <i>one</i> of his heads. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:18">Revelation 17:18</span>.</p>
