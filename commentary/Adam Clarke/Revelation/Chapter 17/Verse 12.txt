<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12">Revelation 17:12</span>. <i><b>And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings</b></i><b> </b><i><b>one hour with the beast.</b></i> — The meaning of <i>horns</i> has already been defined when speaking of those of the dragon. The meaning is therefore as follows: Though the Latin empire be now in existence, the ten horns refer to ten Latin kingdoms yet in futurity, and consequently they have received no dominion AS YET; for that part of the Latin domination now in power is the <i>sixth</i> head, or imperial government of the heathen Caesars. But the ten states of the Latins receive dominion as monarchies μιανωραν, one time, (as it may be properly translated,) i.e., at the same time with the beast, or that which ascendeth out of the bottomless pit; consequently, the Latin empire here intended is the one which was in futurity in the apostolic age.</p>
