<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:14">Revelation 17:14</span>. <i><b>These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall</b></i><b> </b><i><b>overcome them; for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and</b></i><b> </b><i><b>they that are with him</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>called, and chosen, and, faithful</b></i><i>.</i>] The ten powers of the beast must compose the secular kingdom of antichrist, for they make war <i>with the Lamb</i>, who is Christ Jesus. This is perfectly true of all popish states, for they have constantly opposed, as long as they have had any secular power, the progress of pure Christianity. They make war with the Lamb by persecuting his followers; <i>but the Lamb shall overcome them, for</i> <i>he is the Lord of lords, and King of kings</i>-all lords have their authority from him, and no king can reign without him; therefore the ten Latin kings are God's ministers to execute his vengeance upon the idolatrous nations. But when these antichristian monarchies have executed the Divine purpose, those that are with the Lamb-the called, the chosen, and the faithful, those who have kept THE TRUTH in the love of it, shall prevail against all their adversaries, because their battles are fought by the Lamb, who is their God and Deliverer.
