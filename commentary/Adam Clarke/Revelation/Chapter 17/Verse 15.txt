<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span>. <i><b>And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>and tongues.</b></i> â€” "So many words," Bishop Newton observes, "in the plural number, fitly denote the great extensiveness of her power and jurisdiction. She herself glories in the title of the <i>Catholic</i> Church, and exults in the number of her votaries as a certain proof of the true religion. Cardinal Bellarmin's first note of the true Church is, <i>the very name of the Catholic Church</i>; and his fourth note is, <i>amplitude, or multitude, and variety of believers</i>; for the truly Catholic Church, says he, ought not only to comprehend all ages, but likewise all <i>places</i>, all <i>nations</i>, all <i>kinds</i> of men."</p>
