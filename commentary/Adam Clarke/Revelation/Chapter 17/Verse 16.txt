<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:16">Revelation 17:16</span>. <i><b>And the ten horns which thou sowest upon the beast,</b></i> <i>these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked,</i> <i>and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</i>] Here is a clue to lead us to the right interpretation of <i>the horns</i> of the beast. It is said the <i>TEN horns</i> shall <i>hate</i> the whore; by which is evidently meant, when connected with what follows, that <i>the whole</i> of the ten kingdoms in the interest of the Latin Church shall finally despise her doctrines, be reformed from popery, assist in depriving her of all influence and in exposing her follies, and in the end consign her to utter destruction. From this it follows that no Roman Catholic power which did not exist so late as the Reformation can be numbered among the horns of the beast; the horns must, therefore, be found among the great states of Europe at the commencement of the Reformation. These were exactly ten, viz., <i>France, Spain, England, Scotland, The Empire, Sweden,</i> <i>Denmark, Poland, Hungary</i>, and <i>Portugal</i>. In these were comprehended most of the minor states not styled monarchies, and which, from their first rise to the period of the Reformation, had been subdued by one or more of the ten grand Roman Catholic powers already named. Consequently, these ten constituted <i>the power and</i> <i>strength of the beast</i>; and each minor state is considered a part of that monarchy under the authority of which it was finally reduced previously to the Reformation.</p>
<p>But it may be asked, How could <i>the empire</i>, which was the revived <i>head</i> of the beast, have been at the same time one of its <i>horns</i>? The answer is as follows: <i>Horns of an animal</i>, in the language of prophecy, represent the powers of which that empire or kingdom symbolized by the animal is composed. Thus the angel, in his interpretation of Daniel's vision of the ram and he-goat expressly informs us that "the ram with two horns are the kings of Media and Persia." One of the horns of the ram, therefore, represented the kingdom of Media, and the other the kingdom of Persia; and their union in one animal denoted the united kingdom of Media and Persia, viz., the Medo-Persian empire. In like manner the beast with ten horns denotes that the empire represented by the beast is composed of ten distinct powers, and the ten horns being united in <i>one beast</i> very appropriately show that the monarchies symbolized by these horns are united together to form <i>one empire</i>; for we have already shown, in <i>Clarke's notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span><i>"</i>, that <i>a beast</i> is the symbol of <i>an empire</i>. Therefore, as the <i>horns</i> of an animal, agreeably to the angel's explanation, (and we can have no higher authority,) represent <i>all</i> the powers of which that domination symbolized by the animal is composed, the Roman empire of Germany, as one of those monarchies which gave their power and strength to the Latin empire, must consequently have been <i>A HORN</i> <i>of the beast</i>. But the Germanic empire was not only <i>a LATIN power</i>, but at the same time was acknowledged by all Europe to have <i>precedency</i> of all the others. Therefore, as it is not possible to express these <i>two</i> circumstances by <i>one</i> symbol, it necessarily follows, from the nature of symbolical language, that what has been named the holy Roman empire must have a <i>double</i> representation. Hence the empire, as <i>one</i> of the powers of the Latin monarchy, was <i>a horn</i> of the beast, and in having <i>precedency</i> of all the others was its revived <i>head</i>. See a similar explanation of the tail of the dragon in <i>Clarke's notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:4">Revelation 12:4</span><i>"</i>.</p>
