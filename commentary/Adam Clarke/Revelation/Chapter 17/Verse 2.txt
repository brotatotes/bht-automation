<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:2">Revelation 17:2</span>. <i><b>With whom the kings of the earth have committed</b></i><b> </b><i><b>fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk</b></i><b> </b><i><b>with the wine of her fornication.</b></i> â€” What an awful picture this is of the state of the religion of the world in subjection to this whore! Kings have committed spiritual fornication with her, and their subjects have drunk deep, dreadfully deep, into the doctrine of her abominable errors.</p>
