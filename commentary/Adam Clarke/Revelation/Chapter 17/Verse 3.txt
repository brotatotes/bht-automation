<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span>. <i><b>So he carried me away in the spirit into the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>wilderness</b></i> â€” This wilderness into which the apostle was carried is the desolate state of the true Church of Christ, in one of the wings of the once mighty Roman empire.

This is a representation of the Latin Church in her highest state of antichristian prosperity, for she SITS UPON the scarlet coloured beast, a striking emblem of her <i>complete domination</i> over the secular Latin empire. The state of the Latin Church from the commencement of the fourteenth century to the time of the Reformation may be considered that which corresponds to this prophetic description in the most literal and extensive sense of the words; for during this period she was at her highest pitch of worldly grandeur and temporal authority. The beast is <i>full of names of blasphemy</i>; and it is well known that the nations, in support of the Latin or Romish Church, have abounded in blasphemous appellations, and have not blushed to attribute to themselves and to their Church the most sacred titles, not only blaspheming by the improper use of sacred names, but even by applying to its bishop those names which alone belong to God; for God hath expressly declared that he <i>will not give his glory to</i> <i>another, neither his praise to graven images</i>.</p>
