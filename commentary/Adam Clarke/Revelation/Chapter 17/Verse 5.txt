<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span>. <i><b>And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Earth</b></i><i>.</i>] This inscription being written upon her forehead is intended to show that she is not ashamed of her doctrines, but publicly professes and glories in them before the nations: she has indeed <i>a whore's forehead, she has refused to be ashamed</i>. The inscription upon her forehead is exactly the portraiture of the Latin Church. This Church is, as Bishop Newton well expresses it, <i>A MYSTERY of iniquity</i>. This woman is also called <i>Babylon the</i> <i>Great</i>; she is the exact antitype of the ancient Babylon in her idolatry and cruelty, but the ancient city called Babylon is only a drawing of her in miniature. This is indeed <i>Babylon THE GREAT</i>. "She affects the style and title of <i>our HOLY MOTHER, the CHURCH</i>; but she is, in truth, the <i>mother</i> of harlots and abominations of the earth."</p>
