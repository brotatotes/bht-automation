<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+18:13">Revelation 18:13</span>. <i><b>And cinnamon</b></i> — "By the sinamon is ment all maner of costly spyces, wherewith they bury their byshops and founders, lest they shoulde stinke when they translate them agayne to make them saintes for advauntage.</p>
<p>"By the smellynge <i>odours</i>, the swete herbes that they strewe abrode at theyr dedications and burials; besydes the damaske waters, bawmes, muskes, pomaunder, civet, and other curious confections they yet bestow upon theyr owne precious bodyes.</p>
<p>"The <i>oyntments</i> are such oyles as they mingle with rose water, aloes, and spike, with other mery conceits, wherwith they anoynt their holy savours and roods, to make them to sweat, and to smell sweete when they are borne abrod in procession upon their high feastfull dayes.</p>
<p>"<i>Frankinsence</i> occupye they ofte as a necessarie thinge in the sensyng of their idols, hallowinge of their paschal, conjuringe of their ploughes; besydes the blessing of their palmes, candles, ashes, and their dead men's graves, with <i>requiescant in pace</i>.</p>
<p>"With <i>wine</i> synge they theyr masses for money, they housell the people at Easter, they wash their aultar stones upon Maundy Thursday; they fast the holy imber dayes, besydes other banketinges all the whole years, to kepe theyr flesh chaste.</p>
<p>"With <i>oyle</i> smere they yonge infantes at baptisme and bishopping; they grease their massmongers, and gere them the mark of madian; they anele their cattell that starveth; and do many other feates els.</p>
<p>"<i>Fyne floure</i> is suche a merchandyse of theirs as far excedeth all other, and was first geven them by Pope Alexander the first, thinkinge Christes institution not sufficient, nor comly in using the common breade in that ministerie. For that ware hath brought them in their plentifull possessions, their lordshippes, fatte benifices, and prebendaries, with innumerable plesures els.</p>
<p>"<i>Wheat</i> have thei of their farms, whereof they make pardon bread and cakes, to draw people to devocion towardes them.</p>
<p>"<i>Cattell</i> receive they, offered unto their idols by the idiots of the countries, for recover of sondrye diseases; besides that they have of their tithes.</p>
<p>"<i>Shepe</i> have they, sometime of their owne pastures, sometime of begginge, sometime of bequestes for the dead, to cry them out of their feareful purgatorye, when they be asleepe at midnight.</p>
<p>"Great <i>horses</i> have they, for mortuaries, for offices, for favers, giftes, and rewardes, to be good lords unto them, that they may holde still their farmes, and to have saunder waspe their sonne and their heire a priest; or to admitte him unto a manerly benefice, that he may be called 'maister person,' and suche lyke.</p>
<p>"<i>Charets</i> have they also, or <i>horse litters</i>, of al manner of sorts, specially at Rome, with foote men runninge on both sides of them, to make roome for the holy fathers. Of whom some carye their owne precious bodyes, some theyr treasure, some the blessed sacramente, some holy reliques and ornamentes, some their whores, and some their bastardes. The <i>bodyes of men</i> must needes be judged to be at their pleasure, so long as Christen provinces be tributaries unto them, princes obediente, people subject, and their lawes at their commaundement to slea and to kyll. And to make this good, who hath not in England payd his Peter peny, sometime to acknowledge hymselfe a <i>bondman</i> of theirs, at the receit of his yerely howsell? Furthermore yet, besides their market muster of monkes, fryars, and priestes, they have certayne <i>bondmen</i>, of whom some they sell to the <i>Venicians</i>, some to the <i>Genues</i>, some to the <i>Portingales</i>, and some to the <i>Turks</i>, to row in their galleis. And laste of all, to make up their market, least any thing should escape theyr hands, these unmercifull bribers maketh marchaundise of the <i>soules of men</i>, to deprive Christe of his whole right, sending many unto hell, but not one unto heaven, (unlesse they maliciously murther them for the truths sake,) and all for mony. After many other sortes els, abuse they these good creatures of God, whom the Holy Ghost heere nameth. Much were it to shew here by the cronicles severally of what Pope they have received authorytie, power, and charge, to utter these wares to advauntage, and how they came firste by the old idolatrous."</p>
<p>Several of the most reputable MSS. versions, and some of the <i>fathers</i>, after <i>cinnamon</i>, add καιαμωμον, <i>and amomum</i>. What this shrub was is not easy to say, though mentioned and partially described by <i>Pliny</i> and <i>Dioscorides</i>. Some think it was a species of <i>geranium</i>; others, the <i>rose of Jericho</i>. It was an odoriferous plant supposed to be a native of Assyria; and is thus mentioned by <i>Virgil</i>, Eclog. iv., ver. 25:- </p>
<p><i><b>Thyine wood</b></i> — The <i>Thyne</i> or <i>Thyin</i> is said to be a tree whose boughs, leaves, stalks, and fruit, resemble the cypress. It is mentioned by <i>Homer</i>, Odyss, lib. v., ver. 60; by <i>Theophrastes</i>, Hist. Plant, v. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+18:5">Revelation 18:5</span>; and by <i>Pliny</i>, Hist. Nat. lib. xiii. c. 16. How much the different articles mentioned in the 12th and 13th verses were in request among the ancients, and how highly valued, every scholar knows.</p>
<p><i><b>Slaves</b></i> — σωματων <i>The bodies of men</i>; probably distinguished here from ψυχας, <i>souls of men</i>, to express <i>bondmen</i> and <i>freemen</i>.</p>
