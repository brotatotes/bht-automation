<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17">Revelation 18:17</span>. <i><b>Every shipmaster</b></i> — Captains of vessels; some think <i>pilots</i> are meant, and this is most likely to be the meaning of the original word κυβερνητης. This description appears to be at least partly taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+27:26-28">Ezekiel 27:26-28</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And all the company in ships</b></i> — Και πας επι των πλοιων ὁ ὁμιλος· <i>The crowd or passengers aboard</i>. But the best MSS, and versions have και πας ὁ επι τοπον πλεων, <i>those who sail from place to</i> <i>place</i>, or such as <i>stop at particular places</i> on the coast, without performing the <i>whole voyage</i>. This sufficiently marks the traffic on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Some might debark (in sailing from Rome) at the island of <i>Sicily</i>, others at different ports in <i>Greece</i>; some at <i>Corinth</i>, others at <i>Crete</i>, or the various islands of the <i>AEgean Sea</i>; some at <i>Rhodes, Pamphylia</i>, c., &amp;c. as in those times in which the compass was unknown, every voyage was performed <i>coastwise</i>, always keeping, if possible, within sight of the land.</p>
