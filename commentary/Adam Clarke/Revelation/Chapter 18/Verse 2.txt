<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+18:2">Revelation 18:2</span>. <i><b>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen</b></i> — This is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+21:9">Isaiah 21:9</span>: <i>And he said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven</i> <i>images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground</i>. This is applied by some to Rome <i>pagan</i>; by others to Rome <i>papal</i>; and by others to <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Is become-the hold of every foul spirit</b></i> — See the parallel passages in the margin. The figures here point out the most <i>complete destruction</i>. A city utterly sacked and ruined, never to be rebuilt.</p>
