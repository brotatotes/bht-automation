<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+18:20">Revelation 18:20</span>. <i><b>Rejoice over her</b></i><b>, thou </b><i><b>heaven</b></i> â€” This is grand and sublime; the fall of this bad city was cause of grief to bad men. But as this city was a <i>persecutor of the godly</i>, and an <i>enemy to</i> <i>the works of God</i>, angels, apostles, and prophets are called to rejoice over her fall.</p>
