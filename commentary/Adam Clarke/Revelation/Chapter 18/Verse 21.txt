<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+18:21">Revelation 18:21</span>. <i><b>Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be</b></i><b> </b><i><b>thrown down</b></i> — This action is finely and forcibly expressed by the original words: Οὑτως ὁρμηματι βληθησεται Βαβυλων ἡ μεγαλη πολις. The millstone will in falling have not only an accelerated force from the law of gravitation, but that force will be greatly increased by the projectile force impressed upon it by the power of the destroying angel.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall be found no more at all.</b></i> — In her government, consequence, or influence. This is true of ancient <i>Babylon</i>; we are not certain even of the <i>place</i> where it stood. It is also true of <i>Jerusalem</i>; her government, consequence, and influence are gone. It is not true of <i>Rome pagan</i>; nor, as yet, of <i>Rome papal</i>: the latter still exists, and the former is most intimately blended with it; for in her religions service Rome papal has retained her language, and many of her heathen temples has she dedicated to <i>saints</i> real or reputed, and incorporated many of her superstitions and absurdities in a professedly <i>Christian</i> service. It is true also that many idols are now restored under the names of Christian saints!</p>
