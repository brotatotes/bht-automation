<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+18:8">Revelation 18:8</span>. <i><b>Therefore shall her plagues come</b></i> — <i>Death</i>, by the sword of her adversaries; <i>mourning</i> on account of the slaughter; and <i>famine</i>, the fruits of the field being destroyed by the hostile bands.</p>
<p><i><b>Utterly burned with fire</b></i> — Of what <i>city</i> is this spoken? Rome <i>pagan</i> has never been thus treated; Alaric and Totilas burnt only some parts with fire. Rome <i>papal</i> has not been thus treated; but this is true of Jerusalem, and yet Jerusalem is not generally thought to be intended.</p>
