<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span>. <i><b>I heard a great voice of much people in heaven</b></i> — The idolatrous city being destroyed, and the blood of the martyred saints being avenged, there is a universal joy among the redeemed of the Lord, which they commence with the word הללו יה Hallelu-Yah, <i>praise ye Jah</i> or <i>Jehovah</i>; which the <i>Septuagint</i>, and St. John from them, put into Greek letters thus: αλληλουια, <i>Allelou-ia</i>, a form of praise which the heathens appear to have borrowed from the Jews, as is evident from their <i>paeans</i>, or hymns in honour of Apollo, which began and ended with ελελευ ιη, <i>eleleu</i> <i>ie</i>; a mere corruption of the Hebrew words. It is worthy of remark that the <i>Indians</i> of <i>North America</i> have the same word in their religious worship, and use it in the same sense. "In their places of worship, or <i>beloved square</i>, they dance sometimes for a whole night always in a bowing posture, and frequently singing <i>halleluyah Ye ho wah</i>; praise ye Yah, Ye ho vah:" probably the true pronunciation of the Hebrew יהוה, which we call <i>Jehovah</i>. See Adair's History of the American Indians.</p>
<p><i><b>Salvation</b></i> — He is the sole author of <i>deliverance from sin</i>; the <i>glory</i> of this belongs to him, the <i>honour</i> should be ascribed to him, and his <i>power</i> is that alone by which it is effected.</p>
