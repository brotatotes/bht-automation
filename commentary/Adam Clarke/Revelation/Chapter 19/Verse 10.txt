<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>. <i><b>I fell at his feet to worship him.</b></i> — Great as this angel was, St. John could not mistake him either for Jesus Christ, or for God the Father; nor was his prostration intended as an act of <i>religious worship</i>. It was merely an act of that sort of reverence which any <i>Asiatic</i> would pay to a <i>superior</i>. His mistake was, the considering that he was under obligation to the angel for the information which he had now received. This mistake the angel very properly corrects, showing him that it was from God alone this intelligence came, and that to him alone the praise was due.</p>
<p><i><b>I am thy fellow servant</b></i> — No higher in dignity than thyself; employed by the same God, on the same errand, and with the same testimony; and therefore not entitled to thy prostration: <i>worship</i> <i>God</i>-prostrate thyself to him, and to him give thanks.</p>
<p><i><b>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</b></i> — As this is a <i>reason</i> given by the angel why he should not worship him, the meaning must be this: I, who have received this <i>spirit of</i> <i>prophecy</i>, am not superior to thee who hast received the <i>testimony of Christ</i>, to preach him among the Gentiles; for the <i>commission</i> containing such a testimony is equal to the <i>gift of</i> <i>the spirit of prophecy</i>. Or, the spirit of prophecy is a general testimony concerning Jesus, for he is the <i>scope</i> and <i>design</i> of the whole <i>Scripture; to him gave all the prophets witness</i>. Take Jesus, his grace, Spirit, and religion out of the Bible, and it has neither <i>scope, design, object</i>, nor <i>end</i>.</p>
