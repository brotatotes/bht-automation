<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12">Revelation 19:12</span>. <i><b>His eyes</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>as a flame of fire</b></i> — To denote the piercing and all-penetrating nature of his wisdom.</p>
<p><i><b>On his head</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>many crowns</b></i> — To denote the multitude of his conquests, and the extent of his dominion.</p>
<p><i><b>A name written, that no man knew</b></i> — This is a reference to what the rabbins call the <i>shem hammephorash</i>, or <i>tetragrammaton</i>, יהוה YHVH; or what we call <i>Jehovah</i>. This name the Jews never attempt to pronounce: when they meet with it in the Bible, they read אדני <i>Adonai</i> for it; but, to a man, they all declare that <i>no man can</i> <i>pronounce it</i>; and that the <i>true pronunciation</i> has <i>been lost</i>, at least since the Babylonish captivity; and that <i>God alone knows its</i> <i>true interpretation and pronunciation</i>. This, therefore, is <i>the</i> <i>name which no man knew but he himself</i>.</p>
