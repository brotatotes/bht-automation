Verse Revelation 19:12. His eyes were as a flame of fire — To denote the piercing and all-penetrating nature of his wisdom.On his head were many crowns — To denote the multitude of his conquests, and the extent of his dominion.A name written, that no man knew — This is a reference to what the rabbins call the shem hammephorash, or tetragrammaton, יהוה YHVH; or what we call Jehovah. This name the Jews never attempt to pronounce: when they meet with it in the Bible, they read אדני Adonai for it; but, to a man, they all declare that no man can pronounce it; and that the true pronunciation has been lost, at least since the Babylonish captivity; and that God alone knows its true interpretation and pronunciation. This, therefore, is the name which no man knew but he himself.
