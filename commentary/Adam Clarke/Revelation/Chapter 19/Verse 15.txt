Verse Revelation 19:15. Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword — Revelation 1:16; Revelation 1:16. This appears to mean the word of the Gospel, by which his enemies are confounded, and his friends supported and comforted.With a rod of iron — He shall execute the severest judgment on the opposers of his truth.He treaded the winepress — As the grapes are trodden to express the juice, so his enemies shall be bruised and beaten, so that their life's blood shall be poured out.
