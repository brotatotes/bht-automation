<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:15">Revelation 19:15</span>. <i><b>Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword</b></i> — <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span></span>. This appears to mean the word of the Gospel, by which his enemies are confounded, and his friends supported and comforted.</p>
<p><i><b>With a rod of iron</b></i> — He shall execute the severest judgment on the opposers of his truth.</p>
<p><i><b>He treaded the winepress</b></i> — As the grapes are trodden to express the juice, so his enemies shall be bruised and beaten, so that their life's blood shall be poured out.</p>
