<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>. <i><b>On his vesture and on his thigh a name written</b></i> — Dr. Dodd has well observed on this passage, that "it appears to have been an ancient custom among several nations to adorn the images of their deities, princes, victors at public games, and other eminent persons, with <i>inscriptions</i>, expressing either the character of the persons, their names, or some other circumstance which might contribute to their honour; and to that custom the description here given of Christ may possibly have some allusion.</p>
<p>"There are several such images yet extant, with an inscription written either on the <i>garment</i>, or on one of the <i>thighs</i>, or on that part of the garment which was over the thigh; and probably this is the meaning of the apostle. And as these inscriptions are placed on the <i>upper garment</i>, Grotius seems very justly to have explained the words επιτοιματιον, by <i>his imperial robe</i>, that his power in this victory might be conspicuous to all. But as a farther confirmation of this sense of the passage it may not be improper here to describe briefly several remarkable figures of this sort, which are still extant." This description I shall give from my own examination.</p>
<p>1. HERODOTUS, Euterpe, lib. ii. p. 127, edit. <i>Gale</i>, speaking of the actions of <i>Sesostris</i>, and of the images he set up in the countries which he conquered, has the following words: Εισι δε περι Ιωνιην δυο τυποι εν πετρῃσι εγκεκολαμμενοι τουτου του ανδρος, κ. τ. λ. "Two images likewise of this man are seen in Ionia, on the way that leads from Ephesus to Phocaea, and from Sardis to Smyrna. The figure is five palms in height; in his right hand he holds a <i>dart</i>, in his left a <i>bow</i>, armed after the manner of the Egyptians and Ethiopians. On a line drawn across the breast, from one shoulder to the other, are these words, written in Egyptian hieroglyphics: Εγω τηνδε την χωρην ωμοισι τοισι εμοισι εκτησαμην· 'I obtained this country by these my shoulders;'" i.e., by my own power.</p>
<p>2. In the <i>Etruria Regalis</i> of <i>Dempster</i>, in the appendix at the end of vol. ii., there is a beautiful female figure of brass, about twelve inches high, the hair gracefully plaited, and the head adorned with a diadem. She has a <i>tunic</i> without sleeves, and over that a sort of <i>pallium</i>. On the outside of the <i>right thigh</i>, close to the tunic, and probably <i>on</i> it, in the original, is an <i>inscription</i> in Etruscan characters. What these import I cannot say. Dempster has given a general explanation of the <i>image</i> in the appendix to the above volume, p. 108. The plate itself is the eighty-third of the work.</p>
<p>3. There are two other images found in the same author, vol. i., p. 91, tab. xxiv.; the first is <i>naked</i>, with the exception of a short loose jupe, or petticoat, which goes round the loins, and over the left arm. On the <i>left thigh</i> of this image there is an <i>inscription</i> in Etruscan characters. The second has a similar jupe, but much longer, which extends to the calf of the leg, and is supported over the bended left arm. Over the <i>right thigh</i>, on this vesture, there is an Etruscan <i>inscription</i> in two lines.</p>
<p>4. MONTFAUCON, <i>Antiquite Expliquee</i>, vol. iii., part 2, p. 268, has introduced an account of two fine images, which are represented tab. CLVII. The first is a warrior entirely naked, except a collar, one bracelet, and boots. On his <i>left thigh</i>, extending from the groin to a little below the knee, is an <i>inscription</i> in very ancient Etruscan characters, in two lines, but the import is unknown.</p>
<p>The second is a small figure of brass, about six inches long, with a loose tunic, which is suspended from the left shoulder down to the calf of the legs. On this tunic, <i>over the left thigh</i>, is an <i>inscription</i> (perhaps) in very ancient <i>Latin</i> characters, but in the <i>Etruscan</i> language, as the learned author conjectures. It is in one line, but what it means is equally unknown.</p>
<p>5. In the same work, p. 269, tab. CLVIII., another Etruscan <i>warrior</i> is represented entirely naked; on the <i>left thigh</i> is the following words in uncial Greek letters, ΚΑΦΙΣΟΔΩΡΟΣ, and on the <i>right thigh</i>, ΑΙΣΧΛΑΜΙΟΥ, i.e., "Kaphisodorus, the son of Aischlamius." All these inscriptions are written <i>longitudinally</i> on the thigh.</p>
<p>6. GRUTER, vol. iii., p. DCCCCLXXXIX, sub. tit. <i>Affectus</i> <i>Servorum et Libertinorum inter se, et in suos</i>, gives us the figure of a naked warrior, with his left hand on an axe, the end of whose helve rests on the ground, with the following <i>inscription</i> on the inside of his <i>left thigh</i>, longitudinally written, as in all other cases:- </p>
<p>In the latter tract, sec. 16, fol. 232, 3, and in <i>Rab. Tanchum</i>, fol. 66, mention is made of the <i>guardian angels</i> of the Israelites, who were <i>clothed with purple vestments</i>, on which was inscribed שם המפורש <i>shem hammephorash</i>, the ineffable name. See more in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>8. But what comes nearer to the point, in reference to the <i>title</i> given here to Christ, is what is related of <i>Sesostris</i> by DIODORUS <i>Siculus</i>, lib. i. c. 55, p. 166, edit. <i>Bipont</i>, of whom he says: "Having pushed his conquests as far as Thrace, he erected pillars, on which were the following words in Egyptian hieroglyphics: Τηνδε την χωραν ὁπλοις κατεστρεψατο τοις ἑαυτου Βασιλευς Βασιλεων, και Δεσποτης Δεσποτων, Σεσοωσις·" <i>This province, Sesoosis</i>, (Sesostris,) <i>KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS, conquered by his own</i> <i>arms</i>. This inscription is conceived almost in the <i>words</i> of St. John. Now the Greek historian did not <i>borrow</i> the words from the apostle, as he died in the reign of Augustus, about the time of our Lord's incarnation. This cannot be the same inscription mentioned above by <i>Herodotus</i>, the one being in Ionia, the other in Thrace: but as he erected several of those pillars or images, probably a nearly similar inscription was found on each.</p>
<p>9. This custom seems to have been common among the ancient <i>Egyptians</i>. Inscriptions are frequently found on the images of <i>Isis, Osiris, Anubis</i>, c., at the <i>feet</i>, on the <i>head</i>, on the <i>back</i>, on the <i>girdle</i>, c., &amp;c. Eight of those ancient images in my own collection abound with these inscriptions.</p>
<p>1. <i>Osiris</i>, four inches and a quarter high, standing on a thrones all covered over with <i>hieroglyphics</i> exquisitely engraved.</p>
<p>2. <i>Anubis</i>, six inches high, with a tiara, on the back of which is cut ΛΕΓΟΡΝΥΘ, in uncial Greek characters.</p>
<p>3. The <i>Cercopithecus</i>, seven inches long, sitting on a pedestal, and at his feet, in the same characters, ΧΑΔΕΟ.</p>
<p>4. An <i>Isis</i>, about eight inches high, on her back ΔΡΥΓΟ.</p>
<p>5. Ditto, seven inches, beautifully cut, standing, holding a serpent in her left hand, and at her feet ΕΤΑΠΥΓΙ.</p>
<p>6. Ditto, five inches and a quarter, round whose girdle is ΠΙΕΥΧΥΔΙ; but part of this inscription appears to be hidden under her-arms, which are extended by her side.</p>
<p>7. Ditto, five inches high, hooded, with a loose stola, down the <i>back</i> of which are seven lines of Greek uncial characters, but nearly obliterated.</p>
<p>8. Ditto, four inches high, with a <i>girdle</i> going round the back immediately under the arms, the front of which is hidden under a sort of a stomacher on the part that appears are these characters, ΧΕΝΛΑ. These may be all intended as a kind of <i>abrasaxas</i> or tutelary deities; and I give this notice of them, and the inscriptions upon them, partly in illustration of the text, and partly to engage my learned and antiquarian readers in attempts to decipher them. I would have given the <i>Etruscan</i> characters on the other images described above, but have no method of imitating them except by an engraving.</p>
<p>As these kinds of inscriptions on the <i>thigh</i>, the <i>garments</i>, and <i>different parts of the body</i>, were in use among different nations, to express character, conduct, qualities, and <i>conquests</i>, we may rest assured that to them St. John alludes when he represents our sovereign Lord with an <i>inscription upon his vesture</i> and <i>upon his thigh</i>; and had we not found it a custom among other nations, we should have been at a loss to account for its introduction and meaning here.</p>
