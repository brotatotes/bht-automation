<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:17">Revelation 19:17</span>. <i><b>An angel standing in the sun</b></i> — Exceedingly luminous; every part of him emitting rays of light. From this representation, Milton has taken his description of <i>Uriel</i>, the angel of the sun. Paradise Lost, b. iii. l. 648:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Who, in God's presence, nearest to his throne</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Stands ready at command and are his eyes</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> That run through all the heavens, or down to the earth</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Bears his swift errands over moist and dry,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Over sea and land."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p><i><b>All the fowls that fly</b></i> — The carcasses of God's enemies shall be food for all the fowls of heaven. This is according to a Jewish tradition, <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, p. 114, n. 25: "In the time when God shall execute vengeance for the people of Israel, he shall feed all the beasts of the earth for twelve months with their flesh and all the fowls for seven years." It is well known that both beasts and birds of prey are accustomed to frequent fields of battle, and live upon the slain.</p>
