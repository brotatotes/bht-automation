<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:6">Revelation 19:6</span>. <i><b>The voice of a great multitude</b></i> — This is the catholic or universal Church of God gathered from among the <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</b></i> — Εβασιλευσε Κυριος ὁ Θεος ὁ παντοκρατωρ. Many excellent MSS., most of the <i>versions</i>, with <i>Andreas</i> and <i>Arethas</i>, the two most ancient commentators on this book, add ημων, <i>our</i>, after ο θεος and according to this the text reads emphatically thus: OUR <i>Lord God, the Almighty,</i> <i>reigneth</i>. What consolation to every genuine Christian that <i>HIS</i> <i>Lord</i> and <i>God</i> is the <i>Almighty</i>, and that this Almighty never trusts the reins of the government of the universe out of his hands! What therefore has his Church to fear?</p>
