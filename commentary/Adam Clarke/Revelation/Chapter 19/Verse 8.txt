Verse Revelation 19:8. Arrayed in fine linen â€” A prediction that the Church should become more pure in her doctrines, more pious in her experience, and more righteous in her conduct, than she had ever been from her formation.The fine linen here spoken of is not the righteousness of Christ imputed to believers, for it is here called the righteousness of the saints-that which the grace and Spirit of Christ has wrought in them.
