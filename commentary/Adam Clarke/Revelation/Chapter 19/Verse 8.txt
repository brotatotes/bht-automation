<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:8">Revelation 19:8</span>. <i><b>Arrayed in fine linen</b></i> â€” A prediction that the Church should become more <i>pure</i> in her <i>doctrines</i>, more <i>pious</i> in her <i>experience</i>, and more <i>righteous</i> in her <i>conduct</i>, than she had ever been from her formation.</p>
<p><i>The fine linen</i> here spoken of is not the <i>righteousness of Christ</i> <i>imputed to believers</i>, for it is here called <i>the righteousness of</i> <i>the saints</i>-that which the grace and Spirit of Christ has wrought in them.</p>
