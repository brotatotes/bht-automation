Verse Revelation 19:9. Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper] This is an evident allusion to the marriage of the king's son, Matthew 22:2, &c., where the incarnation of our Lord, and the calling of Jews and Gentiles, are particularly pointed out. See the notes there. Blessed are all they who hear the Gospel, and are thus invited to lay hold on everlasting life.
