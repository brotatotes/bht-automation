<p>I must here advertise my readers, 1. That I do not perceive any metaphorical or allegorical meaning in the epistles to these Churches. 2. I consider the Churches as real; and that their spiritual state is here really and literally pointed out; and that they have no reference to the state of the Church of Christ in all ages of the world, as has been imagined; and that the notion of what has been termed the Ephesian state, the Smyrnian state, the Pergamenian state, the Thyatirian state, c., c., is unfounded, absurd, and dangerous and such expositions should not be entertained by any who wish to arrive at a sober and rational knowledge of the Holy Scriptures. 3. I consider the angel of the Church as signifying the messenger, the pastor, sent by Christ and his apostles to teach and edify that Church. 4. I consider what is spoken to this angel as spoken to the whole Church and that it is not <i>his</i> particular state that is described, but the states of the <i>people</i> in general under his care.</p>
<p><i>The epistle to the Church at Ephesus.</i></p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span>. <i><b>Unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus</b></i> — By αγγελος, <i>angel</i>, we are to understand the <i>messenger</i> or person sent by God to preside over this Church; and to him the epistle is directed, not as pointing out his state, but the state of the Church under his care. <i>Angel of the Church</i> here answers exactly to that officer of the synagogue among the Jews called ציבור שליח <i>sheliach</i> <i>tsibbur</i>, the messenger of the Church, whose business it was to <i>read, pray</i>, and <i>teach</i> in the synagogue. The Church at Ephesus is <i>first</i> addressed, as being the place where John chiefly resided; and the city itself was the metropolis of that part of Asia. The angel or bishop at this time was most probably <i>Timothy</i>, who presided over that Church before St. John took up his residence there, and who is supposed to have continued in that office till A.D. 97, and to have been martyred a short time before St. John's return from Patmos.</p>
<p><i><b>Holdeth the seven stars</b></i> — Who particularly preserves, and guides, and upholds, not only the ministers of those seven Churches, but all the genuine ministers of his Gospel, in all ages and places.</p>
<p><i><b>Walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks</b></i> — Is the supreme Bishop and Head, not only of those Churches, but of all the Churches or congregations of his people throughout the world.</p>
