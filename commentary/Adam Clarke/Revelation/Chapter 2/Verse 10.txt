<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>. <i><b>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer</b></i> — This may be addressed particularly to <i>Polycarp</i>, if he was at that time the bishop of this Church. He had much to suffer; and was at last burnt alive at Smyrna, about the year of our Lord 166. We have a very ancient account of his martyrdom, which has been translated by <i>Cave</i>, and is worthy of the reader's perusal. That account states that the <i>Jews</i> were particularly active in this martyrdom, and brought the fagots, c., by which he was consumed. Such persons must indeed have been of <i>the synagogue of Satan</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ten days</b></i> — As the <i>days</i> in this book are what is commonly called <i>prophetic days</i>, each answering to a <i>year</i>, the <i>ten years</i> of tribulation may denote <i>ten years of persecution</i> and this was precisely the duration of the persecution under <i>Diocletian</i>, during which all the Asiatic Churches were grievously afflicted. Others understand the expression as implying <i>frequency</i> and <i>abundance</i>, as it does in other parts of Scripture. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:7">Genesis 31:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:41">Genesis 31:41</span>: <i>Thou hast changed my wages TEN TIMES</i>; i.e. thou hast <i>frequently</i> changed my wages <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:22">Numbers 14:22</span>: <i>Those men have tempted me now these TEN TIMES</i>; i.e. they have <i>frequently</i> and grievously tempted and sinned against me. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ne+4:12">Nehemiah 4:12</span>: <i>The Jews that dwelt by them came and said unto us TEN TIMES</i>, i.e. they were <i>frequently</i> coming and informing us, that our adversaries intended to attack us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+19:3">Job 19:3</span>; <i>These TEN TIMES have ye reproached me</i>; i.e. ye have loaded me with <i>continual</i> reproaches. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+1:20">Daniel 1:20</span>: <i>In all matters of wisdom, he found them TEN TIMES better than</i> <i>all the magicians</i>; i.e. the king frequently consulted Daniel and his companions, and found them <i>more abundantly informed</i> and <i>wise</i> than all his counsellors.</p>
<p>Some think the <i>shortness</i> of the affliction is here intended, and that the ten days are to be understood as in Terence, <i>Heaut</i>., Act v., scen. 1, ver. 36, <i>Decem dierum vis mi est familia</i>. "I have enjoyed my family but a <i>short</i> time."</p>
<p><i><b>Be thou faithful unto death</b></i> — Be firm, hold fast the faith, confess Christ to the last, and at all hazards, and thou shalt have <i>a crown of life</i>-thou shalt be crowned with life, have an eternal happy existence, though thou suffer a temporal death. It is said of <i>Polycarp</i> that when brought before the judge, and commanded to abjure and blaspheme Christ, he firmly answered, "Eighty and six years have I served him, and he never did me wrong, how then can I blaspheme my king who hath saved me?" He was then adjudged to the flames, and suffered cheerfully for Christ his Lord and Master.</p>
