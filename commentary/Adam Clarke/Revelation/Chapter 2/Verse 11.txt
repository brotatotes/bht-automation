<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:11">Revelation 2:11</span>. <i><b>He that overcometh</b></i> — The <i>conqueror</i> who has stood firm in every trial, and vanquished all his adversaries.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall not be hurt of the second death.</b></i> — That is, an eternal separation from God and the glory of his power; as what we commonly mean by <i>final perdition</i>. This is another rabbinical mode of speech in very frequent use, and by it they understand the punishment of hell in a future life.</p>
