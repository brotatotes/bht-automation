<p><i>The Epistle to the Church at Pergamos.</i></p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:12">Revelation 2:12</span>. <i><b>The angel of the Church in Pergamos</b></i> — See the description of this place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which hath the sharp sword</b></i> — <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span></span>. The <i>sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God</i>, cuts every way; it convinces of sin, righteousness, and judgment; pierces between the joints and the marrow, divides between the soul and spirit, dissects the whole mind, and exhibits a regular anatomy of the soul. It not only reproves and exposes sin, but it slays the ungodly, pointing out and determining the punishment they shall endure. Jesus has the sword with the two edges, because he is the Saviour of sinners, and the Judge of quick and dead.</p>
