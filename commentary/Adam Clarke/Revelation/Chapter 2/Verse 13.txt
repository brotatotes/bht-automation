<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</span>. <i><b>Where Satan's seat is</b></i> — Ὁπου ὁ θρονος του Σατανα· <i>Where Satan has his throne</i>-where he <i>reigns</i> as king, and is universally obeyed. It was a maxim among the Jews, that where the law of God was <i>not</i> studied, there Satan dwelt; but he was obliged to leave the place where a synagogue or academy was established.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou holdest fast my name</b></i> — Notwithstanding that the profession of <i>Christianity</i> exposed this Church to the bitterest persecution, they held fast the name of <i>Christian</i>, which they had received from Jesus Christ, and <i>did not deny his faith</i>; for when brought to the trial they openly professed themselves disciples and followers of their Lord and Master.</p>
<p><i><b>Antipas</b></i> was <i>my faithful martyr</i>] Who this <i>Antipas</i> was we cannot tell. We only know that he was a <i>Christian</i>, and probably bore some office in the Church, and became illustrious by his martyrdom in the cause of Christ. There is a work extant called <i>The Acts of</i> <i>Antipas</i>, which makes him bishop of Pergamos, and states that he was put to death by being enclosed in a burning brazen bull. But this story confutes itself, as the Romans, under whose government Pergamos then was, never put any person to death in this way. It is supposed that he was murdered by some mob, who chose this way to vindicate the honour of their god <i>AEsculapius</i>, in opposition to the claims of our Lord Jesus.</p>
