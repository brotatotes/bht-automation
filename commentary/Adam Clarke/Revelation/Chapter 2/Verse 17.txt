<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>. <i><b>The hidden manna</b></i> — It was a constant tradition of the Jews that the ark of the covenant, the tables of stone, Aaron's rod, the holy anointing oil, and the pot of manna, were <i>hidden</i> by King Josiah when Jerusalem was taken by the Chaldeans; and that these shall all be restored in the days of the Messiah. This <i>manna</i> was <i>hidden</i>, but Christ promises to give it to him that is conqueror. Jesus is the ark, the oil, the rod, the testimony, and the manna. He who is partaker of his grace has all those things in their spiritual meaning and perfection.</p>
<p><i><b>And will give him a white stone</b></i> — I. It is supposed that by the white stone is meant <i>pardon</i> or <i>acquittance</i>, and the evidence of it; and that there is an allusion here to the custom observed by judges in ancient times, who were accustomed to give their suffrages by <i>white</i> and <i>black</i> pebbles; those who gave the former were for <i>absolving</i> the culprit, those who gave the latter were for his <i>condemnation</i>. This is mentioned by Ovid, Metam. lib. xv., ver. 41:</p>
<p>1. <i>Tesserae conviviales</i>, which answered exactly to our <i>cards of</i> <i>invitation</i>, or tickets of admission to a public feast or banquet; when the person invited produced his <i>tessera</i> he was admitted. The mention of the <i>hidden manna</i> here may seem to intimate that there is a reference to these <i>convivial tesserae</i>, whether given to the victor in the public games, entitling him to be fed at the public expense, or to a particular friend, inviting him to a family meal or to a public banquet.</p>
<p>2. There were <i>tesserae</i> inscribed with different kinds of things, such as provisions, garments, gold or silver vessels, horses, mares, slaves, c. These were sometimes thrown by the Roman emperors among the crowd in the theatres, and he that could snatched one and on producing it he received that, the name of which was inscribed on it. But from <i>Dio Cassius</i> it appears that those <i>tesserae</i> were small wooden balls, whereas the <i>tesserae</i> in general were <i>square</i>, whence they had their name, as having <i>four</i> <i>sides, angles</i>, or <i>corners</i>. <i>Illi</i> τεσσαρην, <i>vel</i> τεσσαραν <i>vocabant figuram quamvis</i> quadratam, <i>quae</i> quatuor angulos <i>haberet</i>; and these were made of <i>stone, marble, bone</i>, or <i>ivory, lead, brass</i>, or other metal. See <i>Pitiscus</i>.</p>
<p>3. <i>Tesserae frumentariae</i>, or tickets to receive grain in the public distributions of corn; the <i>name</i> of the person who was to receive, and the <i>quantum</i> of grain; being both <i>inscribed</i> on this badge or ticket. Those who did not need this public provision for themselves were permitted to sell their ticket, and the <i>bearer</i> was entitled to the quantum of grain mentioned on it.</p>
<p>4. But the most remarkable of these instruments were the <i>tesserae hospitales</i>, which were given as badges of <i>friendship</i> and <i>alliance</i>, and on which some device was engraved, as a testimony that a contract of friendship had been made between the parties. A small oblong square piece of wood, bone, stone, or ivory, was taken and divided into two equal parts, on which each of the parties wrote his own name, and then interchanged it with the other. This was carefully preserved, and handed down even to posterity in the same family; and by producing this when they travelled, it gave a mutual claim to the bearers of kind reception and hospitable entertainment at each other's houses.</p>
<p>It is to this custom that <i>Plautus</i> refers in his POENULUS, act. v., scen. 2, ver. 80, in the interview between <i>Agorastocles</i>, and his unknown uncle <i>Hanno</i>. </p>
<p>But what does this mean in the language of Christ? 1. That the person is taken into an intimate state of friendship with him. 2. That this contract is witnessed to the party by some especial token, sign, or seal, to which he may have recourse to support his claim, and identify his person. This is probably what is elsewhere called the <i>earnest of the Spirit</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>, and the places there referred to. He then who has received and retains the witness of the Spirit that he is <i>adopted</i> into the <i>heavenly</i> <i>family</i>, may humbly claim, in virtue of it, his support of the bread and water of life; the <i>hidden manna</i>-every grace of the Spirit of God; and the <i>tree of life-immortality</i>, or the final glorification of his body and soul throughout eternity. 3. By this state of grace into which he is brought he acquires a <i>new name</i>, the name of <i>child of God</i>; the earnest of the Spirit, the <i>tessera</i>, which he has received, shows him this new name. 4. And this name of child of God <i>no man can know</i> or understand, but he who has received the <i>tessera</i> or Divine witness. 5. As his Friend and Redeemer may be found everywhere, because he fills the heavens and the earth, everywhere he may, on retaining this <i>tessera</i>, claim direction, succour, support, grace, and glory; and therefore the privileges of him who overcometh are the greatest and most glorious that can be imagined.</p>
