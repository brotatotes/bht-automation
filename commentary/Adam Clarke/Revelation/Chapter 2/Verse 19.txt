Verse Revelation 2:19. I know thy works — And of these he first sets forth their charity, τηναγαπην, their love to God and each other; and particularly to the poor and distressed: and hence followed their faith, τηνπιστιν, their fidelity, to the grace they had received; and service, την διακονιαν, and ministration; properly pious and benevolent service to widows, orphans, and the poor in general.And thy patience — την υπομονην σου Thy perseverance under afflictions and persecutions, and thy continuance in well-doing. I put faith before service according to the general consent of the best MSS. and versions.Thy works — The continued labour of love, and thorough obedience.The last to be more than the first.] They not only retained what they had received at first, but grew in grace, and in the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ. This is a rare thing in most Christian Churches: they generally lose the power of religion, and rest in the forms of worship; and it requires a powerful revival to bring them to such a state that their last works shall be more than their first.
