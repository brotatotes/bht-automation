<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:19">Revelation 2:19</span>. <i><b>I know thy works</b></i> — And of these he first sets forth their <i>charity</i>, τηναγαπην, their <i>love</i> to God and each other; and particularly to the <i>poor</i> and <i>distressed</i>: and hence followed their <i>faith</i>, τηνπιστιν, their <i>fidelity</i>, to the grace they had received; and <i>service</i>, την διακονιαν, and ministration; properly pious and benevolent service to widows, orphans, and the poor in general.</p>
<p><i><b>And thy patience</b></i> — την υπομονην σου Thy <i>perseverance</i> under <i>afflictions</i> and <i>persecutions</i>, and thy <i>continuance</i> in well-doing. I put <i>faith</i> before <i>service</i> according to the general consent of the best MSS. and versions.</p>
<p><i><b>Thy works</b></i> — The continued labour of love, and thorough obedience.</p>
<p><i><b>The last</b></i> to be <i>more than the first.</i>] They not only <i>retained</i> what they had received at first, but <i>grew</i> in <i>grace</i>, and in the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ. This is a rare thing in most Christian Churches: they generally lose the power of religion, and rest in the forms of worship; and it requires a powerful <i>revival</i> to bring them to such a state that their last works shall be more than their first.</p>
