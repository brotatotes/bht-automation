<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>. <i><b>I know thy works</b></i> — For the eyes of the Lord are throughout the earth, beholding the evil and the good; and, being omnipresent, all things are continually open and naked before him. It is worthy of remark, that whatsoever is <i>praiseworthy</i> in any of these Churches is <i>first</i> mentioned; thereby intimating that God is more intent on finding out the good than the evil in any person or Church; and that those who wish to reform such as have fallen or are not making sufficient advances in the Divine life, should take occasion, from the good which yet remains, to encourage them to set out afresh for the kingdom of heaven. The fallen or backsliding who have any tenderness of conscience left are easily discouraged, and are apt to think that there is no seed left from which any harvest can be reasonably expected. Let such be told that there is still a seed of godliness remaining, and that it requires only watching and strengthening the things which <i>remain</i>, by prompt application to God through Christ, in order to bring them back to the full enjoyment of all they have lost, and to renew them in the spirit of their mind. Ministers continually harping on <i>Ye are dead, ye are dead; there is little or no</i> <i>Christianity among you</i>, c., c., are a contagion in a Church, and spread desolation and death wheresoever they go. It is far better to say, in such cases, "Ye have <i>lost ground</i>, but ye have not lost <i>all</i> your <i>ground</i> ye might have been much farther advanced, but through mercy ye are still in the <i>way</i>. The Spirit of God is grieved by you, but it is evident he has not forsaken you. Ye have not walked in the light as ye should, but your candlestick is not yet removed, and still the light shines. Ye have not <i>much</i> zeal, but ye have a <i>little</i>. In short, God still strives with you, still loves you, still waits to be gracious to you take courage, set out afresh, come to God through Christ; believe, love, obey, and you will soon find days more blessed than you have ever yet experienced." Exhortations and encouragements of this kind are sure to produce the most blessed effects; and under such the work of God infallibly revives.</p>
<p><i><b>And thy labour</b></i> — He knew their <i>works</i> in general. Though they had left their <i>first love</i>, yet still they had so much love as excited them to <i>labour</i>, and enabled them to <i>bear</i> persecution <i>patiently</i>, and to keep the faith; for they could not tolerate <i>evil men</i>, and they had put fictitious <i>apostles</i> to the <i>test</i>, and had found them to be <i>liars</i>, pretending a Divine commission while they had none, and teaching false doctrines as if they were the truths of God.</p>
