<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>. <i><b>That woman Jezebel</b></i> — There is an allusion here to the history of Ahab and Jezebel, as given in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ki+9:1-36">2 Kings 9:1-36</span>; and although we do not know who this Jezebel was, yet from the allusion we may take it for granted she was a woman of power and influence in Thyatira, who corrupted the true religion, and harassed the followers of God in that city, as Jezebel did in Israel. Instead of <i>that woman Jezebel</i>, την γυναικα ιεζαβηλ, many excellent MSS., and almost all the ancient versions, read την γυναικα σου ιεζαβηλ, <i>THY WIFE Jezebel</i>; which intimates, indeed asserts, that this bad woman was the wife of the bishop of the Church, and his criminality in suffering her was therefore the greater. This reading Griesbach has received into the text. She called herself a prophetess, i.e., set up for a teacher; taught the Christians that fornication, and eating things offered to idols, were matters of indifference, and thus they were seduced from the truth. But it is probable that by <i>fornication</i> here is meant <i>idolatry</i> merely, which is often its meaning in the Scriptures. It is too gross to suppose that the wife of the bishop of this Church could teach fornication literally. The messenger or bishop of this Church, probably her <i>husband, suffered</i> this: he had power to have cast her and her party out of the Church, or, as his <i>wife</i>, to have restrained her; but he did not do it, and thus she had every opportunity of seducing the faithful. This is what Christ had <i>against</i> the messenger of this Church.</p>
