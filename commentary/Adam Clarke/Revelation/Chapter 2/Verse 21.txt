<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:21">Revelation 2:21</span>. <i><b>I gave her space to repent</b></i> â€” "This alludes to the history of Jezebel. God first sent Elijah to Ahab to pronounce a severe judgment upon him; upon which Ahab showed tokens of repentance, and so God put off his punishment. By these means the like punishment pronounced against Jezebel was also put off. Thus God gave <i>her</i> time to repent, which she did not, but instead of that seduced <i>her sons</i> to the same sins. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+21:1-29">1 Kings 21:1-29</span>. According to the Mosaical law, the punishment of idolatrous seducers was not to be delayed at all, but God sometimes showed mercy; and now much more under the Christian dispensation, though that mercy is often abused, and thus produces the contrary effect, as in the case of this Jezebel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ec+8:11">Ecclesiastes 8:11</span>.</p>
