<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:22">Revelation 2:22</span>. <i><b>Behold, I will cast her into a bed</b></i> â€” "This again alludes to the same history. Ahaziah, son of Ahab and Jezebel, by his mother's ill instruction and example, followed her ways. God punished him by making him fall down, as is supposed, from the top of the terrace over his house, and so to be bedridden for a long time under great anguish, designing thereby to give him time to repent; but when, instead of that, he sent to consult Baalzebub, Elijah was sent to pronounce a final doom against his impenitence. Thus the <i>son of Jezebel</i>, who had committed idolatry with and by her advice, was long <i>cast into the bed of affliction</i>, and not repenting, died: in the same manner his brother Jehoram succeeded likewise. All this while Jezebel had <i>time</i> and warning enough to <i>repent</i>; and though she did not prevail with Jehoram to continue in the idolatrous worship of Baal, yet she persisted in her own way, notwithstanding God's warnings. The sacred writer, therefore, here threatens the <i>Gnostic Jezebel</i> to make that wherein she delighteth, as adulterers in the bed of lust, to be the very place, occasion, and instrument, of her greatest torment. So in Isaiah, the <i>bed</i> is made a symbol of <i>tribulation</i>, and <i>anguish</i> of body and mind.
