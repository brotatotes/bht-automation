But our Saviour tells them that it was in vain, for he had power to bring their deeds to light, having that Divine power of searching into the Evilly and affections of men; and hereby he would show both them and us that he is, according to his title, <i>The Son of God</i>; and hath such eyes to pry into their actions, that, like a <i>fire</i>, they will search into every thing, and burn up the chaff which cannot stand his trial; so that the <i>depths of</i> <i>Satan</i>, mentioned in the next verse, to which this alludes, (Christ assuming here this title purposely) shall avail nothing to those who think by their secret craft to undermine the Christian religion; he will not only bring to light, but baffle all their evil intentions. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>.</p>
