<p>Verse 27. <i><b>He shall rule them with a rod of iron</b></i> â€” He shall restrain vice by the <i>strictest administration of justice</i>; and those who finally despise the word and rebel shall be <i>broken</i> and destroyed, so as never more to be able to make head against the truth. This seems to refer to the <i>heathen</i> world; and perhaps Constantine the Great may be intended, who, when he overcame Licinius, became the instrument in God's hand of destroying <i>idolatry</i> over the whole Roman empire; and it was so effectually <i>broken</i> as to be ever after like the fragments of an <i>earthen</i> <i>vessel</i>, of no use in themselves, and incapable of being ever united to any good purpose.</p>
