<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:3">Revelation 2:3</span>. <i><b>And hast borne</b></i> — The same things mentioned in the preceding verse, but in an <i>inverted</i> order, the particular reason of which does not appear; perhaps it was intended to show more <i>forcibly</i> to this Church that there was no good which they had done, nor evil which they had suffered, that was forgotten before God.</p>
<p><i><b>And hast not fainted.</b></i> — They must therefore have had a considerable portion of this love remaining, else they could not have thus acted.</p>
