<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>. <i><b>He that hath an ear</b></i> — Let every intelligent person, and every Christian man, attend carefully to what the Holy Spirit, in this and the following epistles, says to the Churches. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:15">Matthew 11:15</span>, where the same form of speech occurs.</p>
<p><i><b>To him that overcometh</b></i> — To him who continues steadfast in the faith, and uncorrupt in his life; who faithfully confesses Jesus, and neither imbibes the doctrines nor is led away by the error of the wicked; <i>will I give to eat of the tree of life</i>. As he who conquered his enemies had, generally, not only great <i>honour</i>, but also a <i>reward</i>; so here a great reward is promised τῳ νικωντι, <i>to</i> <i>the conqueror</i>: and as in the Grecian games, to which there may be an allusion, the conqueror was crowned with the leaves of some <i>tree</i>; here it is promised that they should <i>eat of the fruit of</i> <i>the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God</i>; that is, that they should have a happy and glorious immortality. There is also here an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:9">Genesis 2:9</span>, where it is said, <i>God made the tree of life to grow out of the midst of the</i> <i>garden</i>; and it is very likely that by eating the fruit of this tree the immortality of Adam was secured, and on this it was made dependent. When Adam transgressed, he was expelled from this garden, and no more permitted to eat of the tree of life; hence he became necessarily mortal. This tree, in all its sacramental effects, is secured and restored to man by the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ. The <i>tree of life</i> is frequently spoken of by the rabbins; and by it they generally mean the immortality of the soul, and a final state of blessedness. See many examples in <i>Schoettgen</i>. They talk also of a <i>celestial</i> and <i>terrestrial</i> <i>paradise</i>. The former, they say, "is for the reception of the souls of the <i>just perfect</i>; and differs as much from the earthly paradise as light from darkness."</p>
