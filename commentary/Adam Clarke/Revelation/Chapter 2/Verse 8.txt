<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:8">Revelation 2:8</span>. <i><b>Unto the angel</b></i> — This was probably the famous Polycarp. See below.</p>
<p><i><b>These things saith the first and the last</b></i> — He who is <i>eternal</i>; from whom all things come, and to whom all things must return. <i>Which was dead</i>, for the redemption of the world; <i>and is alive</i> to die no more for ever, his glorified humanity being enthroned at the Father's right hand.</p>
