<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:9">Revelation 2:9</span>. <i><b>I know thy works</b></i> — As he had spoken to the preceding Church, so he speaks to this: I know all that ye have <i>done</i>, and all that ye have <i>suffered</i>. The <i>tribulation</i> here mentioned must mean persecution, either from the Jews, the heathens, or from the heretics, who, because of their flesh-pampering doctrines might have had many partisans at Smyrna.</p>
<p><i><b>And poverty</b></i> — Stripped probably of all their temporal possessions, because of their attachment to the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>But thou art rich</b></i> — Rich in faith, and heir of the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>The blasphemy of them which say they are Jews</b></i> — There were persons there who professed <i>Judaism</i>, and had a synagogue in the place, and professed to worship the true God; but they had no genuine religion, and they served the devil rather than God. They applied a sacred name to an unholy thing: and this is one meaning of the word <i>blasphemy</i> in this book.</p>
