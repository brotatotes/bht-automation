<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:1">Revelation 20:1</span>. <i><b>An angel came down from heaven</b></i> â€” One of the executors of the Divine justice, who receives criminals, and keeps them in prison, and delivers them up only to be tried and executed.</p>
<p>The <i>key</i> of the prison and the <i>chain</i> show who he is; and as the <i>chain</i> was <i>great</i>, it shows that the culprit was impeached of no ordinary crimes.</p>
