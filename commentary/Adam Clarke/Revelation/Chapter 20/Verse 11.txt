Verse Revelation 20:11. A great white throne — Refulgent with glorious majesty.Him that sat on it — The indescribable Jehovah.From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away — Even the brightness of his countenance dissolved the universe, and annihilated the laws by which it was governed. This is a very majestic figure, and finely expressed.There was found no place for them. — The glorious majesty of God filling all things, and being all in all.
