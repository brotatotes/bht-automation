<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span>. <i><b>A great white throne</b></i> — Refulgent with glorious majesty.</p>
<p><i><b>Him that sat on it</b></i> — The indescribable Jehovah.</p>
<p><i><b>From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away</b></i> — Even the brightness of his countenance dissolved the universe, and annihilated the laws by which it was governed. This is a very majestic figure, and finely expressed.</p>
<p><i><b>There was found no place for them.</b></i> — The glorious majesty of God filling all things, and being all in all.</p>
