<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span>. <i><b>The dead, small and great</b></i> — All ranks, degrees, and conditions of men. This description seems to refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:9-10">Daniel 7:9-10</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And the books were opened</b></i> — See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>. "Rab. Jehuda said: All the actions of men, whether good or bad, <i>are written in a book</i>, and of all they shall give account."-<i>Sohar</i> Gen., fol. 79, col. 298. "How careful should men be to shun vice, and to act uprightly before the holy blessed God, seeing there are so many which go throughout the earth, see the works of men, testify of them, and <i>write them in a book</i>!"-Ibid., fol. 105, col. 417.</p>
<p>"In the first day of the new year the holy blessed God sits that he may judge the world; and all men, without exception, give an account of themselves; and <i>the books of the living and the dead</i> <i>are opened</i>." <i>Sohar Chadash</i>, fol. 19, 1.</p>
<p>The books mentioned here were the books of the <i>living</i> and the <i>dead</i>, or the <i>book of life</i> and the <i>book of death</i>: that is, the account of the good and evil actions of men; the former leading to <i>life</i>, the latter to <i>death</i>. St. John evidently alludes here to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:10">Daniel 7:10</span>, on which the rabbinical account of the books appears to be founded. The expressions are <i>figurative</i> in both.</p>
<p><i><b>According to their works.</b></i> — And according to their <i>faith</i> also, for their works would be the proof whether their <i>faith</i> were <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>; but faith exclusively could be no rule in such a procedure.</p>
