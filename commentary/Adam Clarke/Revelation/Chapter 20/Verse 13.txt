<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13">Revelation 20:13</span>. <i><b>The sea gave up the dead</b></i> — Those who had been drowned in it, and those millions slain in naval contests, who had no other grave.</p>
<p><i><b>And death</b></i> — All who died by any kind of <i>disease</i>. Death is here <i>personified</i>, and represented as a keeper of defunct human beings; probably no more than <i>earth</i> or the <i>grave</i> is meant, as properly belonging to the empire of death.</p>
<p><i><b>And hell</b></i> — αιδης, <i>Hades</i>, the place of separate spirits. The <i>sea</i> and <i>death</i> have the <i>bodies</i> of all human beings; <i>hades</i> has their <i>spirits</i>. That they may be judged, and punished or rewarded according to their works, their bodies and souls must be reunited; <i>hades</i>, therefore, gives up the <i>spirits</i>; and the <i>sea</i> and the <i>earth</i> give up the <i>bodies</i>.</p>
