<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>. <i><b>And death and hell were cast into the lake</b></i> — Death himself is now abolished, and the <i>place</i> for separate spirits no longer needful. All dead bodies and separated souls being rejoined, and no more separation of bodies and souls by death to take place, consequently the existence of these things is no farther necessary.</p>
<p><i><b>This is the second death.</b></i> — The <i>first death</i> consisted in the separation of the soul from the body for a season; the second death in the separation of body and soul from God for ever. The first death is that from which there may be a resurrection; the second death is that from which there can be no recovery. By the first the <i>body</i> is <i>destroyed</i> during <i>time</i>; by the second, <i>body</i> and <i>soul</i> are <i>destroyed</i> through <i>eternity</i>.</p>
