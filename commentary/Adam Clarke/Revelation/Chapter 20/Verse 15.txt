<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:15">Revelation 20:15</span>. <i><b>Written in the book of life</b></i> â€” Only those who had continued faithful unto death were taken to heaven. All whose names were not found in the public registers, who either were not citizens, or whose names had been <i>erased</i> from those registers because of crimes against the state, could claim none of those emoluments or privileges which belong to the citizens; so those who either did not belong to the new and spiritual Jerusalem, or who had forfeited their rights and privileges by sin, and had died in that state, <i>were cast into the lake of fire</i>.</p>
<p>THIS is the way in which God, at the day of judgment, will proceed with sinners and apostates. Reader, see that thy name be written in the sacred register; and, if written in, see that it never be blotted out.</p>
