<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2">Revelation 20:2</span>. <i><b>The dragon</b></i> — <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>That old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan</b></i> — He who is called the <i>old serpent</i> is the DEVIL-the <i>calumniator</i>, and SATAN-the <i>opposer</i>. He who supposes that the term <i>old serpent</i> here plainly proves that the creature that tempted our first parents was actually a <i>snake</i>, must enjoy his opinion; and those who can receive such a saying, why let them receive it. <i>Selah</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A thousand years</b></i> — In what this <i>binding</i> of Satan consists, who can tell? How many visions have been seen on this subject both in ancient and modern times! This, and what is said <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3-5">Revelation 20:3-5</span>, no doubt refers to a time in which the influence of Satan will be greatly restrained, and the true Church of God enjoy great prosperity, which shall endure for a long time. But it is not likely that the number, a thousand years, is to be taken literally here, and <i>year</i> symbolically and figuratively in all the book beside. The doctrine of the <i>millennium</i>, or of the saints reigning on earth a thousand years, with Christ for their head, has been illustrated and defended by many Christian writers, both among the ancients and moderns. Were I to give a collection of the conceits of the primitive fathers on this subject, my readers would have little reason to applaud my pains. It has long been the idle expectation of many persons that the millennium, in <i>their</i> sense, was at hand; and its commencement has been expected in every century since the Christian era. It has been fixed for several different years, during the short period of my own life! I believed those predictions to be vain, and I have lived to see them such. Yet there is no doubt that the earth is in a state of progressive moral improvement; and that the light of true religion is shining more copiously everywhere, and will shine more and more to the perfect day. But <i>when</i> the religion of Christ will be at its meridian of light and heat, we know not. In each believer this may speedily take place; but probably no such time shall ever appear, in which evil shall be wholly banished from the earth, till after the day of judgment, when the earth having been burnt up, a new heaven and a new earth shall be produced out of the ruins of the old, by the mighty power of God: righteousness alone shall dwell in them. The phraseology of the apostle here seems partly taken from the ancient prophets, and partly rabbinical; and it is from the Jewish use of those terms that we are to look for their interpretation.</p>
