<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span>. <i><b>Blessed</b></i> — μακαριος Happy. <i>And holy</i>; he <i>was</i> holy, and therefore he suffered for the testimony of Jesus in the time when nothing but <i>holiness</i> was called to such a trial.</p>
<p><i><b>The first resurrection</b></i> — Supposed to be that of the <i>martyrs</i>, mentioned above.</p>
<p><i><b>The second death</b></i> — Punishment in the eternal world; such is the acceptation of the phrase among the ancient Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath no power</b></i> — ουκ εχει εξουσιαν <i>Hath no authority-no dominion</i> over him. This is also a rabbinical mode of speech. In <i>Erubin</i>, fol. 19, 1; <i>Chagiga</i>, fol. 27, 1: "Res Lakish said, The <i>fire of</i> <i>hell</i> hath <i>no power</i> over an Israelite who sins. Rab. Elieser says; The <i>fire of hell</i> hath <i>no power</i> over the disciples of the wise men."</p>
