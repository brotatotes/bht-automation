<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7">Revelation 20:7</span>. <i><b>Satan shall be loosed</b></i> â€” How can this bear any kind of <i>literal</i> interpretation? Satan is bound a thousand years, and the earth is in peace; righteousness flourishes, and Jesus Christ alone reigns. This state of things may continue for ever if the imprisonment of Satan be <i>continued</i>. Satan, however, is loosed at the end of the thousand years, and goes out and deceives the nations, and peace is banished from the face of the earth, and a most dreadful war takes place, &amp;c., &amp;c. These can be only symbolical representations, utterly incapable of the sense generally put upon them.</p>
