<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+20:8">Revelation 20:8</span>. <i><b>Gog and Magog</b></i> â€” This seems to be almost literally taken from the <i>Jerusalem Targum</i>, and that of <i>Jonathan ben Uzziel</i>, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:26">Numbers 11:26</span>. I shall give the words at length: "And there were two men left in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, the name of the other was Medad, and on them the spirit of prophecy rested. Eldad prophesied and said, 'Behold, Moses the prophet, the scribe of Israel, shall be taken from this world; and Joshua the son of Nun, captain of the host, shall succeed him.' Medad prophesied and said, 'Behold quails shall arise out of the sea, and be a stumbling block to Israel.' Then they both prophesied together, and said, 'In the very end of time Gog and Magog and their army shall come up against Jerusalem, and they shall fall by the hand of the King Messiah; and for seven whole years shall the children of Israel light their fires with the wood of their warlike engines, and they shall not go to the wood nor cut down any tree.'" In the Targum of <i>Jonathan ben Uzziel</i>, on the same place, the same account is given; only the latter part, that is, the conjoint prophecy of Eldad and Medad, is given more <i>circumstantially</i>, thus: "And they both prophesied together, and said, 'Behold, a king shall come up from the land of Magog in the last days, and shall gather the kings together, and leaders clothed with armour, and all people shall obey them; and they shall wage war in the land of Israel against the children of the captivity, but the hour of lamentation has been long prepared for them, or they shall be slain by the <i>flame of fire which shall</i> <i>proceed from under the throne of glory</i>, and their dead carcasses shall fall on the mountains of the land of Israel; and all the wild beasts of the field, and the wild fowl of heaven, shall come and devour their carcasses; and afterwards <i>all the dead of Israel</i> <i>shall rise again</i> to life, and shall enjoy the delights prepared for them from the beginning, and shall receive the reward of their worlds.'"</p>
<p>This account seems most evidently to have been copied by St. John, but how he intended it to be applied is a question too difficult to be solved by the skill of man; yet both the account in the rabbins and in St. John is founded on Ezekiel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+38:1-29">Ezekiel 38:1-29</span>. The rabbinical writings are full of accounts concerning <i>Gog</i> and <i>Magog</i>, of which <i>Wetstein</i> has made a pretty large collection in his notes on this place. Under these names the enemies of God's truth are generally intended.</p>
