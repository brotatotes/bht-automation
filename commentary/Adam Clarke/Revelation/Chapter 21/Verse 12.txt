Verse Revelation 21:12. Had a wall great and high — An almighty defense.Twelve gates — A gate for every tribe of Israel, in the vicinity of which gate that tribe dwelt; so that in coming in and going out they did not mix with each other. This description of the city is partly taken from Ezekiel 48:30-35.In Synopsis Sohar, p. 115, n. 27, it is said: "In the palace of the world to come there are twelve gates, each of which is inscribed with one of the twelve tribes, as that of Reuben, of Simeon, c.: he, therefore, who is of the tribe of Reuben is received into none of the twelve gates but his own and so of the rest."
