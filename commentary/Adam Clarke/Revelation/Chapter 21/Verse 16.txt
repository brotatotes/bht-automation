<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:16">Revelation 21:16</span>. <i><b>The city lieth foursquare</b></i> — Each side was equal, consequently the length and breadth were equal; and its <i>height</i> is here said to be equal to its length. It is hard to say how this should be understood. It cannot mean the height of the <i>buildings</i>, nor of the <i>walls</i>, for neither houses nor walls could be twelve thousand furlongs in height; some think this means the distance from the plain country to the place where the city stood. But what need is there of attempting to determine such measures in such a visionary representation? The quadrangular form intimates its perfection and stability, for the <i>square</i> figure was a figure of perfection among the Greeks; αντρ τετραγωνος, the <i>square</i> or <i>cubical man</i>, was, with them, a man of <i>unsullied integrity</i>, perfect in all things.</p>
