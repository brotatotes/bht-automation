<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:17">Revelation 21:17</span>. <i><b>The wall-a hundred</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>forty</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>four cubits</b></i> — This is <i>twelve</i>, the number of the apostles, multiplied by itself: for <i>twelve times twelve</i> make <i>one hundred and forty-four</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</b></i> — The <i>cubit</i>, so called from <i>cubitus</i>, the <i>elbow</i>, is the measure from the tip of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, and is generally reckoned at <i>one foot and a half</i>, or eighteen inches; though it appears, from some measurements at the pyramids of Egypt, that the <i>cubit</i> was, at least in some cases, twenty-one inches.</p>
<p>By the cubit of a man we may here understand the <i>ordinary cubit</i>, and that this was the angel's cubit who appeared in the form of a man. Or suppose we understand the <i>height</i> of the man as being here intended, and that this was the length of the measuring rod. Now allowing this <i>height</i> and rod to be <i>six feet</i>, and that this was intended to have some kind of symbolical reference to the <i>twelve</i> <i>tribes</i>, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12">Revelation 21:12</span>, represented by the twelve gates; and to the <i>twelve apostles</i>, represented by the twelve thresholds or foundations; then twenty-four, the number of the tribes and apostles, multiplied by <i>six</i>, make precisely the number one hundred and forty-four.</p>
