<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:18">Revelation 21:18</span>. <i><b>The building of the wall of it was</b></i><b> of </b><i><b>jasper</b></i> — The oriental jasper is exceedingly hard, and almost indestructible. Pillars made of this stone have lasted some thousands of years, and appear to have suffered scarcely any thing from the tooth of time.</p>
<p><i><b>Pure gold, like unto clear glass.</b></i> — Does not this imply that the walls were made of some beautifully bright yellow stone, very highly polished? This description has been most injudiciously applied to <i>heaven</i>; and in some public discourses, for the comfort and edification of the pious, we hear of heaven with its <i>golden</i> <i>walls, golden pavements, gates of pearl</i>, c., c., not considering that nothing of this description was ever intended to be literally understood and that gold and jewels can have no place in the spiritual and eternal world. But do not such descriptions as these tend to keep up a fondness for gold and ornaments? In symbols they are proper but construed into realities, they are very improper.</p>
<p>The ancient Jews teach that "when Jerusalem and the temple shall be built, they will be all of <i>precious stones</i>, and <i>pearls</i>, and <i>sapphire</i>, and with <i>every species of jewels</i>."-<i>Sepher Rasiel</i> <i>Haggadol</i>, fol. 24, 1.</p>
<p>The same authors divide paradise into seven parts or houses; the <i>third</i> they describe thus: "The third house is built of gold and pure silver, and all <i>kinds of jewels and pearls</i>. It is very spacious, and in it all kinds of the good things, either in heaven or earth, are to be found. All kinds of precious things, perfumes, and spiritual virtues, are there planted. In the midst of it is the tree of life, the height of which is five hundred years; (i.e., it is equal in height to the journey which a man might perform in five hundred years,) and under it dwell Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the twelve patriarchs, and all that came out of Egypt, and died in the wilderness. Over these Moses and Aaron preside, and teach them the law," c.-<i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 13, 4. In the same tract, fol. 182, 1, we find these words: "Know that we have a tradition, that when the Messiah, with the collected captivity, shall come to the land of Israel, in that day the dead in Israel shall rise again and in that day the fiery walls of the city of Jerusalem shall descend from heaven, and in that day the temple shall be builded of <i>jewels and pearls</i>."</p>
