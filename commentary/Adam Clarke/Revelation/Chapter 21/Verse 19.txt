<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:19">Revelation 21:19</span>. <i><b>The foundations of the wall</b></i> — Does not this mean the foundations or <i>thresholds</i> of the <i>gates</i>? The gates represented the twelve tribes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12">Revelation 21:12</span>; and these foundations or thresholds, the twelve apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:14">Revelation 21:14</span>. There was no entrance into the city but <i>through those gates</i>, and none through the gates but <i>over these</i> <i>thresholds</i>. The whole of the Mosaic dispensation was the preparation of the Gospel system: without it the Gospel would have no <i>original</i>; without the Gospel, it would have no <i>reference</i> nor proper <i>object</i>. Every part of the <i>Gospel</i> necessarily supposes the <i>law</i> and the <i>prophets</i>. They are the <i>gates</i>, it is the <i>threshold;</i> without the Gospel no person could enter through those gates. The doctrine of Christ crucified, preached by the apostles, gives a solid foundation to stand on; and we have an <i>entrance</i> into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19">Hebrews 10:19</span>, c. And in reference to this we are said to be <i>built on the FOUNDATION of the APOSTLES and</i> <i>prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The first foundation was jasper</b></i> — A stone very hard, some species of which are of a <i>sea-green</i> colour but it is generally a bright reddish brown.</p>
<p><i><b>The second, sapphire</b></i> — This is a stone of a fine blue colour, next in hardness to the diamond.</p>
<p><i><b>The third, a chalcedony</b></i> — A genus of the semipellucid gems, of which there are four species:-</p>
<p>1. A <i>bluish white</i>; this is the most common sort.</p>
<p>2. The <i>dull milky veined</i>; this is of little worth.</p>
<p>3. The <i>brownish black</i>; the least beautiful of all.</p>
<p>4. The <i>yellow and red</i>; the most beautiful, as it is the most valuable of all. Hitherto this has been found only in the East Indies.</p>
<p><i><b>The fourth, an emerald</b></i> — This is of a <i>bright green</i> colour without any mixture, and is one of the most beautiful of all the gems, The true oriental emerald as very scarce, and said to be found only in the kingdom of <i>Cambay</i>.</p>
