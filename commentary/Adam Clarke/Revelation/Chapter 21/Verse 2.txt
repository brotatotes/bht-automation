<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>. <i><b>And I John</b></i> — The writer of this book; whether the evangelist and apostle, or John the Ephesian presbyter, has been long doubted in the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>New Jerusalem</b></i> — See Clarke's notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24-27">Galatians 4:24-27</span>. This doubtless means the Christian Church in a state of great prosperity and purity; but some think eternal blessedness is intended.</p>
<p><i><b>Coming down from God</b></i> — It is a maxim of the ancient Jews that both the tabernacle, and the temple, and Jerusalem itself, came down from heaven. And in <i>Midrash Hanaalem, Sohar</i> Gen. fol. 69, col. 271, Rab. Jeremias said, "The holy blessed God shall renew the world, and build Jerusalem, and shall cause it to descend from heaven." Their opinion is, that there is a spiritual temple, a spiritual tabernacle, and a spiritual Jerusalem; and that none of <i>these</i> can be destroyed, because they subsist in their spiritual representatives. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
