<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:20">Revelation 21:20</span>. <i><b>The fifth, sardonyx</b></i> — The onyx is an accidental variety of the agate kind; it is of a dark horny colour, in which is a plate of a bluish white, and sometimes of red. When on one or both sides of the white there happens to lie also a plate of a reddish colour, the jewellers call the stone a <i>sardonyx</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The sixth, sardius</b></i> — The <i>sardius, sardel</i>, or <i>sardine stone</i>, is a precious stone of a <i>blood-red</i> colour.</p>
<p><i><b>The seventh, chrysolite</b></i> — The <i>gold stone</i>. It is of a <i>dusky green</i> with a cast of <i>yellow</i>. It is a species of the <i>topaz</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The eighth, beryl</b></i> — This is a pellucid gem of a <i>bluish green</i> colour.</p>
<p><i><b>The ninth, a topaz</b></i> — A <i>pale dead green</i>, with a mixture of <i>yellow</i>. It is considered by the mineralogists as a variety of the <i>sapphire</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The tenth, a chrysoprasus</b></i> — A variety of the <i>chrysolite</i>, called by some the <i>yellowish green and cloudy topaz</i>. It differs from the <i>chrysolite</i> only in having a <i>bluish</i> hue.</p>
<p><i><b>The eleventh, a jacinth</b></i> — A precious stone of a <i>dead red</i> colour, with a mixture of <i>yellow</i>. It is the same as the hyacenet or cinnamon stone.</p>
<p><i><b>The twelfth, an amethyst.</b></i> — A gem generally of a <i>purple</i> or <i>violet</i> colour, composed of a strong <i>blue</i> and deep <i>red</i>.</p>
<p>These stones are nearly the same with those on the breastplate of the high priest, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:17">Exodus 28:17</span>, &amp;c., and probably were intended to express the meaning of the Hebrew words there used. See the notes on the above passages, where these gems are particularly explained.</p>
