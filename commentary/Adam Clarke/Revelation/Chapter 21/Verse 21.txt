<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:21">Revelation 21:21</span>. <i><b>The twelve gates</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>twelve pearls</b></i> â€” This must be merely figurative, for it is out of all the order of nature to produce a <i>pearl</i> large enough to make a <i>gate</i> to such an immense city. But St. John may refer to some relations of this nature among his countrymen, who talk much of most prodigious pearls. I shall give an example: "When Rabbi Juchanan (John) once taught that God would provide <i>jewels</i> and <i>pearls, thirty cubits</i> every way, ten of which should exceed in height <i>twenty cubits</i>, and would place them in the gates of Jerusalem, according to what is said <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:12">Isaiah 54:12</span>, <i>I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles</i>, one of his disciples ridiculed him, saying, Where can such be found, since at present there is none so large as a pigeon's egg? Afterwards, being at sea in a ship, he saw the ministering angels cutting gems and pearls; and he asked them for what purpose they were preparing those. They answered, to place them in the gates of Jerusalem. On his return he found Rabbi Juchanan teaching as usual; to whom he said, Explain, master, what I have seen. He answered, Thou knave, unless thou hadst <i>seen</i>, thou wouldst not have <i>believed</i>; wilt thou not receive the saying of the wise men? At that moment he fixed his eyes upon him, and he was reduced into a heap of bones."-<i>Bava bathra</i>, fol. 77, 1, and <i>Sanhedrim</i>, fol. 100, 1, page 393. Edit. <i>Cocceii</i>.
