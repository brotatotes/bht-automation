<p>Verse 25. <i><b>The gates of it shall not be shut at all</b></i> — The Christian Church shall ever <i>stand open</i> to receive sinners of all sorts, degrees, and nations.</p>
<p><i><b>There shall be no night there.</b></i> — No more idolatry, no intellectual darkness; the Scriptures shall be everywhere read, the pure word everywhere preached, and the Spirit of God shall shine and work in every heart.</p>
