<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:4">Revelation 21:4</span>. <i><b>There shall be no more death</b></i> â€” Because there shall be a general resurrection. And this is the inference which St Paul makes from his doctrine of a general resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:26">1 Corinthians 15:26</span>, where he says, "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." But death cannot be <i>destroyed</i> by there being simply no farther death; death can only be <i>destroyed</i> and <i>annihilated</i> by a <i>general</i> <i>resurrection</i>; if there be no general resurrection, it is most evident that death will still retain his empire. Therefore, the fact that <i>there shall be no more death</i> assures the fact that there shall be a <i>general resurrection</i>; and this also is a proof that, after the resurrection, <i>there shall be no more death</i>.
