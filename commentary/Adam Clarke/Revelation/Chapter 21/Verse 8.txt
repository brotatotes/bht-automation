Verse Revelation 21:8. But the fearful — δειλοις Those who, for fear of losing life or their property, either refused to receive the Christian religion, though convinced of its truth and importance; or, having received it, in times of persecution fell away, not being willing to risk their lives.And unbelieving — Those who resist against full evidence. And sinners, καιαμαρτωλοις, is added here by about thirty excellent MSS., and is found in the Syrian, Arabic, some of the Slavonic, and in Andreas and Arethas. On this evidence Griesbach has admitted it into the text.The abominable — εβδελυγμενοις Those who are polluted with unnatural lust.And murderers — φονευσι Those who take away the life of man for any cause but the murder of another, and those who hate a brother in their heart.And whoremongers — πορνοις Adulterers, fornicators, whores, prostitutes, and rakes of every description.Sorcerers — φαρμακοις Persons who, by drugs, philtres, fumigations, c., pretend to produce supernatural effects, chiefly by spiritual agency.Idolaters — ειδωλολατραις Those who offer any kind of worship or religious reverence to any thing but God. All image worshippers are idolaters in every sense of the word.And all liars — και πασι τοις ψευδεσι Every one who speaks contrary to the truth when he knows the truth, and even he who speaks the truth with the intention to deceive i.e., to persuade a person that a thing is different from what it really is, by telling only a part of the truth, or suppressing some circumstance which would have led the hearer to a different end to the true conclusion. All these shall have their portion, το μερος, their share, what belongs to them, their right, in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. This is the second death, from which there is no recovery.
