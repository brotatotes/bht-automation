<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>. <i><b>But the fearful</b></i> — δειλοις Those who, for <i>fear</i> of losing <i>life</i> or their <i>property</i>, either refused to receive the Christian religion, though convinced of its truth and importance; or, having received it, in times of persecution fell away, not being willing to risk their lives.</p>
<p><i><b>And unbelieving</b></i> — Those who resist against full evidence. <i>And</i> <i>sinners</i>, καιαμαρτωλοις, is added here by about thirty excellent MSS., and is found in the <i>Syrian, Arabic</i>, some of the <i>Slavonic</i>, and in <i>Andreas</i> and <i>Arethas</i>. On this evidence Griesbach has admitted it into the text.</p>
<p><i><b>The abominable</b></i> — εβδελυγμενοις Those who are polluted with unnatural lust.</p>
<p><i><b>And murderers</b></i> — φονευσι Those who take away the life of man for any cause but the murder of another, and those who hate a brother in their heart.</p>
<p><i><b>And whoremongers</b></i> — πορνοις Adulterers, fornicators, whores, prostitutes, and rakes of every description.</p>
<p><i><b>Sorcerers</b></i> — φαρμακοις Persons who, by <i>drugs, philtres,</i> <i>fumigations</i>, c., pretend to produce supernatural effects, chiefly by spiritual agency.</p>
<p><i><b>Idolaters</b></i> — ειδωλολατραις Those who offer any kind of worship or religious reverence to any thing but God. All <i>image worshippers</i> are idolaters in <i>every sense</i> of the word.</p>
<p><i><b>And all liars</b></i> — και πασι τοις ψευδεσι Every one who speaks contrary to the truth when he knows the truth, and even he who speaks the truth with the <i>intention to deceive</i> i.e., to persuade a person that a thing is different from what it really is, by telling only a part of the truth, or suppressing some circumstance which would have led the hearer to a different end to the true conclusion. All these shall have their <i>portion</i>, το μερος, their <i>share</i>, what <i>belongs to them</i>, their right, <i>in the lake which</i> <i>burneth with fire and brimstone</i>. <i>This is the second death</i>, from which there is no recovery.</p>
