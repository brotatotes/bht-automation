<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>. <i><b>Pure river of water of life</b></i> â€” This is evidently a reference to the <i>garden of paradise</i>, and the river by which it was watered; and there is also a reference to the account, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:7-12">Ezekiel 47:7-12</span>. <i>Water of life</i>, as we have seen before, generally signifies <i>spring</i> or <i>running water</i>; here it may signify incessant communications of happiness proceeding from God.</p>
