<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:11">Revelation 22:11</span>. <i><b>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still</b></i> â€” The time of fulfilment will come so <i>suddenly</i> that there will be but little space for repentance and amendment. What is done must be done instantly; and let him that is holy persevere, and hold fast what he has received.</p>
