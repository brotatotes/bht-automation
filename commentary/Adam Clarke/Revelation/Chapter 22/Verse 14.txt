<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:14">Revelation 22:14</span>. <i><b>Blessed</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>they that do his commandments</b></i> — They are happy who are obedient.</p>
<p><i><b>That they may have right to the tree of life</b></i> — The original is much more expressive, Ἱνα εσται ἡ εξουσια αυτων επι το ξυλον της ζωης· <i>That they may have authority over the tree of life</i>; an authority founded on <i>right</i>, this <i>right</i> founded on <i>obedience</i> to the commandments of God, and that <i>obedience</i> produced by the <i>grace</i> of God working in them. Without <i>grace</i> no <i>obedience</i>; without <i>obedience</i> no <i>authority</i> to the tree of life; without <i>authority</i> no <i>right</i>; without <i>right</i> no <i>enjoyment</i>: God's grace through Christ produces the good, and then rewards it as if all had been our <i>own</i>.</p>
