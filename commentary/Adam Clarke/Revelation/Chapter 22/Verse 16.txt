<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>. <i><b>I Jesus</b></i> — The Maker, the Redeemer, and Judge of all men.</p>
<p><i><b>Have sent mine angel</b></i> — An especial messenger from heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>I am the root and the offspring of David</b></i> — Christ is the <i>root</i> of David as to his <i>Divine nature</i>; for from that all the human race sprang, for <i>he</i> is the <i>Creator of all things</i>, and <i>without him was</i> <i>nothing made which is made</i>. And he is the <i>offspring</i> of David as to his <i>human nature</i>; for that he took of the stock of David, becoming thereby heir to the Jewish throne, and the only heir which then existed; and it is remarkable that the whole regal family terminated in Christ: and as <i>HE liveth for ever</i>, he is the alone true David and everlasting King.</p>
<p><i><b>The bright and morning star.</b></i> — I am splendour and glory to my kingdom; as the <i>morning star</i> ushers in the sun, so shall I usher in the unclouded and eternal glories of the everlasting kingdom.</p>
