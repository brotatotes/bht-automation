<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:19">Revelation 22:19</span>. <i><b>If any man shall take away</b></i> â€” If any man shall lessen this meaning, curtail the sense, explain away the spirit and design, of these prophecies, <i>God shall take away his part out of</i> <i>the book of life</i>, c. Thus Jesus Christ warns all those who consider this book to beware of indulging their own conjectures concerning it. I confess that this warning has its own powerful influence upon my mind, and has prevented me from indulging my own conjectures concerning its meaning, or of adopting the conjectures of others. These visions and threatenings are too delicate and awful a subject to trifle with, or even to treat in the most solemn manner, where the meaning is obscure. I must leave these things to <i>time</i> and <i>event</i>, the surest interpreters. No jot or tittle of Christ's word shall fall to the ground all shall have its fulfilment in due time.</p>
<p>This is termed a <i>revelation</i>, but it is a revelation of <i>symbols</i>; an exhibition of <i>enigmas</i>, to which no particular solution is given, and to which God alone can give the solution.</p>
