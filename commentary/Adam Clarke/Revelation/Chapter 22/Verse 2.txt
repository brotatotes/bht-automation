<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:2">Revelation 22:2</span>. <i><b>In the midst of the street of it</b></i> — That is, of the city which was described in the preceding chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>The tree of life</b></i> — An allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:9">Genesis 2:9</span>. As this tree of life is stated to be in the <i>streets</i> of the city, and <i>on each side of</i> <i>the river, tree</i> must here be an <i>enallage</i> of the singular for the plural number, <i>trees of life</i>, or trees which yielded fruit by which life was preserved. The account in Ezekiel is this: "And by the river, upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade-it shall bring forth new fruit, according to his months - and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine;" <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:12">Ezekiel 47:12</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Twelve</b></i><b> manner of </b><i><b>fruits</b></i> — καρπους δωδεκα <i>Twelve fruits</i>; that is, fruit twelve times in the year, as is immediately explained, <i>yielded her fruit every month</i>. As this was a great and spacious city, one fountain was not sufficient to provide water for it, therefore a river is mentioned; a great river, by which it was sufficiently watered. Some think that by this <i>tree of life</i> the <i>Gospel</i> is indicated; the <i>twelve fruits</i> are the <i>twelve apostles</i>; and the <i>leaves</i> are <i>Gospel doctrines</i> by which the nations-the <i>Gentiles</i>, are healed of the disease of <i>sin</i>. But this seems to be a fanciful interpretation.</p>
