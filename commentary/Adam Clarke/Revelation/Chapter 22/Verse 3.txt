<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>. <i><b>No more curse</b></i> — Instead of καταναθεμα, <i>curse</i>, the best MSS., versions, c., read καταθεμα <i>cursed person</i>. As there shall be no more sinning against God, so there shall be no more curse of God upon the people for they shall be all his <i>servants</i>, and <i>serve</i> <i>him</i>. Our first parents came under the curse by sinning against their Maker in paradise; these shall never apostatize, therefore neither <i>they</i> nor the <i>earth</i> shall be <i>cursed</i>.</p>
