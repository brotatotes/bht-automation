Verse Revelation 22:3. No more curse — Instead of καταναθεμα, curse, the best MSS., versions, c., read καταθεμα cursed person. As there shall be no more sinning against God, so there shall be no more curse of God upon the people for they shall be all his servants, and serve him. Our first parents came under the curse by sinning against their Maker in paradise; these shall never apostatize, therefore neither they nor the earth shall be cursed.
