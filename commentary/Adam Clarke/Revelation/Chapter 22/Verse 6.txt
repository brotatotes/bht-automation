<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>. <i><b>These sayings</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>faithful and true</b></i> — See the preceding chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span>. From this verse to the end of the chapter is reckoned the <i>epilogue</i> of this book.</p>
<p>1. The angel affirms the truth of all that had been <i>spoken</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6-11">Revelation 22:6-11</span>.</p>
<p>2. Jesus Christ confirms what has been affirmed, and pledges himself for the fulfilment of all the prophecies contained in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12-17">Revelation 22:12-17</span>.</p>
<p>3. John cautions his readers against adding or diminishing, and concludes with the apostolical blessing, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+22:18-21">Revelation 22:18-21</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The things which must shortly be done.</b></i> — There are many sayings in this book which, if taken <i>literally</i>, would intimate that the prophecies delivered in the whole of the Apocalypse were to be fulfilled in a <i>short</i> time after their delivery to John; and this is a strong support for the scheme of Wetstein, and those who maintain that the prophecies of this book all referred to those times in which the apostle lived, and to the disturbances which then took place, not only among the <i>Jews</i>, but in the <i>Roman</i> empire. What they all mean, and when and how they are to be fulfilled, God in heaven alone knows.</p>
