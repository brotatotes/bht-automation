<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>. <i><b>The word of my patience</b></i> — The doctrine which has exposed you to so much trouble and persecution, and required so much patience and magnanimity to bear up under its attendant trials.</p>
<p><i><b>The hour of temptation</b></i> — A <i>time</i> of sore and peculiar trial which might have proved too much for their strength. He who is faithful to the grace of God is often hidden from trials and difficulties which fall without mitigation on those who have been unfaithful in his covenant. Many understand by the <i>hour of temptation</i> the persecution under <i>Trajan</i>, which was greater and more extensive than the preceding ones under <i>Nero</i> and <i>Domitian</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To try them</b></i> — That is, such persecutions will be the means of trying and proving those who profess Christianity, and showing who were sound and thorough Christians and who were not.</p>
