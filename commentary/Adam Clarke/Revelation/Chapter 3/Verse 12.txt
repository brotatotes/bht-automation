<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>. <i><b>A pillar in the temple</b></i> — There is probably all allusion here to the <i>two pillars</i> in the temple of Jerusalem, called <i>Jachin</i> and <i>Boaz</i>, stability and strength. The <i>Church</i> is the <i>temple</i>; CHRIST is the <i>foundation</i> on which it is built; and his <i>ministers</i> are the PILLARS by which, under him, it is adorned and supported. St. Paul has the same allusions, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>I will write upon him the name of my God</b></i> — That is, I will make him a <i>priest</i> unto myself. The priest had written on his forehead ליהוה קודש <i>kodesh laihovah</i>, "Holiness to the Lord."</p>
<p><i><b>And the name of the city of my God</b></i> — As the high priest had on his breastplate the names of the twelve tribes engraved, and these constituted the <i>city</i> or <i>Church of God</i>; Christ here promises that in place of them the twelve apostles, representing the <i>Christian</i> <i>Church</i>, shall be written, which is called the <i>New Jerusalem</i>, and which God has adopted in place of the <i>twelve Jewish tribes</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>My new name.</b></i> — The <i>Saviour</i> of ALL; the <i>light</i> that <i>lightens</i> the GENTILES; the CHRIST; the Anointed One; the only GOVERNOR of his Church; and the <i>Redeemer</i> of ALL mankind.</p>
<p>There is here an intimation that the Christian <i>Church</i> is to endure for ever; and the Christian <i>ministry</i> to last as long as time endures: <i>He shall go no more out</i> for ever.</p>
