<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:15">Revelation 3:15</span>. <i><b>Thou art neither cold nor hot</b></i> — Ye are neither heathens nor Christians-neither good nor evil-neither led away by false doctrine, nor thoroughly addicted to that which is true. In a word, they were listless and indifferent, and seemed to care little whether heathenism or Christianity prevailed. Though they felt little zeal either for the salvation of their own souls or that of others, yet they had such a general conviction of the truth and importance of Christianity, that they could not readily give it up.</p>
<p><i><b>I would thou wert cold or hot</b></i> — That is, ye should be decided; adopt some part or other, and be in earnest in your attachment to it. If ever the words of Mr. Erskine, in his Gospel Sonnets, were true, they were true of this Church: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "To good and evil equal bent,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> I'm both a devil and a saint."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>They were too <i>good</i> to go to <i>hell</i>, too <i>bad</i> to go to <i>heaven</i>. Like Ephraim and Judah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:4">Hosea 6:4</span>: <i>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do</i> <i>unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the</i> <i>early dew it passeth away</i>. They had <i>good</i> dispositions which were captivated by evil ones, and they had <i>evil</i> dispositions which in their turn yielded to those that were good; and the Divine justice and mercy seem puzzled to know what to do <i>to</i> or <i>with</i> them. This was the state of the Laodicean Church; and our Lord expresses here in this apparent <i>wish</i>, the same that is expressed by <i>Epictetus</i>, Ench., chap. 36. Ἑνα σε δει ανθρωπον, η αγαθον, η κακον, ειναι . "Thou oughtest to be one kind of man, either a good man or a bad man."</p>
