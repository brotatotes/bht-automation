<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:17">Revelation 3:17</span>. <i><b>I am rich</b></i> — Thou supposest thyself to be in a safe state, perfectly sure of final salvation, because thou hast begun well, and laid the right foundation. It was this most deceitful conviction that cut the nerves of their spiritual diligence; they rested in what they had already received, and seemed to think that <i>once in grace</i> must be <i>still in grace</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou art wretched</b></i> — ταλαιπωρος <i>Most wretched</i>. "The word signifies," according to Mintert, "being worn out and fatigued with grievous labours, as they who labour in a <i>stone quarry</i>, or are condemned to the <i>mines</i>." So, instead of being children of God, as they supposed, and infallible heirs of the kingdom, they were, in the sight of God, in the condition of the most abject <i>slaves</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And miserable</b></i> — ο ελεεινος Most deplorable, to be pitied by all men.</p>
<p><i><b>And poor</b></i> — Having no <i>spiritual riches</i>, no <i>holiness</i> of heart. <i>Rich</i> and <i>poor</i> are sometimes used by the rabbins to express the <i>righteous</i> and the <i>wicked</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And blind</b></i> — The eyes of thy understanding being darkened, so that thou dost not see thy state.</p>
<p><i><b>And naked</b></i> — Without the image of God, not clothed with holiness and purity. A more deplorable state in spiritual things can scarcely be imagined than that of this Church. And it is the true picture of many <i>Churches</i>, and of innumerable individuals.</p>
