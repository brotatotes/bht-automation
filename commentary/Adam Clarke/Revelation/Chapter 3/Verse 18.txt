<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:18">Revelation 3:18</span>. <i><b>I counsel thee</b></i> — O fallen and deceived soul, hear Jesus! Thy case is not <i>hopeless</i>. <i>Buy of me</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Gold tried in the fire</b></i> — Come and receive from me, without money and without price, <i>faith</i> that shall stand in every trial: so <i>gold</i> <i>tried in the fire</i> is here understood. But it may mean pure and undefiled <i>religion</i>, or that <i>grace</i> or <i>Divine influence</i> which produces it, which is more valuable to the soul than the purest gold to the body. They had before <i>imaginary riches</i>; this alone can make them <i>truly</i> rich.</p>
<p><i><b>White raiment</b></i> — Holiness of heart and life.</p>
<p><i><b>Anoint thine eyes</b></i> — Pray for, that ye may receive, the enlightening influences of my Spirit, that ye may be convinced of your true state, and see where your help lies.</p>
