<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:19">Revelation 3:19</span>. <i><b>As many as I love</b></i> — So it was the love he still had to them that induced him thus to reprehend and thus to counsel them.</p>
<p><i><b>Be zealous</b></i> — Be in <i>earnest</i>, to get your souls saved, They had no zeal; this was their bane. He now stirs them up to diligence in the use of the means of grace and repentance for their past sins and remissness.</p>
