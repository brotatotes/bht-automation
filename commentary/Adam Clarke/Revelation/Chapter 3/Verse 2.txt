<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:2">Revelation 3:2</span>. <i><b>Be watchful</b></i> — Ye have lost ground by carelessness and inattention. Awake, and keep awake!</p>
<p><i><b>Strengthen the things which remain</b></i> — The convictions and good desires, with any measure of the fear of God and of a tender conscience, which, although still subsisting, are about to perish, because the Holy Spirit, who is the author of them, being repeatedly grieved, is about finally to depart.</p>
<p><i><b>Thy works perfect</b></i> — πεπληρωμενα <i>Filled up</i>. They performed duties of all kinds, but no duty <i>completely</i>. They were constantly beginning, but never brought any thing to a proper end. Their resolutions were languid, their strength feeble, and their light dim. They probably maintained their reputation <i>before men</i>, but their works were not perfect <i>before God</i>.</p>
