<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:20">Revelation 3:20</span>. <i><b>Behold, I stand at the door and knock</b></i> — There are many sayings of this kind among the ancient rabbins; thus in <i>Shir</i> <i>Hashirim Rabba</i>, fol. 25, 1: "God said to the Israelites, My children, open to me one <i>door</i> of repentance, even so wide as the eye of a needle, and I will open to you <i>doors</i> through which calves and horned cattle may pass."</p>
<p>In <i>Sohar Levit</i>, fol. 8, col. 32, it is said: "If a man <i>conceal</i> his sin, and do not open it before the holy King, although he ask mercy, yet the <i>door</i> of repentance shall not be <i>opened</i> to him. But if he <i>open</i> it before the holy blessed God, God spares him, and mercy prevails over wrath; and when he laments, although <i>all the</i> <i>doors</i> were <i>shut</i>, yet they shall be <i>opened</i> to him, and his prayer shall be heard."</p>
<p>Christ <i>stands</i> - waits long, at the <i>door</i> of the sinner's heart; he <i>knocks</i> - uses judgments, mercies, reproofs, exhortations, c., to induce sinners to repent and turn to him he lifts up his <i>voice</i> - calls loudly by his word, ministers, and Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>If any man hear</b></i> — If the sinner will seriously consider his state, and attend to the voice of his Lord.</p>
<p><i><b>And open the door</b></i> — This must be his <i>own act</i>, receiving power for this purpose from his offended Lord, who will not <i>break open</i> the door; he will make no <i>forcible entry</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>I will come in to him</b></i> — I will manifest myself to him, heal all his backslidings, pardon all his iniquities, and love him freely.</p>
<p><i><b>Will sup with him</b></i> — Hold communion with him, feed him with the bread of life.</p>
<p><i><b>And he with me.</b></i> — I will bring him at last to dwell with me in everlasting glory.</p>
