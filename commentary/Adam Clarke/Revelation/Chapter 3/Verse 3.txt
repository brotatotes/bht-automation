Verse Revelation 3:3. Remember — Enter into a serious consideration of your state.How thou hast received — With what joy, zeal, and gladness ye heard the Gospel of Christ when first preached to you.Hold fast — Those good desires and heavenly influences which still remain.And repent. — Be humbled before God, because ye have not been workers together with him, but have received much of his grace in vain.If therefore thou shalt not watch — If you do not consider your ways, watching against sin, and for opportunities to receive and do good.I will come on thee as a thief — As the thief comes when he is not expected, so will I come upon you if ye be not watchful, and cut you off from life and hope.
