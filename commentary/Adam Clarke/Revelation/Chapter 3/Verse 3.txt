<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:3">Revelation 3:3</span>. <i><b>Remember</b></i> — Enter into a serious consideration of your state.</p>
<p><i><b>How thou hast received</b></i> — With what joy, zeal, and gladness ye heard the Gospel of Christ when first preached to you.</p>
<p><i><b>Hold fast</b></i> — Those good desires and heavenly influences which still remain.</p>
<p><i><b>And repent.</b></i> — Be humbled before God, because ye have not been workers together with him, but have received much of his grace in vain.</p>
<p><i><b>If therefore thou shalt not watch</b></i> — If you do not consider your ways, watching against sin, and for opportunities to receive and do good.</p>
<p><i><b>I will come on thee as a thief</b></i> — As the thief comes when he is not expected, so will I come upon you if ye be not watchful, and cut you off from life and hope.</p>
