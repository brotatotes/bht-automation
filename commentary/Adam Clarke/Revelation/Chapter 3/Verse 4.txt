<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:4">Revelation 3:4</span>. <i><b>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis</b></i> — A few <i>persons,</i> <i>names</i> being put for those who bore them. And as the members of the Church were all <i>enrolled</i>, or their names entered in a book, when admitted into the Church or when baptized, <i>names</i> are here put for the <i>people</i> themselves. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Have not defiled their garments</b></i> — Their <i>souls</i>. The Hebrews considered holiness as the <i>garb</i> of the soul, and evil actions as <i>stains</i> or <i>spots</i> on this garb. So in <i>Shabbath</i>, fol. 152, 2: "A certain king gave royal garments to his servants: those who were prudent folded them up, and laid them by in a chest; those who were foolish put them on, and performed their daily labour in them. After some time the king asked for those royal robes; the wise brought theirs white and clean, the foolish brought theirs spotted with dirt. With the former the king was well pleased; with the latter he was angry. Concerning the former he said: Let those garments be laid up in my wardrobe, and let the persons go home in peace. Of the latter he said: Let the garments be put into the hands of the fuller, and cast those who wore them into prison." This parable is spoken on these words of Ecclesiastes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ec+12:7">Ecclesiastes 12:7</span>: <i>The spirit shall return to God who gave it</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>They shall walk with me in white</b></i> — They shall be raised to a state of eternal glory, and shall be for ever with their Lord.</p>
