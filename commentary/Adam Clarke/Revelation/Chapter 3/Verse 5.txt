<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>. <i><b>I will not blot out his name</b></i> — This may be an allusion to the custom of registering the names of those who were admitted into the Church in a book kept for that purpose, from which custom our <i>baptismal registers</i> in Churches are derived. These are properly <i>books of life</i>, as there those who were born unto God were registered; as in the latter those who were born in that parish were enrolled. Or there may be allusions to the <i>white raiment</i> worn by the priests, and the erasing of the name of any priest out of the sacerdotal list who had either sinned, or was found not to be of the seed of Aaron. In <i>Middoth</i>, fol. 37, 2: "The great council of Israel sat and judged the priests. If in a priest any vice was found they stripped of his white garments and clothed him in <i>black</i>, in which he wrapped himself, went out, and departed. Him in whom no vice was found they clothed in <i>white</i>, and he went and took his part in the ministry among his brother priests."</p>
<p><i><b>I will confess his name</b></i> — I will acknowledge that this person is my true disciple, and a member of my mystical body. In all this there may also be an allusion to the custom of registering citizens. Their names were entered into books, according to their condition, tribes, family, c. and when they were dead, or had by unconstitutional acts forfeited their right of citizenship, the name was <i>blotted out</i>, or erased from the registers. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:32">Exodus 32:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:32">Exodus 32:32</span></span>.</p>
