<p><i>Epistle to the Church at Philadelphia.</i></p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>. <i><b>He that is holy</b></i> — In whom holiness essentially dwells, and from whom all holiness is derived.</p>
<p><i><b>He that is true</b></i> — He who is the fountain of truth; who cannot lie nor be imposed on; from whom all truth proceeds; and whose veracity in his <i>Revelation</i> is unimpeachable.</p>
<p><i><b>He that hath the key of David</b></i> — See this metaphor explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>. <i>Key</i> is the emblem of authority and knowledge; <i>the key of David</i> is the regal right or authority of David. David could <i>shut</i> or <i>open</i> the kingdom of Israel to whom he pleased. He was not bound to leave the kingdom even to his eldest son. He could choose whom he pleased to succeed him. The kingdom of the Gospel, and the kingdom of heaven, are at the disposal of Christ. He can <i>shut</i> against whom he will; he can <i>open</i> to whom he pleases. If he <i>shuts</i>, no man can <i>open</i>; if he <i>opens</i>, no man can <i>shut</i>. His determinations all stand fast, and none can reverse them. This expression is an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+22:22">Isaiah 22:22</span>, where the prophet promises to Eliakim, under the symbol of the key of the house of David, the government of the whole nation; i.e., all the power of the king, to be executed by him as his deputy; but the words, as here applied to Christ, show that <i>He</i> is absolute.</p>
