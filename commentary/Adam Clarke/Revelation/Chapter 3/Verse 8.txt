<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</span>. <i><b>I have set before thee an open door</b></i> — I have opened to thee a door to proclaim and diffuse my word; and, notwithstanding there are many adversaries to the spread of my Gospel, yet none of them shall be able to prevent it.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou hast a little strength</b></i> — Very little political authority or influence; yet thou <i>hast kept my word</i>-hast kept the true <i>doctrine;</i> <i>and hast not denied my name</i>, by taking shelter in heathenism when Christianity was persecuted. The <i>little strength</i> may refer either to the smallness of the numbers, or to the littleness of their grace.</p>
