<p><i><b>I will make them to come and worship</b></i> — I will so dispose of matters in the course of my providence, that the Jews shall be obliged to seek unto the Christians for toleration, support, and protection, which they shall be obliged to sue for in the most <i>humble</i> and <i>abject</i> manner.</p>
