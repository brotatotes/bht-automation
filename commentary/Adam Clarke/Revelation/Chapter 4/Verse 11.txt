<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span>. <i><b>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive</b></i> â€” Thus all creation acknowledges the supremacy of God; and we learn from this song that he <i>made all things for his pleasure</i>; and through the same motive he <i>preserves</i>. Hence it is most evident, that he hateth nothing that he has made, and could have made no intelligent creature with the design to make it eternally miserable. It is strange that a contrary supposition has ever entered into the heart of man; and it is high time that the benevolent nature of the Supreme God should be fully vindicated from aspersions of this kind.</p>
