<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>. <i><b>Four and twenty elders</b></i> — Perhaps this is in reference to the smaller <i>Sanhedrin</i> at Jerusalem, which was composed of twenty-three elders; or to the <i>princes of the twenty-four courses</i> of the Jewish priests which ministered at the tabernacle and the temple, at first appointed by David.</p>
<p><i><b>Clothed in white raiment</b></i> — The garments of the priests.</p>
<p><i><b>On their heads crowns of gold.</b></i> — An emblem of their <i>dignity</i>. The Jewish writers represent human souls as being created first; and before they enter the body, each is taken by an angel into paradise, where it sees the righteous sitting in glory with crowns upon their heads. <i>Rab. Tanchum</i>, fol. 39, 4.</p>
