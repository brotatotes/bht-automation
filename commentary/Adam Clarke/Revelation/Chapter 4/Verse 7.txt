<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>. <i><b>The first beast</b></i><b> was </b><i><b>like a lion</b></i> â€” It is supposed that there is a reference here to the <i>four standards</i> or <i>ensigns</i> of the <i>four divisions</i> of the tribes in the Israelitish camp, as they are described by Jewish writers.</p>
<p>The first living creature was like a <i>lion</i>; this was, say the rabbins, the standard of JUDAH on the <i>east</i>, with the two tribes of <i>Issachar</i> and <i>Zabulon</i>. The second, like a <i>calf</i> or <i>ox</i>, which was the emblem of EPHRAIM who pitched on the <i>west</i>, with the two tribes of <i>Manasseh</i> and <i>Benjamin</i>. The third, with the <i>face</i> of a <i>man</i>, which, according to the rabbins, was the standard of REUBEN who pitched on the <i>south</i>, with the two tribes of <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Gad</i>. The fourth which was like a <i>flying</i> (spread) <i>eagle</i>, was, according to the same writers, the emblem on the ensign of DAN who pitched on the <i>north</i>, with the two tribes of <i>Asher</i> and <i>Naphtali</i>. This traditionary description agrees with the <i>four faces</i> of the cherub in Ezekiel's vision. See my <i>notes</i> and <i>diagrams</i> on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+2:0">Numbers 2:0</span>.</p>
<p><i>Christian tradition</i> has given these creatures as emblems of the <i>four</i> evangelists. To <i>John</i> is attributed the EAGLE; to <i>Luke</i> the OX, to <i>Mark</i> the LION, and to <i>Matthew</i> the MAN, or <i>angel</i> in <i>human</i> form. As the former represented the <i>whole Jewish Church</i> or <i>congregation</i>, so the latter is intended to represent the <i>whole</i> <i>Christian Church</i>.</p>
