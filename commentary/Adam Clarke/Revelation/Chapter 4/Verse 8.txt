<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>. <i><b>The four beasts had each of them six wings</b></i> — I have already observed, in the <i>preface</i> to this book, that the <i>phraseology</i> is <i>rabbinical</i>; I might have added, and the <i>imagery</i> also. We have almost a counterpart of this description in <i>Pirkey</i> <i>Elieser</i>. chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+4:0">Revelation 4:0</span>. I shall give the substance of this from <i>Schoettgen</i>. "Four troops of ministering angels praise the holy blessed God: the first is <i>Michael,</i> at the right hand; the next is <i>Gabriel</i>, at the left; the third is <i>Uriel</i>, before; and the fourth is <i>Raphael</i>, behind him. The <i>shechinah</i> of the holy, blessed God is <i>in the midst</i>, and he himself <i>sits upon a throne</i> high and elevated, hanging in the air; and his magnificence is as <i>amber</i> חשמל , (chashmal,) <i>in the midst of the fire</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</span>, On his head is placed a <i>crown</i> and a <i>diadem</i>, with the incommunicable name (יהוה <i>Yehovah</i>) inscribed on the front of it. His <i>eyes</i> go throughout the whole earth; a part of them is <i>fire</i>, and a part of them <i>hail</i>. At his right hand stands <i>Life</i>, and at his left hand <i>Death</i>; and he has a fiery sceptre in his hand. Before him is the <i>veil</i> spread, that <i>veil</i> which is between the <i>temple</i> and the <i>holy</i> <i>of holies</i>; and <i>seven angels</i> minister before him within that <i>veil</i>: the veil and his footstool are like <i>fire</i> and <i>lightning</i>; and <i>under</i> <i>the throne of glory</i> there is a shining like fire and <i>sapphire</i>, and <i>about his throne are justice</i> and <i>judgment</i>.</p>
<p>"The place of the throne are the <i>seven clouds of glory</i>; and the <i>chariot wheels</i>, and the <i>cherub</i>, and the <i>living creatures</i> which <i>give glory</i> before his face. The throne is in similitude like <i>sapphire</i>; and at the four feet of it are <i>four living creatures</i>, each of which has <i>four faces</i> and <i>four wings</i>. When God speaks from the <i>east</i>, then it is from between the two cherubim with the <i>face</i> <i>of a MAN</i>; when he speaks from the <i>south</i>, then it is from between the two cherubim with the <i>face of a LION</i>; when from the <i>west</i>, then it is from between the two cherubim with the <i>face of an OX</i>; and when from the <i>north</i>, then it is from between the two cherubim with the <i>face of an EAGLE</i>.</p>
<p>"And the <i>living creatures stand before the throne of glory</i>; and they stand in fear, in trembling, in horror, and in great agitation; and from this agitation a <i>stream of fire</i> flows before them. Of the two <i>seraphim</i> one stands at the right hand of the holy blessed God, and one stands at the left; and each has <i>six wings</i>: with <i>two they cover their face</i> lest they should see the face of the <i>shechina; with two they cover their feet</i> lest they should find out the footstool of the shechinah; and <i>with two they fly</i>, and sanctify his great name. And they answer each other, saying <i>Holy,</i> <i>holy, holy, Lord God of hosts</i>; the whole earth is full of his glory. And the <i>living creatures</i> stand near his glory, yet they do not know the place of his glory; but wheresoever his glory is, they cry out and say, <i>Blessed be the glory of the Lord in his</i> <i>place</i>."</p>
<p>In <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sec. 23, fol. 122, 4, Rabbi Abin says: "There are <i>four</i> which have principality in this world: among <i>intellectual</i> <i>creatures</i>, MAN; among <i>birds</i>, the EAGLE; among <i>cattle</i>, the OX; and among <i>wild beasts</i>, the LION: each of these has a kingdom and a certain magnificence, and they are placed <i>under the throne of</i> <i>glory</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:10">Ezekiel 1:10</span>, to show that no creature is to exalt itself in this world, and that the kingdom of God is over all." These creatures may be considered the representatives of the whole creation.</p>
