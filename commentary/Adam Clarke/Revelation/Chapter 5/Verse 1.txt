<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span>. <i><b>A book written within and on the back side</b></i> — That is, the book was full of solemn contents <i>within</i>, but it was <i>sealed</i>; and on the <i>back side</i> was a <i>superscription</i> indicating its contents. It was a <i>labelled</i> book, or one written on each side of the skin, which was not usual.</p>
<p><i><b>Sealed with seven seals.</b></i> — As seven is a number of <i>perfection</i>, it may mean that the book was so sealed that the seals could neither be <i>counterfeited</i> nor <i>broken</i>; i.e., the matter of the book was so <i>obscure</i> and <i>enigmatical</i> and the work it enjoined and the facts it predicted so difficult and stupendous, that they could neither be known nor performed by human wisdom or power.</p>
