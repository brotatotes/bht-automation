Verse Revelation 5:12. To receive power — That is, Jesus Christ is worthy to take, λαβειν, to have ascribed to him, power-omnipotence; riches-beneficence; wisdom-omniscience; strength-power in prevalent exercise; honour-the highest reputation for what he has done; glory-the praise due to such actions; and blessing-the thankful acknowledgments of the whole creation. Here are seven different species of praise; and this is exactly agreeable to the rabbinical forms, which the author of this book keeps constantly in view. See Sepher Rasiel, fol. 39, 2: "To thee belongs כבוד cabod, glory; גדולה gedulah, magnitude; גבורה geburah, might; הממלכה hammamlakah, the kingdom; התפארת hattiphereth, the honour; הנצח hannetsach, the victory; וההוד vehahod, and the praise."
