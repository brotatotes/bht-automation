<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span>. <i><b>Every creature</b></i> â€” All parts of the creation, animate and inanimate, are represented here, by that figure of speech called <i>prosopopaeia</i> or <i>personification</i>, as giving praise to the Lord Jesus, because by him <i>all things were created</i>. We find the whole creation gives precisely the <i>same praise</i>, and in the <i>same terms</i>, to Jesus Christ, who is undoubtedly meant here by the <i>Lamb just</i> <i>slain</i> as they give to GOD who <i>sits upon the throne</i>. Now if Jesus Christ were not properly GOD this would be <i>idolatry</i>, as it would be giving to the <i>creature</i> what belongs to the <i>Creator</i>.</p>
