<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:14">Revelation 5:14</span>. <i><b>The four beasts said, Amen.</b></i> — Acknowledged that what was attributed to Christ was his due.</p>
<p><i><b>The four</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>twenty elders</b></i> — The word εικοσιτεσσαρες, <i>twenty-four</i>, is wanting in the most eminent MSS. and versions.</p>
<p><i><b>Fell down and worshipped</b></i> — Επεσαν και προσεκυνησαν· <i>Fell down</i> on their knees, and then <i>prostrated themselves</i> before the throne. This is the eastern method of <i>adoration</i>: first, the person worshiping fell down on his knees; and then, bowing down touched the earth with his forehead. This latter act was <i>prostration</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Him that liveth for ever</b></i> — This clause is wanting in ABC, thirty-seven others, <i>Syriac, Arabic, Coptic, AEthiopic</i>, some copies of the <i>Slavonic, Itala</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>; and in <i>Andreas</i>, and <i>Arethas</i>, ancient commentators on this book. It is also wanting in some editions, and is undoubtedly spurious. Griesbach has left this and the above <i>twenty-four</i> out of the text.</p>
<p>Now follow the least intelligible parts of this mysterious book, on which so much has been written, and so much in vain. It is natural for man to desire to be wise; and the more difficult the subject the more it is studied, and the hope of finding out something by which the world and the Church might be profited, has caused the most eminently learned men to employ their talents and consume their time on these abstruse prophecies. But of what use has all this learned and well-meant labour been to mankind? Can <i>hypothesis</i> explain <i>prophecy</i>, and <i>conjecture</i> find a <i>basis</i> on which <i>faith</i> can rest? And what have we better in all attempts hitherto made to explain the mysteries of this book?</p>
