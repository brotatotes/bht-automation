<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:2">Revelation 5:2</span>. <i><b>A strong angel</b></i> — One of the <i>chief</i> of the angelic host.</p>
<p><i><b>Proclaiming</b></i> — As the <i>herald</i> of God.</p>
<p><i><b>To open the book, and to loose the seals</b></i> — To loose the seals that he may open the book. Who can tell what this book contains? Who can open its mysteries? The book may mean the purposes and designs of God relative to his government of the world and the Church; but we, whose habitation is in the dust, know nothing of such things. We are, however, determined to <i>guess</i>.</p>
