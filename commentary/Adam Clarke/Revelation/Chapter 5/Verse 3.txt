Verse Revelation 5:3. And no man — ουδεις No person or being.In heaven — Among all the angels of God.Nor in the earth — No human being.Neither under the earth — No disembodied spirit, nor any demon. Neither angels, men, nor devils, can fathom the decrees of God.Neither to look thereon. — None can look into it unless it be opened, and none can open it unless the seals be unloosed.
