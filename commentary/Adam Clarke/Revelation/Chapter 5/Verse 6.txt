<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. <i><b>Stood a Lamb</b></i> — Christ, so called because he was a sacrificial offering; αρνιον signifies a <i>little</i> or <i>delicate</i> lamb.</p>
<p><i><b>As it had been slain</b></i> — As if now <i>in the act of being offered</i>. This is very remarkable; so important is the sacrificial offering of Christ in the sight of God that he is still represented as being in the very act of pouring out his blood for the offences of man. This gives great advantage to faith: when any soul comes to the throne of grace, he finds a sacrifice there provided for him to offer to God. Thus all succeeding generations find they have the <i>continual</i> sacrifice ready, and the newly-shed blood to offer.</p>
<p><i><b>Seven horns</b></i> — As <i>horn</i> is the emblem of <i>power</i>, and <i>seven</i> the number of <i>perfection</i>, the <i>seven horns</i> may denote the all-prevailing and infinite <i>might</i> of Jesus Christ. He <i>can</i> support all his <i>friends</i>; he <i>can</i> destroy all his <i>enemies</i>; and he <i>can</i> save to the uttermost all that come unto God through him.</p>
<p><i><b>Seven eyes</b></i> — To denote his infinite knowledge and wisdom: but as these <i>seven eyes</i> are said to be the <i>seven Spirits of God</i>, they seem to denote rather his <i>providence</i>, in which he often employs the ministry of <i>angels</i>; therefore, these are said to be <i>sent forth</i> <i>into all the earth</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span></span>.</p>
