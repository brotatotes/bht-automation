<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>. <i><b>The four beasts - fell down before the Lamb</b></i> — The whole Church of God, and all his children in heaven and earth, acknowledge that Jesus Christ is alone worthy and able to unfold and execute all the mysteries and counsels of God. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Having every one of them harps</b></i> — There were <i>harps</i> and <i>vials</i>; and each of the <i>elders</i> and <i>living creatures</i> had <i>one</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Odours, which are the prayers of saints.</b></i> — The frankincense and odours offered at the tabernacle were emblems of the prayers and praises of the Lord. That <i>prayers</i> are compared to <i>incense</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+141:2">Psalms 141:2</span>: <i>Let my PRAYER be set forth before thee as INCENSE</i>. Hence that saying in <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, p. 44, n. 37: "The odour of the prayers of the Israelites is equal to <i>myrrh</i> and <i>frankincense</i>; but on the Sabbath it is preferred to the scent of all kinds of perfumes." The words <i>which are the prayers of saints</i> are to be understood as <i>this is my body</i>, this signifies or <i>represents</i> my body; these odours <i>represent</i> the prayers of the saints.</p>
