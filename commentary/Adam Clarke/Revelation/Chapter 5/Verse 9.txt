<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>. <i><b>A new song</b></i> — Composed on the matters and blessings of the Gospel, which was just now opened on earth. But <i>new song</i> may signify a <i>most excellent song</i>; and by this the Gospel and its blessings are probably signified. The Gospel is called a <i>new song</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+96:1">Psalms 96:1</span>. And perhaps there is an allusion in the <i>harps</i> here to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+144:9">Psalms 144:9</span>: <i>I will sing a NEW SONG unto thee, O God: upon a PSALTERY, and an</i> <i>INSTRUMENT of TEN STRINGS</i>, c. The same form of speech is found, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:10">Isaiah 42:10</span>: <i>Sing unto the Lord a NEW SONG</i>, c. and there the prophet seems to have the <i>Gospel dispensation</i> particularly in view.</p>
<p><i><b>Thou-hast redeemed us to God - out of every - nation</b></i> — It appears, therefore, that the <i>living creatures</i> and the <i>elders</i> represent the <i>aggregate</i> of the followers of God or the <i>Christian Church</i> in all nations, and among all kinds of people, and perhaps through the whole compass of time: and all these are said to be redeemed by Christ's <i>blood</i>, plainly showing that his <i>life</i> was a <i>sacrificial</i> <i>offering</i> for the sins of mankind.</p>
