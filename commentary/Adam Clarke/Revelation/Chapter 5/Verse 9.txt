Verse Revelation 5:9. A new song — Composed on the matters and blessings of the Gospel, which was just now opened on earth. But new song may signify a most excellent song; and by this the Gospel and its blessings are probably signified. The Gospel is called a new song, Psalms 96:1. And perhaps there is an allusion in the harps here to Psalms 144:9: I will sing a NEW SONG unto thee, O God: upon a PSALTERY, and an INSTRUMENT of TEN STRINGS, c. The same form of speech is found, Isaiah 42:10: Sing unto the Lord a NEW SONG, c. and there the prophet seems to have the Gospel dispensation particularly in view.Thou-hast redeemed us to God - out of every - nation — It appears, therefore, that the living creatures and the elders represent the aggregate of the followers of God or the Christian Church in all nations, and among all kinds of people, and perhaps through the whole compass of time: and all these are said to be redeemed by Christ's blood, plainly showing that his life was a sacrificial offering for the sins of mankind.
