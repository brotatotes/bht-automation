Verse Revelation 6:10. And they cried with a loud voice — That is, their blood, like that of Abel, cried for vengeance; for we are not to suppose that there was any thing like a vindictive spirit in those happy and holy souls who had shed their blood for the testimony of Jesus. We sometimes say Blood cries for blood; that is, in the order of Divine justice, every murderer, and every murdering persecutor, shall be punished.O Lord — ο δεσποτης Sovereign Lord, supreme Ruler; one having and exercising unlimited and uncontrolled authority.Holy — In thy own nature, hating iniquity;And true — In all thy promises and threatenings;Dost thou not judge — The persecutors;And avenge our blood — Inflict signal punishment;On them that dwell on the earth? — Probably meaning the persecuting Jews; they dwelt επιτηςγης, upon that land, a form of speech by which Judea is often signified in the New Testament.
