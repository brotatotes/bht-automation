<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>. <i><b>And they cried with a loud voice</b></i> — That is, their <i>blood</i>, like that of Abel, cried for vengeance; for we are not to suppose that there was any thing like a vindictive spirit in those happy and holy souls who had shed their blood for the testimony of Jesus. We sometimes say <i>Blood cries for blood</i>; that is, in the order of Divine justice, every murderer, and every murdering persecutor, shall be punished.</p>
<p><i><b>O Lord</b></i> — ο δεσποτης Sovereign Lord, supreme Ruler; one having and exercising unlimited and uncontrolled authority.</p>
<p><i><b>Holy</b></i> — In thy own nature, hating iniquity;</p>
<p><i><b>And true</b></i> — In all thy promises and threatenings;</p>
<p><i><b>Dost thou not judge</b></i> — The persecutors;</p>
<p><i><b>And avenge our blood</b></i> — Inflict signal punishment;</p>
<p><i><b>On them that dwell on the earth?</b></i> — Probably meaning the persecuting <i>Jews</i>; they dwelt επιτηςγης, <i>upon that land</i>, a form of speech by which <i>Judea</i> is often signified in the New Testament.</p>
