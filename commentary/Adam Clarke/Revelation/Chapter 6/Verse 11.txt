<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11">Revelation 6:11</span>. <i><b>White robes</b></i> — The emblems of purity, innocence, and triumph.</p>
<p><i><b>They should rest yet for a little season</b></i> — This is a declaration that, when the cup of the iniquity of the Jews should be full, they should then be punished in a mass. They were determined to proceed farther, and God permits them so to do; reserving the fulness of their punishment till they had filled up the measure of their iniquity. If this book was written <i>before</i> the destruction of Jerusalem, as is most likely, then this destruction is that which was to fall upon the <i>Jews</i>; and the <i>little time</i> or <i>season</i> was that which elapsed between their martyrdom, or the date of this book, and the final destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, under Vespasian and his son Titus, about A.D. 70. What follows may refer to the destruction of the heathen Roman empire.</p>
