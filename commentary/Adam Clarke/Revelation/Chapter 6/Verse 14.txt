<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:14">Revelation 6:14</span>. <i><b>And the heaven departed as a scroll</b></i> — The whole system of pagan and idolatrous worship, with all its spiritual, secular, and superstitious influence, was blasted, shrivelled up, and rendered null and void, as a parchment scroll when exposed to the action of a strong fire.</p>
<p><i><b>And every mountain</b></i> — All the props, supports, and dependencies of the empire, whether <i>regal allies, tributary kings, dependent</i> <i>colonies</i>, or <i>mercenary troops, were all moved out of their places</i>, so as to stand no longer in the same relation to that empire, and its worship, support, and maintenance, as they formerly did.</p>
<p><i><b>And island</b></i> — The heathen temples, with their <i>precincts</i> and <i>enclosures, cut off</i> from the common people, and into which none could come but the <i>privileged</i>, may be here represented by <i>islands</i>, for the same reasons.</p>
