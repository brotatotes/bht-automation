<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:15">Revelation 6:15</span>. <i><b>The kings of the earth</b></i>, c.] All the secular powers who had endeavoured to support the pagan worship by authority, influence, riches, political wisdom, and military skill with <i>every bondman</i>-all <i>slaves</i>, who were in life and limb addicted to their masters or owners.</p>
<p><i><b>And every freeman</b></i> â€” Those who had been <i>manumitted</i>, commonly called <i>freedmen</i>, and who were attached, through gratitude, to the families of their liberators. All <i>hid themselves</i>-were astonished at the total overthrow of the heathen empire, and the revolution which had then taken place.</p>
