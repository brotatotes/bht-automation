<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>. <i><b>A white horse</b></i> — Supposed to represent the <i>Gospel system</i>, and pointing out its excellence, swiftness, and purity.</p>
<p><i><b>He that sat on him</b></i> — Supposed to represent <i>Jesus Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A bow</b></i> — The <i>preaching of the Gospel</i>, darting <i>conviction</i> into the hearts of sinners.</p>
<p><i><b>A crown</b></i> — The emblem of the <i>kingdom</i> which Christ is to establish on earth.</p>
<p><i><b>Conquering, and to conquer.</b></i> — Overcoming and confounding the <i>Jews</i> first, and then the <i>Gentiles</i>; spreading more and more the doctrine and influence of the cross over the face of the earth.</p>
