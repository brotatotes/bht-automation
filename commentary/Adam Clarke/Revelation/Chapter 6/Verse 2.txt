Verse Revelation 6:2. A white horse — Supposed to represent the Gospel system, and pointing out its excellence, swiftness, and purity.He that sat on him — Supposed to represent Jesus Christ.A bow — The preaching of the Gospel, darting conviction into the hearts of sinners.A crown — The emblem of the kingdom which Christ is to establish on earth.Conquering, and to conquer. — Overcoming and confounding the Jews first, and then the Gentiles; spreading more and more the doctrine and influence of the cross over the face of the earth.
