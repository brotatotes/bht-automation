<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:6">Revelation 6:6</span>. <i><b>A measure of wheat for a penny</b></i> — The <i>chaenix</i> here mentioned was a measure of <i>dry</i> things; and although the <i>capacity</i> is not exactly known, yet it is generally agreed that it contained as much as one man could consume in a day; and a <i>penny</i>, the Roman <i>denarius</i>, was the ordinary pay of a labourer. So it appears that in this scarcity each might be able to obtain a bare subsistence by his daily labour; but a man could not, in such cases, provide for a <i>family</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Three measures of barley</b></i> — This seems to have been the <i>proportion</i> <i>of value</i> between the wheat and the barley. Barley was allowed to afford a poor aliment, and was given to the Roman soldiers instead of wheat, by way of <i>punishment</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hurt not the oil and the wine.</b></i> — Be sparing of these: use them not as <i>delicacies</i>, but for <i>necessity</i>; because neither the <i>vines</i> nor the <i>olives</i> will be productive.</p>
