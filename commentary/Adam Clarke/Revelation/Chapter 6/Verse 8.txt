Verse Revelation 6:8. A pale horse — The symbol of death. Pallida mors, pale death, was a very usual poetic epithet; of this symbol there can be no doubt, because it is immediately said, His name that sat on him was DEATH.And hell followed with him — The grave, or state of the dead, received the slain. This is a very elegant prosopopaeia, or personification.Over the fourth part of the earth — One fourth of mankind was to feel the desolating effects of this seal.To kill with sword — WAR; with hunger-FAMINE; with death-PESTILENCE; and with the beasts of the earth-lions, tigers, hyaenas, &c., which would multiply in consequence of the devastations occasioned by war, famine, and pestilence.
