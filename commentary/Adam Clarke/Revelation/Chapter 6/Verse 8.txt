<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>. <i><b>A pale horse</b></i> — The symbol of <i>death</i>. <i>Pallida mors, pale</i> <i>death</i>, was a very usual poetic epithet; of this symbol there can be no doubt, because it is immediately said, <i>His name that sat on</i> <i>him was DEATH</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And hell followed with him</b></i> — The <i>grave</i>, or <i>state of the dead</i>, received the <i>slain</i>. This is a very elegant <i>prosopopaeia</i>, or personification.</p>
<p><i><b>Over the fourth part of the earth</b></i> — One fourth of mankind was to feel the desolating effects of this seal.</p>
<p><i><b>To kill with sword</b></i> — WAR; <i>with hunger</i>-FAMINE; <i>with</i> <i>death</i>-PESTILENCE; <i>and with the beasts of the earth</i>-lions, tigers, hyaenas, &amp;c., which would multiply in consequence of the devastations occasioned by <i>war, famine</i>, and <i>pestilence</i>.</p>
