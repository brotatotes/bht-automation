<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>. <i><b>The fifth seal</b></i> — There is no <i>animal</i> nor any other <i>being</i> to introduce this seal, nor does there appear to be any new event predicted; but the whole is intended to comfort the followers of God under their persecutions, and to encourage them to bear up under their distresses.</p>
<p><i><b>I saw under the altar</b></i> — A symbolical vision was exhibited, in which he saw an <i>altar</i>; and under it the <i>souls of those who had</i> <i>been slain for the word of God</i>-martyred for their attachment to Christianity, are represented as being newly slain as victims to idolatry and superstition. The altar is upon earth, not in heaven.</p>
