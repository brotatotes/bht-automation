<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>. <i><b>Sir, thou knowest</b></i> — That is, I do not know, but thou canst inform me.</p>
<p><i><b>Came out of great tribulation</b></i> — Persecutions of every kind.</p>
<p><i><b>And have washed their robes</b></i> — Have obtained their <i>pardon</i> and <i>purity</i>, through the <i>blood of the Lamb</i>.</p>
<p>Their <i>white robes</i> cannot mean the <i>righteousness of Christ</i>, for this cannot be washed and made white in his own blood. This <i>white</i> <i>linen</i> is said to be <i>the righteousness of the saints</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:8">Revelation 19:8</span>, and this is the righteousness in which they stand <i>before the</i> <i>throne</i>; therefore it is not Christ's righteousness, but it is a righteousness wrought in them by the merit of his blood, and the power of his Spirit.</p>
