Verse Revelation 7:16. They shall hunger no more — They shall no longer be deprived of their religious ordinances, and the blessings attendant on them, as they were when in a state of persecution.Neither shall the sun light on them — Their secular rulers, being converted to God, became nursing fathers to the Church.Nor any heat. — Neither persecution nor affliction of any kind. These the Hebrews express by the term heat, scorching, &c.
