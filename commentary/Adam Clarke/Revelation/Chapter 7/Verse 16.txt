<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+7:16">Revelation 7:16</span>. <i><b>They shall hunger no more</b></i> — They shall no longer be deprived of their religious ordinances, and the blessings attendant on them, as they were when in a state of persecution.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither shall the sun light on them</b></i> — Their <i>secular rulers</i>, being converted to God, became nursing fathers to the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor any heat.</b></i> — Neither persecution nor affliction of any kind. These the Hebrews express by the term <i>heat, scorching</i>, &amp;c.</p>
