<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+7:17">Revelation 7:17</span>. <i><b>The Lamb</b></i> — The Lord Jesus, enthroned with his Father in ineffable glory.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall feed them</b></i> — Shall communicate to them every thing calculated to secure, continue, and increase their happiness.</p>
<p><i><b>Living fountains of water</b></i> — A <i>spring</i> in the Hebrew phraseology is termed <i>living water</i>, because constantly boiling up and running on. By these <i>perpetual fountains</i> we are to understand <i>endless sources</i> of comfort and happiness, which Jesus Christ will open out of his own infinite plenitude to all glorified souls. These eternal living fountains will make an infinite <i>variety</i> in the enjoyments of the blessed. There will be no <i>sameness</i>, and consequently no <i>cloying</i> with the perpetual enjoyment of the same things; every moment will open a <i>new source</i> of pleasure, instruction, and improvement; they shall make an eternal progression into the fulness of God. And as God is infinite, so his attributes are infinite; and throughout infinity more and more of those attributes will be discovered; and the discovery of each will be a <i>new fountain</i> or <i>source</i> of pleasure and enjoyment. These sources must be <i>opening</i> through all eternity, and yet, through all eternity, there will still remain, in the absolute perfections of the Godhead, an infinity of them to be opened! This is one of the finest images in the Bible.</p>
<p><i><b>God shall wipe away</b></i> — In the most affectionate and fatherly manner, <i>all tears from their eyes</i>-all causes of distress and grief. They shall have pure, unmixed happiness. Reader, this is the happiness of those who are washed from their sins. Art thou washed? O, rest not till thou art prepared to appear before God and the Lamb.</p>
<p>IF these saints had not met with troubles and distresses, in all likelihood they had not excelled so much in righteousness and true holiness. When all avenues of worldly comfort are shut up, we are obliged to seek our all in God; and there is nothing sought from him that is not found in him.</p>
