<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>. <i><b>Till we have sealed the servants of our God</b></i> â€” There is manifestly an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+9:4">Ezekiel 9:4</span> here. By <i>sealing</i> we are to understand <i>consecrating</i> the persons in a more especial manner to God, and showing, by this mark of God upon them, that they were under his more immediate protection, and that nothing should hurt them. It was a custom in the <i>east</i>, and indeed in the <i>west</i> too, to stamp with a hot iron the name of the owner upon the <i>forehead</i> or <i>shoulder</i> of his slave.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that not one Christian perished in the siege of Jerusalem; all had left the city, and escaped to Pella. This I have often had occasion to notice.</p>
