<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+7:4">Revelation 7:4</span>. <i><b>I heard the number of them which were sealed</b></i> â€” In the number of 144,000 are included all the <i>Jews</i> converted to Christianity; 12,000 out of each of the twelve tribes: but this must be only a certain for an uncertain number; for it is not to be supposed that <i>just</i> 12,000 were converted out of <i>each</i> of the <i>twelve tribes</i>.</p>
