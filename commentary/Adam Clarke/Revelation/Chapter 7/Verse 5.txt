Verse Revelation 7:5-8. Of the tribe of Juda, c.] First, we are to observe that the tribe of Levi is here mentioned, though that tribe had no inheritance in Israel but they now belonged to the spiritual priesthood. Secondly, That the tribe of Dan, which had an inheritance, is here omitted; as also the tribe of Ephraim. Thirdly, That the tribe of Joseph is here added in the place of Ephraim. Ephraim and Dan, being the principal promoters of idolatry, are left out in this enumeration.
