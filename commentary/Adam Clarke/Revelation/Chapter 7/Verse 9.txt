<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>. <i><b>A great multitude</b></i> — This appears to mean the Church of Christ among the <i>Gentiles</i>, for it was different from that collected from the <i>twelve tribes</i>; and it is here said to be of all <i>nations, kindreds, people</i>, and <i>tongues</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Clothed with white robes</b></i> — As emblems of <i>innocence</i> and <i>purity</i>. With <i>palms in their hands</i>, in token of victory gained over the world, the devil, and the flesh.</p>
