<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1">Revelation 8:1</span>. <i><b>The seventh seal</b></i> — This is ushered in and opened only by the Lamb.</p>
<p><i><b>Silence in heaven</b></i> — This must be a mere <i>metaphor, silence</i> being put here for the deep and solemn <i>expectation</i> of the stupendous things about to take place, which the opening of this seal had produced. When any thing prodigious or surprising is expected, all is <i>silence</i>, and even the breath is scarcely heard to be drawn.</p>
<p><i><b>Half an hour.</b></i> — As <i>heaven</i> may signify the <i>place</i> in which all these representations were made to St. John, the <i>half hour</i> may be considered as the time during which no representation was made to him, the time in which God was preparing the august exhibition which follows.</p>
<p>There is here, and in the following verses, a strong allusion to different parts of the <i>temple worship</i>; a presumption that the temple was still standing, and the regular service of God carried on. The <i>silence</i> here refers to this fact-while the priest went in to burn incense in the holy place, all the people continued in silent mental prayer without till the priest returned. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:10">Luke 1:10</span>. The angel mentioned here appears to execute the office of priest, as we shall by and by see.</p>
