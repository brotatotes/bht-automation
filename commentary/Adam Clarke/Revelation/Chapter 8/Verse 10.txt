<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:10">Revelation 8:10</span>. <i><b>There fell a great star from heaven</b></i> â€” This has given rise to various conjectures. Some say the star means <i>Attila</i> and his Huns, others, Genseric with his Vandals falling on the city of Rome; others, Eleazer, the son of Annus, spurning the emperor's victims, and exciting the fury of the Zealots; others, Arius; infecting the pure Christian doctrine with his heresy, c., &amp;c. It certainly cannot mean <i>all these</i> and probably <i>none</i> of them. Let the reader judge.</p>
