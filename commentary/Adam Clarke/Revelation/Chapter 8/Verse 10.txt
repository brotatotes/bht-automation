Verse Revelation 8:10. There fell a great star from heaven â€” This has given rise to various conjectures. Some say the star means Attila and his Huns, others, Genseric with his Vandals falling on the city of Rome; others, Eleazer, the son of Annus, spurning the emperor's victims, and exciting the fury of the Zealots; others, Arius; infecting the pure Christian doctrine with his heresy, c., &c. It certainly cannot mean all these and probably none of them. Let the reader judge.
