<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>. <i><b>I - heard an angel flying</b></i> — Instead of αγγελου πετωμενου, <i>an angel flying</i>, almost every MS. and version of note has αετου πετωμενον, <i>an eagle flying</i>. The <i>eagle</i> was the symbol of the Romans, and was always on their ensigns. The <i>three woes</i> which are here expressed were probably to be executed by this people, and upon the Jews and their commonwealth. Taken in this sense the symbols appear consistent and appropriate; and the reading <i>eagle</i> instead of <i>angel</i> is undoubtedly genuine, and Griesbach has received it into the text.</p>
