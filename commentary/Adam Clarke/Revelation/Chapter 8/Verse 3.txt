<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span>. <i><b>Another angel</b></i> — About to perform the office of <i>priest</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Having a golden censer</b></i> — This was a preparation peculiar to the <i>day of expiation</i>. "On other days it was the custom of the priest to <i>take fire</i> from the <i>great altar</i> in a <i>silver censer</i>, but on the <i>day of expiation</i> the high priest took the fire from the <i>great</i> <i>altar</i> in a <i>golden censer</i>; and when he was come down from the great altar, he took incense from one of the priests, who brought it to him, and went with it to the <i>golden altar</i>; and while he offered the incense the people prayed without in silence, which is the <i>silence in heaven for half an hour</i>." See Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
<p><i><b>Much incense, that he should offer</b></i><b> it</b>] Judgments of God are now about to be executed; the <i>saints</i>-the genuine Christians, <i>pray</i> much to God for protection. The angelic priest comes with <i>much incense</i>, standing between the living and those consigned to death, and offers his incense to God <i>WITH the prayers of the saints</i>.</p>
