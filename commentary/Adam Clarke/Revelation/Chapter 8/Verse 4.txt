Verse Revelation 8:4. The smoke of the incense - with the prayers â€” Though incense itself be an emblem of the prayers of the saints, Psalms 141:2; yet here they are said to ascend before God, as well as the incense. It is not said that the angel presents these prayers. He presents the incense, and the prayers ascend WITH it. The ascending of the incense shows that the prayers and offering were accepted.
