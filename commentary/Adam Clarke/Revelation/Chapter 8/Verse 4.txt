<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:4">Revelation 8:4</span>. <i><b>The smoke of the incense - with the prayers</b></i> â€” Though incense itself be an emblem of the prayers of the saints, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+141:2">Psalms 141:2</span>; yet here <i>they</i> are said to <i>ascend before God</i>, as well as the <i>incense</i>. It is not said that the angel presents these prayers. He presents the incense, and the <i>prayers ascend WITH it</i>. The <i>ascending</i> of the <i>incense</i> shows that the prayers and offering were accepted.</p>
