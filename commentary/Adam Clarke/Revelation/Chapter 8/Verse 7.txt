<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:7">Revelation 8:7</span>. <i><b>Hail and fire mingled with blood</b></i> — This was something like the <i>ninth</i> plague of Egypt. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:18-24">Exodus 9:18-24</span>: "The Lord sent thunder and hail-and fire mingled with the hail-and the fire ran along upon the ground." In the <i>hail</i> and <i>fire mingled with blood</i>, some fruitful imaginations might find <i>gunpowder</i> and <i>cannon balls</i>, and <i>canister shot</i> and <i>bombs</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>They were cast upon the earth</b></i> — εις την γην <i>Into that land</i>; viz., <i>Judea</i>, thus often designated.</p>
<p><i><b>And the third part of trees</b></i> — Before this clause the <i>Codex</i> <i>Alexandrinus</i>, thirty-five others, the <i>Syriac, Arabic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Slavonic, Vulgate, Andreas, Arethas</i>, and some others, have και το τριτον της γης κατεκαη· <i>And the third part of the land</i> <i>was burnt up</i>. This reading, which is undoubtedly genuine, is found also in the <i>Complutensian</i> Polyglot. Griesbach has received it into the text.</p>
<p>The <i>land</i> was wasted; the <i>trees</i>-the chiefs of the nation, were destroyed; and the <i>grass</i>-the <i>common people</i>, slain, or carried into captivity. High and low, rich and poor, were overwhelmed with one general destruction. This seems to be the meaning of these figures.</p>
<p>Many eminent men suppose that the irruption of the barbarous nations on the Roman empire is here intended. It is easy to find coincidences when fancy runs riot. Later writers might find here the irruption of the <i>Austrians</i> and <i>British</i>, and <i>Prussians,</i> <i>Russians</i>, and <i>Cossacks</i>, on the French empire!</p>
