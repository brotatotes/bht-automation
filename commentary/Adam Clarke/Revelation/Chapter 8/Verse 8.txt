<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+8:8">Revelation 8:8</span>. <i><b>A great mountain burning with fire</b></i> — Supposed to signify the powerful nations which invaded the Roman empire. <i>Mountain</i>, in prophetic language, signifies a <i>kingdom</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:25">Jeremiah 51:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:27">Jeremiah 51:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:30">Jeremiah 51:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:58">Jeremiah 51:58</span>.
