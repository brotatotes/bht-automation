<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:16">Revelation 9:16</span>. <i><b>Two hundred thousand thousand</b></i> — Δυο μυριαδες μυριαδων· <i>Two myriads of myriads</i>; that is, <i>two hundred millions</i>; an army that was never yet got together from the foundation of the world, and could not find <i>forage</i> in any part of the earth. Perhaps it only means <i>vast numbers, multitudes without number</i>. Such a number might be literally true of the <i>locusts</i>. Those who will have their particular system supported by the images in this most obscure book, tell us that the number here means all the soldiers that were employed in this war, from its commencement to its end! Those who can receive this saying let them receive it.</p>
