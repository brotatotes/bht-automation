<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:17">Revelation 9:17</span>. <i><b>Breastplates of fire-jacinth, and brimstone</b></i> — That is, <i>red, blue</i>, and <i>yellow</i>; the first is the colour of <i>fire</i>, the second of <i>jacinth</i>, and the third of <i>sulphur</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And the heads of the horses</b></i> — Is this an allegorical description of great <i>ordnance</i>? Cannons, on the mouths of which horses' heads were formed, or the mouth of the cannon cast in that form? <i>Fire,</i> <i>smoke</i>, and <i>brimstone</i>, is a good allegorical representation of <i>gunpowder</i>. The Ottomans made great use of heavy artillery in their wars with the Greeks of the lower empire.</p>
