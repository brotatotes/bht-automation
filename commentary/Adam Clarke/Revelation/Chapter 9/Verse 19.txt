<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:19">Revelation 9:19</span>. <i><b>Their power is in their mouth</b></i> — From these the destructive <i>balls</i> are projected; <i>and in their tails</i>, the <i>breech</i> where the <i>charge</i> of <i>gunpowder</i> is lodged.</p>
<p><i><b>Their tails</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>like unto serpents, and had heads</b></i> — If cannons are intended, the description, though allegorical, is plain enough; for <i>brass ordnance</i> especially are frequently thus ornamented, both at their <i>muzzles</i> and at their <i>breech</i>.</p>
