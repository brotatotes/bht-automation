<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:3">Revelation 9:3</span>. <i><b>Locusts</b></i> — Vast hordes of military troops: the description which follows certainly agrees better with the <i>Saracens</i> than with any other people or nation, but may also apply to the Romans.</p>
<p><i><b>As the scorpions of the earth have power.</b></i> — Namely, to hurt men by <i>stinging</i> them. Scorpions may signify <i>archers</i>; and hence the description has been applied to <i>Cestius Gallus</i>, the Roman general, who had many <i>archers</i> in his army.</p>
