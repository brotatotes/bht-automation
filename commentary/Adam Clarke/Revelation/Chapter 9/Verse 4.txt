<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:4">Revelation 9:4</span>. <i><b>They should not hurt the grass</b></i> — Neither the common people, the men of middling condition, nor the nobles. However, this appears rather to refer to the prudent counsels of a military chief, not to destroy the <i>crops</i> and <i>herbage</i> of which they might have need in their campaigns.</p>
<p><i><b>Which have not the seal of God</b></i> — All false, hypocritical, and heterodox Christians.</p>
