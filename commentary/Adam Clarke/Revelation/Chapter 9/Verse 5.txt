<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:5">Revelation 9:5</span>. <i><b>To them it was given</b></i> — That is, they were <i>permitted</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That they should be tormented five months</b></i> — Some take these months <i>literally</i>, and apply them to the conduct of the Zealots who, from <i>May</i> to <i>September</i>, in the year of the siege, produced dreadful contests among the people; or to the afflictions brought upon the Jews by <i>Cestius Gallus</i>, when he came against Jerusalem, before which he lay one whole summer, or nearly five months.-See <i>Joseph</i>., Bell.

"The scorpion is a poisoned arrow shot from a bow or other instrument, which, when it wounds a man, deposits the poison with which it is covered in the wound; whence it has the name of scorpion." <i>Seneca</i>, in his <i>Hercules OEtaeus</i>, act iv., ver. 1218, describes the torment which is occasioned by this species of poisoned arrow: - </p>
