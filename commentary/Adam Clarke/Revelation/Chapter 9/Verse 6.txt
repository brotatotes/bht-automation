<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:6">Revelation 9:6</span>. <i><b>In those days shall men seek death</b></i> â€” So distressing shall be their sufferings and torment that they shall long for death in <i>any form</i>, to be rescued from the evils of life. There is a sentiment much like this in <i>Maximianus</i>, Eleg. i., ver. 111, commonly attributed to <i>Cornelius Gallus</i>:- </p>
<p>Why is light given to the miserable,</p>
<p>And life to the bitter of soul?</p>
<p>Who wait for death, but it is not;</p>
<p>And dig for it more than hid treasures.</p>
<p>They rejoice for it, and are glad,</p>
<p>And exult when they find the grave.</p>
