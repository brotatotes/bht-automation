Verse Revelation 9:6. In those days shall men seek death â€” So distressing shall be their sufferings and torment that they shall long for death in any form, to be rescued from the evils of life. There is a sentiment much like this in Maximianus, Eleg. i., ver. 111, commonly attributed to Cornelius Gallus:- Why is light given to the miserable,And life to the bitter of soul?Who wait for death, but it is not;And dig for it more than hid treasures.They rejoice for it, and are glad,And exult when they find the grave.Job 3:20-22.
