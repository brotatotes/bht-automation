<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:7">Revelation 9:7</span>. <i><b>The locusts were like unto horses</b></i> — This description of the locusts appears to be taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:4">Joel 2:4</span>. The whole of this symbolical description of an overwhelming military force agrees very well with the troops of Mohammed. The Arabs are the most expert horsemen in the world: they live so much on horseback that the horse and his rider seem to make but one animal. The <i>Romans</i> also were eminent for their cavalry.</p>
<p><i><b>Crowns like gold</b></i> — Not only alluding to their costly <i>tiaras</i> or <i>turbans</i>, but to the extent of their conquests and the multitude of powers which they subdued.</p>
<p><i><b>Their faces</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>as the faces of men</b></i><i>.</i>] That is, though locusts symbolically, they are really men.</p>
