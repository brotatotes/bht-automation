Verse Revelation 9:9. They had breastplates-of iron — They seemed to be invulnerable, for no force availed against them.The sound of their wings — Their hanging weapons and military trappings, with the clang of their shields and swords when they make their fierce onsets. This simile is borrowed from Joel 2:5-7.
