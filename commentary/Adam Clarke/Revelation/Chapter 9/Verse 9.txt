<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+9:9">Revelation 9:9</span>. <i><b>They had breastplates-of iron</b></i> — They seemed to be invulnerable, for no force availed against them.</p>
<p><i><b>The sound of their wings</b></i> — Their hanging weapons and military trappings, with the clang of their shields and swords when they make their fierce onsets. This simile is borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:5-7">Joel 2:5-7</span>.</p>
