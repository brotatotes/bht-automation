<p>DIFFERENT interpreters have divided this epistle into certain parts or divisions, by which they suppose its subject and matter may be the better understood. Some of these divisions have been mentioned in the preceding <i>preface</i>.</p>
<p>The epistle contains <i>three</i> grand divisions.</p>
<p>I. The PREFACE, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1-17">Romans 1:1-17</span>.</p>
<p>II. The TRACTATION, or setting forth of the main subject, including two sections:</p>
<p>1. <i>Dogmatic</i>, or what relates to doctrine.</p>
<p>2. <i>Paraenetic</i>, or what relates to the necessity and importance of the <i>virtues</i> and <i>duties</i> of the Christian life.</p>
<p>The <i>dogmatic</i> part is included in the first <i>eleven chapters</i>, the grand object of which is to show that eternal salvation cannot be procured by any <i>observance</i> of the Jewish law, and can be hoped for <i>only</i> on the <i>Christian scheme</i>; for <i>by the works of the law no man can be</i> <i>justified</i>; but <i>what the law could not do, in that it was weak</i> <i>through the flesh</i>, God has accomplished by <i>sending his Son</i> into the world, who, becoming an <i>offering for sin, condemned sin in the</i> <i>flesh</i>. The <i>paraenetic</i> part commences with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>: <i>I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye</i> <i>present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,</i> <i>which is your reasonable service</i>, c. and extends to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:14">Romans 15:14</span>.</p>
<p>III. The <i>peroration</i> or <i>epilogue</i>, which contains the author's apology for writing; his commendation of his apostolical office; his promise to visit them; his request of an interest in their prayers; his commendations of certain persons, and his salutations to others. These points are contained in the succeeding parts of the epistle, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:14">Romans 15:14</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:24">Romans 16:24</span>. The 25th, 26th, and 27th verses <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25-27">Romans 16:25-27</span> of this chapter evidently belong to another part of the epistle, and should come in, as they do in a vast majority of the best MSS., after <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>.</p>
<p>For every thing necessary to a <i>general knowledge</i> of the epistle itself, see the preceding <i>preface</i>.</p>
<p>The inscriptions to this epistle are various in the different MSS. and versions. The following are the principal: - <i>To the</i> <i>Romans - The Epistle of Paul to the Romans - The Epistle of Paul the</i> <i>Apostle to the Romans - The Epistle of the Holy Apostle Paul to the</i> <i>Romans</i>. The word αγιος, <i>holy</i>, we have translated <i>saint</i>; and thus, instead of saying the <i>holy Paul</i>, c., we say <i>Saint Paul</i>, c. and this is now brought into general use. The older the MSS. are, the more simple the appellatives given to <i>apostles</i> and <i>apostolic men</i>.</p>
<p>NOTES ON CHAP. I.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>. <i><b>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ</b></i> — The word δουλος, which we translate <i>servant</i>, properly means a <i>slave</i>, one who is the <i>entire property</i> of his master and is used here by the apostle with great propriety. He felt he was not <i>his own</i>, and that his <i>life</i> and <i>powers belonged</i> to his heavenly <i>owner</i>, and that he had no right to dispose of or employ them but in the strictest subserviency to the will of his Lord. In this sense, and in this spirit, he is the <i>willing slave</i> of Jesus Christ; and this is, perhaps, the highest character which any soul of man can attain on this side eternity. "I am wholly the Lord's; and wholly devoted in the spirit of sacrificial obedience, to the constant, complete, and energetic performance of the Divine will." A <i>friend</i> of God is high; a <i>son</i> of God is higher; but the <i>servant</i>, or, in the above sense, the <i>slave</i> of God, is higher than all; - in a word, he is a person who feels he has no property in himself, and that God is all and in all.</p>
<p><i><b>Called to be an apostle</b></i> — The word αποστολος, <i>apostle</i>, from αποστελλειν, <i>to send</i>, signifies simply a <i>messenger</i> or <i>envoy</i>; one sent on a confidential errand: but here it means an <i>extraordinary messenger</i>; one sent by God himself to deliver the most important message on behalf of his Maker; - in a word, one sent by the <i>Divine authority</i> to preach the Gospel to the nations. The word κλητος, <i>called</i>, signifies here the same as <i>constituted</i>, and should be joined with αποστολος, as it is in the Greek, and translated thus: <i>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, constituted an</i> <i>apostle</i>, c. This sense the word <i>called</i> has in many places of the sacred writings e. g. <i>Behold what manner of love the Father hath</i> <i>bestowed on us, that we should be called</i>, κληθωμεν, CONSTITUTED, or <i>made the sons of God</i>. As it is likely that no apostle had been employed in founding the Church of Rome, and there was need of much <i>authority</i> to settle the matters that were there in dispute, it was necessary he should show them that he derived his authority from <i>God</i>, and was immediately delegated by him to <i>preach</i> and <i>write</i> as he was now doing.</p>
<p><i><b>Separated unto the Gospel</b></i> — Set apart and appointed to this work, and to this only; as the Israelites were <i>separate</i> from all the people of the earth, to be the servants of God: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+20:26">Leviticus 20:26</span>. St. Paul may here refer to his former state as a <i>Pharisee</i>, which literally signifies a <i>separatist</i>, or one <i>separated. Before</i> he was separated unto the service of his own <i>sect; now</i> he is separated unto the Gospel of God. On the word GOSPEL, and its meaning, see the preface to the notes on St. Matthew; and for the meaning of the word <i>Pharisee</i>, see the same Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>.</p>
