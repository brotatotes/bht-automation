<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11">Romans 1:11</span>. <i><b>Some spiritual gift</b></i> â€” This probably means some of the <i>extraordinary gifts</i> of the Holy Spirit, which, being given to them, might tend greatly to establish their faith in the Gospel of Christ; and it is very likely that such gifts were only conferred by means of <i>apostles</i>; and as the <i>apostle</i> had not yet been at Rome, consequently the Roman Christians had not yet received any of these miraculous gifts, and thus they differed widely from all the other Churches which had been raised by the apostle's ministry.</p>
