<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:12">Romans 1:12</span>. <i><b>That I may be comforted together with you</b></i> â€” He here, with great address, intimates that he longs for this opportunity, as well on his <i>own account</i> as on <i>theirs</i>, and to show them that he arrogates nothing to himself; for he intimates that it will require the conjoint action of <i>their faith</i> as well as <i>his own</i>, to be the means of receiving those blessings from God to which he refers.</p>
