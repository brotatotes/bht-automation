<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:14">Romans 1:14</span>. <i><b>I am a debtor both to the Greeks, and to the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>barbarians</b></i> â€” It has been remarked before that all the nations of the earth, themselves excepted, were termed <i>barbarians</i> by the <i>Greeks</i>. See the origin of the word <i>barbarous</i> in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:2">Acts 28:2</span>. The apostle considers himself, by his apostolical office and call, under obligation to preach the Gospel to <i>all</i> <i>people</i>, as far as the providence of God might open his way; for this is implied in the Divine commission:-<i>Go ye into all the</i> <i>world, and preach the Gospel to every creature-to the wise and the</i> <i>unwise</i>; to the <i>learned</i> and <i>cultivated</i> as well as to the <i>unlearned</i> and <i>uncultivated</i>. This evidently appears to be the import of the terms.</p>
