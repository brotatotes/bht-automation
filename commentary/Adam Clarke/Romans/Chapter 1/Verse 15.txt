<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:15">Romans 1:15</span>. <i><b>I am ready to preach</b></i> — προθυμον; I have a <i>ready</i> mind. I was only prevented by the providence of God from visiting you long <i>ago</i>. His time is best: in the mean time I write, by his direction, to comfort and instruct you.</p>
