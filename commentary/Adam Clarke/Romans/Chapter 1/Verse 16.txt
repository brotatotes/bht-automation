<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>. <i><b>I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ</b></i> — This text is best illustrated by <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:23">Isaiah 49:23</span>, quoted by the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:11">Romans 10:11</span>: For the Scripture saith, <i>Whosoever believeth on him, shall not be</i> <i>ashamed</i>; i.e. they shall neither be <i>confounded</i>, nor <i>disappointed</i> of their hope. The <i>Jews</i>, by not believing on Jesus Christ, by not receiving him as the promised Messiah, but trusting in others, have been <i>disappointed, ashamed</i>, and <i>confounded</i>, from that time to the present day. Their expectation is cut off; and, while rejecting Christ, and expecting <i>another</i> Messiah, they have continued under the displeasure of God, and are <i>ashamed</i> of their confidence. On the other hand, those who have believed on Christ have, in and through him, all the blessings of which the prophets spoke; every promise of God being <i>yea</i> and <i>amen</i> through him. Paul, as a Jew, believed on Christ Jesus; and in believing he had life through his name; through him he enjoyed an abundance of grace; so that, being filled with that happiness which an indwelling Christ produces, he could cheerfully say, <i>I am not ashamed of the Gospel</i> <i>of Christ</i>. And why? Because he felt it to be <i>the power of God to</i> <i>the salvation</i> of his believing soul. This appears to be the true sense of this passage, and this interpretation acquires additional strength from the consideration that St. Paul is here most evidently addressing himself to the <i>Jews</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>It is the power of God unto salvation</b></i> — δυναμις γαρ θεου εστιν: The <i>almighty power</i> of God accompanies this preaching to the souls of them that believe; and the consequence is, they are <i>saved</i>; and what but the <i>power of God</i> can save a <i>fallen, sinful</i> soul?</p>
<p><i><b>To the Jew first</b></i> — Not only the Jews have the <i>first</i> offer of this Gospel, but they have the <i>greatest</i> need of it; being so <i>deeply fallen</i>, and having sinned against such <i>glorious privileges</i>, they are much more culpable than the Gentiles, who never had the light of a Divine revelation.</p>
<p><i><b>And also to the Greek</b></i> — Though the salvation of God has hitherto been apparently <i>confined</i> to the Jewish people, yet it shall be so no longer, for the Gospel of Christ is sent to the <i>Gentiles</i> as well as the <i>Jews</i>; God having put no difference between them; and Jesus Christ having <i>tasted death for</i> EVERY <i>man</i>.</p>
