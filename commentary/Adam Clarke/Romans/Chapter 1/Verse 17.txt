<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For therein</b></i> — In the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Is the righteousness of God</b></i> — God's method of saving sinners.</p>
<p><i><b>Revealed from faith to faith</b></i> — Shown to be by <i>faith</i>, and not by the works of <i>any</i> law; for Abraham, the father and founder of the Jewish people, was <i>justified by faith</i>, before even the law was given; and by believing, in reference to the spiritual object held forth in the various ordinances of the law, and now revealed under the Gospel, he and all his believing descendants have been justified. And thus the faith of the old covenant led on to the faith of the new covenant, which shows that salvation has been <i>by</i> <i>faith</i> from the call of Abraham to the present time. And, from the beginning, all that were <i>just</i> or <i>righteous</i> in the earth became such by <i>faith</i>, and by this principle alone they were enabled to persevere; as it is written, <i>The just shall live by faith</i>. That δικαιοσυνη, which we translate <i>righteousness</i> in this verse, signifies <i>God's method of saving mankind by faith in Christ</i>, is fully evident from the use of the term in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span>: <i>The Gentiles which followed not after</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS - who had no knowledge by revelation, of <i>God's method of justifying</i> and saving sinners, <i>have attained to</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS - have had imparted to them God's method of salvation by faith in Christ. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:31">Romans 9:31</span>: <i>But Israel</i>, the Jews, <i>which followed after the law of</i> <i>righteousness</i> - that law, the <i>end</i> or object of which is CHRIST, and through him <i>justification</i> to all that believe (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:4">Romans 10:4</span>,) <i>have not attained to the law of righteousness</i> - have not found out the genuine plan of salvation, even in that law which so strongly and generally proclaims justification by faith. And why have they not found it? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:32">Romans 9:32</span>: <i>Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works</i> <i>of the law</i> - they did not discern that even its works or prescribed religious observances were intended to lead to faith in that glorious Mediator of whom they were the <i>types</i> and <i>representatives</i>; but the Jews trusted in the observances themselves, hoping to acquire justification and final salvation by that means. <i>For</i> <i>they stumbled at the stumbling-stone</i> - at the doctrine of <i>Christ</i> <i>crucified</i> as the only sure ground on which the expectation of future salvation can be founded. Therefore, <i>being ignorant of</i> <i>God's righteousness</i> - God's method of saving sinners, <i>and going</i> <i>about to establish their own righteousness</i> - their own method of salvation, by the observance of those rites and ceremonies which should have led them by faith to Christ, <i>they did not submit</i> <i>themselves to the righteousness of God</i> - they would not submit to be saved in God's way, and therefore rejected, persecuted, and crucified the Lord Jesus; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:3">Romans 10:3</span>. This collation of passages most evidently shows that the word <i>righteousness</i> here means simply <i>God's method of saving sinners</i>, or God's way of salvation, in opposition to the ways and means invented by the fancies or prejudices of men.</p>
<p>There are few words in the sacred writings which are taken in a greater variety of acceptations than the word צדקה <i>tsedakah</i> in Hebrew, and δικαιοσυνη in Greek, both of which we generally translate <i>righteousness</i>. Our English word was originally <i>rightwiseness</i>, from the Anglo-Saxon, [Anglo-Saxon], <i>justice,</i> <i>right</i>, and [Anglo-Saxon], <i>to know</i>; and thus the <i>righteous</i> man was a person who was allowed to <i>understand</i> the claims of <i>justice</i> and <i>right</i>, and who, knowing them, acted according to their dictates. Such a man is <i>thoroughly wise</i>; he aims at the attainment of the <i>best end</i> by the use of the <i>best means</i>. This is a true definition of <i>wisdom</i>, and the righteous man is he that <i>knows</i> most and acts <i>best</i>. The Hebrew צדק <i>tsadak</i>, in its ideal meaning, contains the notion of a <i>beam</i> or <i>scales</i> in <i>equipoise</i>, what we call <i>even</i> <i>balance</i>; and it is well known that in all the personifications of Justice, both ancient and modern, she is represented as a beautiful female with a bandage on her eyes, and a beam and scales in her hand, so perfectly poised that neither end preponderates.</p>
<p>The Greek word δικαιοσυνη has been derived from διχαζω, to <i>divide</i>; and hence δικη, <i>justice</i>, because it is the property of this virtue to <i>divide</i> to each his <i>due</i>. With other etymologies it is useless to trouble the reader. Both the noun δικαιοσυνη and the verb δικαιοω have a great variety of meaning in the New Testament; but they are all reducible to this original idea, <i>acting</i> according to the requisitions of <i>justice</i> or <i>right</i>. It may not be improper to notice some of the chief of these acceptations in this place.</p>
<p>1. The act of <i>distributing</i> to each man his <i>due</i> is the sense of the word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>: <i>He will judge the world in</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS, i.e. according to the principles of eternal justice and rectitude. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:2">Revelation 19:2</span>: <i>In</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS <i>doth he judge and make war</i>.</p>
<p>2. It signifies a <i>holy life</i>, as proceeding from <i>piety</i> towards God. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:75">Luke 1:75</span>: <i>Might serve him in holiness and</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS <i>all the days of our</i> <i>life</i>.</p>
<p>3. It signifies <i>benignity, liberality</i>, and particularly <i>almsgiving</i>, as justice and righteousness require us, being only <i>stewards</i> of God's bounty, to share it with the necessitous. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>: <i>Take heed that ye do not your</i> ALMS, δικαιοσυνην, <i>your</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS, <i>before men</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>: <i>But if our unrighteousness commend the</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS, <i>the</i> <i>benignity of God</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>: <i>Increase the fruits of your</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS, i.e. of your <i>liberality</i>.</p>
<p>4. It signifies God's <i>method of saving sinners</i>; the way which is agreeable to his <i>righteousness</i> and <i>liberality</i>. See the former part of this note, and the scriptures there referred to.</p>
<p>5. It signifies the <i>reward</i> or <i>issue</i> of <i>liberality</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:9">2 Corinthians 9:9</span>: <i>He hath scattered abroad; he hath given to the poor; his</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS - the reward of his bounty, <i>remaineth for ever</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalms 112:9</span>.</p>
<p>6. It signifies the whole collection of <i>graces</i>, which constitute the complete Christian character. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6">Matthew 5:6</span>: <i>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS - they who ardently long for the <i>full salvation</i> of God. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span> : <i>If your</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS <i>exceed not the righteousness</i>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:33">Matthew 6:33</span>: <i>Seek the kingdom of God and his</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS.</p>
<p>7. It signifies the <i>result</i> of <i>faith</i> in God and <i>submission to</i> <i>his will</i>, exemplified in a holy and useful life. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>: <i>By faith Noah prepared an ark, and became heir of the</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS <i>which is by faith</i> - he escaped the deluge and became the instrument of repeopling the world.</p>
<p>8. It signifies an <i>exact observance</i> of <i>religious ordinances</i> and <i>precepts</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:6">Philippians 3:6</span>: <i>Touching the</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS <i>which is of the law, blameless</i> - having lived in an exact conformity to all the Mosaic precepts. In this sense it is to be understood, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:15">Matthew 3:15</span>: <i>Thus it becomes us to fulfil all</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS - to observe every precept of the law.</p>
<p>9. It signifies the <i>favour</i> or <i>pardoning mercy</i> of God. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:6">Romans 4:6</span>: <i>The blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS - - <i>without works</i> - the man is happy to whom God has granted the remission of sins, without respect to his observance of the law of Moses. </p>
<p>10. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>, δικαιοσυνη, <i>righteousness</i>, is put for δικαιος, <i>righteous</i>: <i>That we might become the righteousness of God</i> - that we might receive such a righteousness or holiness, such a salvation, as is worthy of God's grace to impart, and such as the necessities of mankind require.</p>
<p>A few of the leading acceptations of the verb δικαιοω, which we translate to <i>justify</i>, may be here properly subjoined, as this verb is so repeatedly used in this epistle.</p>
<p>1. It signifies so <i>declare</i> or <i>pronounce</i> one <i>just</i> or <i>righteous</i> or, in other words, to declare him to be <i>what he really</i> is. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>: <i>He was</i> JUSTIFIED <i>in the Spirit</i>. - By the almighty power of the Spirit he was <i>proved</i> to be the TRUE MESSIAH.</p>
<p>2. To <i>esteem</i> a thing <i>properly</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>: <i>Wisdom is</i> JUSTIFIED <i>of her children</i>. - Wisdom, propriety of conduct, is properly <i>estimated</i> by wise men.</p>
<p>3. It signifies to <i>approve, praise</i>, and <i>commend</i>. <i>The publicans</i> JUSTIFIED <i>God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:29">Luke 7:29</span>; praised him for calling them to such a state of salvation. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15">Luke 16:15</span>: <i>Ye are they which</i> JUSTIFY <i>yourselves before men </i>- Ye are self-commended, self-applauded, and self-praised. In this sense it is often used in the Greek apocryphal books. Ecclus. vii. 5: JUSTlFY <i>not thyself before the Lord</i> - Do not applaud thyself in the presence of thy - Maker. Ib. x. 29: <i>Who will</i> JUSTIFY (<i>praise</i> or <i>applaud</i>) <i>him that sinneth against his own soul</i>. Ib. xviii. 2: <i>The Lord only is righteous</i>, δικαιωθησεται, <i>shall be</i> JUSTIFIED, i.e. <i>praised</i>, because <i>there is none other but he</i>.</p>
<p>4. The verb δικαιοομαι is used <i>to clear from all sin</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4">1 Corinthians 4:4</span>: <i>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby</i> JUSTIFIED - A man's own consciousness of <i>integrity</i> is not a proof that he is clear from all sin in the sight of God.</p>
<p>5. A judge is said to <i>justify</i> not only when he <i>condemns</i> and <i>punishes</i>, but also when he <i>defends</i> the cause of the innocent. See EURIP. <i>Heraclid</i>. ver. 190. THUCYD. iii. p. 200. POLYB. iii. 31, and SCHLEUSNER on δικαιοω. Hence δικαιουσθαι is taken in a <i>forensic</i> sense, and signifies to be <i>found</i> or <i>declared righteous</i>, <i>innocent</i>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:37">Matthew 12:37</span>: <i>By thy words shalt thou be</i> JUSTIFIED - thou shalt be <i>declared</i> to be righteous. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>: <i>That thou mightest be</i> JUSTIFIED <i>in thy saying</i> - that thou mightest be <i>proved</i> to be <i>true</i> in what thou hast said.</p>
<p>6. It signifies to <i>set free</i>, to <i>escape from</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:39">Acts 13:39</span>: <i>And by him all that believe are</i> JUSTIFIED <i>from all things, from</i> <i>which ye could not be</i> JUSTIFIED <i>by the law</i> - by faith in Christ a man <i>escapes</i> those evils which, otherwise, the law of Moses would <i>inflict</i> upon him. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:7">Romans 6:7</span>: <i>For he that is dead</i>, δεδικαιωται, <i>is</i> JUSTIFIED, properly rendered by our translators, <i>is</i> FREED <i>from sin</i>.</p>
<p>7. It signifies also to <i>receive one into favour, to pardon sin</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>: <i>Whom he called, them he also</i> JUSTIFIED - he received them into <i>favour</i> and <i>pardoned</i> their sins. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:14">Luke 18:14</span>: <i>This man went down to his house</i> JUSTIFIED - he humbled himself, repented of his iniquity, and God <i>forgave his sin</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>: <i>By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be</i> JUSTIFIED - no soul can have his sins forgiven through the observance of the Mosaic law. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:2">Romans 4:2</span>: <i>If Abraham were</i> JUSTIFIED (had his <i>sin pardoned</i>) <i>by works</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>: <i>Such were some of you, but ye are</i> JUSTIFIED - ye are received into the Divine <i>favour</i>, and have your <i>sins forgiven</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:21-25">James 2:21-25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:9">Romans 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:17">Galatians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:7">Titus 3:7</span>. In all these texts the word <i>justify</i> is taken in the sense of <i>remission of sins</i> through faith in Christ Jesus; and does not mean <i>making</i> the person <i>just</i> or <i>righteous</i>, but treating him as if he were so, having already <i>forgiven</i> him his sins.</p>
<p><i><b>The just shall live by faith.</b></i> — This has been understood <i>two</i> ways:</p>
<p>1. That the just or righteous man cannot live a holy and useful life without exercising continual faith in our Lord Jesus: which is strictly true; for He only who has brought him into that state of salvation can <i>preserve</i> him in it; and he stands by faith.</p>
<p>2. It is contended by some able critics that the words of the original text should be pointed thus: 'ο δε δικαιος εκ πιστεως, ζησεται. <i>The just by faith, shall live</i>; that is, he alone that is justified by faith shall be <i>saved</i>: which is also true; as it is impossible to get salvation in any other way. This last meaning is probably the true one, as the original text in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span>, speaks of those who <i>believed</i> the declarations of God when the Chaldeans besieged Jerusalem, and, having acted conformably to them, escaped with their <i>lives</i>.</p>
