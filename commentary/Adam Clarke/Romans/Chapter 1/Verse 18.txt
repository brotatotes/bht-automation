<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For the wrath of God is revealed</b></i> — The apostle has now finished his <i>preface</i>, and comes to the grand <i>subject</i> of the epistle; namely, to show the <i>absolute need</i> of the Gospel of Christ, because of the <i>universal corruption</i> of mankind; which was so great as to incense the justice of God, and call aloud for the <i>punishment</i> of the world.</p>
<p>1. He shows that all the heathen nations were utterly corrupt, and deserved this threatened punishment. And this is the subject of the first chapter, from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span> to the end. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18-32">Romans 1:18-32</span></p>
<p>2. He shows that the <i>Jews</i>, notwithstanding the greatness of their privileges, were no better than the <i>Gentiles</i>; and therefore the wrath of God was revealed against <i>them</i> also. This subject he treats in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1-29">Romans 2:1-29</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1-19">Romans 3:1-19</span>.</p>
<p>3. He returns, as it were, on both, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20-31">Romans 3:20-31</span>, and proves that, as the Jews and Gentiles were equally corrupt, they could not be saved by the deeds of any law; that they stood equally in <i>need</i> of that salvation which God had provided; that both were equally entitled to that salvation, for God was the God of the <i>Gentiles</i> as well as of the <i>Jews</i>.</p>
<p>By οργη θεου, <i>the wrath of God</i>, we are not to understand any <i>uneasy passion</i> in the Divine Being; but the <i>displeasure</i> of his righteousness, which is expressed by the punishments inflicted on the <i>ungodly</i>, those who retain not God in their knowledge; and the <i>unrighteous</i>, those whose lives are profligate.</p>
<p>As, in the Gospel, the <i>righteousness</i> of God is <i>revealed</i> for the <i>salvation of the ungodly</i>, so is the <i>wrath</i> of God <i>revealed</i> against the <i>workers of iniquity</i>. Those who refuse to be saved in the way revealed by his <i>mercy</i> must be consumed in the way revealed by his <i>justice</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ungodliness</b></i> — ασεβειαν,, from α, <i>negative</i>, and σεβω or σεβομαι, <i>I worship</i>, probably intended here to express <i>atheism,</i> <i>polytheism</i>, and <i>idolatry</i> of every kind.</p>
<p><i><b>Unrighteousness</b></i> — αδικιαν from α, <i>negative</i>, and δικη, <i>justice</i>; every thing contrary to strict morality; all viciousness and profligacy of conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>Who hold the truth in unrighteousness</b></i> — In what sense could it be said that the heathen <i>held the truth</i> in unrighteousness, when they really had not that truth? Some think this refers to the conduct of their best philosophers, such as <i>Socrates, Plato,</i> <i>Seneca</i>, c., who knew much more of the Divine nature than they thought safe or prudent to discover and who acted in many things contrary to the light which they enjoyed. Others think this to be spoken of the <i>Gentiles</i> in general, who either <i>did know</i>, or <i>might</i> have known, much of God from the works of creation, as the apostle intimates in the following verses. But <i>Rosenmuller</i> and some others contend that the word κατεχειν here does not signify to <i>hold</i>, but to <i>hinder</i>; and that the place should be translated, <i>who through</i> <i>maliciousness hinder the truth</i>; i.e. prevent it from taking hold of their hearts, and from governing their conduct. This is certainly a very usual acceptation of the verb κατεχειν, which Hesychius interprets κρατειν, κωλυειν, συνεχειν, <i>to retain,</i> <i>hinder</i>, c. these men hindering, by their vicious conduct, the <i>truth</i> of God from being propagated in the earth.</p>
