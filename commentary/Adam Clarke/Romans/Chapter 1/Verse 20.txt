<p>Verse 20. <i><b>The invisible things of him</b></i> — His invisible perfections are manifested by his visible works, and may be apprehended by what he has made; their <i>immensity</i> showing his <i>omnipotence</i>, their vast <i>variety</i> and <i>contrivance</i>, his <i>omniscience</i>; and their <i>adaptation</i> to the most <i>beneficent</i> <i>purposes</i>, his infinite <i>goodness</i> and <i>philanthropy</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>His eternal power</b></i> — αιδιος αυτου δυναμις, That all-powerful energy that <i>ever was</i>, and <i>ever will exist</i>; so that, ever since there was a creation to be surveyed, there have been intelligent beings to make that survey.</p>
<p><i><b>And Godhead</b></i> — θειοτης, His <i>acting as God</i> in the government and support of the universe. His <i>works</i> prove his <i>being</i>; the <i>government</i> and <i>support</i> of these works prove it equally. <i>Creation</i> and <i>providence</i> form a <i>twofold</i> demonstration of God,</p>
<p>1st. in the <i>perfections</i> of his nature; and,</p>
<p>2dly. in the <i>exercise</i> of those perfections.</p>
