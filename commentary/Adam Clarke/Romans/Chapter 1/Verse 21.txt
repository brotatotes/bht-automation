<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Because that when they knew God</b></i> — When they thus acquired a general knowledge of the unity and perfections of the Divine nature, <i>they glorified him not as God</i> - they did not <i>proclaim</i> him to the people, but shut up his <i>glory</i> (as Bishop Warburton expresses it) in their <i>mysteries</i>, and gave the people, in exchange for an <i>incorruptible God, an image made like to corruptible man</i>. Wherefore God, in punishment for their sins, thus <i>turning his</i> <i>truth into a lie</i>, suffered even their <i>mysteries</i>, which they had erected for a school of virtue, to degenerate into an odious sink of vice and immorality; giving them up unto all uncleanness and vile affections.</p>
<p><i><b>They glorified him not</b></i> — They did not give him that <i>worship</i> which his perfections required.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither were thankful</b></i> — They manifested no <i>gratitude</i> for the blessings they received from his providence, but <i>became vain in</i> <i>their imaginations</i>, διαλογισμοις, <i>in their reasonings</i>. This certainly refers to the foolish manner in which even the wisest of their philosophers discoursed about the Divine nature, not excepting <i>Socrates, Plato</i>, or <i>Seneca</i>. Who can read their works without being struck with the vanity of their reasonings, as well as with the stupidity of their nonsense, when speaking about God? I might crowd my page with proofs of this; but it is not necessary to those who are acquainted with their writings, and to others it would not be useful. In short, their foolish, darkened minds sought God no where but in the place in which he is never to be found; viz. the vile, corrupted, and corrupting passions of their own hearts. As they did not discover him <i>there</i>, they scarcely sought him any where else.</p>
