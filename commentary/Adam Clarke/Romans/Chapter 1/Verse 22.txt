<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Professing themselves to be wise</b></i> — This is most strikingly true of all the ancient philosophers, whether Greeks or Romans, as their works, which remain, sufficiently testify. The word φασκοντες signifies not merely the <i>professing</i> but the <i>assumption</i> of the philosophic character. In this sense the word φασκειν is used by the best Greek writers. See <i>Kypke</i>. A dispassionate examination of the doctrine and lives of the most famed philosophers of antiquity, of every nation, will show that they were darkened in their mind and irregular in their conduct. It was from the Christian religion alone that true philosophy and genuine philosophers sprang.</p>
