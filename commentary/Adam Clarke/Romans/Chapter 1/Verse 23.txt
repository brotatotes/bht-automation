<p>Verse 23. <i><b>They changed the glory</b></i>, c.] The finest representation of their deities was in the <i>human</i> figure and on such representative figures the sculptors spent all their skill; hence the HERCULES of <i>Farnese</i>, the VENUS of <i>Medicis</i>, and the APOLLO of <i>Belvidere</i>. And when they had formed their gods according to the <i>human shape</i>, they endowed them with <i>human passions</i>; and as they clothed them with attributes of <i>extraordinary strength,</i> <i>beauty, wisdom</i>, c., not having the true principles of morality, they represented them as slaves to the most disorderly and disgraceful passions excelling in irregularities the most profligate of men, as possessing unlimited powers of sensual gratification.</p>
<p><i><b>And to birds</b></i> — As the <i>eagle</i> of Jupiter among the Romans, and the <i>ibis</i> and <i>hawk</i> among the Egyptians; which were all sacred animals.</p>
<p><i><b>Four-footed beasts</b></i> — As the <i>apis</i> or <i>white ox</i> among the Egyptians; from which the idolatrous Israelites took their <i>golden</i> <i>calf</i>. The <i>goat</i>, the <i>monkey</i>, and the <i>dog</i>, were also sacred animals among the same people.</p>
<p><i><b>Creeping things.</b></i> — Such as the <i>crocodile</i> and <i>scarabeus</i>, or <i>beetle</i>, among the Egyptians.</p>
