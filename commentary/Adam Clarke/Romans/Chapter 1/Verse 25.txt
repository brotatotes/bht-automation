<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Changed the truth of God into a lie</b></i> â€” In the place of the <i>true worship</i> of God, they established <i>idolatry</i>. In various places of Scripture <i>idols</i> are termed <i>lies</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:20">Isaiah 44:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+10:14">Jeremiah 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:25">Jeremiah 13:25</span>. The true God <i>was</i> known among the primitive inhabitants of the earth, those who first became <i>idolaters</i> literally changed the truth of God into a lie: they <i>did know</i> the true God, but they put <i>idols</i> in his place.</p>
