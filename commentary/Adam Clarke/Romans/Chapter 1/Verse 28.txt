Verse 28. They did not like to retain God — It would, perhaps, be more literal to translate ουκ εδοκιμασαν, THEY DID NOT SEARCH to retain God in their knowledge. They did not examine the evidences before them (Romans 1:19; Romans 1:20) of his being and attributes; therefore God gave them over to a REPROBATE mind, εις αδοκιμον νουν, to an UNSEARCHING or undiscerning mind; for it is the same word in both places. They did not reflect on the proofs they had of the Divine nature, and God abandoned them to the operations of a mind incapable of reflection. How men of such powers and learning, as many of the Greek and Roman philosophers and poets really were, could reason so inconsecutively concerning things moral and Divine is truly astonishing. But here we see the hand of a just and avenging God; they abused their powers, and God deprived them of the right use of these powers.
