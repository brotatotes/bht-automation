<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Being filled with all unrighteousness</b></i> — αδικια, every vice contrary to <i>justice</i> and <i>righteousness</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Fornication</b></i> — πορνεια, all commerce between the sexes out of the bounds of lawful marriage. Some of the best MSS. omit this reading; and others have ακαθαρσια, uncleanness.</p>
<p><i><b>Wickedness</b></i> — πονηρια, <i>malignity</i>, that which is oppressive to its possessor and to its object; from πονος, <i>labour, toil</i>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Covetousness</b></i> — πλεονεξια, from πλειον, <i>more</i>, and εξω, <i>I will have</i> the intense love or lust of gain; the <i>determination</i> to be rich; the principle of a <i>dissatisfied</i> and <i>discontented</i> soul.</p>
<p><i><b>Maliciousness</b></i> — κακια, <i>malice, ill-will</i>; what is radically and essentially <i>vicious</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Full of envy</b></i> — φθονου, from φθινω, <i>to wither, decay, consume,</i> <i>pine away</i>, c. "pain felt and malignity conceived at the sight of excellence or happiness in another." A fine personification of this vice is found in OVID METAM. lib. ii. ver. 768-781, which I shall here insert, with Mr. Addison's elegant and nervous translation. </p>
<p><i><b>Debate</b></i> — εριδος, <i>contention, discord</i>, c. Of this vile passion the Greeks made a <i>goddess</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Deceit</b></i> — δολου, <i>lying, falsity, prevarication, imposition</i>, c. from δελω, <i>to take with a bait</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Malignity</b></i> — κακοηθειας, from κακος, <i>evil</i>, and ηθος, <i>a custom</i> bad customs, founded in <i>corrupt sentiment</i>, producing <i>evil habits</i>, supported by <i>general usage</i>. It is generally interpreted, a <i>malignity of mind</i>, which leads its possessor to put the worst construction on every action; ascribing to the <i>best</i> <i>deeds</i> the <i>worst motives</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whisperers</b></i> — ψιθυριστος, secret detractors; those who, under pretended secrecy, carry about accusations against their neighbours, whether true or false; blasting their reputation by clandestine tittle-tattle. This word should be joined to the succeeding verse.</p>
<p>The <i>whispering</i> is well expressed by the Greek word ψιθυριστας, psithuristas.</p>
