Verse 29. Being filled with all unrighteousness — αδικια, every vice contrary to justice and righteousness.Fornication — πορνεια, all commerce between the sexes out of the bounds of lawful marriage. Some of the best MSS. omit this reading; and others have ακαθαρσια, uncleanness.Wickedness — πονηρια, malignity, that which is oppressive to its possessor and to its object; from πονος, labour, toil, c.Covetousness — πλεονεξια, from πλειον, more, and εξω, I will have the intense love or lust of gain; the determination to be rich; the principle of a dissatisfied and discontented soul.Maliciousness — κακια, malice, ill-will; what is radically and essentially vicious.Full of envy — φθονου, from φθινω, to wither, decay, consume, pine away, c. "pain felt and malignity conceived at the sight of excellence or happiness in another." A fine personification of this vice is found in OVID METAM. lib. ii. ver. 768-781, which I shall here insert, with Mr. Addison's elegant and nervous translation. Debate — εριδος, contention, discord, c. Of this vile passion the Greeks made a goddess.Deceit — δολου, lying, falsity, prevarication, imposition, c. from δελω, to take with a bait.Malignity — κακοηθειας, from κακος, evil, and ηθος, a custom bad customs, founded in corrupt sentiment, producing evil habits, supported by general usage. It is generally interpreted, a malignity of mind, which leads its possessor to put the worst construction on every action; ascribing to the best deeds the worst motives.Whisperers — ψιθυριστος, secret detractors; those who, under pretended secrecy, carry about accusations against their neighbours, whether true or false; blasting their reputation by clandestine tittle-tattle. This word should be joined to the succeeding verse.The whispering is well expressed by the Greek word ψιθυριστας, psithuristas.
