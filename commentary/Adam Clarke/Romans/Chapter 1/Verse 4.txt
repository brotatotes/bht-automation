<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>. <i><b>And declared to be the Son of God</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>, where this subject is considered at large. The word ορισθεντος, which we render <i>declared</i>, comes from οριζω, to <i>bound, define, determine</i>, or <i>limit</i>, and hence our word <i>horizon</i>, the <i>line</i> that <i>determines</i> the farthest visible part of the earth, in reference to the heavens. In this place the word signifies such a <i>manifest</i> and <i>complete exhibition</i> of the subject as to render it <i>indubitable</i>. The resurrection of Christ from the dead was such a <i>manifest proof</i> of our Lord's innocence, the truth of his doctrine, and the fulfilment of all that the prophets had spoken, as to leave no doubt on any considerate and candid mind.</p>
<p><i><b>With power</b></i> — ενδυναμει, With a <i>miraculous</i> display of Divine energy; for, how could his body be raised again, but by the miraculous energy of God? Some apply the word here to the <i>proof</i> of Christ's <i>sonship</i>; as if it were said that he was most manifestly declared to be the Son of God, with such powerful evidence and argument as to render the truth irresistible.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the spirit of holiness</b></i> — There are many differences of sentiment relative to the meaning of this phrase in this place; some supposing that the spirit of holiness implies the <i>Divine</i> <i>nature</i> of Jesus Christ; others, his <i>immaculate sanctity</i>, c. To me it seems that the apostle simply means that the person called Jesus, lately crucified at Jerusalem, and in whose name salvation was preached to the world, was the <i>Son of God</i>, the very Messiah promised before in the holy Scriptures and that he was this Messiah was amply demonstrated. </p>
<p>1st, By his resurrection from the dead, the irrefragable proof of his purity, innocence, and the Divine approbation; for, had he been a <i>malefactor</i>, as the Jews pretended, the miraculous power of God would not have been exerted in raising his body from the dead. </p>
<p>2d, He vas proved to be the Son of God, the promised Messiah, by the Holy Spirit, (called here the <i>spirit of holiness</i>,) which he sent down upon his apostles, and not on them only, but on all that believed on his name; by whose influence multitudes were convinced of sin, righteousness, and judgment, and multitudes sanctified unto God; and it was by the peculiar unction of this <i>spirit of holiness</i>, that the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:33">Acts 4:33</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, then, Christ was proved to be the <i>true Messiah</i>, the <i>son of</i> <i>David according to the flesh</i>, having the <i>sole right</i> to the throne of Israel; and God recognized this character, and this right, by his resurrection from the dead, and sending forth the various gifts and graces of the Spirit of holiness in his name.</p>
