<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:6">Romans 1:6</span>. <i><b>Ye are the called</b></i> â€” Ye Romans are all <i>invited</i> to believe in Christ Jesus, for the salvation of your souls; and to you, with the rest, my apostolical mission extends. This appears to be the most obvious sense of the word <i>called</i> in this place-to be <i>called by the Gospel</i> is to be <i>invited</i> to believe in Christ Jesus, and become his disciples. The word sometimes means <i>constituted</i>, or <i>made</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>.</p>
