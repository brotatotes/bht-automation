<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>. <i><b>Called to be saints</b></i> — Invited to become holy persons, by believing the Gospel and receiving the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Or, here, the word may have the meaning of <i>made</i> or <i>constituted</i>, as above; κλητοις αγιοις, <i>to all that be in Rome</i>, CONSTITUTED <i>saints,</i> for they had already received the Gospel grace, and were formed into a Christian Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Grace to you</b></i> — χαρις υμιν; May you be partakers of the <i>Divine</i> <i>favour</i>, the <i>source</i> whence every blessing is derived.</p>
<p>I think it necessary, once for all, to give the several acceptations of this word grace which occur in the sacred writings.</p>
<p>1. The word χαριν signifies in general <i>favour</i> or <i>benevolence</i>, but especially that <i>favour</i> which is <i>powerful</i> and <i>active</i>, and loads its objects with <i>benefits</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:30">Luke 1:30</span>: <i>Fear not, Mary, thou hast found</i> FAVOUR, χαριν, <i>with God</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:40">Luke 2:40</span>: And the child <i>grew - and the</i> GRACE <i>of God</i>, χαρις θεου, the <i>favour</i> <i>of God was upon him</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:52">Luke 1:52</span>: <i>And Jesus increased in</i> FAVOUR, χαριτι GRACE, <i>with God and man</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:47">Acts 2:47</span>: <i>Having</i> FAVOUR, χαριν, GRACE, <i>with all the people</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:33">Acts 4:33</span>: <i>And great</i> GRACE, χαρις, FAVOUR, <i>was upon them all</i>. The apostles were at that time in universal <i>favour</i> with the multitude. In this sense the word occurs in a great variety of places, both in the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>2. Hence it is often used for the <i>blessing</i> which it <i>dispenses</i>; for, if God be <i>favourably disposed</i> towards a person, his <i>beneficent</i> acts, in that person's behalf, will be a necessary consequence of such <i>favour</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>: <i>Full of</i> GRACE <i>and truth</i>; accomplished in all spiritual blessings. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>: <i>And</i> GRACE <i>upon</i> GRACE: he who is full of the most excellent blessings, confers them <i>liberally</i> on all believers. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:23">Acts 11:23</span>: <i>When he had seen the</i> GRACE <i>of God</i>, i.e. had the fullest evidence that they were richly endowed with heavenly gifts. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4">1 Corinthians 1:4</span>: <i>For the</i> GRACE <i>of God which is given you</i> - the <i>Divine blessings</i> conferred upon you. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8">2 Corinthians 9:8</span>: <i>God is able to make all</i> GRACE <i>abound toward you</i>; i.e. to enrich you with every benediction. This is also a very common acceptation of the word; and in this sense the word <i>grace</i> or <i>favour</i> is now generally understood among religious people. The <i>grace of God</i> meaning with them some <i>Divine</i> or <i>spiritual blessing communicated</i>.</p>
<p>3. It is sometimes taken for the whole of the <i>Christian</i> <i>religion</i>, as being the grandest possible display of God's <i>favour</i> to a lost, ruined world: and in this sense it appears to be used, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span>: <i>For the</i> LAW <i>was given by Moses; but</i> GRACE <i>and truth came by Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i>: where the term GRACE is evidently opposed to LAW; the latter meaning the <i>Mosaic</i>, the other the <i>Christian</i>, dispensation. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:43">Acts 13:43</span>: <i>Barnabas persuaded them to continue in the</i> GRACE <i>of God</i>; i.e. to hold fast their profession of the religion of Christ. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span>: <i>Ye are not under the</i> LAW, <i>but under</i> GRACE - ye are no longer under obligation to fulfil the Mosaic precepts, but are under the <i>Christian dispensation</i>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15">Romans 6:15</span>; and see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:2">Romans 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1">Romans 2:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span>: <i>The</i> GRACE <i>of God, that bringeth salvation unto all men,</i> <i>hath appeared</i>. The Jewish religion was restricted in its <i>benefits</i> to a <i>few</i>; but the <i>Christian religion</i> proposes the salvation of <i>all</i> men; and the author of it has become a sacrifice for the sins of the <i>whole world</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span>: <i>Looking diligently lest any man fall from the</i> GRACE <i>of God</i> - lest any man apostatize from the Christian religion, and the blessings of pardon and holiness which he has received through it. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:12">1 Peter 5:12</span>: <i>This is the true</i> GRACE <i>of God wherein ye stand</i> - the <i>Christian</i> <i>religion</i> which ye have received is the <i>genuine</i> religion of God.</p>
<p>4. It signifies all the <i>blessings</i> and <i>benefits</i> which Christ has <i>purchased</i>, and which he gives to true believers, both in <i>time</i> and <i>eternity</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>, where the <i>grace</i> of God is opposed to <i>death</i>; i.e. to all the wretchedness and misery brought into the world by Adam's transgression. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:23">1 Corinthians 16:23</span>: <i>The</i> GRACE <i>of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all</i> - May every blessing purchased by Christ's passion and death be the portion of you all. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span>: Ye <i>are fallen from</i> GRACE - ye have lost the blessings of the Gospel by submitting to circumcision.</p>
<p>5. It signifies the <i>apostolic</i> and <i>ministerial office</i>, or the authority to propagate the Christian religion, and the unction or influence by which that office is executed; so in the 5th verse of this chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span> as has been already noted: <i>By whom we have received</i> GRACE and <i>apostleship</i>, or, <i>the apostolic</i> <i>office</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:3">Romans 13:3</span>: <i>I say, through the</i> GRACE <i>given unto me</i>; i.e. I command you, by the <i>authority</i> of my <i>apostolic office</i>, c. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:6">Romans 13:6</span>.</p>
<p>6. It signifies a <i>gift</i>, salary, or money collected for the use of the poor. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>: <i>Whomsoever ye shall approve - them will I send to bring your</i> LIBERALITY, την χαριν υμων, <i>your</i> GRACE i.e. the <i>collection</i> made for the poor saints: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1">1 Corinthians 16:1</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span>: Praying us - <i>that we would receive the</i> GIFT, την χαριν, the GRACE, the <i>contribution</i> made in the Churches of Macedonia, for the relief of the poor. In this sense it is used in Ecclus. xvii. 22: <i>He will</i> <i>keep the</i> GOOD DEEDS <i>of man</i>, χαριν, the same as ελεημοσυνη, <i>alms</i>, in the beginning of the verse; and it signifies a kind or <i>friendly act</i>, in the same author. Ecclus. xxix. 16: <i>Forget not</i> <i>the</i> FRIENDSHIP, χαριτας, <i>of thy surety</i>. GRACES <i>or</i> χαρις, was a deity among the ancients; and the <i>three</i> GRACES, αι τρεις χαριτες, were called <i>Pitho, Aglaia</i>, and <i>Euphrosyne</i>; πειθω, mild <i>persuasion</i>; αγλαια, <i>dignity</i>; ευφροσυνη, <i>liberality</i> and <i>joyfulness</i>; and these were always painted <i>naked</i>, to show that all <i>benefits</i> should be <i>gratuitous</i>, this being essential to the nature of a <i>gift</i>. See Suidas, in χαριτας.</p>
<p>7. It sometimes signifies merely <i>thanks</i> or <i>thanksgiving</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:9">Luke 17:9</span>: <i>Doth he thank</i>, μη χαριν εχει, <i>that servant</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span>: <i>But God be</i> THANKED, χαρις οε τω θεω. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:30">1 Corinthians 10:30</span>: <i>For if I by</i> GRACE, χαριτι, THANKSGIVING, as our <i>margin</i> has it, and properly.</p>
<p>8. It signifies <i>remuneration, wages</i>, or <i>reward</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:32-34">Luke 6:32-34</span>: <i>If ye love them that love you - do good to them which do good to</i> <i>you - lend</i> to them <i>of whom ye hope to receive, what</i> THANK <i>have ye</i>? ποια υμιν χαρις εστι; <i>what</i> REWARD <i>have ye</i>? This appears, from the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:46">Matthew 5:46</span>, to be most evidently the meaning: τινα μισθον εχετε; <i>what</i> REWARD <i>have ye</i>? The word is used in this sense by several Greek writers.</p>
<p>9. It signifies whatever is the <i>means</i> of <i>procuring</i> the <i>favour</i> or <i>kindness</i> of another. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:20">2 Peter 2:20</span>: <i>For this is</i> THANKWORTHY, τουτο γαρ χαρις παρα τω θεω, this is the <i>means</i> of PROCURING FAVOUR <i>from God</i>.</p>
<p>10. It signifies <i>joy, pleasure</i>, and <i>gratification</i>, which is the, meaning of χαρα, and with which it is often confounded in the New Testament. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:7">Philemon 1:7</span>: <i>For we have great</i> JOY, χαριν γαρ εχομεν πολλην. Tobit vii. 18: <i>The Lord give thee</i> JOY, χαριν, <i>for this thy sorrow</i>. In this sense the word is used by the best Greek writers; and in this sense it appears to be used, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span>.</p>
<p>11. It signifies the <i>performance</i> of an <i>act</i> which is <i>pleasing</i> or <i>grateful</i> to others. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:27">Acts 24:27</span>: <i>Felix, willing to show the Jews a</i> PLEASURE, χαριτας καταθεσθαι, to perform an act which he knew would be highly <i>gratifying</i> to them.</p>
<p>12. It signifies <i>whatever has the power or influence to procure</i> <i>favour</i>, c. Suavity, kindness, benevolence, gentle demeanour. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:22">Luke 4:22</span>: <i>All wondered at the</i> GRACIOUS WORDS, τοις λογοις της χαριτος, the <i>benevolent, kind</i>, and <i>tender expressions</i> such as his text, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>, would naturally lead him to speak. <i>He hath anointed me to preach</i> <i>the Gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the</i> <i>broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives</i>, c. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:29">Ephesians 4:29</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:6">Colossians 4:6</span>: <i>Let your speech be always with</i> GRACE; i.e. <i>gracious, kind,</i> <i>benevolent</i>, savouring of the <i>doctrine</i> of Christ: it is thus used by several Greek writers. See <i>Schleusner</i>. As the word χαρις GRACE, most frequently signifies some <i>blessing</i> or <i>benefit</i> calculated to promote human <i>happiness</i>, it is generally derived from χαρω, <i>I rejoice</i>, because of the effect produced by the blessing.</p>
<p><i><b>And peace</b></i> — ειρηνη, the same as שלום <i>shalom</i> in Hebrew, generally signifying all <i>kinds of blessing</i>, but especially harmony and <i>unity</i>, and the <i>bond</i> of such <i>unity</i>. The most probable derivation of the word ειρηνη is from ειρω, <i>I bind</i>, and εν, <i>one</i> - because peace unites and binds those who were, by discord, before <i>disunited</i>. In the New Testament it signifies - 1. <i>Peace</i>, public or private, in the general acceptation of the word, as implying <i>reconciliation</i> and <i>friendship</i>; and to the etymology of the word the apostle seems to allude in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>: <i>Endeavouring to keep the</i> UNITY <i>of the Spirit in the</i> BOND <i>of</i> PEACE. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:20">Acts 12:20</span>: <i>They of Tyre and Sidon desired</i> PEACE - they sought <i>reconciliation</i>, with Herod, by means of Blastus, the king's chamberlain.</p>
<p>2. It signifies <i>regularity, good order</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:33">1 Corinthians 14:33</span>: <i>God is not the God of confusion, but</i> of PEACE.</p>
<p>3. It signifies the <i>labour</i> or <i>study</i> of preserving <i>peace</i> and <i>concord</i>; and this is supposed to be its meaning, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:34">Matthew 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:51">Luke 12:51</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:26">Acts 7:26</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>: <i>For the kingdom of God is righteousness and</i> PEACE - the Christian dispensation admits of no <i>contention</i>, but inculcates <i>peace</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:15">1 Corinthians 7:15</span>: <i>God hath called us to</i> PEACE - to <i>labour</i> to preserve <i>quietness</i> and <i>concord</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>: <i>Follow</i> PEACE - <i>labour</i> to preserve it.</p>
<p>4. It signifies the <i>author</i> or <i>procurer</i> of <i>peace</i> and <i>concord.</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span>: <i>He is our</i> PEACE - the <i>author</i> of concord betwixt Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p>5. It signifies the <i>Gospel</i> and its <i>blessings</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>: <i>And came and preached</i> PEACE <i>to you which were afar off, and to</i> <i>them that were nigh</i>.</p>
<p>6. It signifies all kinds of <i>mental</i> and <i>corporeal happiness</i>, and especially the happiness of Christians. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79">Luke 1:79</span>: <i>To guide our feet into the way of</i> PEACE - to show us the way to obtain <i>true happiness</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:42">Luke 19:42</span>: <i>The things</i> which belong <i>unto thy</i> PEACE - that by which thou mightest have been made truly happy. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>: <i>The very God of</i> PEACE - God, the only source of true felicity. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>: <i>These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye might have</i> PEACE - that ye might have confidence and happiness in believing on me as your only Saviour.</p>
<p>7. It signifies <i>good wishes</i> and <i>affectionate prayers</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:13">Matthew 10:13</span>: <i>And if the house be worthy, let your</i> PEACE <i>come upon it</i>. Our Lord commands his disciples, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:12">Matthew 10:12</span>, to <i>salute</i> the house into which they entered; and this was done by saying, <i>Peace be unto this house</i>! that is, Let every blessing, <i>spiritual</i> and <i>temporal</i>, be the portion of this family! See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:6">Luke 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:33">Acts 15:33</span>: <i>They were let go in</i> PEACE - they had the most <i>fervent and</i> <i>affectionate prayers</i> of the Church.</p>
<p>8. It signifies <i>praise</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:38">Luke 19:38</span>: PEACE <i>in heaven and glory in the highest</i>! - May all the heavenly host praise God, and give him the highest honour!</p>
<p>9. It signifies <i>benignity, benevolence, favour</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>: <i>Being justified by faith, we have</i> PEACE <i>with God</i> - In consequence of having our sins forgiven, we have a clear sense of the Divine <i>favour</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>: <i>The</i> PEACE <i>of God which passeth all understanding</i> - the inexpressible blessedness of a <i>sense</i> of the Divine <i>favour</i>. See <i>Schleusner's</i> Lexicon.</p>
<p><i><b>From God our Father</b></i> — The apostle wishes them all the blessings which can flow from GOD, as the <i>fountain of grace</i>, producing in them all the <i>happiness</i> which a heart filled with the <i>peace of God</i> can possess; all of which are to be communicated to them through the Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:31">Acts 28:31</span>.</p>
