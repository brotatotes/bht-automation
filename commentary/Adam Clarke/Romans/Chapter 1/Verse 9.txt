<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span>. <i><b>Whom I serve with my spirit</b></i> — λατπευω Whom <i>I worship</i> with the <i>profoundest religious reverence</i>; for so the original certainly means: I not only employ all the powers of my <i>body</i> in this service, but all those of my <i>soul</i>; being thoroughly convinced of the <i>absolute truth</i> of the religion I preach. Probably St. Paul opposes, in this place, the <i>spiritual</i> worship of the Gospel to the <i>external</i>, or what some call the <i>carnal</i>, worship of the Jews. Mine is not a religion of <i>ceremonies</i>, but one in which the <i>life</i> and <i>power</i> of the <i>eternal Spirit</i> are acknowledged and experienced.</p>
