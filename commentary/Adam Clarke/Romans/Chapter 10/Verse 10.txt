<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span>. <i><b>For with the heart man believeth</b></i>, c.] And be sincere in this: <i>for with the heart</i>, duly affected with a sense of guilt, and of the sufficiency of the sacrifice which Christ has offered, <i>man believeth unto righteousness</i>, believeth to receive <i>justification</i> for this is the proper meaning of the term here, and in many other parts of this epistle; <i>and with the mouth</i> <i>confession is made unto salvation</i>. He who believes aright in Christ Jesus will receive such a full conviction of the truth, and such an evidence of his redemption, that his mouth will boldly confess his obligation to his Redeemer, and the blessed persuasion he has of the remission of all his sins through the blood of the cross. One grand object of the apostle is to show the simplicity of the Gospel scheme of salvation; and at the same time, its great efficacy, it is <i>simple</i>, and very unlike the law, which was full of rites, ordinances, ceremonies, &amp;c., each of which required to be perfectly fulfilled: and yet, after all, even those who had the utmost zeal for God, and, as conscientiously as possible, observed all the precepts of the law, had not attained to justification nor peace of conscience. Whereas both Jews and Gentiles, who had believed on the Lord Jesus according to the simple declarations of the Gospel, were freely justified from all things from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses: and they had the witness in themselves that they were passed from death to life.</p>
