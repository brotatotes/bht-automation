<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span>. <i><b>For there is no difference between the Jew and the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Greek</b></i> â€” All are equally welcome to this salvation. Here the Jew has no exclusive privilege; and from this the Greek is not rejected. One simple way of being saved is proposed to all, viz. faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; because he is the same Lord who has made all and governs all, and is rich in mercy to all that call upon him.</p>
