<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:13">Romans 10:13</span>. <i><b>For whosoever shall call</b></i>, c.] Nor shall any one who hears this doctrine of salvation, and credits it as he is commanded, be permitted to pray or supplicate the throne of grace in vain: for the Prophet Joel hath declared, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:32">Joel 2:32</span>: <i>Whosoever shall call upon, invoke, the name of the Lord Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i>, the Saviour of sinners, <i>shall be saved</i>-shall have his guilt pardoned, his heart purified and if he abide in the faith, rooted and grounded in him, showing forth the virtues of him who was called him out of darkness into his marvellous light, <i>he shall</i> <i>be saved</i> with all the power of an <i>eternal</i> life.</p>
<p>"<i>Believing in Christ</i>, or God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:11">Romans 10:11</span>, and <i>calling upon God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12-14">Romans 10:12-14</span>, are in effect the same thing; as <i>calling upon God</i> necessarily connects and supposes faith in him: and he who duly believes in Christ has such a sense of his dependence upon Divine grace, that he looks unto God and trusts in his power and goodness alone for happiness: which is the true religion of the Gospel." Dr. <i>Taylor</i>.</p>
<p>It is evident that St. Paul understood the text of <i>Joel</i> as relating to our blessed Lord; and therefore his word κυριος must answer to the prophet's word יהוה <i>Yehovah</i>, which is no mean proof of the Godhead of Jesus Christ. If the text be translated, <i>Whosoever shall invoke in the name of the Lord</i>, which translation יקרא בשם יהוה <i>yikra beshem Yehovah</i> will certainly bear, yet still the term <i>Yehovah</i>, the incommunicable name, is given to Christ; because <i>invoking in the name</i> signifies soliciting one in the name or on the account of another. He who is invoked is GOD; he, in whose name he is invoked, is JESUS CHRIST, who is here called <i>Yehovah</i>. He who asks mercy from GOD, in the <i>name</i> and for the <i>sake</i> of JESUS CHRIST, shall get his soul saved.</p>
