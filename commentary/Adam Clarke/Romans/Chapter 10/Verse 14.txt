<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14">Romans 10:14</span>. <i><b>How then shall they call on him</b></i> â€” As the apostle had laid so much stress on <i>believing</i> in order to salvation, and as this doctrine, without farther explanation, might be misunderstood, it was necessary to show how this faith was produced; and therefore he lays the whole doctrine down in a beautifully graduated order.</p>
<p>1. There can be no salvation without the <i>Gospel</i>: a dispensation of mercy and grace from God alone, here called, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:15">Romans 10:15</span>, the <i>Gospel of peace; glad tidings of good things</i>.</p>
<p>2. <i>This must be preached</i>, proclaimed in the world for the obedience of faith.</p>
<p>3. None can effectually preach this unless he have a <i>Divine</i> <i>mission</i>; for <i>how shall they preach except they be</i> SENT, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:15">Romans 10:15</span>. The <i>matter</i> must come from God; and the <i>person</i> mho proclaims it must have both <i>authority</i> and <i>unction</i> from on high.</p>
<p>4. This Divinely-commissioned person must be <i>heard</i>: it is the duty of all, to whom this message of salvation is sent, to <i>hear</i> it with the deepest reverence and attention.</p>
<p>5. What is <i>heard</i> must be <i>credited</i>; for they who do not believe the Gospel as the record which God has given of his Son cannot be saved, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14">Romans 10:14</span>.</p>
<p>6. Those who believe must <i>invoke</i> God by Christ, which they cannot do unless they <i>believe</i> in him; and in this way alone they are to expect salvation. <i>Professing</i> to believe in Christ, without earnest, importunate <i>prayer</i> for salvation, can save no man. All these things the apostle lays down as essentially necessary; and they all follow from his grand proposition, <i>Whosoever shall call</i> <i>upon the name of the Lord shall be saved</i>. But, says the apostle, <i>How shall they</i> CALL <i>upon him in whom they have not believed? And</i> <i>how shall they</i> BELIEVE <i>in him of whom they have not heard? And</i> <i>how shall they</i> HEAR <i>without a preacher? And how shall they</i> PREACH <i>except they be sent</i>? And with what message which can bring <i>salvation</i> can they be sent, but with the GOSPEL OF PEACE, the GLAD TIDINGS OF GOOD THINGS. When, therefore, there is:</p>
<p>1st, a proper MESSAGE;</p>
<p>2dly, a proper MESSENGER;</p>
<p>3dly, the message PREACHED, proclaimed, or properly delivered by him;</p>
<p>4thly, the proclamation properly HEARD and attentively considered by the people;</p>
<p>5thly, the message which they have <i>heard</i>, conscientiously BELIEVED;</p>
<p>6thly, the <i>name</i> of the Lord Jesus, by whom alone this salvation is provided, most fervently INVOKED; then,</p>
<p>7thly, salvation, or redemption from sin and misery, and the enjoyment of peace and happiness, will be the result of such <i>calling, believing, hearing,</i> <i>preaching, sending</i>, and <i>message</i> sent:-and thus the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith is guarded from abuse.</p>
