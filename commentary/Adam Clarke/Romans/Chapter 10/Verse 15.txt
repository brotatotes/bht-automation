<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:15">Romans 10:15</span>. <i><b>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach</b></i> â€” Dr. Taylor remarks on this quotation, which is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:7">Isaiah 52:7</span>, that "<i>feet</i> are variously used in Scripture, and sometimes have respect to things <i>internal</i> and <i>spiritual</i>. For as the life of man and the practice of piety are compared to <i>walking</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:1">Psalms 1:1</span>, so his <i>feet</i> may signify the <i>principles</i> on which he acts, and the <i>dispositions</i> of his <i>mind</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:1">Ecclesiastes 5:1</span>: <i>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God</i>. Agreeably to this, the <i>feet</i> of the <i>messengers</i> in Isaiah and of the <i>apostles</i> in this verse, may signify the <i>validity of their mission</i>-the authority upon which they acted, and any character or qualifications with which they were invested."</p>
