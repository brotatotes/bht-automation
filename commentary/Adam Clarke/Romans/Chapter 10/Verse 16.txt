<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span>. <i><b>But they have not all obeyed the Gospel.</b></i> â€” This seems to be the objection of a <i>Jew</i>; as if he had said: A Divine mission would be attended with success; whereas there are numbers who pay no attention to the glad tidings you preach. To this the apostle answers, that the Spirit of God, by Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1">Isaiah 53:1</span>, foretold it would be <i>so</i>, even in the <i>case of the Jews</i> themselves, where he said, <i>Lord, who hath believed our report</i>? For although God brings the message of salvation to men, he does not <i>oblige</i> them to embrace it.</p>
<p>It is <i>proposed</i> to their understanding and conscience; but it does not become the means of salvation unless it be <i>affectionately</i> <i>credited</i>.</p>
