<p>Verse 17. <i><b>So then faith</b></i><b> cometh </b><i><b>by hearing</b></i> â€” Preaching the Gospel is the ordinary means of salvation; faith in Christ is the result of hearing the <i>word</i>, the <i>doctrine of God preached</i>. Preaching, God sends; if heard attentively, faith will be produced; and if they believe the report, the arm of the Lord will be revealed in their salvation.</p>
