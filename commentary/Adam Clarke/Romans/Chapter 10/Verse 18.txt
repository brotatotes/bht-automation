<p>Verse 18. <i><b>But I say, have they not heard?</b></i> — But to return to the objection: You say <i>they have not all</i> BELIEVED; I ask: <i>Have</i> <i>they not all</i> HEARD? Have not the means of salvation been placed within the reach of every Jew in Palestine, and within the reach of all those who sojourn in the different Gentile countries where we have preached the Gospel, as well to the Jews as to the Gentiles themselves? Yes: for we may say of the preaching of the Gospel what the psalmist has said (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:4">Psalms 19:4</span>) of the <i>heavenly bodies: Their sound went into all the earth, and</i> <i>their words unto the ends of the world</i>. As the celestial luminaries have given testimony of the eternal power and Godhead of the Deity to the habitable world, the Gospel of Christ has borne testimony to his eternal goodness and mercy to all the land of Palestine, and to the whole Roman empire. There is not a part of the promised land in which these glad tidings have not been preached; and there is scarcely a place in the Roman empire in which the doctrine of Christ crucified has not been heard: if, therefore, the Jews have not believed, the fault is entirely their own; as God has amply furnished them with the means of faith and of salvation.</p>
<p>In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:4">Psalms 19:4</span>, the psalmist has קום <i>kauuam</i>, their <i>line</i>, which the <i>Septuagint</i>, and the apostle who quotes from them, render φθογγος, <i>sound</i>; and hence some have thought that the word in the Psalm was originally קולם <i>kolam, voice</i>. But that קו <i>kau</i> is used for <i>word</i> or <i>speech</i> is sufficiently evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:10">Isaiah 28:10</span>, <i>line</i> upon <i>line</i>, precept upon precept, &amp;c., where קו is analogous to <i>word</i> or <i>direction</i>. It is very remarkable that these words of David, quoted by St. Paul, are mentioned in <i>Sohar. Genes</i>. fol. 9, where it is said: עבדי משיחא אינון מלין <i>Abdey mashicha innun</i> <i>millin</i>. "These words are the servants of the Messiah, and measure out both the things above and the things beneath." To this notion of them the apostle may refer in his use of them in this place, and to a Jew the application would be legitimate.</p>
