<p>Verse 19. <i><b>But I say, Did not Israel know?</b></i> â€” You object to this preaching among the <i>Gentiles</i>; but is not this according to the positive declaration of God? He, foreseeing your unbelief and rebellion, said by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:21">Deuteronomy 32:21</span>, <i>I will provoke you to jealousy by</i> them that are <i>no people, and by</i> <i>a foolish nation I will anger you</i>. As you have provoked me to jealousy with worshipping those that are <i>no gods</i>, I will provoke you to jealousy by those which are <i>no people</i>. This most evidently refers to the <i>calling</i> or <i>inviting</i> of the Gentiles to partake of the benefits of the Gospel; and plainly predicts the envy and rage which would be excited in the Jews, in consequence of those offers of mercy made to the Gentiles.</p>
