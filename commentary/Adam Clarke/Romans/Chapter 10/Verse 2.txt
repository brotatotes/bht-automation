<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:2">Romans 10:2</span>. <i><b>They have a zeal of God</b></i> â€” They believe their law to have come immediately from God himself, and are jealous of its glory and excellence; they conscientiously observe its rites and ceremonies, but they do not consider the <i>object</i> and <i>end</i> of those rites; they sin more through ignorance than malice; and this pleads in their excuse. By this fine apology for them, the apostle prepares them for the harsher truths which he was about to deliver.</p>
