<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:21">Romans 10:21</span>. <i><b>But to Israel he saith</b></i> â€” In the very next verse, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:2">Isaiah 65:2</span>,) <i>All day long have I stretched forth my hands</i>, manifesting the utmost readiness and willingness to gather them all together under my protecting care; but <i>I stretched forth my hands</i> in vain, for they are a <i>disobedient and gainsaying people</i>. They not only disobey my command, but they gainsay and contradict my prophets. Thus the apostle proves, in answer to the objection made <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span>, that the <i>infidelity</i> of the Jews was the effect of their own <i>obstinacy</i>; that the opposition which they are now making to the Gospel was foretold and deplored 700 years before; and that their opposition, far from being a proof of the insufficiency of the Gospel, proved that this was the grand means which God had provided for their salvation; and having rejected this, they could expect no other. And this gives the apostle opportunity to speak largely concerning their rejection in the following chapter.</p>
<p>I. IN the preceding chapter are several quotations from the <i>law</i>, the <i>prophets</i>, and the <i>Psalms</i>; and as the apostle seems to take them with considerable latitude of meaning, it has been thought that he only uses their <i>words</i> as being well calculated to express his <i>sense</i>, without paying any attention to their <i>original</i> <i>import</i>. This principle is too lax to be introduced in such solemn circumstances. Dr. Taylor has made some judicious and useful distinctions here. After observing that, if we allow this principle, no argument can be built on any of the apostle's quotations; and that it must have been an indifferent thing with him whether he did or did not understand the Scripture-as, on this supposition, they would serve him as well <i>without</i> as with the <i>true</i> <i>meaning</i>-he adds: the apostle was a strict and close quoter of the Scripture; but he did not always quote them in the same manner, or for the same purpose.</p>
<p>1. <i>Sometimes</i> his intention goes no farther than using the <i>same</i> <i>strong expressions</i>, as being equally applicable to the point in hand. So, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6-8">Romans 10:6-8</span>, he uses the words of <i>Moses</i>, not to prove any thing, nor as if he thought Moses spoke of the same subject, but only as intimating that the strong and lively expressions which Moses used concerning the doctrine he taught, were equally applicable to the faith of the Gospel. So, in the same manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:18">Romans 10:18</span>, he quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:4">Psalms 19:4</span>, though it is likely (see the note in that place) that those expressions were used by the ancient Jews in application to the <i>Messiah</i> as the apostle applies them.</p>
<p>2. <i>Sometimes</i> the design of the quotation is only to show that the <i>cases</i> are <i>parallel</i>: or, that what happened in his times corresponded with what happened in former days. So <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:24">Romans 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:36">Romans 8:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:27-29">Romans 9:27-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2-5">Romans 11:2-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8-10">Romans 11:8-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:21">Romans 15:21</span>.</p>
<p>3. <i>Sometimes</i> the quotation is only intended to <i>explain</i> a doctrinal point, as <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:6-8">Romans 4:6-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:18-21">Romans 4:18-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:20">Romans 9:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:21">Romans 9:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:15">Romans 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:3">Romans 15:3</span>.</p>
<p>4. <i>Sometimes</i> the quotation is designed to <i>prove</i> a doctrinal point. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-19">Romans 3:10-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3-17">Romans 4:3-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12-14">Romans 5:12-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:9">Romans 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:12">Romans 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:13">Romans 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:15">Romans 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:17">Romans 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:5">Romans 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:11">Romans 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:13">Romans 10:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:19">Romans 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:20">Romans 12:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:11">Romans 14:11</span>.</p>
<p>5. <i>Sometimes</i> it is the intention of the quotation to prove that something was <i>predicted</i>, or <i>properly foretold</i> in the prophetic writings, as <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:25">Romans 9:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:26">Romans 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:19-21">Romans 10:19-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:27">Romans 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:9-13">Romans 15:9-13</span>.</p>
<p>These things duly considered, it will appear that the apostle has every where shown a just regard to the true sense of the Scripture he quotes, in the <i>view</i> in which he quotes it.</p>
<p>These rules may help to vindicate the quotations in all the apostolic writings. And it is evident that we cannot form a true judgment upon any quotation, unless we take in the <i>intention</i> of the writer, or the <i>view</i> in which he quotes.</p>
<p>II. The apostle here makes a just and proper distinction between the righteousness or justification that is of the law, and that which is by faith in Christ. And, in his view of the former, shows it to be absolutely impossible; for if no man is <i>to live</i> <i>thereby</i>-to have <i>spiritual</i> and <i>eternal life</i>, but he who <i>does</i> these things; then salvation on that ground must be impossible; for,</p>
<p>1. The law makes no <i>provision</i> for the <i>pardon of sin</i>.</p>
<p>2. It affords no <i>helps</i> for the performance of duty.</p>
<p>3. It makes no <i>allowances</i> for imperfections in duty, or for imperfections is our nature.</p>
<p>4. Its commandments, necessarily, suppose a <i>righteous</i> <i>soul</i>, and <i>a vigorous body</i>; and it does not lower its claims to the fallen state of man.</p>
<p>5. It requires <i>perfect obedience</i>, not only in all <i>things</i>, but in all <i>places</i> and <i>circumstances</i>. The man who comes up to this standard, has ever <i>been in it</i>, and has never swerved from it, shall, by the law, live for ever. But no man, since the fall, ever did so or ever can do so: therefore, salvation by the works of the law is absolutely impossible. But,</p>
<p>1. The righteousness or justification, which is by faith, receives Christ as an atoning sacrifice, by which all past sin is pardoned.</p>
<p>2. Receives continual supplies of grace from Christ by the eternal Spirit, through which the man is enabled to love God with all his heart, soul, mind, and strength, and his neighbour as himself.</p>
<p>3. This grace is afforded in sufficient degrees suited to all places, times, and circumstances, so that no trial can happen too great to be borne, as the grace of Christ is ever at hand to support and to save to the uttermost. The law is the letter that killeth; the Gospel is the spirit that giveth life. Reader, let thy whole soul say with the apostle, Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift!</p>
