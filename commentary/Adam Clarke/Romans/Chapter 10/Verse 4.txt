<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:4">Romans 10:4</span>. <i><b>For Christ</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the end of the law</b></i> â€” Where the law ends, Christ begins. The law ends with representative sacrifices; Christ begins with the <i>real</i> offering. The law is our schoolmaster to lead us to Christ; it cannot save, but it leaves us at his door, where alone salvation is to be found. Christ as an atoning sacrifice for sin, was the grand <i>object</i> of the whole sacrificial code of Moses; his passion and death were the fulfilment of its great object and design. Separate this sacrificial death of Christ from the law, and the law has no meaning, for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins: wherefore the Messiah is represented as saying, <i>Sacrifice</i> <i>and observing thou didst not desire; burnt-offering and</i> <i>sin-offering thou hast not required; then said I, Lo, I come to do</i> <i>thy will; a body hast thou prepared me</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6">Psalms 40:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:7">Psalms 40:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:4-10">Hebrews 10:4-10</span>; which proves that God never designed that the sacrifices of the law should be considered <i>the atonement</i> for sin, but a type or representative of that atonement; and that THE atonement was the sacrifice offered by Christ. Thus he was the END <i>of the law</i>, in respect to its <i>sacrifices</i>. And, as sacrifices were offered merely to procure pardon of sin, righteousness, or justification, Christ is the end of the law for this justification <i>to every one that</i> <i>believeth</i> on him, as dying for their offences, and rising again for their justification, having made peace through the blood of his cross. Therefore every Jew who rejected Christ rejected salvation, and that very salvation which the law witnessed and required, and which could not be had but through Christ alone.</p>
