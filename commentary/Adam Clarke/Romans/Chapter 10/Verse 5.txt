<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:5">Romans 10:5</span>. <i><b>For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>the law</b></i> â€” The place to which the apostle refers, seems to be <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+18:5">Leviticus 18:5</span>: <i>Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments; which if a</i> <i>man do, he shall live in them</i>. These words seem to be spoken in answer to an objection which might be made by a Jew: "Did not Moses give us a law, the observance of which should secure our salvation?" Such a law Moses undoubtedly gave, and that law promises life to those who perform its precepts: but who can plead for life on this ground, who rejects that Christ who is the <i>end of</i> <i>the law</i>? No man ever did, nor ever can, fulfil that law, so as to <i>merit</i> salvation by the performance of it: for, as all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, they are all under the curse of the law, which says: <i>Cursed is every one who continueth</i> <i>not in all the things that are written in the book of the law to</i> <i>do them</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+27:26">Deuteronomy 27:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>; therefore by the deeds of this law none can be justified, because all are in a state of condemnation for transgressions already committed against it. If, therefore, there were not such a provision as is made by the death of Christ, no soul could be saved.</p>
