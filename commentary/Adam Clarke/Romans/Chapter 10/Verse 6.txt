<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6">Romans 10:6</span>. <i><b>But the righteousness which is of faith</b></i> â€” As it is most evident that there can be no justification by <i>works</i>, as all are <i>sinful</i> and all in a <i>guilty</i> state; if God will grant salvation at all, it must be by <i>faith</i>: but faith must have an <i>object</i> and a <i>reason</i> for its exercise; the <i>object</i> is Jesus Christ-the <i>reason</i> is the infinite merit of his passion and death.</p>
<p><i><b>Who shall ascend unto heaven</b></i>? c.] As Christ is the end of the law for justification to every one that believes, no observance of the law can procure <i>him</i>. <i>Who</i>, by the practice of the law, can bring Christ down from heaven? or, when brought down, and crucified and buried, as a sacrifice for sin, who can bring him up again from the dead? And both his <i>death</i> and <i>resurrection</i> are essentially necessary for the salvation of a lost world. Or the sense of the apostle may be this: They who will not believe in Christ crucified must in effect be seeking another Messiah to come down from heaven with a different revelation or they who will not credit the doctrine that we preach concerning his <i>resurrection</i> seem in effect to say, Christ yet remains to be raised from the dead, and reign over the Jews as a mighty secular sovereign, subjecting the Gentile world to the sway of his righteous sceptre.</p>
