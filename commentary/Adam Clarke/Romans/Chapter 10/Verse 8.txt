<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:8">Romans 10:8</span>. <i><b>But what saith it? The word is nigh thee</b></i> â€” There is no occasion to seek <i>high</i> or <i>low</i> for the saving power; the word of reconciliation is nigh. The way of salvation is now both plain and easy. The law is magnified and made honourable by the death of Christ; and the doctrine of faith in his death and resurrection is fully proclaimed, and amply proved to be effectual to the purpose for which it was revealed. By the preaching of the Gospel the doctrine of salvation is <i>nigh</i> thee, and the saving influence is <i>at hand</i>: it is <i>in thy mouth</i>, easy to be understood, easy to be <i>professed</i>: and <i>in thy heart</i>, if thou art upright before God, sincerely desiring to be saved on his own terms, not striving to establish thy own method of justification by the law, which must for ever be ineffectual, but submitting to the method of justification which God has devised.</p>
