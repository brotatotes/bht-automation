<p>This chapter is of the <i>prophetic</i> kind. It was by the spirit of prophecy that the <i>apostle</i> foresaw the rejection of the Jews, which he supposes in the two preceding chapters; for when he wrote the epistle they were not in <i>fact</i>, rejected, seeing their polity and Church were then standing. But the event has proved that he was a true prophet; for we know that in about <i>ten</i> or <i>eleven</i> years after the writing of this letter the temple was destroyed, the Jewish polity overthrown, and the Jews expelled out of the promised land, which they have never been able to recover to the present day.</p>
<p>This, 1. confirms the arguments which the apostle had advanced to establish the calling of the Gentiles. For the Jews are, in <i>fact</i>, rejected; consequently, our calling is, in fact, not invalidated by any thing they suggested, relative to the <i>perpetuity</i> of the <i>Mosaic dispensation</i>. But that dispensation being wholly subverted, our title to the privileges of God's Church and people stands clear and strong; the Jewish constitution only could furnish objections against our claim; and the event has silenced every objection from that quarter.</p>
<p>2. The actual rejection of the Jews proves Paul to be a <i>true</i> <i>apostle</i> of Jesus Christ, and that he spoke by the Spirit of God; otherwise, he could not have argued so fully upon a case which was yet to come, and of which there was no appearance in the state of things when he wrote this epistle. And this very circumstance should induce us to pay great attention to this chapter, in which he discourses concerning the <i>extent</i> and <i>duration</i> of the rejection of his countrymen, to prevent their being insulted and despised by the <i>Gentile Christians</i>.</p>
<p>(1) As to the <i>extent</i> of this rejection, it is not absolutely <i>universal</i>; some of the Jews have embraced the Gospel, and are incorporated into the Christian Church with the believing Gentiles. Upon the case of these believing Jews he comments, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1-7">Romans 11:1-7</span>.</p>
<p>(2) As to the <i>duration</i> of it, it is not <i>final</i> and <i>perpetual</i>, for <i>all Israel</i>, or the nation of the Jews, which is now <i>blinded</i>, shall one day be <i>saved</i> or brought again into the kingdom or covenant of God. Upon the state of these <i>blinded</i> Jews he comments, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span> to the end of the chapter. His design, in discoursing upon this subject, was not only to make the thing itself known, but partly to engage the attention of the unbelieving Jew; to conciliate his favour, and, if possible, to induce him to come into the Gospel scheme; and partly to dispose the <i>Gentile Christians</i> not to treat the Jews with contempt; (considering that they derived all their present blessings from the <i>patriarchs</i>, the <i>ancestors</i> of the Jewish nation, and were engrafted into the good olive tree, whence the Jews had been broken;) and to admonish them to take warning by the fall of the Jews; to make a good improvement of their religious privileges, lest, through unbelief, any of them should relapse into <i>heathenism</i>, or perish finally at the last day.</p>
<p>The thread of his discourse leads him into a general survey and comparison of the several dispensations of God towards the <i>Gentiles</i> and <i>Jews</i>; and he concludes this survey with adoration of the depths of the Divine knowledge and wisdom exercised in the various constitutions erected in the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:30-36">Romans 11:30-36</span>.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>. <i><b>I say then, hath God cast away his people?</b></i> — Has he <i>utterly</i> and <i>finally</i> rejected them? for this is necessarily the apostle's meaning, and is the import of the Greek word απωσατο, which signifies to <i>thrust</i> or <i>drive away</i>, from απο, <i>from</i>, and ωθεω, to <i>thrust</i> or <i>drive</i>; has he thrust them off, and driven them eternally from him? <i>God forbid</i>-by no means. This rejection is neither <i>universal</i> nor <i>final. For I also am an Israelite</i>-I am a regular descendant from <i>Abraham</i>, through <i>Israel</i> or <i>Jacob</i>, and by his son <i>Benjamin</i>. And <i>I</i> stand in the Church of God, and in the peculiar covenant; for the rejection is only of the obstinate and disobedient; for those who believe on Christ, as I have done, are continued in the Church.</p>
