<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:10">Romans 11:10</span>. <i><b>Let their eyes be darkened</b></i> â€” All these words are <i>declarative</i>, and not <i>imprecatory</i>. God <i>declares</i> what will be the case of such obstinate unbelievers; their <i>table</i>, their common providential blessings, will <i>become a snare</i>, a <i>trap</i>, a <i>stumbling</i> <i>block</i>, and the means of their punishment. Their eyes will be more and more darkened as they persist in their unbelief, and their <i>back shall be bowed down always</i>; far from becoming a <i>great</i> and <i>powerful nation</i>, they shall continue ever in a state of <i>abject</i> <i>slavery</i> and oppression, till they acknowledge Jesus as the promised Messiah, and submit to receive redemption in his blood.</p>
