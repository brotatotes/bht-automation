<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>. <i><b>Have they stumbled that they should fall?</b></i> â€” Have the Jews, now for their disobedience and unbelief rejected, so sinned against God as to be for ever put out of the reach of his mercy? <i>By no means</i>. Are they, as a nation, utterly irrecoverable? This is the sense of the place, and here the prophecy of the restoration of the Jewish nation commences.</p>
<p><i><b>But</b></i><b> rather </b><i><b>through their fall salvation</b></i><b> is come</b>] The Church of God cannot fail; if the Jews have <i>broken the everlasting covenant</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:5">Isaiah 24:5</span>, the Gentiles shall be taken into it; and this very circumstance shall be ultimately the means of exciting them to seek and claim a share in the blessings of the new covenant; and this is what the apostle terms <i>provoking them to jealousy</i>, i.e. exciting them to emulation, for so the word should be understood. We should observe here, that the <i>fall of the Jews</i> was not in <i>itself</i> the cause or reason of the <i>calling of the Gentiles</i>; for whether the Jews had <i>stood</i> or <i>fallen</i>, whether they had <i>embraced</i> or <i>rejected</i> the Gospel, it was the original purpose of God to take the Gentiles into the Church; for this was absolutely implied in the covenant made with Abraham: and it was in virtue of that covenant that the Gentiles were now called, and <i>not</i> BECAUSE of the <i>unbelief</i> of the <i>Jews</i>. And hence we see that their fall was not the necessary means of the salvation of the Gentiles; for certainly the <i>unbelief</i> of the <i>Jews</i> could never produce <i>faith</i> in the <i>Gentiles</i>. The simple state of the case is: the Jews, in the most obstinate and unprincipled manner, rejected Jesus Christ and the salvation offered them in his name; then the apostles <i>turned</i> <i>to the Gentiles</i>, and they heard and believed. The Jews themselves perceived that the Gentiles were to be put in possession of similar privileges to those which they, as the peculiar people of God, had enjoyed; and this they could not bear, and put forth all their strength in opposition and persecution. The <i>calling of the</i> <i>Gentiles</i>, which existed in the original purpose of God, became in a certain way <i>accelerated</i> by the unbelief of the Jews, through which they forfeited all their privileges, and <i>fell</i> from that state of glory and dignity in which they had been long placed as the peculiar people of God.
