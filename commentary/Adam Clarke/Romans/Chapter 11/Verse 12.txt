<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:12">Romans 11:12</span>. <i><b>Now if the fall of them</b></i> — The English reader may imagine that, because <i>fall</i> is used in both these verses, the original word is the same. But <i>their fall</i>, and <i>the fall of them</i>, is παραπτωμα, the same word which we render <i>offence</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17-18">Romans 5:17-18</span>, and might be rendered <i>lapse</i>. Whereas <i>that they should fall</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>) is, ινα πεσωσι. Now, πιπτω, <i>to fall</i>, is used in a sense so very emphatical as to signify <i>being slain</i>. So Homer, Il. viii., ver. 475. </p>
<p><i><b>The riches of the world</b></i> — If, in consequence of their unbelief, the <i>riches</i> of God's grace and goodness be poured out on the whole Gentile world, how much more shall that dispensation of grace and mercy enrich and aggrandize the Gentiles, which shall bring the whole body of the Jews to the faith of the Gospel! Here the apostle supposes, or rather predicts, that such a dispensation shall take place; and that, therefore, the Jews have not so <i>stumbled</i> as to be finally <i>irrecoverable</i>.</p>
