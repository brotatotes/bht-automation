<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>. This and the following verse should be read in a parenthesis. St. Paul, as the apostle of the Gentiles, wished to show them the high pitch of glory and blessedness to which they had been called, that they might have a due sense of God's mercy in calling them to such a state of salvation; and that they might be jealous over themselves, lest they should fall as the Jews had done before them: and he dwells particularly on the greatness of those privileges which the Gentiles had now received, that he might stir up the minds of his countrymen to emulation, and might be the means of <i>saving some of them</i>, as he states in the following verse.</p>
<p><i><b>I magnify mine office</b></i> — This is a very improper translation of την διακονιαν μου δοξαζω, which is, literally, <i>I honour this my</i> <i>ministry</i>. Dr. Taylor has justly observed that <i>magnify</i>, except when applied to the most High, carries with it, in our language, the idea of stretching beyond the bounds of truth; whereas the apostle simply means that he does justice to his ministry, by stating the glorious things which he was commissioned to preach among the Gentiles: blessings which the Jews by their obstinacy had forfeited.</p>
