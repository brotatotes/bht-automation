<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:16">Romans 11:16</span>. <i><b>For if the first fruit</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>holy</b></i> — As the consecrating the first fruits to God was the means of drawing down his blessing upon the rest, so the conversion of Abraham to the true faith, and the several Jews who have now embraced Christianity, are pledges that God will, in process of time, admit the whole Jewish nation into his favour again, so that they shall constitute a part of the visible Church of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>If the root</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>holy, so are the branches.</b></i> — The word <i>holy</i> in this verse is to be taken in that sense which it has so frequently in the Old and New Testaments, viz. <i>consecrated, set apart to</i> <i>sacred uses</i>. It must not be forgotten that the first converts to Christ were from among the <i>Jews</i>; these formed the <i>root</i> of the Christian Church: these were <i>holy</i>, αγιοι, <i>consecrated</i> to God, and those who among the Gentiles were converted by their means were also αγιοι, <i>consecrated</i>; but the chief reference is to the ancestors of the Jewish people, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and, as these were <i>devoted to God</i> and received into his covenant, all their posterity, the <i>branches</i> which proceeded from this <i>root</i>, became entitled to the same privileges: and as the <i>root</i> still remains, and the <i>branches</i> also, the descendants from that root still remain: they still have a certain title to the blessings of the covenant; though, because of their obstinate unbelief, these blessings are suspended, as they cannot, even on the ground of the <i>old covenant</i>, enjoy these blessings but through <i>faith</i>: for it was when Abraham <i>believed</i> God that it was accounted to him for righteousness; and thus he became an heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</p>
