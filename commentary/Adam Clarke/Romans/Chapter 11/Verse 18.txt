<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Boast not against the branches.</b></i> â€” While you are ready to acknowledge that you were included in the covenant made with Abraham, and are now partakers of the same blessings with him, do not <i>exult over</i>, much less <i>insult, the branches</i>, his present descendants, whose place you now fill up, <i>according to the</i> <i>election of grace</i>: for remember, ye are not the <i>root</i>, nor do ye <i>bear the root, but the root bears you</i>. You have not been the <i>means</i> of deriving any blessing on the Jewish people; but through that very people, which you may be tempted to despise, all the blessing and excellencies which you enjoy have been communicated to you.</p>
