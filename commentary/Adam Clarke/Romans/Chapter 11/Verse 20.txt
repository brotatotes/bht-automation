<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Well; because of unbelief</b></i>, c.] This statement is all true but then, consider, <i>why</i> is it that they were <i>cast out</i>? Was it not <i>because</i> of their unbelief? And you stand by <i>faith</i>: you were made partakers of these blessings by faith; be not <i>high-minded</i>; let this humble, not exalt you in your own estimation; for if the blessings were received by <i>faith</i>, consequently not by works; and if not by works, you have no merit; and what you have received is through the mere mercy of God. They once stood by <i>faith</i>; they gave place to <i>unbelief</i>, and fell: you stand now by <i>faith</i>; but it is as possible for you to be unfaithful as it was for them, and consequently <i>you</i> may fall under the Divine displeasure, as <i>they</i> have done; be not high-minded, but fear; watch over yourselves with godly jealousy.</p>
