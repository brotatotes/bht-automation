<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Behold therefore the goodness</b></i> — The exclamation, <i>Behold the goodness of God</i>! is frequent among the Jewish writers, when they wish to call the attention of men to particular displays of God's mercy, especially towards those who are singularly unworthy. See several instances in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And severity of God</b></i> — As χρηστοτης, <i>goodness</i>, signifies the essential quality of the Divine nature, the fountain of all good to men and angels, so αποτομια, <i>severity</i>, as it is here translated, signifies that particular exercise of his <i>goodness</i> and holiness which leads him to sever from his mystical body whatsoever would injure, corrupt, or destroy it. The apostle in these verses uses a metaphor taken from engrafting, εγκεντρισις, from the verb εγκεντριζω, from εν, <i>in</i>, and κεντριζω, <i>to</i> <i>puncture</i>, because engrafting was frequently done by making a <i>puncture</i> in the bark of a tree, and then <i>inserting</i> a <i>bud</i> taken from another. This was the practice in the Roman agriculture, as we learn from Virgil, Georg. ii, ver. 73:- </p>
<p>The apostle, having adopted this metaphor as the best he could find to express that act of God's justice and mercy by which the Jews were rejected, and the Gentiles elected in their stead, and, in order to show that though the Jewish tree <i>was cut down</i>, or its <i>branches lopped off</i>, yet it was not <i>rooted up</i>, he informs the Gentile believers that, as it is <i>customary</i> to insert a <i>good scion</i> <i>in a bad</i> or <i>useless</i> stock, they who were bad, contrary to the custom in such cases, were grafted in a <i>good stock</i>, and their growth and fruitfulness proclaimed the excellence and vegetative life of the stock in which they were inserted. This was the <i>goodness</i> of the heavenly gardener to them; but it was <i>severity</i>, αποτομια, an act of <i>excision</i> to the Jews.</p>
<p>The reader will observe that this term belongs to engrafting: often, in this operation, a part of a <i>branch</i> is cut off; in that part which remains in connection with the tree a little slit is made, and then a small twig or branch taken from another tree is, at its lower end, shaved thin, wedge-like, and then inserted in the cleft, after which the whole is tied together, clayed round, c., and the bark unites to bark and the <i>stock</i> and the <i>scion</i> become thus one tree, the juices of the whole stock circulating through the tubes of the newly-inserted twig; and thus both live, though the branch inserted bears a very different fruit from that which the parent stock bore. I have often performed this operation, and in this very way, with success: and I cannot conceive that the apostle could have chosen a more apt or more elegant metaphor. The <i>Jewish tree</i> does not bring forth proper fruit; but it will answer well to ingraft a proper fruit-bearing tree on. The <i>Gentiles</i> are a <i>wild olive</i>, which is a tree that bears no fruit; but it may be made to bear if grafted on the Jewish <i>stock. Some of the branches were cut off</i>, that the branches of this wild olive might be inserted: the act by which this insertion is made is termed αποτομια, <i>goodness, benignity</i>: the act by which the branches of the original stock are broken off is termed αποτομια, <i>excision</i>; from απο, <i>from</i>, and τεμνω, <i>I cut</i>, still keeping the metaphor taken from engrafting in view. Now, let the apostle's mode of reasoning be observed: the tree is <i>cut down</i>, or its <i>branches lopped off</i>; but the tree is not <i>rooted</i> <i>up</i>. The Jews have stumbled, but not so as to <i>fall</i> irrecoverably; for <i>if they abide not still in unbelief</i>, they shall be grafted in, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:23">Romans 11:23</span>. The Gentiles which are grafted in on these cut-off branches, like the scion inserted into another stock, <i>partake of</i> <i>the root</i>, which absorbs from the earth the nutritious juices, <i>and</i> <i>the fatness</i> of the Jewish tree, the blessings and privileges which that people have long enjoyed, in consequence of the Abrahamic covenant, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:17">Romans 11:17</span>; <i>the root</i>, the Jewish covenant, <i>bears them</i>: not they the <i>root</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:18">Romans 11:18</span>. As, therefore, the continuance of the Gentiles as the Church and people of God depends upon their interest in the Abrahamic covenant, the blessings of which they derive through the medium of the Jews, they should be grateful to God, and tolerant to those through whom they have received such blessings. And as, in the case of grafting, the prosperity of the engrafted scion depends on the existence of the parent stock, so the continuance of the Gentiles in this state of favour, (following the metaphor,) in a certain way depends on the continuance of the Jewish people: and <i>they</i> are preserved, as so many <i>scions</i> which are in process of time to be engrafted on the <i>Gentiles</i>; and thus the <i>Gentiles</i> shall become the <i>means</i> of salvation to the <i>Jews</i>, as the <i>Jews</i> have been the means of salvation to the <i>Gentiles</i>. Following, therefore, the metaphor a little farther, which seems to have been so well chosen in all its parts, the continued existence of the Jews as a distinct people, together with the acknowledgment of the Gentiles, that they have derived their salvation and state of blessedness through them-of which Jesus Christ, born of the stock of David, is the <i>author</i>; and the Jewish <i>Scriptures</i>, which the Gentiles receive as inspired by God, are the <i>evidence</i>-then, the restoration of the Jews to the favour of God is a necessary consequence, and indeed seems to be the principal end in reference to which the apostle reasons. The Gentiles, however, are to take care that the restoration of the Jews be not at <i>their</i> expense; as <i>their</i> calling and election were at the expense of the <i>Jews</i>: the <i>latter</i> being cut off, that the <i>former</i> might be grafted in, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:19">Romans 11:19</span>. Of this there is no kind of necessity, for the original stock, the Abrahamic covenant, is sufficient to receive them all; and so Jews and Gentiles become one eternal flock, under one Bishop and Shepherd of all their souls.</p>
