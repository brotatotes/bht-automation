<p>Verse 23. <i><b>If they abide not in unbelief</b></i> — So, we find that their rejection took place in consequence of their <i>wilful</i> obstinacy: and, that they <i>may</i> return into the fold, the door of which still stands open.</p>
<p><i><b>For God is able to graft them in again.</b></i> — Fallen as they are and degraded, God can, in the course of his providence and mercy, restore them to all their forfeited privileges; and this will take place if <i>they abide not in unbelief</i>: which intimates that God has furnished them with all the <i>power</i> and <i>means</i> necessary for <i>faith</i>, and that they <i>may believe</i> on the Lord Jesus whenever they will. The <i>veil</i> now continues on their heart; but it is not a veil which God has spread there, but a veil occasioned by their own voluntary and obstinate unbelief: and, when they shall turn to the Lord, (Jesus,) the veil shall be taken away.
