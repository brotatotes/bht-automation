<p>Verse 26. <i><b>And so all Israel shall be saved</b></i> — Shall be brought <i>into the way of salvation</i>, by acknowledging the Messiah; for the word certainly does not mean eternal glory; for no man can conceive that a time will ever come in which every Jew then living, shall be taken to the <i>kingdom of glory</i>. The term <i>saved</i>, as applied to the Israelites in different parts of the Scripture, signifies no more than <i>their being gathered out of the nations of</i> <i>the world, separated to God</i>, and <i>possessed of the high privilege</i> <i>of being his peculiar people</i>. And we know that this is the meaning of the term, by finding it applied to the body of the Israelites when this alone was the sum of their state. See the <i>Preface</i>, page viii, c.</p>
<p><i><b>As it is written</b></i> — The apostle supports what he advances on this head by a quotation from Scripture, which, in the main, is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:20">Isaiah 59:20</span>: The Deliverer shall come out of Zion, and turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Now this cannot be understood of the manifestation of Christ among the Jews or of the multitudes which were converted <i>before, at</i>, and for some time <i>after</i>, the day of pentecost; for these times were all <i>past</i> when the apostle wrote this epistle, which was probably about the 57th or 58th year of our Lord; and, as no remarkable conversion of that people has since taken place, therefore the fulfilment of this prophecy <i>is yet to take place</i>. In what manner Christ <i>is to come</i> <i>out of Zion</i>, and in what <i>way</i> or by what <i>means</i> he is to <i>turn</i> <i>away transgression from Jacob</i>, we cannot tell; and to attempt to <i>conjecture</i>, when the time, occasion, means, &amp;c., are all in <i>mystery</i>, would be more than reprehensible.</p>
