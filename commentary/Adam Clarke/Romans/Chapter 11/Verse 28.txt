<p>Verse 28. <i><b>As concerning the Gospel</b></i> â€” The unbelieving Jews, with regard to the <i>Gospel</i> which they have rejected, are at present <i>enemies</i> to God, and aliens from his kingdom, under his Son Jesus Christ, on account of that extensive grace which has overturned their <i>peculiarity</i>, by admitting the Gentiles into his Church and family: but with regard to the original purpose of <i>election</i>, whereby they were chosen and separated from all the people of the earth to be the peculiar people of God, <i>they are beloved for the</i> <i>fathers' sake</i>; he has still favour in store for them on account of their <i>forefathers</i> the <i>patriarchs</i>.</p>
