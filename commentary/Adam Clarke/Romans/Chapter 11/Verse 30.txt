<p>Verse 30. <i><b>For as ye in times past</b></i> — The apostle pursues his argument in favour of the restoration of the Jews. <i>As ye</i>, Gentiles, <i>in times past</i>-for many ages back.</p>
<p><i><b>Have not believed</b></i> — Were in a state of alienation from God, <i>yet</i> not so as to be totally and for ever excluded,</p>
<p><i><b>Have now obtained mercy</b></i> — For ye are now taken into the kingdom of the Messiah; through <i>their unbelief</i>-by that method which, in destroying the Jewish <i>peculiarity</i>, and fulfilling the Abrahamic covenant, has occasioned the unbelief and obstinate opposition of the Jews.</p>
