<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Even so have these also</b></i> — In like manner the Jews are, through their infidelity, shut out of the kingdom of God:-</p>
<p><i><b>That through your mercy</b></i> — But this exclusion will not be <i>everlasting</i>; but this will serve to open a new scene when, through farther displays of mercy to you Gentiles, <i>they also may obtain</i> <i>mercy </i>- shall be received into the kingdom of God again; and this shall take place whenever they shall consent to acknowledge the Lord Jesus, and see it their privilege to be fellow heirs with the Gentiles of the grace of life.</p>
<p>As sure, therefore, as the Jews were <i>once</i> in the kingdom, and the Gentiles were not; as sure as the Gentiles <i>are now</i> in the kingdom, and the Jews are not; so surely will the Jews be brought back into that kingdom.</p>
