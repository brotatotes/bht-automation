<p>Verse 32. <i><b>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief</b></i> — Συνεκλεισε γαρ ὁ Θεος, God hath <i>shut</i> or <i>locked</i> them all up under unbelief. This refers to the guilty state of both Jews and Gentiles. They had all broken God's law-the Jews, the written law; the Gentiles, the law written in their hearts; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19">Romans 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>. They are represented here as having been <i>accused</i> if their transgressions; <i>tried</i> at God's bar; found guilty on being tried; <i>condemned</i> to the death they had merited; <i>remanded</i> to prison, till the sovereign will, relative to their execution, should be announced; <i>shut</i> or <i>locked up</i>, under the jailer, <i>unbelief</i>; and there both continued in the same state, awaiting the execution of their sentence: but God, in his own compassion, moved by no merit in either party, caused a <i>general pardon</i> by the Gospel to be proclaimed to <i>all</i>. The Jews have refused to receive this pardon on the terms which God has proposed it, and therefore continue <i>locked up</i> under <i>unbelief</i>. The <i>Gentiles</i> have welcomed the offers of grace, and are delivered out of their prison. But, as the offers of mercy continue to be made to all indiscriminately, the time will come when the Jews, seeing the vast accession of the Gentile world to the kingdom of the Messiah, and the glorious privileges which they in consequence enjoy, shall also lay hold on the hope set before them, and thus become with the Gentiles one flock under one shepherd and bishop of all their souls. The same figure is used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:22">Galatians 3:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>. <i>But the Scripture hath concluded</i> συνεκλεισεν, locked up <i>all under</i> <i>sin, that the promise, by faith of Christ Jesus, might be given to</i> <i>them that believe. But before faith came, we were kept</i>, εφρουρουμεθα, we were guarded as in a strong hold, <i>under the law;</i> <i>shut up</i>, συγκεκλεισμενοι, locked up together <i>unto the faith which</i> should afterwards be revealed. It is a fine and well chosen metaphor in both places, and forcibly expresses the guilty, helpless, wretched state of both <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
