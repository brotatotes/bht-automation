<p>Verse 33. <i><b>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and</b></i><b> </b><i><b>knowledge of God!</b></i> â€” This is a very proper conclusion of the whole preceding discourse. <i>Wisdom</i> may here refer to the <i>designs</i> of God; <i>knowledge</i>, to the <i>means</i> which he employs to accomplish these designs. The <i>designs</i> are the offspring of infinite wisdom, and therefore they are all right; the <i>means</i> are the most proper, as being the choice of an infinite knowledge that cannot err; we may safely credit the goodness of the <i>design</i>, founded in infinite <i>wisdom</i>; we may rely on the due accomplishment of the <i>end</i>, because the <i>means</i> are chosen and applied by infinite knowledge and skill.</p>
