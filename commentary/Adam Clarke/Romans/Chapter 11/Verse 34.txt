<p>Verse 34. <i><b>For who hath known the mind of the Lord?</b></i> â€” Who can pretend to penetrate the counsels of God, or fathom the reasons of his conduct? His designs and his counsels are like himself, <i>infinite</i>; and, consequently, inscrutable. It is strange that, with such a scripture as this before their eyes, men should sit down and coolly and positively write about counsels and decrees of God formed from all eternity, of which they speak with as much confidence and decision as if <i>they</i> had formed a part of the council of the Most High, and had been with him in the beginning of his ways! A certain writer, (Mr. Perkins,) after having entered into all these counsels, and drawn out his <i>black-lined</i> scheme of absolute <i>and eternal reprobation</i>, with all its causes and effects; and then his <i>light-lined</i> scheme of absolute and eternal ELECTION, with all its causes and effects, all deduced in the most regular and graduated order, link by link; concludes with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>: <i>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!</i> <i>how</i> UNSEARCHABLE <i>are his judgments, and his ways</i> PAST FINDING OUT! But this writer forgot that <i>he</i> had <i>searched out God's judgments</i> in the one case, and <i>found out his ways</i> in the other: and that he had given, as a proof of the success of his researches, a complete exhibition of the <i>whole scheme</i>! This conduct is worthy of more than mere reprehension; and yet he who differs from such opinions gives, in the apprehension of some, this proof of his being included in some of the links of the <i>black list</i>! We may rest with the conviction, that God is as <i>merciful</i> and <i>good</i> in all his ways, as he is <i>wise</i> and <i>just</i>. But as we cannot comprehend him, neither can we his operations, it is our place, who are the objects of his infinite mercy and kindness, to adore in silence, and to obey with alacrity and delight.</p>
