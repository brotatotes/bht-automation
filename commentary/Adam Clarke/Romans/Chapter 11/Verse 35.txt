<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:35">Romans 11:35</span>. <i><b>Or, who hath first given to him</b></i> â€” Who can pretend to have any <i>demands</i> upon God? To whom is he <i>indebted</i>? Have either Jews or Gentiles any <i>right</i> to his blessings? May not he bestow his favours <i>as</i> he pleases, and to <i>whom</i> he pleases? Does he do any injustice to the <i>Jews</i> in choosing the <i>Gentiles</i>! And was it because he was under obligation to the <i>Gentiles</i> that he has chosen them in the place of the <i>Jews</i>? Let him who has any <i>claim</i> on God prefer it; and he shall be <i>compensated</i>.</p>
<p>But how can the CREATOR be indebted to the <i>creature</i>? How can the CAUSE be dependent on the <i>effect</i>? How can the AUTHOR of <i>providence</i>, and the FATHER <i>of every good and perfect gift</i>, be under obligation to <i>them</i> for whom he provides, and who are wholly <i>dependent</i> on his bounty?</p>
