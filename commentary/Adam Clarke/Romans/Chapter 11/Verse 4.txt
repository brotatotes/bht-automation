<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:4">Romans 11:4</span>. <i><b>But what saith the answer of God</b></i> — The answer which God made assured him that there were <i>seven thousand</i>, that is, <i>several</i> or <i>many thousands</i>; for so we must understand the word <i>seven</i>, a <i>certain</i> for an <i>uncertain</i> number. These had continued faithful to God; but, because of Jezebel's persecution, they were obliged to <i>conceal</i> their attachment to the true religion; and God, in his providence, preserved them from her sanguinary rage.</p>
<p><i><b>Who have not bowed the knee</b></i> — Baal was the god of Jezebel; or, in other words, his worship was then the worship of the <i>state</i>; but there were several thousands of pious Israelites who had not acknowledged this idol, and did not partake in the idolatrous worship.</p>
