<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:5">Romans 11:5</span>. <i><b>Even so then at this present time</b></i> — As in the present day the irreligion of the Jews is very great; yet there is a <i>remnant</i>, a considerable number, who have accepted of the grace of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the election of grace.</b></i> — And these are saved just as God has saved all believers from the beginning; they are chosen by his <i>grace</i>, not on account of any <i>worth</i> or <i>excellence</i> in themselves, but through his goodness are they chosen to have a place in his Church, and continue to be his people, entitled to all the privileges of the new covenant. The <i>election of grace</i> simply signifies God's gracious design in sending the Christian system into the world, and saving under it all those who believe in Christ Jesus, and none else. Thus the believers in Christ are <i>chosen</i> to inherit the blessings of the Gospel, while those who seek justification by the works of the law are <i>rejected</i>.</p>
