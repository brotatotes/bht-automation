<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span>. <i><b>And if by grace</b></i> — And let this very remnant of pious Jews, who have believed in Christ Jesus, know that <i>they</i> are brought in, precisely in the same way as God has brought in the <i>Gentiles</i>; the one having no more <i>worthiness</i> to plead than the other; <i>both</i> being brought in, and continued in by God's free grace, and not by any observance of the Mosaic law.</p>
<p>And this is done <i>according to the election of grace</i>, or the <i>rule</i> of choosing any persons to be the people of God upon the footing of grace; which takes in all that <i>believe</i> in his Son Jesus Christ: some of the Jewish people did so believe; therefore those believing Jews are a <i>remnant according to the election of grace</i>. They are saved in that way in which alone God will save mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>And if by grace</b></i> — Then let these very persons remember, that their election and interest in the covenant of God has no connection with their <i>old Jewish works</i>; for were it of <i>works,</i> <i>grace</i> would lose its proper nature, and cease to be what it is-<i>a</i> <i>free undeserved gift</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But if</b></i><b> it be </b><i><b>of works</b></i> — On the other hand, could it be made to appear that they are invested in these privileges of the kingdom of Christ only by the <i>observance of the law of Moses</i>, then GRACE would be quite set aside; and if it were not, <i>work</i>, or the <i>merit</i> <i>of obedience</i>, would lose its proper nature, which excludes <i>favour</i> and <i>free gift</i>. But it is not, and cannot be, of WORKS; for those very Jews who now believe, and are happy in the <i>grace</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ, are so <i>according to the election of grace</i>, which does not mean a particular act of God's sovereignty, which has singled out some of the Jews who deserved to have been cast off as well as the rest; but it is that general scheme of grace, according to which God purposed to take into his Church and kingdom any, among either Jews or Gentiles, who should believe on Christ. And the <i>remnant</i> here mentioned were not <i>selected</i> from their countrymen by such a <i>sovereign</i> act of God's grace as might have taken in the whole if it had so pleased; but they were admitted into and received the privileges of the Messiah's kingdom, <i>because they believed on the Lord Jesus</i>, and received him as their <i>only Saviour</i>; and thus came into that <i>scheme of election</i> which God had appointed. And we may observe, farther, that out of this election <i>they</i> as well as the <i>others</i> would have been excluded, had <i>they</i> like the <i>rest</i> remained in unbelief; and into this <i>election of grace</i> all the Jews, to a man, notwithstanding they were all sinners, would have been taken, had they believed in Christ Jesus. This is the true notion of the <i>election of grace</i>. See <i>Taylor</i>.</p>
