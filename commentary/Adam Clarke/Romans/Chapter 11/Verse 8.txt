<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8">Romans 11:8</span>. <i><b>God hath given them the spirit of slumber</b></i> â€” As they had <i>wilfully</i> closed their eyes against the light, so God has, in judgment, given them up to the <i>spirit of slumber</i>. The very word and revelation of God, which should have awakened their consciences, and opened their eyes and ears, have had a very different effect; and because <i>they did not receive the truth in</i> <i>the love thereof</i>, that which would otherwise have been the <i>savour</i> <i>of life unto life</i>, has become the <i>savour of death unto death</i>; and this continues to the present day.</p>
