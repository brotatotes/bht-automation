Verse Romans 11:9. And David saith, Let their table, c.] And from their present disposition it is reasonable to conclude that the same evils will fall upon them as fell upon the disobedient in former times, as predicted by David, Psalms 69:22, Psalms 69:23,that their very blessings should become curses to them, and their temporal mercies be their only recompense and yet even these earthly blessings, by not being enjoyed in the Lord, should be a stumbling block over which they should fall, and, instead of being a blessing, should be the means of their punishment. They would have a worldly Messiah, and therefore they rejected him whose kingdom was not of this world.
