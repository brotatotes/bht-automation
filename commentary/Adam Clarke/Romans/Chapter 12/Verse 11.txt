<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:11">Romans 12:11</span>. <i><b>Not slothful in business</b></i> — That God, who <i>forbade</i> working on the <i>seventh</i> day, has, by the same authority, <i>enjoined</i> it on the other <i>six days</i>. He who neglects to labour during the <i>week</i> is as culpable as he is who works on the <i>Sabbath</i>. An idle, slothful person can never be a Christian.</p>
<p><i><b>Fervent in spirit</b></i> — τω πνευματι ζεοντεςυ Do nothing at any time but what is to tho glory of God, and do every thing as unto him; and in every thing let your <i>hearts</i> be engaged. Be always in <i>earnest</i>, and let your <i>heart</i> ever accompany your hand.</p>
<p><i><b>Serving the Lord</b></i> — Ever considering that his eye is upon you, and that you are accountable to him for all that you do, and that you should do every thing so as to please him. In order to this there must be <i>simplicity</i> in the INTENTION, and <i>purity</i> in the AFFECTIONS.</p>
<p>Instead of τω Κυριω δουλευοντες, <i>serving the Lord</i>, several MSS., as DFG, and many editions, have τω καιρω δουλευοντες, <i>serving</i> <i>the time</i>-embracing the opportunity. This reading <i>Griesbach</i> has received into the text, and most critics contend for its authenticity. Except the Codes <i>Claromontanus</i>, the Codex <i>Augiensis</i>, and the Codex <i>Boernerianus</i>, the first a MS. of the seventh or eighth century, the others of the ninth or tenth, marked in Griesbach by the letters DFG, all the other MSS. of this epistle have Κυριω, <i>the Lord</i>; a reading in which all the <i>versions</i> concur. Καιρω, <i>the time</i>, is not found in the two <i>original</i> <i>editions</i>; that of <i>Complutum</i>, in 1514, which is the <i>first</i> edition of the Greek Testament ever <i>printed</i>; and that of <i>Erasmus</i>, in 1516, which is the first edition <i>published</i>; the former having been suppressed for several years after it was finished at the press. As in the ancient MSS. the word Κυριω is written <i>contractedly</i>, ΚΩ, some appear to have read it καιρω instead of Κυριω; but I confess I do not see sufficient reason after all that the critics have said, to depart from the common reading.</p>
