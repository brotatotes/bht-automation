Rejoicing in hope — Of that glory of God that to each faithful follower of Christ shall shortly be revealed.Patient in tribulation — Remembering that what you suffer as Christians you suffer for Christ's sake; and it is to his honour, and the honour of your Christian profession, that you suffer it with an even mind.Continuing instant in prayer — ηροσκαρτερουντες. Making the most fervent and intense application to the throne of grace for the light and power of the Holy Spirit; without which you can neither abhor evil, do good, love the brethren, entertain a comfortable hope, nor bear up patiently under the tribulations and ills of life.
