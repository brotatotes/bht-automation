<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:12">Romans 12:12</span>. <i><b>Rejoicing in hope</b></i> — Of that glory of God that to each faithful follower of Christ shall shortly be revealed.</p>
<p><i><b>Patient in tribulation</b></i> — Remembering that what you suffer as Christians you suffer for Christ's sake; and it is to his honour, and the honour of your Christian profession, that you suffer it with an even mind.</p>
<p><i><b>Continuing instant in prayer</b></i> — ηροσκαρτερουντες. Making the most fervent and intense application to the throne of grace for the light and power of the Holy Spirit; without which you can neither <i>abhor evil, do good, love the brethren</i>, entertain a comfortable <i>hope</i>, nor bear up patiently under the <i>tribulations</i> and ills of life.</p>
