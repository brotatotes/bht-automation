<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:13">Romans 12:13</span>. <i><b>Distributing to the necessity of saints</b></i> — Relieve your poor brethren according to the power which God has given you. Do good unto all men, but especially to them which are of the household of faith. Instead of χρειαις, <i>necessities</i>, some ancient MSS. have μνειαις, <i>memorials</i>; distributing to the memorials of the saints, which some interpret as referring to saints that were <i>absent</i>; as if he had said: Do not <i>forget</i> those in other Churches who have a claim on your bounty. But I really cannot see any good sense which this various reading can make in the text; I therefore follow the common reading.</p>
<p><i><b>Given to hospitality.</b></i> — την φιλοξενιαν διωκοντες, <i>pursuing</i> <i>hospitality</i>, or the duty of <i>entertaining strangers</i>. A very necessary virtue in ancient times, when houses of public accommodation were exceedingly scarce. This exhortation might have for its object the apostles, who were all itinerants; and in many cases the Christians, flying before the face of persecution. This virtue is highly becoming in all Christians, and especially in all Christian <i>ministers</i>, who have the <i>means</i> of relieving a brother in distress, or of succouring the poor wherever he may find them. But providing for <i>strangers</i> in <i>distress</i> is the proper meaning of the term; and to be <i>forward</i> to do this is the <i>spirit</i> of the duty.</p>
