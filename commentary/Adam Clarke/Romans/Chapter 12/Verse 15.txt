<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:15">Romans 12:15</span>. <i><b>Rejoice with them that do rejoice</b></i> — Take a lively interest in the prosperity of others. Let it be a matter of rejoicing to you when you hear of the health, prosperity, or happiness of any brother.</p>
<p><i><b>Weep with them that weep.</b></i> — Labour after a <i>compassionate</i> or <i>sympathizing</i> mind. Let your heart feel for the distressed; enter into their sorrows, and bear a part of their burdens. It is a fact, attested by universal experience, that by sympathy a man may receive into his own affectionate feelings a measure of the distress of his friend, and that his friend does find himself relieved in the same proportion as the other has entered into his griefs. "But how do you account for this?" I do not account for it at all, it depends upon certain laws of nature, the principles of which have not been as yet duly developed.</p>
