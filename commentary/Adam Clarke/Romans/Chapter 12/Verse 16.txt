<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:16">Romans 12:16</span>. <b> Be </b><i><b>of the same mind</b></i> — Live in a state of continual harmony and concord, and pray for the same good for all which you desire for yourselves.</p>
<p><i><b>Mind not high things</b></i> — Be not ambitious; affect nothing above your station; do not court the rich nor the powerful; do not pass by the <i>poor man</i> to pay your court to the <i>great man</i>; do not affect <i>titles</i> or worldly <i>distinctions</i>; much less sacrifice your conscience for them. The attachment to <i>high things</i> and <i>high men</i> is the vice of <i>little, shallow minds</i>. However, it argues one important fact, that such persons are conscious that they are of <i>no worth</i> and of <i>no consequence</i> in THEMSELVES, and they seek to render themselves observable and to gain a little credit by their endeavours to <i>associate</i> themselves with men of <i>rank</i> and <i>fortune</i>, and if possible to get into honourable <i>employments</i>; and, if this cannot be attained, they affect honourable TITLES.</p>
<p><i><b>But condescend to men of low estate.</b></i> — Be a companion of the humble, and pass through life with as little noise and <i>show</i> as possible. Let the poor, godly man be your chief companion; and learn from his humility and piety to be humble and godly. The term συναπαγομενοι, which we translate <i>condescend</i>, from συν, <i>together</i>, and απαγω, <i>to lead</i>, signifies <i>to be led, carried</i>, or <i>dragged away to prison</i> with <i>another</i>; and points out the state in which the primitive Christians were despised and rejected of men, and often led forth to prison and death. False or man-pleasing professors would endeavour to escape all this disgrace and danger by getting into the favour of the great, the worldly, and the irreligious. There have not been wanting, in all ages of the Church, persons who, losing the savour of Divine things from their own souls by drinking into a worldly spirit, have endeavoured to shun the reproach of the cross by renouncing the company of the godly, speaking evil of the way of life, and perhaps sitting down in the chair of the scorner with apostates like themselves. And yet, strange to tell, these men will keep up a form of godliness! for a decent outside is often necessary to enable them to secure the ends of their ambition.</p>
<p><i><b>Be not wise in your own conceits.</b></i> — Be not puffed up with an opinion of your own consequence; for this will prove that the consequence itself is <i>imaginary. Be not wise</i>, παρ εαυτοις, <i>by</i> <i>yourselves</i>-do not suppose that wisdom and discernment dwell alone with <i>you</i>. Believe that you stand in need both of help and instruction from others.</p>
