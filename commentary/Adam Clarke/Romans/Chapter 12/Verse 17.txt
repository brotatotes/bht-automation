Verse 17. Recompense, c.] Do not take notice of every little injury you may sustain. Do not be litigious. Beware of too nice a sense of your own honour intolerable pride is at the bottom of this. The motto of the royal arms of Scotland is in direct opposition to this Divine direction-Nemo me impune lacesset, of which "I render evil for evil to every man," is a pretty literal translation. This is both antichristian and abominable, whether in a state or in an individual.Provide things honest â€” Be prudent, be cautious, neither eat, drink, nor wear, but as you pay for every thing. "Live not on trust, for that is the way to pay double;" and by this means the poor are still kept poor. He who takes credit, even for food or raiment, when he has no probable means of defraying the debt, is a dishonest man. It is no sin to die through lack of the necessaries of life when the providence of God has denied the means of support; but it is a sin to take up goods without the probability of being able to pay for them. Poor man! suffer poverty a little; perhaps God is only trying thee for a time; and who can tell if he will not turn again thy captivity. Labour hard to live honestly; if God still appear to withhold his providential blessing, do not despair; leave it all to him; do not make a sinful choice; he cannot err. He will bless thy poverty, while he curses the ungodly man's blessings.
