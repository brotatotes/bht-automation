<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Recompense</b></i>, c.] Do not take notice of every little injury you may sustain. Do not be <i>litigious</i>. Beware of too nice a sense of your own honour intolerable pride is at the bottom of this. The motto of the royal arms of Scotland is in direct opposition to this Divine direction-<i>Nemo me impune lacesset</i>, of which "I render evil for evil to every man," is a pretty literal translation. This is both antichristian and abominable, whether in a <i>state</i> or in an <i>individual</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Provide things honest</b></i> â€” Be prudent, be cautious, neither <i>eat,</i> <i>drink</i>, nor <i>wear</i>, but as you pay for every thing. "Live not on <i>trust</i>, for that is the way to pay double;" and by this means the <i>poor</i> are still kept <i>poor</i>. He who <i>takes credit</i>, even for food or raiment, when he has no probable means of defraying the debt, is a <i>dishonest</i> man. It is no sin to die through lack of the necessaries of life when the providence of God has denied the means of support; but it is a <i>sin</i> to take up goods without the probability of being able to pay for them. Poor man! suffer poverty a little; perhaps God is only trying thee for a time; and who can tell if he will not turn again thy captivity. Labour hard to live honestly; if God still appear to withhold his providential blessing, do not despair; leave it all to him; do not make a sinful choice; he cannot err. He will bless <i>thy</i> poverty, while he curses the ungodly man's blessings.</p>
