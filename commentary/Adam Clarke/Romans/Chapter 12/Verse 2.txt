<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</span>. <i><b>And be not conformed to this world</b></i> — By <i>this world</i>, αιωνιτουτω, may be understood that <i>present state</i> of things both among the Jews and Gentiles; the customs and fashions of the people who then <i>lived</i>, the Gentiles particularly, who had neither the <i>power</i> nor the <i>form</i> of godliness; though some think that the Jewish economy, frequently termed עולם הזה <i>olam hazzeh</i>, this world, this peculiar state of things, is alone intended. And the apostle warns them against reviving usages that Christ had abolished: this exhortation still continues in full force. The world that <i>now is</i>-THIS <i>present state of things</i>, is as much opposed to the spirit of genuine Christianity as the world <i>then</i> was. Pride, luxury, vanity, extravagance in dress, and riotous living, prevail <i>now</i>, as they did <i>then</i>, and are as unworthy of a Christian's pursuit as they are injurious to his soul, and hateful in the sight of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Be ye transformed</b></i> — μεταμορφουσθε, <i>Be ye metamorphosed,</i> <i>transfigured</i>, appear as <i>new persons</i>, and with <i>new habits</i>, as God has given you a new form of worship, so that ye serve in the newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. The word implies a <i>radical, thorough</i>, and <i>universal change</i>, both <i>outward</i> and <i>inward</i>. SENECA, <i>Epis</i>. vi, shows us the force of this word when used in a moral sense. <i>Sentio</i>, says he, <i>non</i> EMENDARI <i>me</i> <i>tantum, sed</i> TRANSFIGURARI; "I perceive myself not to be amended merely, but to be transformed:" i. e entirely renewed.</p>
<p><i><b>By the renewing of your mind</b></i> — Let the inward change produce the outward. Where the <i>spirit</i>, the temper, and disposition of <i>the</i> <i>mind</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:23">Ephesians 4:23</span>, are not <i>renewed</i>, an outward change is of but <i>little worth</i>, and but of <i>short standing</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye may prove</b></i> — εις το δοκιμαζειν, That ye may have <i>practical proof</i> and <i>experimental knowledge of, the will of God</i>-of his purpose and determination, which is <i>good</i> in itself; infinitely so. <i>Acceptable</i>, ευαπεστον, <i>well pleasing</i> to and <i>well received</i> by every mind that is renewed and transformed.</p>
<p><i><b>And perfect</b></i> — τελειον, Finished and complete: when the mind is renewed, and the whole life changed, then the will of God is perfectly fulfilled; for this is its grand design in reference to every human being.</p>
<p>These words are supposed by <i>Schoettgen</i> to refer entirely to the <i>Jewish</i> law. The Christians were to renounce <i>this world</i>-the Jewish state of things; to be <i>transformed</i>, by having their minds enlightened in the pure and simple Christian worship, that they might prove the grand characteristic difference between the two covenants: the latter being <i>good</i> in opposition to the <i>statutes</i> which were not <i>good</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:25">Ezekiel 20:25</span>; <i>acceptable</i>, in opposition to those sacrifices and offerings which God <i>would not accept</i>, as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6-8">Psalms 40:6-8</span>; and perfect, in opposition to that system which was <i>imperfect</i>, and which made nothing perfect, and was only the <i>shadow of good things to come</i>. There are both ingenuity and probability in this view of the subject.</p>
