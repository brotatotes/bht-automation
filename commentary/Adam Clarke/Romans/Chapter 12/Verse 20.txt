<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:20">Romans 12:20</span>. <i><b>If thine enemy hunger, feed him</b></i> â€” Do not withhold from any man the offices of mercy and kindness; <i>you</i> have been God's enemy, and yet God fed, clothed, and preserved you alive: do to your enemy as God has done to you. If your enemy be hungry, feed him; if he be thirsty, give him drink: so has God dealt with you. And has not a sense of his goodness and long-suffering towards you been a means of melting down your heart into penitential compunction, gratitude, and love towards him? How know you that a similar conduct towards <i>your</i> enemy may not have the same gracious influence on him towards you? Your kindness may be the means of begetting in him a sense of his guilt; and, from being your <i>fell enemy</i>, he may become your <i>real friend</i>! This I believe to be the sense of this passage, which many have encumbered with difficulties of their own creating. The whole is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:21">Proverbs 25:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:22">Proverbs 25:22</span>, in the precise words of the <i>Septuagint</i>; and it is very likely that the latter clause of this verse, <i>Thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head</i>, is a metaphor taken from <i>smelting metals</i>. The <i>ore</i> is put into the furnace, and fire put both <i>under</i> and <i>over</i>, that the metal may be liquefied, and, leaving the scoriae and dross, may fall down pure to the bottom of the furnace. This is beautifully expressed by one of our own poets, in reference to this explanation of this passage:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "So artists <i>melt</i> the <i>sullen</i> ore of <i>lead</i>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> By <i>heaping coals of fire upon its head</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> In the <i>kind warmth</i> the metal learns to <i>glow</i>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And <i>pure from dross</i> the silver <i>runs below</i>." </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>It is most evident, from the whole connection of the place and the apostle's use of it, that the <i>heaping of the coals of fire</i> <i>upon the head of the enemy</i> is intended to produce not an <i>evil</i>, but the most <i>beneficial effect</i>; and the following verse is an additional proof of this.</p>
