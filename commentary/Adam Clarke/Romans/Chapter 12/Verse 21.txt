<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:21">Romans 12:21</span>. <i><b>Be not overcome of evil</b></i> â€” Do not, by giving place to evil, become precisely the same character which thou condemnest in another. <i>Overcome evil with good</i> - however frequently he may grieve and injure thee, always repay him with kindness; thy good-will, in the end, may overcome his evil.</p>
<p>1. THOMAS AQUINAS has properly said: <i>Vincitur a malo qui vult</i> <i>peccare in alium, quia ille peccavit in ipsum</i>. "He is overcome of evil who sins against another, because he sins against him." A moral enemy is more easily overcome by <i>kindness</i> than by <i>hostility</i>. Against the latter he arms himself; and all the evil passions of his heart concentrate themselves in opposition to him who is striving to retaliate, by violence, the injurious acts which he has received from him. But where the injured man is labouring to do him <i>good</i> for his <i>evil</i> - to repay his <i>curses</i> with <i>blessings</i> and <i>prayers</i>, his evil passions have no longer any motive, any incentive; his mind relaxes; the turbulence of his passions is calmed; reason and conscience are permitted to speak; he is disarmed, or, in other words, he finds that he has no use for his weapons; he beholds in the injured man a magnanimous friend whose mind is superior to all the insults and injuries which he has received, and who is determined never to permit the heavenly principle that influences his soul to bow itself before the miserable, mean, and wretched spirit of revenge. This amiable man views in his enemy a spirit which he beholds with horror, and he cannot consent to receive into his own bosom a disposition which he sees to be so destructive to another; and he knows that as soon as he begins to <i>avenge</i> himself, he places himself on a <i>par</i> with the unprincipled man whose <i>conduct</i> he has so much reason to blame, and whose <i>spirit</i> he has so much cause to abominate. He who avenges himself receives into his own heart all the evil and disgraceful passions by which his enemy is rendered both wretched and contemptible. There is the voice of <i>eternal reason</i> in "Avenge not yourselves: - overcome evil with good;" as well as the high authority and command of the living God.</p>
<p>2. The reader will, no doubt, have observed with pleasure the skill and address, as well as the Divine wisdom, with which the apostle has handled the important subjects which he has brought forth to view in the preceding chapters. Nothing can be more regular or judicious than his plan of proceeding. He <i>first</i> shows the <i>miserable, wretched, fallen, degraded state of man; next</i>, the <i>merciful provision</i> which God has made for his salvation, and <i>lastly</i>, the use which man should make of the mercies of his God. He shows us, in a most pointed manner, the <i>connection</i> that subsists between the <i>doctrines</i> of the Gospel and <i>practical piety</i>. From the beginning of the first to the end of the <i>eleventh</i> chapter he states and defends the grand truths of Christianity, and from the beginning of the twelfth to the end of the epistle he shows the practical use of these doctrines. This is a point which is rarely considered by professors; multitudes run to the Epistle to the Romans for texts to prop up their peculiar system of doctrine, but how few go to this sacred book for <i>rules</i> relative to <i>holy</i> <i>life</i>! They abound in quotations from the doctrinal parts, but seldom make that use of them which the apostle makes in this chapter. "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world, &amp;c." Now we learn from the <i>use</i> which the apostle makes of his doctrines, that whatsoever teaching comes from God leads to a holy and useful life. And if we hold any doctrine that does not excite us to labour after the strictest conformity to the will of God in all our tempers, spirit, and actions, we may rest assured that either that doctrine is not of God, or we make an improper use of it. He that knows God best, loves and resembles him most.</p>
