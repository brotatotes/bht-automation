<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:3">Romans 12:3</span>. <i><b>Through the grace given unto me</b></i> — By the grace given St. Paul most certainly means his apostolical <i>office</i>, by which he had the <i>authority</i>, not only to preach the Gospel, but also to rule the Church of Christ. This is the meaning of the word, η χαρις, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>: <i>Unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace</i> <i>given</i> - is conceded this <i>office</i> or <i>employment</i> immediately by God himself; <i>that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable</i> <i>riches of Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Not to think - more highly</b></i> — μη υπερφρονειν, Not <i>to act proudly</i>; to arrogate nothing to himself on account of any grace he had received, or of any office committed to him.</p>
<p><i><b>But to think soberly</b></i> — αλλα φρονειν εις το σωφρονειν. The reader will perceive here a sort of <i>paronomasia</i>, or play upon words: φρονειν, from φρην, the <i>mind</i>, signifies to <i>think, mind,</i> <i>relish, to be of opinion</i>, c. and σωφρονειν from σοος, <i>sound,</i> and φρην, the <i>mind</i>, signifies to be of a <i>sound mind</i>; to <i>think</i> <i>discreetly, modestly, humbly</i>. Let no man think himself more or greater than God has made him; and let him know that what ever he <i>is</i> or <i>has</i> of good or excellence, he has it <i>from God</i>; and that the glory belongs to the giver, and not to him who has received the gift.</p>
<p><i><b>Measure of faith.</b></i> — μετρον πιστεως. It is very likely, as Dr. Moore has conjectured, that the πιστις, <i>faith</i>, here used, means the Christian religion; and the <i>measure</i>, the degree of <i>knowledge</i> and <i>experience</i> which each had received in it, and the power this gave him of being useful in the Church of God.
