<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:5">Romans 12:5</span>. <i><b>So we, being many</b></i> â€” We who are members of the Church of Christ, which is considered the <i>body</i> of which he is the <i>head</i>, have various offices assigned to us, according to the measure of grace, faith and religious knowledge which we possess; and although each has a different office, and qualifications suitable to that office, yet all belong to the <i>same body</i>; and each has as much need of the help of another as that other has of his; therefore, let there be neither <i>pride</i> on the one hand, nor <i>envy</i> on the other. The same metaphor, in nearly the same words, is used in <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, page 13. "As man is divided into various members and joints, united among themselves, and raised by gradations above each other, and collectively compose one body; so all created things are members orderly disposed, and altogether constitute one body. In like manner the law, distributed into various articulations, constitutes but <i>one body</i>." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
