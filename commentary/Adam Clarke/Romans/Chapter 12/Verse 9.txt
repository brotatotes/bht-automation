Verse Romans 12:9. Let love be without dissimulation. — Ἡ αγαπη ανυποκριτος· Have no hypocritical love; let not your love wear a mask; make no empty professions. Love God and your neighbour; and, by obedience to the one and acts of benevolence to the other, show that your love is sincere.Abhor that which is evil — Αποστυγουντες το πονηρον· Hate sin as you would hate that hell to which it leads. στυγεω signifies to hate or detest with horror; the preposition απο greatly strengthens the meaning. στυξ, Styx, was a feigned river in hell by which the gods were wont to swear, and if any of them falsified this oath he was deprived of his nectar and ambrosia for a hundred years; hence the river was reputed to be hateful, and στυγεω signified to be as hateful as hell. Two MSS. read μισουντες, which signifies hating in the lowest sense of the term. The word in the text is abundantly more expressive, and our translation is both nervous and appropriate.Cleave to that which is good. — Κολλωμενοι τῳ αγαθῳ· Be CEMENTED or GLUED to that which is good; so the word literally signifies. Have an unalterable attachment to whatever leads to God, and contributes to the welfare of your fellow creatures.
