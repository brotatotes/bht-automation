<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:9">Romans 12:9</span>. <i><b>Let love be without dissimulation.</b></i> — Ἡ αγαπη ανυποκριτος· Have no <i>hypocritical</i> love; let not your love wear a mask; make no empty professions. Love God and your neighbour; and, by obedience to the one and acts of benevolence to the other, show that your love is <i>sincere</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Abhor that which is evil</b></i> — Αποστυγουντες το πονηρον· Hate sin as you would hate that <i>hell</i> to which it leads. στυγεω signifies to <i>hate</i> or <i>detest with horror</i>; the preposition απο greatly strengthens the meaning. στυξ, <i>Styx</i>, was a feigned river in hell by which the gods were wont to swear, and if any of them falsified this oath he was deprived of his nectar and ambrosia for a hundred years; hence the river was reputed to be <i>hateful</i>, and στυγεω signified <i>to be as hateful as hell</i>. Two MSS. read μισουντες, which signifies <i>hating</i> in the lowest sense of the term. The word in the text is abundantly more expressive, and our translation is both nervous and appropriate.</p>
<p><i><b>Cleave to that which is good.</b></i> — Κολλωμενοι τῳ αγαθῳ· <i>Be</i> CEMENTED or GLUED <i>to that which is good</i>; so the word literally signifies. Have an unalterable attachment to whatever leads to God, and contributes to the welfare of your fellow creatures.</p>
