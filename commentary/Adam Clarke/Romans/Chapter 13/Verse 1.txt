<p>To see with what propriety the apostle introduces the important subjects which he handles in this chapter, it is necessary to make a few remarks on the circumstances in which the Church of God then was.</p>
<p>It is generally allowed that this epistle was written about the year of our Lord 58, four or five years after the edict of the Emperor Claudius, by which all the Jews were banished from Rome. And as in those early times the Christians were generally confounded with the Jews, it is likely that both were included in this decree.</p>
<p>For what reason this edict was issued does not satisfactorily appear. <i>Suetonius</i> tells us that it was because the Jews were making continual disturbances under their leader <i>Christus</i>. (<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span></span>.) That the Jews were in general an uneasy and seditious people is clear enough from every part of their own history. They had the most rooted aversion to the heathen government; and it was a maxim with them that the <i>world</i> <i>was given to the Israelites</i>; that they should have supreme rule every where, and that the Gentiles should be their vassals. With such political notions, grounded on their native restlessness, it is no wonder if in several instances they gave cause of suspicion to the Roman government, who would be glad of an opportunity to expel from the city persons whom they considered dangerous to its peace and security; nor is it unreasonable on this account to suppose, with Dr. Taylor, that the Christians, under a notion of being the <i>peculiar people of God</i>, and the subjects of his kingdom alone, might be in danger of being infected with those unruly and rebellious sentiments: therefore the apostle shows them that they were, notwithstanding their honours and privileges as Christians, bound by the strongest obligations of conscience to be subject to the civil government. The judicious commentator adds: "I cannot forbear observing the admirable skill and dexterity with which the apostle has handled the subject. His views in writing are always comprehensive on every point; and he takes into his thoughts and instructions all parties that might probably reap any benefit by them. As Christianity was then growing, and the powers of the world began to take notice of it, it was not unlikely that this letter might fall into the hands of the Roman magistrates. And whenever that happened it was right, not only that <i>they</i> should see that Christianity was no favourer of sedition, but likewise that they should have an opportunity of reading their own duty and obligations. But as they were too proud and insolent to permit themselves to be instructed in a plain, direct way, therefore the apostle with a masterly hand, delineates and strongly inculcates the magistrate's duty; while he is pleading his cause with the subject, and establishing his duty on the most sure and solid ground, he dexterously sides with the magistrate, and vindicates his power against any subject who might have imbibed seditious principles, or might be inclined to give the government any disturbance; and under this advantage he reads the magistrate a fine and close lecture upon the nature and ends of civil government. A way of conveyance so ingenious and unexceptionable that even <i>Nero</i> himself, had this epistle fallen into his hands, could not fail of seeing his duty clearly stated, without finding any thing servile or flattering on the one hand, or offensive or disgusting on the other.</p>
<p>"The attentive reader will be pleased to see with what dexterity, truth, and gravity the apostle, in a small compass, affirms and explains the foundation, nature, ends, and just limits of the magistrate's authority, while he is pleading his cause, and teaching the subject the duty and obedience he owes to the civil government."-<i>Dr. Taylor's</i> Notes, page 352.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1">Romans 13:1</span>. <i><b>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.</b></i> — This is a very strong saying, and most solemnly introduced; and we must consider the apostle as speaking, not from his own private judgment, or teaching a doctrine of present <i>expediency</i>, but declaring the <i>mind of God</i> on a subject of the utmost importance to the peace of the world; a doctrine which does not exclusively belong to any <i>class</i> of people, <i>order</i> of the community, or <i>official</i> situations, but to <i>every soul</i>; and, on the principles which the apostle lays down, to every soul in all possible varieties of situation, and on all occasions. And what is this solemn doctrine? It is this: <i>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers</i>. Let every man be obedient to the civil government under which the providence of God has cast his lot.</p>
<p><i><b>For there is no power but of God</b></i> — As God is the origin of power, and the supreme Governor of the universe, he delegates authority to whomsoever he will; and though in many cases the governor <i>himself</i> may not be <i>of God</i>, yet <i>civil government</i> is of him; for without this there could be no society, no security, no private property; all would be confusion and anarchy, and the habitable world would soon be depopulated. In ancient times, God, in an especial manner, on many occasions appointed the <i>individual</i> who was to govern; and he accordingly governed by a <i>Divine right</i>, as in the case of <i>Moses, Joshua</i>, the Hebrew <i>judges</i>, and several of the <i>Israelitish kings</i>. In after times, and to the present day, he does that by a general superintending providence which he did before by especial designation. In all nations of the earth there is what may be called a <i>constitution</i>-a plan by which a particular country or state is governed; and this constitution is less or more calculated to promote the interests of the community. The civil governor, whether he be <i>elective</i> or <i>hereditary</i>, agrees to govern according to that constitution. Thus we may consider that there is a <i>compact</i> and <i>consent</i> between the <i>governor</i> and the <i>governed</i>, and in such a case, the potentate may be considered as coming to the supreme authority in the direct way of God's providence; and as civil government is of God, who is the fountain of law, order, and regularity, the civil governor, who administers the laws of a state according to its <i>constitution</i>, is the <i>minister</i> <i>of God</i>. But it has been asked: If the ruler be an immoral or profligate man, does he not prove himself thereby to be unworthy of his high office, and should he not be deposed? I answer, No: if he rule according to the <i>constitution</i>, nothing can justify rebellion against his authority. He may be <i>irregular</i> in his <i>own</i> <i>private life</i>; he may be an immoral man, and disgrace himself by an improper conduct: but if he rule <i>according to the law</i>; if he make no attempt to change the constitution, nor break the compact between him and the people; there is, therefore, no legal ground of opposition to his civil authority, and every act against him is not only <i>rebellion</i> in the worst sense of the word, but is unlawful and absolutely sinful.</p>
<p>Nothing can justify the opposition of the subjects to the ruler but <i>overt attempts</i> on his part to <i>change the constitution</i>, or to rule <i>contrary to law</i>. When the ruler acts thus he dissolves the compact between him and his people; his authority is no longer binding, because illegal; and it is illegal because he is acting <i>contrary to the laws</i> of that constitution, according to which, on being raised to the supreme power, he promised to govern. This conduct justifies opposition to his government; but I contend that no <i>personal misconduct</i> in the ruler, no immorality in his own life, while he <i>governs according to law</i>, can justify either rebellion against him or contempt of his authority. For his <i>political conduct</i> he is accountable to his <i>people</i>; for his <i>moral</i> <i>conduct</i> he is accountable to <i>God</i>, his <i>conscience</i>, and the <i>ministers</i> of <i>religion</i>. A king may be a <i>good moral man</i>, and yet a weak, and indeed a <i>bad and dangerous prince</i>. He may be a <i>bad man</i>, and stained with vice in his private life, and yet be a <i>good</i> <i>prince</i>. SAUL was a <i>good</i> moral <i>man</i>, but a <i>bad prince</i>, because he endeavoured to act contrary to the Israelitish constitution: he changed some essential parts of that constitution, as I have elsewhere shown; (<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:22">Acts 13:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:22">Acts 13:22</span></span>;) he was therefore lawfully deposed. <i>James the Second</i> was a <i>good</i> moral <i>man</i>, as far as I can learn, but he was a <i>bad</i> and <i>dangerous prince</i>; he endeavoured to alter, and essentially change the British constitution, both in <i>Church</i> and <i>state</i>, therefore <i>he</i> was lawfully deposed. It would be easy, in running over the list of our own kings, to point out several who were deservedly reputed <i>good</i> <i>kings</i>, who in their private life were very <i>immoral</i>. Bad as they might be in private life, the <i>constitution</i> was in their hands ever considered a sacred deposit, and they faithfully preserved it, and transmitted it unimpaired to their successors; and took care while they held the reins of government to have it impartially and effectually administered.</p>
<p>It must be allowed, notwithstanding, that when a prince, howsoever heedful to the laws, is unrighteous in private life, his example is contagious; morality, banished from the throne, is discountenanced by the community; and happiness is diminished in proportion to the increase of vice. On the other hand, when a king governs according to the constitution of his realms and has his heart and life governed by the laws of his God, he is then a double blessing to his people; while he is ruling carefully according to the laws, his pious example is a great means of extending and confirming the reign of pure morality among his subjects. Vice is discredited from the throne, and the profligate dare not hope for a place of trust and confidence, (however in other respects he may be qualified for it,) because he is a vicious man.</p>
<p>As I have already mentioned some potentates by <i>name</i>, as apt examples of the doctrines I have been laying down, my readers will naturally expect that, on so fair an opportunity, I should introduce <i>another</i>; one in whom the double blessing meets; one who, through an unusually protracted reign, during every year of which he most conscientiously watched over the sacred constitution committed to his care, not only did not impair this constitution, but took care that its wholesome laws should be properly administered, and who in every respect acted as the father of his people, and added to all this the most exemplary <i>moral conduct</i> perhaps ever exhibited by a prince, whether in ancient or modern times; not only tacitly discountenancing vice by his truly religious conduct, but by his frequent <i>proclamations</i> most solemnly forbidding Sabbath-breaking, profane swearing, and immorality in general. More might be justly said, but when I have mentioned all these things, (and I mention them with exultation; and with gratitude to God,) I need scarcely add the venerable name of GEORGE <i>the Third, king of Great Britain</i>; as every reader will at once perceive that the description suits no potentate besides. I may just observe, that notwithstanding his long reign has been a reign of unparalleled troubles and commotions in the world, in which his empire has always been involved, yet, never did useful arts, ennobling sciences, and pure religion gain a more decided and general ascendancy: and much of this, under God, is owing to the manner in which this king has lived, and the encouragement he invariably gave to whatever had a tendency to promote the best interests of his people. Indeed it has been well observed, that, under the ruling providence of God, it was chiefly owing to the private and personal virtues of the sovereign that the house of Brunswick remained firmly seated on the throne amidst the storms arising from democratical agitations and revolutionary convulsions in Europe during the years 1792-1794. The stability of his throne amidst these dangers and distresses may prove a useful lesson to his successors, and show them the strength of a virtuous character, and that morality and religion form the best bulwark against those great evils to which all human governments are exposed. This small tribute of praise to the character and conduct of the British king, and gratitude to God for such a governor, will not be suspected of sinister motive; as the object of it is, by an inscrutable providence, placed in a situation to which neither <i>envy, flattery</i>, nor even just praise can approach, and where the majesty of the man is placed in the most awful yet respectable ruins. I have only one abatement to make: had this potentate been as <i>adverse from</i> WAR as he was from public and private vices, he would have been the most immaculate sovereign that ever held a sceptre or wore a crown.</p>
<p>But to resume the subject, and conclude the argument: I wish particularly to show the utter unlawfulness of rebellion against a ruler, who, though he may be incorrect in his moral conduct, yet rules according to the laws; and the additional blessing of having a prince, who, while his political conduct is regulated by the principles of the constitution, has his heart and life regulated by the dictates of eternal truth, as contained in that revelation which came from God.</p>
