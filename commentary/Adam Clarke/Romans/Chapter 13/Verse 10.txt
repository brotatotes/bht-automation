<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>. <i><b>Love worketh no ill</b></i> â€” As he that loves another will act towards that person as, on a reverse of circumstances, he would that his neighbour should act towards him; therefore, this love can never work ill towards another: and, on this <i>head</i>, i.e. the duty we owe to our neighbour, <i>love is the fulfilling of the</i> <i>law</i>.</p>
