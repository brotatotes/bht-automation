Verse Romans 13:10. Love worketh no ill â€” As he that loves another will act towards that person as, on a reverse of circumstances, he would that his neighbour should act towards him; therefore, this love can never work ill towards another: and, on this head, i.e. the duty we owe to our neighbour, love is the fulfilling of the law.
