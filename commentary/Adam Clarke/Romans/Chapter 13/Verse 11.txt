<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:11">Romans 13:11</span>. <i><b>And that, knowing the time</b></i> â€” Dr. Taylor has given a judicious paraphrase of this and the following verses: "And all the duties of a virtuous and holy life we should the more carefully and zealously perform, considering the nature and shortness of the present season of life; which will convince us that it is now <i>high time</i> to <i>rouse</i> and shake off <i>sleep</i>, and apply with vigilance and vigour to the duties of our Christian life; for that eternal <i>salvation</i>, which is the object of our Christian <i>faith</i> and hope, and the great motive of our religion, is every day <i>nearer</i> to us than when we first entered into the profession of Christianity."</p>
<p>Some think the passage should be understood thus: We have now many advantages which we did not formerly possess. <i>Salvation is</i> <i>nearer</i>-the whole Christian system is more fully explained, and the knowledge of it more easy to be acquired than formerly; on which account a greater progress in religious knowledge and in practical piety is required of us: and we have for a long time been too remiss in these respects. <i>Deliverance</i> from the <i>persecutions</i>, &amp;c., with which they were then afflicted, is supposed by others to be the meaning of the apostle.</p>
