Verse Romans 13:13. Let us walk honestly, as in the day — Let us walk, ευσχημονες, decently, from εν, well, and σχημα, mien, habit, or dress. Let our deportment be decent, orderly, and grave; such as we shall not be ashamed of in the eyes of the whole world.Not in rioting, and drunkenness — Μη κωμοις και μεθαις· Κωμος, rioting, according to Hesychius, signifies ασελγη ᾳσματα, πορνικα συμποσια, ῳδαι, unclean and dissolute songs, banquets, and such like. μεθαις signifies drunken festivals, such as were celebrated in honour of their gods, when after they had sacrificed (μετα το θυειν, SUIDAS) they drank to excess, accompanied with abominable acts of every kind. See Suidas and Hesychius, under this word.Not in chambering — This is no legitimate word, and conveys no sense till, from its connection in this place, we force a meaning upon it. The original word, κοιταις, signifies whoredoms and prostitution of every kind.And wantonness — Ασελγειαις, All manner of uncleanness and sodomitical practices.Not in strife and envying. — Μη εριδι και ζηλῳ, Not in contentions and furious altercations, which must be the consequence of such practices as are mentioned above. Can any man suppose that this address is to the Christians at Rome? That they are charged with practices almost peculiar to the heathens? And practices of the most abandoned and dissolute sort? If those called Christians at Rome were guilty of such acts, there could be no difference except in profession, between them and the most abominable of the heathens. But it is impossible that such things should be spoken to the followers of Christ; for the very grace that brings repentance enables the penitent to cast aside and abominate all such vicious and abominable conduct.The advices to the Christians may be found in the preceding chapter; those at the conclusion of this chapter belong solely to the heathens.
