<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>. <i><b>Let us walk honestly, as in the day</b></i> — <i>Let us walk</i>, ευσχημονες, <i>decently</i>, from εν, <i>well</i>, and σχημα, <i>mien,</i> <i>habit</i>, or <i>dress</i>. Let our deportment be decent, orderly, and grave; such as we shall not be ashamed of in the eyes of the whole world.</p>
<p><i><b>Not in rioting, and drunkenness</b></i> — Μη κωμοις και μεθαις· Κωμος, <i>rioting</i>, according to <i>Hesychius</i>, signifies ασελγη ᾳσματα, πορνικα συμποσια, ῳδαι, <i>unclean and dissolute songs</i>, banquets, and such like. μεθαις signifies <i>drunken festivals</i>, such as were celebrated in honour of their gods, when <i>after</i> they had <i>sacrificed</i> (μετα το θυειν, SUIDAS) they drank to excess, accompanied with abominable acts of every kind. See <i>Suidas</i> and <i>Hesychius</i>, under this word.</p>
<p><i><b>Not in chambering</b></i> — This is no legitimate word, and conveys no sense till, from its connection in this place, we force a meaning upon it. The original word, κοιταις, signifies <i>whoredoms</i> and <i>prostitution</i> of every kind.</p>
<p><i><b>And wantonness</b></i> — Ασελγειαις, All manner of <i>uncleanness</i> and <i>sodomitical</i> practices.</p>
<p><i><b>Not in strife and envying.</b></i> — Μη εριδι και ζηλῳ, Not in contentions and furious altercations, which must be the consequence of such practices as are mentioned above. Can any man suppose that this address is to the <i>Christians</i> at Rome? That they are charged with practices almost peculiar to the <i>heathens</i>? And practices of the most abandoned and dissolute sort? If those called Christians at Rome were guilty of such acts, there could be no difference except in <i>profession</i>, between them and the most <i>abominable</i> of the <i>heathens</i>. But it is impossible that such things should be spoken to the followers of Christ; for the very grace that brings <i>repentance</i> enables the penitent to cast aside and abominate all such vicious and abominable conduct.</p>
<p>The advices to the <i>Christians</i> may be found in the preceding chapter; those at the conclusion of this chapter belong <i>solely</i> to the <i>heathens</i>.</p>
