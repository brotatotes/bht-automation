<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:3">Romans 13:3</span>. <i><b>For rulers are not a terror to good works</b></i> — Here the apostle shows the civil magistrate what he should be: he is clothed with great power, but that power is entrusted to him, not for the terror and oppression of the upright man, but to overawe and punish the wicked. It is, in a word, for the <i>benefit of the</i> <i>community</i>, and not for the <i>aggrandizement of himself</i>, that God has entrusted the supreme civil power to any man. If he should use this to wrong, rob, spoil, oppress, and persecute his subjects, he is not only a <i>bad man</i>, but also a <i>bad prince</i>. He infringes on the essential principles of law and equity. Should he <i>persecute</i> his obedient, loyal subjects, on any religious account, this is contrary to all law and right; and his doing so renders him unworthy of their confidence, and they must consider him not as a <i>blessing</i> but a <i>plague</i>. Yet, even in this case, though in our country it would be a breach of the constitution, which allows every man to worship God according to his conscience, the truly pious will not feel that even this would justify rebellion against the prince; they are to suffer patiently, and commend themselves and their cause to him that judgeth righteously. It is an awful thing to rebel, and the cases are extremely rare that can justify rebellion against the constituted authorities.

<p><i><b>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?</b></i> — If thou wouldst not live in fear of the civil magistrate, live according to the laws; and thou mayest expect that <i>he</i> will rule according to the laws, and consequently instead of incurring <i>blame</i> thou wilt have <i>praise</i>. This is said on the supposition that the ruler is himself a <i>good</i> <i>man</i>: such the laws suppose him to be; and the apostle, on the general question of obedience and protection, assumes the point that the magistrate <i>is</i> such.</p>
