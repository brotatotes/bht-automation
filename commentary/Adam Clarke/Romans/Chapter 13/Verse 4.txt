<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:4">Romans 13:4</span>. <i><b>For he is the minister of God to thee for good</b></i> — Here the apostle puts the character of the ruler in the strongest possible light. <i>He is the minister of God</i>-the office is by Divine appointment: the man who is worthy of the office will act in conformity to the will of God: and as the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears open to their cry, consequently the ruler will be the <i>minister of God to them for good</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He beareth not the sword in vain</b></i> — His power is delegated to him for the defence and encouragement of the good, and the punishment of the wicked; and he has authority to punish <i>capitally</i>, when the law so requires: this the term <i>sword</i> leads us to infer.</p>
<p><i><b>For he is the minister of God, a revenger</b></i> — θεου διακονος εστιν εκδικος, <i>For he is God's vindictive minister</i>, to execute <i>wrath</i>; εις οργην, to inflict <i>punishment</i> upon the transgressors of the law; and this according to the statutes of that law; for God's civil ministers are never allowed to pronounce or inflict punishment according to <i>their own minds</i> or <i>feeling</i>, but according to the express declarations of the law.</p>
