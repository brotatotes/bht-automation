<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:7">Romans 13:7</span>. <i><b>Render therefore to all their dues</b></i> — This is an extensive command. Be rigidly just; withhold neither from the <i>king</i> nor his <i>ministers</i>, nor his <i>officers</i> of <i>justice</i> and <i>revenue</i>, nor from even the lowest of the <i>community</i>, what the laws of God and your country require you to pay.</p>
<p><i><b>Tribute to whom tribute</b></i> — φορον. This word probably means such taxes as were levied on <i>persons</i> and <i>estates</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Custom to whom custom</b></i> — τελος. This word probably means such duties as were laid upon <i>goods, merchandise</i>, c., on <i>imports</i> and <i>exports</i> what we commonly call <i>custom</i>. Kypke on this place has quoted some good authorities for the above distinction and signification. Both the words occur in the following quotation from <i>Strabo</i>: Αναγκη γαρ μειουσθαι τα τελη, φορων επιβαλλομενων· <i>It is necessary to lessen the</i> CUSTOMS, <i>if</i> TAXES <i>be imposed.</i> <i>Strabo</i>, lib. ii., page 307. See several other examples in <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Fear to whom fear</b></i> — It is likely that the word φοβον, which we translate <i>fear</i>, signifies that reverence which produces <i>obedience</i>. Treat all <i>official</i> characters with respect, and be obedient to your superiors.</p>
<p><i><b>Honour to whom honour.</b></i> — The word τιμην may here mean that <i>outward respect</i> which the principle <i>reverence</i>, from which it springs, will generally produce. Never behave rudely to any person; but behave respectfully to men in office: if you cannot even respect the <i>man</i>-for an important office may be filled by an unworthy person-respect the <i>office</i>, and the man on account of his <i>office</i>. If a man habituate himself to disrespect <i>official</i> <i>characters</i>, he will soon find himself disposed to pay little respect or obedience to the <i>laws themselves</i>.</p>
