Verse Romans 13:7. Render therefore to all their dues — This is an extensive command. Be rigidly just; withhold neither from the king nor his ministers, nor his officers of justice and revenue, nor from even the lowest of the community, what the laws of God and your country require you to pay.Tribute to whom tribute — φορον. This word probably means such taxes as were levied on persons and estates.Custom to whom custom — τελος. This word probably means such duties as were laid upon goods, merchandise, c., on imports and exports what we commonly call custom. Kypke on this place has quoted some good authorities for the above distinction and signification. Both the words occur in the following quotation from Strabo: Αναγκη γαρ μειουσθαι τα τελη, φορων επιβαλλομενων· It is necessary to lessen the CUSTOMS, if TAXES be imposed. Strabo, lib. ii., page 307. See several other examples in Kypke.Fear to whom fear — It is likely that the word φοβον, which we translate fear, signifies that reverence which produces obedience. Treat all official characters with respect, and be obedient to your superiors.Honour to whom honour. — The word τιμην may here mean that outward respect which the principle reverence, from which it springs, will generally produce. Never behave rudely to any person; but behave respectfully to men in office: if you cannot even respect the man-for an important office may be filled by an unworthy person-respect the office, and the man on account of his office. If a man habituate himself to disrespect official characters, he will soon find himself disposed to pay little respect or obedience to the laws themselves.
