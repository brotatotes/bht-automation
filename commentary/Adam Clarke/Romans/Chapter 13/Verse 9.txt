<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>. <i><b>For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery</b></i> — He that loves another will not deprive him of his <i>wife</i>, of his <i>life</i>, of his <i>property</i>, of his <i>good name</i>; and will not even permit a <i>desire</i> to enter into his heart which would lead him to wish to possess any thing that is the property of another: for the <i>law</i>-the sacred Scripture, has said: <i>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</i>.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that ου ψευδομαρτυρησεις, <i>thou shalt not bear</i> <i>false witness</i>, is wanting here in ABDEFG, and several other MSS. Griesbach has left it out of the text. It is wanting also in the Syriac, and in several of the primitive fathers. The generality of the best critics think it a spurious reading.</p>
