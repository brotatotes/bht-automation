<p>It seems very likely, from this and the following chapter, that there were considerable misunderstandings between the <i>Jewish</i> and <i>Gentile</i> Christians at Rome, relative to certain customs which were sacredly observed by the one and disregarded by the other. The principal subject of dispute was concerning <i>meats</i> and <i>days</i>. The converted Jew, retaining a veneration for the law of Moses, abstained from certain meats, and was observant of certain days; while the converted Gentile, understanding that the Christian religion laid him under no obligations to such ceremonial points, had no regard to either. It appears, farther, that mutual censures and uncharitable judgments prevailed among them, and that brotherly love and mutual forbearance did not generally prevail. The apostle, in this part of his epistle, exhorts that in such things, not essential to religion, and in which both parties, in their different way of thinking, might have an <i>honest meaning</i>, and <i>serious regard to God</i>, difference of sentiments might not hinder Christian fellowship and love; but that they would mutually forbear each other, make candid allowance, and especially not carry their Gospel liberty so far as to prejudice a weak brother, a Jewish Christian, against the Gospel itself, and tempt him to renounce Christianity. His rules and exhortations are still of great use, and happy would the Christian world be if they were more generally practised. See Dr. Taylor, who farther remarks, that it is probable St. Paul learned all these particulars from Aquila and Priscilla, who were lately come from Rome, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span>, and with whom the apostle was familiar for a considerable time. This is very likely, as there is no evidence that he had any other intercourse with the Church at Rome.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>. <i><b>Him that is weak in the faith</b></i> — By this the apostle most evidently means the converted <i>Jew</i>, who must indeed be weak in the faith, if he considered this distinction of meats and days essential to his salvation. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:21">Romans 14:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:21">Romans 14:21</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Receive ye</b></i> — Associate with him; receive him into your religious fellowship; but when there, let all religious altercations be avoided.</p>
<p><i><b>Not to doubtful disputations.</b></i> — Μη εις διακρισεις δια λογισμων. These words have been variously translated and understood. Dr. <i>Whitby</i> thinks the sense of them to be this; <i>Not discriminating</i> <i>them by their inward thoughts</i>. Do not reject any from your Christian communion because of their particular sentiments on things which are in themselves <i>indifferent</i>. Do not curiously inquire into their religious scruples, nor condemn them on that account. Entertain a brother of this kind rather with what may profit his soul, than with curious disquisitions on speculative points of doctrine. A good lesson for modern Christians in general.</p>
