<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:10">Romans 14:10</span>. <i><b>But why dost thou</b></i> — <i>Christian Jew</i>, observing the rites of the Mosaic law, <i>judge</i>-condemn <i>thy brother</i>-the Christian <i>Gentile</i>, who does not think himself bound by this law?</p>
<p><i><b>Or why dost thou</b></i> — Christian <i>Gentile, set at nought</i> thy Christian Jewish brother, as if he were unworthy of thy regard, because he does not yet believe that the Gospel has set him free from the rites and ceremonies of the law?</p>
<p>It is a true saying of Mr. Heylin, on this verse: <i>The</i> superstitious <i>are prone</i> to judge, <i>and those who are</i> not superstitious <i>are prone</i> to despise.</p>
<p><i><b>We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</b></i> — Why should we then judge and condemn each other? We are accountable to God for our conduct, and shall be judged at his bar; and let us consider that whatever measure we mete, the same shall be measured unto us again.</p>
