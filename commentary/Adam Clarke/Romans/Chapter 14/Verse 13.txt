<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>. <i><b>Let us not, therefore, judge one another any more</b></i> — Let us abandon such rash conduct; it is dangerous, it is uncharitable: judgment belongs to the Lord, and he will <i>condemn</i> those only who should <i>not</i> be <i>acquitted</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That no man put a stumbling block</b></i> — Let both the converted <i>Jew</i> and <i>Gentile</i> consider that they should labour to promote each other's spiritual interests, and not be a means of hindering each other in their Christian course; or of causing them to abandon the Gospel, on <i>which</i>, and not on questions of <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i>, the salvation of their soul depends.</p>
