Verse Romans 14:13. Let us not, therefore, judge one another any more — Let us abandon such rash conduct; it is dangerous, it is uncharitable: judgment belongs to the Lord, and he will condemn those only who should not be acquitted.That no man put a stumbling block — Let both the converted Jew and Gentile consider that they should labour to promote each other's spiritual interests, and not be a means of hindering each other in their Christian course; or of causing them to abandon the Gospel, on which, and not on questions of rites and ceremonies, the salvation of their soul depends.
