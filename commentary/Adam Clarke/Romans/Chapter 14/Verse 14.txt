<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>. <i><b>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus</b></i> â€” After reasoning so long and so much with these contending parties on the subject of their mutual misunderstandings, without attempting to give any opinion, but merely to show them the folly and uncharitableness of their conduct, he now expresses himself fully, and tells them that <i>nothing is unclean of itself</i>, and that he has the inspiration and authority of Jesus Christ to say so; for to such an inspiration he must refer in such words as, <i>I know, and am</i> <i>persuaded by the Lord Jesus</i>. And yet, after having given them this decisive judgment, through respect to the tender, mistaken conscience of weak believers, he immediately adds: <i>But to him that</i> <i>esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him</i> it is <i>unclean</i>; because if he act contrary to his conscience, he must necessarily contract guilt; for he who acts in opposition to his conscience in one case may do it in another, and thus even the <i>plain declarations</i> of the <i>word of God</i> may be set aside on things of the utmost importance, as well as the <i>erroneous</i> though well-intentioned dictates of his conscience, on matters which he makes of the <i>last consequence</i>; though others who are better taught know them to be <i>indifferent</i>.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to <i>trifle with conscience</i>, even when <i>erroneous</i>; it should be borne with and instructed; it must be <i>won</i> over, not <i>taken</i> by <i>storm</i>. Its feelings should be respected because they ever refer to God, and have their foundation in his fear. He who sins against his conscience in things which every one else knows to be indifferent, will soon do it in those things in which his salvation is most intimately concerned. It is a great blessing to have a <i>well-informed</i> conscience; it is a blessing to have a <i>tender</i> conscience; and even a <i>sore</i> conscience is infinitely better than none.</p>
