<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>. <i><b>If thy brother be grieved</b></i> — If he think that thou doest wrong, and he is in consequence stumbled at thy conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>Now walkest thou not charitably.</b></i> — κατα αγαπην, <i>According to</i> <i>love; for love worketh no ill to its neighbour</i>; but by thy eating some particular kind of meat, on which neither thy <i>life</i> nor <i>well-being</i> depends, thou <i>workest ill</i> to him by <i>grieving</i> and distressing his mind; and therefore thou breakest the <i>law of God</i> in reference to him, while pretending that <i>thy Christian liberty</i> raises thee above his <i>scruples</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</b></i> — This puts the uncharitable conduct of the person in question in the strongest light, because it supposes that the weak brother may be so <i>stumbled</i> as to <i>fall</i> and <i>perish finally</i>; even the man <i>for</i> <i>whom Christ died</i>. To injure a man in his <i>circumstances</i> is bad; to injure him in his <i>person</i> is worse; to injure him in his <i>reputation</i> is still <i>worse</i>; and to injure his <i>soul</i> is worst of all. No wickedness, no malice, can go farther than to injure and destroy the soul: thy uncharitable conduct may proceed thus far; therefore thou art highly criminal before God.</p>
<p>From this verse we learn that a <i>man for whom Christ died</i> may <i>perish</i>, or have his soul <i>destroyed</i>; and destroyed with such a <i>destruction</i> as implies <i>perdition</i>; the original is very emphatic, μη - εκεινον απολλυε, ὑπερ οὑ Χριστος απεθανε. Christ died in his <i>stead</i>; do not destroy his soul. The <i>sacrificial death</i> is as strongly expressed as it can be, and there is no word in the New Testament that more forcibly implies <i>eternal ruin</i> than the verb απολλυω, from which is derived that most significant name of the <i>Devil</i>, ο απολλυων, the DESTROYER, the great universal murderer of souls.</p>
