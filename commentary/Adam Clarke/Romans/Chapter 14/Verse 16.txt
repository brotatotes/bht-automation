<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:16">Romans 14:16</span>. <i><b>Let not then your good be evil spoken of</b></i> â€” Do not make such a use of your <i>Christian liberty</i> as to subject the <i>Gospel</i> itself to reproach. Whatsoever you do, do it in such a manner, spirit, and time, as to make it productive of the greatest possible good. There are many who have such an unhappy method of doing their good acts, as not only to do <i>little</i> or <i>no good</i> by them, but a great deal of <i>evil</i>. It requires much prudence and watchfulness to find out the proper time of performing even a good action.</p>
