<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For the kingdom of God</b></i> — That holy religion which God has sent from heaven, and which be intends to make the instrument of establishing a counterpart of the kingdom of glory among men: <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Is not meat and drink</b></i> — It consists not in these outward and indifferent things. It neither particularly <i>enjoins</i> nor particularly <i>forbids</i> such.</p>
<p><i><b>But righteousness</b></i> — Pardon of sin, and holiness of heart and life.</p>
<p><i><b>And peace</b></i> — In the soul, from a sense of God's mercy; peace regulating, ruling, and harmonizing the heart.</p>
<p><i><b>And joy in the Holy Ghost.</b></i> — Solid spiritual <i>happiness</i>; a <i>joy</i> which springs from a clear sense of God's mercy; the love of God being shed abroad in the heart by the <i>Holy Ghost</i>. In a word, it is happiness brought into the soul by the Holy Spirit, and maintained there by the same influence. This is a genuine counterpart of heaven; <i>righteousness</i> without sin, PEACE without inward <i>disturbance</i>, JOY without any kind of <i>mental agony</i> or distressing <i>fear</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span></span>.</p>
