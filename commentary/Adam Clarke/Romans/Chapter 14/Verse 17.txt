Verse 17. For the kingdom of God — That holy religion which God has sent from heaven, and which be intends to make the instrument of establishing a counterpart of the kingdom of glory among men: Matthew 3:2; Matthew 3:2.Is not meat and drink — It consists not in these outward and indifferent things. It neither particularly enjoins nor particularly forbids such.But righteousness — Pardon of sin, and holiness of heart and life.And peace — In the soul, from a sense of God's mercy; peace regulating, ruling, and harmonizing the heart.And joy in the Holy Ghost. — Solid spiritual happiness; a joy which springs from a clear sense of God's mercy; the love of God being shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost. In a word, it is happiness brought into the soul by the Holy Spirit, and maintained there by the same influence. This is a genuine counterpart of heaven; righteousness without sin, PEACE without inward disturbance, JOY without any kind of mental agony or distressing fear. Matthew 3:2; Matthew 3:2.
