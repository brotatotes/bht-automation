<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For he that in these things</b></i> â€” The man, whether <i>Jew</i> or <i>Gentile</i>, who <i>in these things</i>-righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, <i>serveth Christ</i>-acts according to his doctrine, is <i>acceptable to God</i>; for he has not only the <i>form</i> of godliness in thus <i>serving Christ</i>, but he has the <i>power</i>, the very <i>spirit</i> and <i>essence</i> of it, in having righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost; and therefore the whole <i>frame</i> of his <i>mind</i>, as well as his <i>acts</i>, must be acceptable to God.-<i>And approved of men</i>; for although religion may be persecuted, yet the righteous man, who is continually labouring for the public good, will be generally esteemed. This was a very common form of speech among the Jews; that <i>he who was a conscientious observer of the law, was pleasing</i> <i>to God and approved of men</i>. See several examples in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
