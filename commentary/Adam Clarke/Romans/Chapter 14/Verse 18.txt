Verse 18. For he that in these things â€” The man, whether Jew or Gentile, who in these things-righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, serveth Christ-acts according to his doctrine, is acceptable to God; for he has not only the form of godliness in thus serving Christ, but he has the power, the very spirit and essence of it, in having righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost; and therefore the whole frame of his mind, as well as his acts, must be acceptable to God.-And approved of men; for although religion may be persecuted, yet the righteous man, who is continually labouring for the public good, will be generally esteemed. This was a very common form of speech among the Jews; that he who was a conscientious observer of the law, was pleasing to God and approved of men. See several examples in Schoettgen.
