<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Let us therefore follow</b></i> â€” Far from contending about <i>meats, drinks</i>, and <i>festival times</i>, in which it is not likely that the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i> will <i>soon</i> agree, let us endeavour to the utmost of our power to promote <i>peace</i> and <i>unanimity</i>, that we may be instrumental in edifying each other, in promoting religious knowledge and piety instead of being <i>stumbling-blocks</i> in each other's way.</p>
