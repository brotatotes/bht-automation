<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:20">Romans 14:20</span>. <i><b>For meat destroy not the work of God</b></i> — Do not hinder the <i>progress of the Gospel</i> either in your own souls or in those of others, by contending about lawful or unlawful meats. And do not destroy the soul of thy Christian brother, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>, by offending him so as to induce him to <i>apostatize</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>All things indeed</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>pure</b></i> — This is a repetition of the sentiment delivered, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>, in different words. Nothing that is <i>proper</i> for <i>aliment</i> is <i>unlawful</i> to be eaten; <i>but</i> it is <i>evil for that man who eateth with offence</i>-the man who either eats contrary to his own conscience, or so as to grieve and stumble another, does an <i>evil</i> act; and however <i>lawful</i> the thing may be in <i>itself</i>, his conduct does not please God.</p>
