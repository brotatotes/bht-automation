<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:21">Romans 14:21</span>. <b>It is </b><i><b>good neither to eat flesh</b></i><b>, c.</b>] The spirit and self-denying principles of the Gospel teach us, that we should not only avoid every thing in eating or drinking which may be an occasion of offence or apostasy to our brethren, but even to lay down our lives for them should it be necessary.</p>
<p><i><b>Whereby thy brother stumbleth</b></i> — Προσκοπτει, from προς, against, and κοπτω, to <i>strike</i>, to <i>hit the foot</i> against <i>a stone</i> in walking, so as to <i>halt</i>, and be <i>impeded</i> in one's <i>journey</i>. It here means, spiritually, any thing by which a man is so perplexed in his mind as to be prevented from making due <i>progress</i> in the Divine life. Any thing by which he is caused to <i>halt</i>, to be <i>undecisive</i>, and undetermined and under such an influence no man has ever yet <i>grown</i> in <i>grace</i> and in the <i>knowledge of Jesus Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Or is offended</b></i> — Η σκανδαλιζεται, from σκανδαλον, a <i>stumbling-block</i>; any thing by which a person is caused to <i>fall</i>, especially into a <i>snare, trap</i>, or <i>gin</i>. Originally the word signified the <i>piece of wood</i> or <i>key</i> in a <i>trap</i>, which being trodden on caused the animal to fall into a pit, or the trap to close upon him. In the New Testament it generally refers to <i>total</i> <i>apostasy</i> from the Christian religion; and this appears to be its meaning in this place.</p>
<p><i><b>Or is made weak.</b></i> — Η ασθενει, from α, <i>negative</i>, and σθενος, <i>strength</i>; without <i>mental vigour</i>; without <i>power</i> sufficiently to distinguish between <i>right</i> and <i>wrong, good</i> and <i>evil, lawful</i> and <i>unlawful</i>. To get under the dominion of an <i>erroneous</i> conscience, so as to judge that to be <i>evil</i> or <i>unlawful</i> which is <i>not so</i>. The two last terms are omitted by two excellent MSS. (the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i> and the <i>Codex Ephraim</i>,) by the <i>Syriac</i> of Erpen, the <i>Coptic</i> and the <i>Ethiopic</i>, and by some of the <i>primitive</i> fathers. It is very likely that they were <i>added</i> by some early hand by way of illustration. <i>Griesbach</i> has left them in the text with a note of <i>doubtfulness</i>.</p>
