<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:22">Romans 14:22</span>. <i><b>Hast thou faith?</b></i> — The term <i>faith</i> seems to signify in this place a <i>full persuasion in a man's mind that he is right</i>, that what he does is <i>lawful</i>, and has the <i>approbation of God</i> and his <i>conscience</i>. Dr. Taylor has a judicious note on this passage. "There is no necessity," says he, " for reading the first clause <i>interrogatively</i>; and it seems to be more agreeable to the structure of the Greek to render it, <i>Thou hast faith</i>; as if he had said: 'I own thou hast a right persuasion.' Farther, there is an <i>anadiplosis</i> in εχεις, and εχε the first simply signifies <i>thou</i> <i>hast</i>, the latter, <i>hold fast</i>. Thou hast a right persuasion concerning thy Christian liberty; and I advise thee to hold that persuasion steadfastly, with respect to thyself in the sight of God. εχω <i>have</i>, has frequently this emphatical signification. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:29">Matthew 25:29</span>, c."</p>
<p><i><b>Happy is he that condemneth not</b></i>, &amp;c.] That man only can enjoy <i>peace of conscience</i> who acts according to the full persuasion which God has given him of the lawfulness of his conduct: whereas he must be miserable who allows himself in the practice of any thing for which his conscience upbraids and accuses him. This is a most excellent maxim, and every genuine Christian should be careful to try every part of his conduct by it. If a man have not peace in his own bosom, he cannot be happy and no man can have peace who sins against his conscience. If a man's passions or appetite allow or instigate him to a particular thing, let him take good heed that his conscience <i>approve</i> what his passions <i>allow</i>, and that he live not the subject of continual self-condemnation and reproach. Even the man who has the too scrupulous conscience had better, in such matters as are in question, obey its <i>erroneous</i> dictates than violate this moral feeling, and live only to condemn the actions he is constantly performing.</p>
