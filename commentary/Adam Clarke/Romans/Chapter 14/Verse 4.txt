<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>. <i><b>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?</b></i> — Who has ever given thee the right to condemn the servant of another man, in things pertaining to his own master? <i>To his own</i> <i>master he standeth or falleth</i>. He is to judge him, not thou; thy intermeddling in this business is both rash and uncharitable.</p>
<p><i><b>Yea, he shall be holden up</b></i> — He is sincere and upright, and <i>God, who is able to make him stand</i>, will uphold him; and so teach him that he shall not essentially err. And it is the will of God that such upright though scrupulous persons should be continued members of his Church.</p>
