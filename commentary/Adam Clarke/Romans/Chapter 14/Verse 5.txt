<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>. <i><b>One man esteemeth one day above another</b></i> — Perhaps the word ημεραν, <i>day</i>, is here taken for <i>time, festival</i>, and such like, in which sense it is frequently used. Reference is made here to the <i>Jewish institutions</i>, and especially their <i>festivals</i>; such as the <i>passover, pentecost, feast of tabernacles, new moons</i>, <i>jubilee</i>, c. The converted <i>Jew</i> still thought these of moral obligation the <i>Gentile</i> Christian not having been bred up in this way had no such prejudices. And as those who were the instruments of bringing him to the knowledge of God gave him no such injunctions, consequently he paid to these no religious regard.</p>
<p><i><b>Another</b></i> — The converted <i>Gentile esteemeth every day</i>-considers that all <i>time</i> is the Lord's, and that each day should be devoted to the glory of God; and that those festivals are not binding on him.</p>
<p>We add here <i>alike</i>, and make the text say what I am sure was never intended, viz. that there is no distinction of days, not even of the Sabbath: and that every Christian is at liberty to consider even this day to be holy or not holy, as he happens to be persuaded in his own mind.</p>
<p>That the <i><b>Sabbath</b></i> is of lasting obligation may be reasonably concluded from its <i>institution</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5- :">Romans 14:5- :</span>) and from its <i>typical</i> reference. All allow that the Sabbath is a type of that <i>rest in glory</i> which <i>remains for the people of God</i>. Now, all types are intended to continue in full force till the antitype, or thing signified, take place; consequently, the Sabbath will continue in force till the consummation of all things. The word <i>alike</i> should not be added; nor is it acknowledged by any MS. or ancient <i>version</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Let every man be fully persuaded</b></i> — With respect to the propriety or non-propriety of keeping the above <i>festivals</i>, let every man act from the plenary conviction of his own mind; there is a sufficient latitude allowed: all may be fully satisfied.</p>
