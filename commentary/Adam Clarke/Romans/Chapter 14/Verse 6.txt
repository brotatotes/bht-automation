<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:6">Romans 14:6</span>. <i><b>He that regardeth the day</b></i> â€” A beautiful apology for <i>mistaken sincerity</i> and <i>injudicious reformation</i>. Do not condemn the man for what is indifferent in itself: if he keep these <i>festivals</i>, his purpose is to honour God by the religious observance of them. On the other hand, he who finds that he cannot observe them in honour of God, not believing that God has enjoined them, he does not observe them at all. In like manner, he that eateth any creature of God, which is wholesome and proper food, <i>gives thanks to God</i> as the author of all good. And he who cannot eat of all indiscriminately, but is regulated by the precepts in the Mosaic law relative to <i>clean</i> and <i>unclean meats</i>, also <i>gives God thanks</i>. Both are sincere; both upright; both act according to their light; God accepts both; and <i>they</i> should bear with each other.</p>
