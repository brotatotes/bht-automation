<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7">Romans 14:7</span>. <i><b>None of us liveth to himself</b></i> — The Greek writers use the phrase, εαυτω ζην, to signify acting according to one's own judgment, following one's own opinion. Christians must act in all <i>things</i> according to the mind and will of God, and not follow their own <i>wills</i>. The apostle seems to intimate that in all the above cases each must endeavour to <i>please God</i>, for he is accountable to him alone for his conduct in these indifferent things. God is our master, we must <i>live to him</i>, as we live under his notice and by his bounty; and when we cease to live among men, we are still in his hand. Therefore, what we do, or what we leave undone, should be in reference to that eternity which is ever at hand.</p>
