<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:9">Romans 14:9</span>. <i><b>Christ both died and rose</b></i> — That we are not our own, but are the Lord's both in life and death, is evident from this-that Christ lived, and died, and rose again, <i>that he might be</i> <i>the Lord of the dead and the living</i>; for his power extends equally over both worlds: <i>separate</i>, as well as <i>embodied spirits</i>, are under his authority; and he it is who is to raise even the dead to life: and thus all throughout eternity shall live under his dominion.</p>
<p>The clause καιανεστη, <i>and rose</i>, is wanting in several reputable MSS., and certainly is not necessary to the text. Griesbach omits the words, and reads απεθανε και εζησεν, <i>died and</i> <i>lived</i>; of which Professor <i>White</i> says, <i>lectio indubie genuina</i>: "this reading is indisputably genuine."</p>
