<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1">Romans 15:1</span>. <i><b>We then that are strong</b></i> â€” The sense of this verse is supposed to be the following: We, Gentile Christians, who perfectly understand the nature of our Gospel liberty, not only lawfully may, but are bound in duty to bear any inconveniences that may arise from the scruples of the weaker brethren, and to ease their consciences by prudently abstaining from such indifferent things as may offend and trouble them; and not take advantage from our superior knowledge to make them submit to our judgment.</p>
