Verse Romans 15:13. Now the God of hope, c.] Ὁ δε Θεος της ελπιδος, May the God of this hope-that God who caused both Jews and Gentiles to hope that the gracious promises which he made to them should be fulfilled and who, accordingly, has fulfilled them in the most punctual and circumstantial manner;Fill you with all joy — Give you true spiritual happiness; peace in your own hearts, and unity among yourselves; in believing not only the promises which he has given you, but believing in Christ Jesus, in whom all the promises are yea and amen.That ye may abound in hope — That ye may be excited to take more enlarged views of the salvation which God has provided for you, and have all your expectations fulfilled by the power of the Holy Ghost, enabling you to hope and believe; and then sealing the fulfilment of the promises upon your hearts.
