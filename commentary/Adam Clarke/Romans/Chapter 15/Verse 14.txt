<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:14">Romans 15:14</span>. <i><b>And I - am persuaded of you</b></i> — This is supposed to be an address to the Gentiles; and it is managed with great delicacy: he seems to apologize for the <i>freedom</i> he had used in writing to them; which he gives them to understand proceeded from the authority he had received by his apostolical office, the exercise of which office respected <i>them</i> particularly. So they could not be offended when they found themselves so particularly distinguished.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye - are full of goodness</b></i> — Instead of αγαθωσυνης, <i>goodness</i>, some MSS. of good repute have αγαπης, <i>love</i>. In this connection both words seem to mean nearly the same thing. They were so full of <i>goodness</i> and <i>love</i> that they were disposed, of themselves, to follow any plan that might be devised, in order to bring about the most perfect understanding between them and their Jewish brethren.</p>
<p><i><b>Filled with all knowledge</b></i> — So completely instructed in the mind and design of God, relative to their <i>calling</i>, and the <i>fruit</i> which they were to bring forth to the glory of God, that they were well qualified to give <i>one another</i> suitable exhortations on every important point.</p>
<p>Instead of αλληλους, <i>one another</i>, several MSS. have αλλους, <i>others</i>, which gives a clearer sense: for, if they were <i>all</i> filled with knowledge, there was little occasion for them to admonish <i>one another</i>; but by this they were well qualified to admonish <i>others</i>-to impart the wisdom they had to those who were less instructed.</p>
