<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:16">Romans 15:16</span>. <i><b>Ministering the Gospel of God</b></i> — ιερουργουντα, <i>Acting as a priest</i>. Here is a plain allusion, says Dr. Whitby, to the Jewish sacrifices offered by the priest, and <i>sanctified</i> or made acceptable by the <i>libamen</i> offered with them; for he compares himself, in preaching the Gospel, to the <i>priest performing his</i> <i>sacred functions</i>-preparing his sacrifice to be offered.

The <i>Holy Spirit</i> is the <i>libamen</i> poured upon this sacrifice, by which it was sanctified and rendered <i>acceptable</i> to God. The words of <i>Isaiah</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:20">Isaiah 66:20</span>, <i>And they shall bring all your brethren for an</i> OFFERING <i>unto the</i> <i>Lord, out of all</i> NATIONS, might have suggested the above idea to the mind of the apostle.</p>
