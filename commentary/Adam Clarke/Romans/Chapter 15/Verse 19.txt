<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Through mighty signs and wonders</b></i> — This more fully explains the preceding clause: through the power of the Holy Ghost he was enabled to work among the Gentiles <i>mighty signs and</i> <i>wonders</i>; so that they were fully convinced that both his doctrine and mission were Divine; and therefore they cheerfully received the Gospel of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>Round about unto Illyricum</b></i> — Among ancient writers this place has gone by a great variety of names, <i>Illyria, Illyrica,</i> <i>Illyricum, Illyris</i>, and <i>Illyrium</i>. It is a country of Europe, extending from the Adriatic gulf to Pannonia: according to Pliny, it extended from the river <i>Arsia</i> to the river <i>Drinius</i>, thus including Liburnia on the <i>west</i>, and Dalmatia on the <i>east</i>. Its precise limits have not been determined by either ancient or modern geographers. It seems, according to an inscription in <i>Gruter</i>, to have been divided by Augustus into <i>two</i> provinces, the <i>upper</i> and <i>lower</i>. It now forms part of Croatia, Bosnia, Istria, and Slavonia. When the apostle says that he preached the Gospel from Jerusalem <i>round about to Illyricum</i>, he intends his <i>land</i> journeys chiefly; and, by looking at the map annexed to the Acts of the Apostles, the reader will see that from Jerusalem the apostle went <i>round</i> the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and that he passed through <i>Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia, Cilicia,</i> <i>Pamphylia, Pisidia, Lycaonia, Galatia, Pontus, Paphlagonia,</i> <i>Phrygia, Troas, Asia, Caria, Lycia, lonia, Lydia, Thrace,</i> <i>Macedonia, Thessaly</i>, and <i>Achaia</i>; besides the isles of <i>Cyprus</i> and <i>Crete</i>. And no doubt he visited many other places which are not mentioned in the New Testament.</p>
<p><i><b>I have fully preached the Gospel</b></i> — πεπληρωκεναι το ευαγγελιον, <i>I have successfully preached</i>-I have not only <i>proclaimed</i> the word, but made <i>converts</i> and founded Churches. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>, where this sense of the word πληρουν is noticed; for it signifies not only <i>fully</i> or <i>perfectly</i>, but also to <i>teach</i> with <i>prosperity</i> and <i>success</i>.</p>
