<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:2">Romans 15:2</span>. <i><b>Let every one of us please</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>neighbour</b></i> â€” For it should be a maxim with each of us to do all in our power to please our brethren; and especially in those things in which their spiritual edification is concerned. Though we should not indulge men in mere whims and caprices, yet we should bear with their ignorance and their weakness, knowing that others had much to bear with from us before we came to our present advanced state of religious knowledge.</p>
