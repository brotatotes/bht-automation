<p>Verse 20. <i><b>So have I strived to preach the Gospel</b></i> — ουτω δε φιλοτιμουμενον. For I have considered it my <i>honour</i> to preach the Gospel where that Gospel was before unknown. This is the proper import of the word φιλοτιμεισθαι; from φιλος, a <i>friend</i>, and τιμη, <i>honour</i>. As I am <i>not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, so I</i> esteem it an <i>honour</i> to preach it, and especially to proclaim it among the <i>heathen; not building on another man's foundation</i>-not watering what another apostle had planted; but cheerfully exposing myself to all kinds of dangers and hardships, in order to found new Churches.</p>
