<p>Verse 23. <i><b>But-having no more place in these parts</b></i> — Having nothing farther at present that I can do - for τοπον εχειν signifies not merely to <i>have a place of residence</i>, or the like, but <i>convenience, opportunity</i>; which is a frequent meaning of the phrase among the best Greek writers - having no large place or city, where Christianity has not yet been planted, in which I can introduce the Gospel. The apostle was then at <i>Corinth</i>; and having evangelized all those parts, he had no opportunity of breaking up any new ground.</p>
