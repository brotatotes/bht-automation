<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Whensoever I take my journey into Spain</b></i> — Where it is very likely the Gospel had not yet been planted; though <i>legendary tales</i> inform us that St. James had planted the Gospel there long before this time, and had founded many <i>bishoprics</i>! But this is as unfounded as it is ridiculous and absurd; for nothing like what is now termed a <i>bishopric</i>, nor even a <i>parish</i>, was founded for many years after this. An <i>itinerant preacher</i>, might, with more propriety, say <i>travelling circuits</i> were formed, rather than <i>bishoprics</i>. Whether the apostle ever fulfilled his design of going to Spain is unknown; but there is no evidence whatever that he did, and the presumption is that he did not undertake this voyage. Antiquity affords no proof that he fulfilled his intention.</p>
<p><i><b>I will come to you</b></i> — ελευσο μαιπρος υμας. These words are wanting in almost every MS. of note, and in the <i>Syriac</i> of <i>Erpen,</i> <i>Coptic, Vulgate, Ethiopic, Armenian</i>, and <i>Itala</i>. If the first clause of this verse be read in connection with the latter clause of the preceding, it will fully appear that this rejected clause is useless. <i>Having a great desire, these many years to come unto</i> <i>you whensoever I take my journey into Spain: for I trust to see</i> <i>you in my journey</i>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Somewhat filled with your</b></i><b> company.</b>] The word εμπλησθω, which we translate <i>filled</i>, would be better rendered <i>gratified</i> for εμπλησθηναι signifies to be <i>satisfied</i>, to <i>be gratified</i>, and to <i>enjoy</i>. AELIAN., <i>Hist. Anim</i>., lib. v., c. 21, speaking of the <i>peacock</i> spreading out his beautiful plumage, says: εα γαρ εμπλησθηναι της θεος τον παρεστωτα· "He readily permits the spectator to <i>gratify himself</i> by viewing him." And MAXIMUS TYRIUS, Dissert. 41, page 413: "That he may behold the heavens, και εμπλησθη λαμπρου φωτος, and be <i>gratified</i> with the splendour of the light." HOMER uses the word in the same sense:- </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Odyss., lib. xi., ver. 451.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "But my wife never suffered my eyes to be delighted with my son." </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>The apostle, though he had not the honour of having planted the Church at Rome, yet expected much <i>gratification</i> from the visit which he intended to pay them.</p>
