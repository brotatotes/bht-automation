<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Now I go unto Jerusalem</b></i> â€” From this and the two following verses we learn that the object of his journey to Jerusalem was, to carry a contribution made among the Gentile Christians of Macedonia and Achaia for the relief of the poor Jewish Christians at Jerusalem. About this affair he had taken great pains, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1-4">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:0">2 Corinthians 8:0</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:1-15">2 Corinthians 9:1-15</span>. His design in this affair is very evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12-13">2 Corinthians 9:12-13</span>, where he says: <i>The administration of this service not only supplieth the</i> <i>want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto</i> <i>God; whiles, by the experiment of this ministration, they glorify</i> <i>God for your professed subjection unto the Gospel of Christ, and</i> <i>for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men</i>. The apostle was in hopes that this liberal contribution, sent by the <i>Gentile</i> Christians who had been converted by St. Paul's ministry, would engage the affections of the Jewish Christians, who had been much prejudiced against the reception of the Gentiles into the Church, without being previously obliged to submit to the <i>yoke of</i> <i>the law</i>. He wished to establish a coalition between the converted Jews and Gentiles, being sensible of its great importance to the spread of the Gospel; and his procuring this contribution was one laudable device to accomplish this good end. And this shows why he so earnestly requests the prayers of the Christians at Rome, that his service which he had for Jerusalem might be accepted of the saints. See <i>Dr. Taylor</i>.</p>
