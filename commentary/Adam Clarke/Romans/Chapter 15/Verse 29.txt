<p>Verse 29. <i><b>In the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Christ.</b></i> — The words του ευαγγελιου του, <i>of the Gospel</i>, are wanting in almost every MS. of importance. <i>Griesbach</i> has left them out of the text. There is no doubt they should be <i>omitted</i>. <i>The fulness of the blessing of Christ</i> is really <i>more</i> than <i>the</i> <i>fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ</i>. He hoped to come to them not only with the <i>blessing of the Gospel</i>, but endued with the <i>gifts</i> and <i>graces</i> of the Lord Jesus himself; which he was now a constant instrument, in the hand of God, to dispense among those who were converted to the Christian faith.</p>
