<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:31">Romans 15:31</span>. <i><b>That I may be delivered from them that do not</b></i><b> </b><i><b>believe</b></i> — He knew that his countrymen, who had not received the Gospel, lay in wait for his life; and, no doubt, they thought they should do God service by destroying him, not only as an apostate, in their apprehension, from the Jewish religion, but as one who was labouring to subvert and entirely destroy it.</p>
<p><i><b>And that my service</b></i> — διακονια. But several eminent MSS. read δωροφορια, <i>the gift which I bear</i>. This probably was a <i>gloss</i>, which in many MSS. subverted the word in the text; for διακονια, <i>service</i>, in its connection here, could refer to nothing else but the <i>contribution</i> which he was carrying to the poor saints at Jerusalem.</p>
