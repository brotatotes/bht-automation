Verse Romans 15:33. The God of peace be with you â€” The whole object of the epistle is to establish peace between the believing Jews and Gentiles, and to show them their mutual obligations, and the infinite mercy of God to both; and now he concludes with praying that the God of peace-he from whom it comes, and by whom it is preserved - may be for ever with them. The word Amen, at the end, does not appear to have been written by the apostle: it is wanting in some of the most ancient MSS.1. IN the preceding chapters the apostle enjoins a very hard, but a very important and necessary, duty - that of bearing with each other, and endeavouring to think and let think, in those religious matters which are confessedly not essential to the salvation of the soul.

The God of peace is the author of Christianity; and the Prince of peace, the priest and sacrifice of it: therefore love one another, and leave off contention before it be meddled with. On this subject the advice of the pious Mr. Herbert is good: -  More than his sickness or his poverty? In love I should; but anger is not love; Nor wisdom neither: - therefore g-e-n-t-l-y m-o-v-e.
