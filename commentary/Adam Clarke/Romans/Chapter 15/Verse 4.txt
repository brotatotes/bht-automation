<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:4">Romans 15:4</span>. <i><b>For whatsoever things were written aforetime</b></i> — This refers not only to the quotation from the 69th Psalm, but to all the <i>Old Testament</i> scriptures; for it can be to no other scriptures that the apostle alludes. And, from what he says here of them, we learn that God had not intended them merely for those generations in which they were first delivered, but for the instruction of all the succeeding generations of mankind. <i>That we, through patience</i> <i>and comfort of the scriptures</i>-that we, through those remarkable examples of <i>patience</i> exhibited by the saints and followers of God, whose history is given in those scriptures, and the <i>comfort</i> which they derived from God in their patient endurance of sufferings brought upon them through their faithful attachment to truth and righteousness, <i>might have hope</i> that we shall be upheld and blessed as they were, and our sufferings become the means of our greater advances in faith and holiness, and consequently our <i>hope of</i> <i>eternal glory</i> be the more confirmed. Some think that the word παρακλησις, which we translate <i>comfort</i>, should be rendered <i>exhortation</i>; but there is certainly no need here to leave the <i>usual</i> acceptation of the term, as the word <i>comfort</i> makes a regular and consistent sense with the rest of the verse.</p>
