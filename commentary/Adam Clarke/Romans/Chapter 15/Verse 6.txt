<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:6">Romans 15:6</span>. <i><b>That ye</b></i><b> - Jews and Gentiles - </b><i><b>may with one mind</b></i> â€” Thinking the same things, and bearing with each other, after the example of Christ; and <i>one mouth</i>, in all your religious assemblies, without jarring or contentions, <i>glorify God</i> for calling you into such a state of salvation, and showing himself to be <i>your</i> loving compassionate <i>Father</i>, as he is <i>the Father of our</i> <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>.</p>
<p>It is very likely that the apostle refers here to <i>religious</i> <i>acts</i> in <i>public worship</i>, which might have been greatly interrupted by the dissensions between the converted Jews and the converted Gentiles; these differences he labours to compose; and, after having done all that was necessary in the way of instruction and exhortation, he now pours out his soul to God, who alone could rule and manage the heart, that he would enable them to think the same things, to be of the same judgment, and that all, feeling their obligation to him, might join in the sweetest harmony in every act of religious worship.</p>
