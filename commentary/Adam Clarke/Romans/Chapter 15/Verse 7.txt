Verse Romans 15:7. Wherefore receive ye one another — Προσλαμβανεσθε. Have the most affectionate regard for each other, and acknowledge each other as the servants and children of God Almighty.As Christ also received us — Καθως και ὁ Χριστος προσελαβετο ἡμας· In the same manner, and with the same cordial affection, as Christ has received us into communion with himself, and has made us partakers of such inestimable blessings, condescending to be present in all our assemblies. And as Christ has received us thus to the glory of God, so should we, Jews and Gentiles, cordially receive each other, that God's glory may be promoted by our harmony and brotherly love.
