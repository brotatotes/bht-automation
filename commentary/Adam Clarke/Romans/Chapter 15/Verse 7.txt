<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:7">Romans 15:7</span>. <i><b>Wherefore receive ye one another</b></i> — Προσλαμβανεσθε. Have the most <i>affectionate regard</i> for each other, and acknowledge each other as the servants and children of God Almighty.</p>
<p><i><b>As Christ also received us</b></i> — Καθως και ὁ Χριστος προσελαβετο ἡμας· In the same manner, and with the same <i>cordial affection</i>, as <i>Christ has received</i> us into communion with himself, and has made us partakers of such inestimable blessings, condescending to be present in all our assemblies. And as Christ has <i>received us</i> thus to the glory of God, so should we, Jews and Gentiles, cordially <i>receive each other</i>, that God's glory may be promoted by our <i>harmony</i> and brotherly love.</p>
