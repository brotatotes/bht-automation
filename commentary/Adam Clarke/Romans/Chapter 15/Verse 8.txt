<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>. <i><b>Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision</b></i> â€” To show the Gentiles the propriety of bearing with the scrupulous Jews, he shows them here that they were under the greatest obligations to this people; to whom, in the days of his flesh, Jesus Christ confined his ministry; giving the world to see that he allowed the claim of the Jews as having the <i>first</i> right to the blessings of the Gospel. And he confined his ministry thus to the Jews, to <i>confirm the truth of God</i>, contained in the promises made unto the <i>patriarchs</i>; for God had declared that thus it should be; and Jesus Christ, by coming according to the promise, has fulfilled this truth, by making good the promises: therefore, salvation is of the Jews, as a kind of <i>right</i> conveyed to them through the <i>promises</i> made to their <i>fathers</i>. But this salvation was not exclusively designed for the Jewish people; as God by his prophets had repeatedly declared.</p>
