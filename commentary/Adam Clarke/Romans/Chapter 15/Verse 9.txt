<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:9">Romans 15:9</span>. <i><b>And that the Gentiles might glorify God for</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>mercy</b></i> — As the Jews were to glorify God for his <i>truth</i>, so the Gentiles were to glorify God for his <i>mercy</i>. The Jews received the blessings of the Gospel by <i>right</i> of <i>promise</i>, which promise God had most punctually and circumstantially <i>fulfilled</i>. The Gentiles had received the same Gospel as an effect of God's mere <i>mercy</i>, having no <i>right</i> in consequence of any promise or engagement made with any of their ancestors, though they were originally included in the covenant made with Abraham; and the <i>prophets</i> had repeatedly declared that they should be made <i>equal</i> partakers of those blessings with the Jews themselves; as the apostle proceeds to prove.</p>
<p><i><b>I will confess to thee among the Gentiles</b></i> — This quotation is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:49">Psalms 18:49</span>, and shows that the Gentiles had a right to glorify God for his mercy to them; and we shall see the strength of this saying farther, when we consider a maxim of the Jews delivered in <i>Megillah</i>, fol. 14: "From the time that the children of Israel entered into the promised land, no Gentile had any right to <i>sing a hymn of praise to God</i>. But after that the Israelites were led into captivity, then the Gentiles <i>began to have a right</i> <i>to glorify God</i>." Thus the Jews themselves confess that the Gentiles have a <i>right to glorify God</i>; and this on account of being made partakers of his grace and mercy. And if, says <i>Schoettgen</i>, we have a <i>right</i> to glorify God, then it follows that our worship must be <i>pleasing</i> to him; and if it be <i>pleasing</i> to him, then it follows that this worship must be <i>good</i>, otherwise God could not be pleased with it.</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Taylor</i> gives a good paraphrase of this and the three following verses: As you Jews glorify God for his <i>truth</i>, so the Gentiles have a right to join with you in glorifying God for his <i>mercy</i>. And you have Scripture authority for admitting them to such fellowship; for instance, <i>David</i> says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:49">Psalms 18:49</span>, <i>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the</i> <i>Gentiles, and sing praises unto thy name</i>. And again, <i>Moses</i> himself says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span>, <i>Rejoice, O ye Gentiles, with his people</i>. And again, it is evident, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+117:1">Psalms 117:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+117:2">Psalms 117:2</span>, that praise to God is not to be confined to the <i>Jews</i> only, but that <i>all</i> people, as they <i>all</i> share in his goodness, should also join in thanks to their common benefactor: <i>O praise the Lord, all ye nations,</i> (Gentiles,) <i>praise him all ye</i> <i>people; for his merciful kindness is great towards us; and the</i> <i>truth of the Lord endureth for ever</i>. Again the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i> expressly and clearly declares, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span>, <i>There shall be a root of Jesse,</i> (that is, the Messiah,) <i>and he</i> <i>shall rise to reign over the Gentiles</i>, and <i>in him shall the</i> <i>Gentiles hope</i>: ελπιουσιν. And thus the apostle proves, both to the Jews and to the Gentiles, who were probably unwilling to join with each other in religious fellowship, that they had both an equal right to glorify God, being equally interested in his mercy, goodness, and truth; and that, from the evidence of the above <i>scriptures</i>, the <i>Gentiles</i> had as much right <i>to hope in Christ</i>, for the full enjoyment of his kingdom, as the Jews had: and, taking occasion from the last word <i>hope</i>, ελπιουσιν, which we improperly translate <i>trust</i>, he pours out his heart in the following affectionate prayer.</p>
