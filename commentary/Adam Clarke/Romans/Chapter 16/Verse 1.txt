<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>. <i><b>I commend unto you Phoebe</b></i> — As the apostle had not been at Rome previously to his writing this epistle, he could not have had a personal acquaintance with those members of the Church there to whom he sends these friendly salutations. It is likely that many of them were his own converts, who, in different parts of Asia Minor and Greece, had heard him preach the Gospel, and afterwards became settlers at Rome.</p>
<p>Phoebe is here termed a <i>servant</i>, διακονον, <i>a deaconess of the</i> <i>Church at Cenchrea</i>. There were deaconesses in the primitive Church, whose business it was to attend the female converts at baptism; to instruct the catechumens, or persons who were candidates for baptism; to visit the sick, and those who were in prison, and, in short, perform those religious offices for the <i>female</i> part of the Church which could not with propriety be performed by <i>men</i>. They were chosen in general out of the most experienced of the Church, and were ordinarily <i>widows</i>, who had borne <i>children</i>. Some ancient constitutions required them to be forty, others fifty, and others sixty years of age. It is evident that they were <i>ordained</i> to their office by the <i>imposition of the</i> <i>hands of the bishop</i>; and the <i>form of prayer</i> used on the occasion is extant in the apostolical constitutions. In the tenth or eleventh century the order became extinct in the <i>Latin</i> Church, but continued in the <i>Greek</i> Church till the end of the twelfth century. See <i>Broughton's</i> Dictionary, article <i>deaconess</i>.</p>
<p><i>Cenchrea</i> was a sea-port on the <i>east</i> side of the isthmus which joined the Morea to Greece, as the <i>Lechaeum</i> was the sea-port on the <i>west</i> side of the same isthmus. These were the only two havens and towns of any note, next to <i>Corinth</i>, that belonged to this territory. As the <i>Lechaeum</i> opened the road to the <i>Ionian</i> sea, so <i>Cenchrea</i> opened the road to the <i>AEgean</i>; and both were so advantageously situated for commerce that they were very rich. These two places are now usually denominated the <i>Gulf</i> of <i>Lepanto</i>, and the <i>Gulf</i> of <i>Ingia</i> or <i>Egina</i>. It was on the isthmus, between these two <i>ports</i>, which was about six miles wide, that the Isthmian games were celebrated; to which St. Paul makes such frequent allusions.</p>
