<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:10">Romans 16:10</span>. <i><b>Apelles, approved in Christ</b></i> â€” A man who, on different occasions, had given the highest proofs of the sincerity and depth of his religion. Some suppose that <i>Apelles</i> was the same with <i>Apollos</i>: whoever he was, he had given every demonstration of being a genuine Christian.</p>
<p><i><b>Of Aristobulus'</b></i> household.] It is doubted whether this person was converted, as the apostle does not <i>salute</i> him, but his <i>household</i>; or as the margin reads, <i>his friends</i>. He might have been a Roman of considerable distinction, who, though not converted himself, had Christians among his <i>servants</i> or his <i>slaves</i>. But, whatever he was, it is likely that he was <i>dead</i> at this time, and therefore those of his household only are referred to by the apostle.</p>
