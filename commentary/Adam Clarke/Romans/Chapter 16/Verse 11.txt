<p><i><b>Of the</b></i><b> household </b><i><b>of Narcissus</b></i> — Probably <i>dead</i> also, as we have supposed <i>Aristobulus</i> to have been at this time.</p>

There was a person of the name of <i>Narcissus</i>, who was a freed man of the Emperor Claudius, mentioned by <i>Suetonius</i> in his life of that prince, cap. 37; and by <i>Tacitus</i>, An., lib. xii. cap. 57: but there does not seem any reason to suppose that this was the person designed by St. Paul.</p>
