<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:12">Romans 16:12</span>. <i><b>Tryphena and Tryphosa</b></i> â€” Two holy women, who it seems were assistants to the apostle in his work, probably by <i>exhorting,</i> <i>visiting the sick</i>, c. <i>Persis</i> was another woman, who it seems excelled the preceding for, of her it is said, she <i>laboured much</i> <i>in the Lord</i>. We learn from this, that Christian <i>women</i>, as well as <i>men</i>, laboured in the ministry of the word. In those times of simplicity all persons, whether men or women, who had received the knowledge of the truth, believed it to be their duty to propagate it to the uttermost of their power. Many have spent much useless labour in endeavouring to prove that these women did not <i>preach</i>. That there were some <i>prophetesses</i>, as well as <i>prophets</i> in the Christian Church, we learn; and that a <i>woman</i> might <i>pray</i> or <i>prophesy</i>, provided she had her <i>head covered</i>, we know; and that whoever <i>prophesied</i> spoke unto others to <i>edification, exhortation,</i> <i>and comfort</i>, St. Paul declares, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>. And that no preacher can do <i>more</i>, every person must acknowledge; because to <i>edify,</i> <i>exhort</i>, and <i>comfort</i>, are the prime ends of the Gospel ministry. If <i>women</i> thus <i>prophesied</i>, then women <i>preached</i>. There is, however, much more than this implied in the Christian ministry, of which men only, and men called of God, are capable.</p>
