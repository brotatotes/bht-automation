<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:13">Romans 16:13</span>. <i><b>Rufus, chosen in the Lord</b></i> — τον εκλεκον, one of <i>great excellence</i> in Christianity; a <i>choice</i> man, as we would say. So the word εκλεκτος often signifies. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:31">Psalms 78:31</span>: <i>They smote</i> τους εκλεκτους, <i>the chosen men that were of Israel</i>. So εκλεκτα μνημεια are <i>choice sepulchres</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:6">Genesis 23:6</span>: εκλεκτα των δωρων <i>choice gifts</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+12:11">Deuteronomy 12:11</span>; and ανδρες εκλεκτοι, <i>choice men</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jdg+20:16">Judges 20:16</span>. By the same use of the word, the companions of Paul and Barnabas are termed <i>chosen men</i>, εκλεξαμενους ανδρας, persons in whom the Church of God could confide. See <i>Whitby</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>His mother and mine.</b></i> — It is not likely that the mother of Rufus was the mother of Paul; but while she was the natural mother of the former, she acted <i>as a mother</i> to the latter. We say of a person of this character, that she is a <i>motherly</i> woman. Among the ancients, he or she who acted a kind, instructing, and indulgent part to another, was styled the <i>father</i> or <i>mother</i> of such a one. So <i>Terence</i>:- </p>
