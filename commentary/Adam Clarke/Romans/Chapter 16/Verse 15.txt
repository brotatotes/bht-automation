<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:15">Romans 16:15</span>. <i><b>Salute Philologus</b></i>, c.] Of these several persons, though much has been conjectured, nothing certain is known. Even the names of some are so ambiguous that we know not whether they were <i>men</i> or <i>women</i>. They were persons well known to St. Paul, and undoubtedly were such as had gone from different places where the apostle had preached to sojourn or settle at Rome. One thing we may remark, that there is no mention of St. <i>Peter</i>, who, according to the Roman and papistical catalogue of bishops, must have been at Rome at this time if he were not now at Rome, the foundation stone of Rome's ascendancy, of Peter's supremacy, and of the uninterrupted succession, is taken away, and the whole fabric falls to the ground. But if Peter were at Rome at this time, Paul would have sent his salutations to <i>him</i> in the <i>first</i> place; and if Peter were there, he must have been there, according to the papistical doctrine, as <i>bishop</i> and <i>vicar of Jesus Christ</i>; but if he were there, is it likely that he should have been passed by, while <i>Andronicus</i> and <i>Junia</i> are mentioned as of <i>note among the</i> <i>apostles</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span>, and that St. Paul should call on the <i>people</i> to remedy the <i>disorders</i> that had crept in among themselves; should not these directions have been given to <i>Peter</i>, the <i>head of the Church</i>? And if there were a Church, in the papistical sense of the word, founded there, of which Peter was the <i>head</i>, is it likely that that Church should be in <i>the house of Priscilla and Aquila</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>. But it is a loss of time to refute such ridiculous and groundless pretensions. It is very likely that Peter, so far from being universal bishop at Rome, never saw the city in his life.</p>
