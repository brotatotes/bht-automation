<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:16">Romans 16:16</span>. <i><b>Salute one another with a holy kiss.</b></i> — In those early times the <i>kiss</i>, as a token of <i>peace, friendship</i>, and <i>brotherly love</i>, was frequent among all people; and the Christians used it in their public assemblies, as well as in their occasional meetings. This was at last laid aside, not because it was abused, but because, the Church becoming very numerous, the thing was impossible. In some countries the kiss of friendship is still common; and in such countries it is scarcely ever abused, nor is it an incentive to evil, because it is <i>customary</i> and <i>common</i>. Shaking of hands is now substituted for it in almost all Christian congregations.</p>
<p><i><b>The Churches of Christ salute you.</b></i> — The word πασαι, ALL, is added here by some of the most reputable MSS. and principal versions; and <i>Griesbach</i> has received it into his text. St. Paul must mean, here, that all the Churches in Greece and Asia, through which he had passed, in which the faith of the Christians at Rome was known, spoke of them affectionately and honourably; and probably knowing the apostle's design of visiting Rome, desired to be kindly remembered to the Church in that city.</p>
