<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Mark them which cause divisions</b></i> — Several MSS. read ασφαλως σκοπειτε, <i>look sharply after them</i>; let <i>them</i> have no kiss of charity nor peace, because they strive to make <i>divisions</i>, and thus set the flock of Christ at variance among themselves; and from these <i>divisions, offences</i> (σκανδαλα, <i>scandals</i>) are produced; and this is contrary to that doctrine of <i>peace, unity</i>, and <i>brotherly love which you have</i> learned. <i>Look sharply</i> after such that they do you no evil, <i>and avoid them</i>-give them no countenance, and have no religious fellowship with them.</p>
