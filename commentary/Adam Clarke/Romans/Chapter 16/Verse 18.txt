<p>Verse 18. <i><b>They - serve not our Lord Jesus</b></i> — They profess to be apostles, but they are not apostles of CHRIST; they neither <i>do</i> his will, nor <i>preach</i> his <i>doctrine; they serve their own belly</i> - they hate intruded themselves into the Church of Christ that they might get a secular support; it is for <i>worldly</i> gain alone that they take up the profession of the ministry: they have no Divine credentials; they convert not the <i>heathen</i> nor the <i>ungodly</i>, for they have no Divine unction; <i>but by good words and fair speeches</i> (for they have no <i>miraculous</i> nor <i>saving</i> powers) <i>deceive the hearts</i> <i>of the simple, perverting</i> Christian <i>converts</i>, that they may get their property, and thus secure a maintenance for themselves. The Church of God has ever been troubled with such pretended <i>pastors</i> - men who FEED <i>themselves</i>, not the <i>flock</i>; men who are too proud to beg, and too lazy to work; who have neither grace nor gifts to plant the standard of the cross on the devil's territories, and by the power of Christ make inroads upon his kingdom, and spoil him of his subjects. On the contrary, by sowing the seeds of <i>dissension</i>, by means of <i>doubtful disputations</i>, and the propagation of <i>scandals</i>; by glaring and insinuating speeches, χρηστολογιας, for they affect <i>elegance</i> and <i>good</i> <i>breeding</i>, they rend Christian congregations, form a party for themselves, and thus live on the spoils of the Church of God.</p>
<p>Should it be asked, Whom do you intend by this description? I answer: No <i>soul</i>, nor <i>party</i>, but <i>such as the description suits.</i> <i>Irasceris.? - De</i> TE <i>fabula narratur</i>. O, you are angry, are you? O, then, the cap fits you - put it on.</p>
