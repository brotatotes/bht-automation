<p>Verse 20. <i><b>The God of peace</b></i> — Who neither sends nor favours such disturbers of the tranquillity of his Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall bruise Satan</b></i> — Shall give you the dominion over the great <i>adversary</i> of your souls, and over all his <i>agents</i> who, through his influence, endeavour to destroy your peace and subvert your minds.</p>
<p>Several critics suppose that the word <i>Satan</i> is a sort of collective term here, by which all <i>opposers</i> and <i>adversaries</i> are meant; and especially those false teachers to whom he refers above.</p>
<p><i><b>The grace of our Lord</b></i> — That you may be truly wise simple, obedient, and steady in the truth, may the favour or gracious influence of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you! without which you cannot be preserved from evil, nor do any thing that is good.</p>
<p>Here the apostle appears to have intended to conclude his epistle; but afterwards he added a <i>postscript</i>, if not <i>two</i>, as we shall see below. Several ancient MSS. omit the whole of this clause, probably thinking that it had been borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:24">Romans 16:24</span>; but on the ground that the apostle might have added a postscript or two, not having immediate opportunity to send the epistle there is no need for this supposition.</p>
