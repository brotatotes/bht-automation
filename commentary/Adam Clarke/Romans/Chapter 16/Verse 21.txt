<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Timotheus my workfellow</b></i> — This is on all hands allowed to be the same <i>Timothy</i> to whom St. Paul directs the two epistles which are still extant. See some account of him in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>Lucius</b></i> — This was probably Luke the <i>evangelist</i>, and writer of the book called <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>. For a short account of him see the <i>Preface</i> to that book.</p>
<p><i><b>Jason</b></i> — It is likely that this is the same person mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:7">Acts 17:7</span>, who at Thessalonica received the apostles into his house, and befriended them at the risk both of his property and life.</p>
<p><i><b>Sosipater</b></i> — He was a Berean, the son of one <i>Pyrrhus</i>, a Jew, by birth, and accompanied St. Paul from Greece into Asia, and probably into Judea. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>.</p>
