<p>Verse 22. <i><b>I Tertius, who wrote</b></i><b> this </b><i><b>epistle</b></i> — Some eminent commentators suppose <i>Tertius</i> to be the same with <i>Silas</i>-the companion of St. Paul. If this were so, it is strange that the <i>name</i> which is generally given him elsewhere in Scripture should not be used in this place. I have already noticed (<i>Preface</i>, page v.) that some learned men have supposed that St. Paul wrote this epistle in <i>Syriac</i>, and that Tertius translated it into Greek; but this can never agree with the declaration here: I Tertius, who <i>wrote</i>, γραψας την επιστολην, this epistle; not <i>translated</i> or <i>interpreted</i> it. It appears that St. Paul dictated it to him, and he wrote it down from the apostle's mouth; and here introduces himself as joining with St. Paul in affectionate wishes for their welfare.</p>
<p><i><b>Salute you in the Lord.</b></i> — I wish you well in the name of the Lord: or, I feel for you that affectionate respect which the grace of the Lord Jesus inspires. It is not clear whether the two following verses be the words of <i>Tertius</i> or St. Paul.</p>
