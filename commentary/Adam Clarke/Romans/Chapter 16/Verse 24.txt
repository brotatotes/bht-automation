<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:24">Romans 16:24</span>. <i><b>The grace of our Lord</b></i> â€” This is the conclusion of <i>Tertius</i>, and is similar to what St. Paul used above. Hence it is possible that Tertius wrote the whole of the 22d, 23rd, and 24th verses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22-24">Romans 16:22-24</span> without receiving any particular instructions from St. Paul, except the bare permission to add his own salutations with those of his particular friends.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of disagreement among the MSS. and versions relative to this verse; some rejecting it entirely, and some of those which place the following verses at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>, inserting it at the end of the 27th verse in that place. The reader who chooses may consult <i>Wetstein</i> and <i>Griesbach</i> on these discordances.</p>
