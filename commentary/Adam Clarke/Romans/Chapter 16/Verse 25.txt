<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>. <i><b>Now to him</b></i> — In <i>Clarke's note at "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span><i>"</i>, I have shown that this and the following verses are by the most reputable MSS. and versions placed at the end of that chapter, which is supposed by most critics to be their proper place. Some of the arguments adduced in favour of this transposition may be found in the note above mentioned. I shall therefore refer to Griesbach, and proceed to make a few short remarks on the verses as they occur <i>here</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of power to stablish you</b></i> — To that God, without whom nothing is <i>wise</i>, nothing <i>strong</i>; who is as willing to teach as he is <i>wise</i>; as ready to <i>help</i> as he is <i>strong</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>According to my Gospel</b></i> — That Gospel which explains and publishes God's purpose of taking the Gentiles to be his people under the Messiah, without subjecting them to the law of Moses. This is what he here calls the preaching of Jesus Christ; for without this he did not think, as Mr. Locke observes, that Christ vas preached to the Gentiles as he ought to be; and therefore in several places of his epistle to the <i>Galatians</i> he calls it <i>the</i> <i>truth</i>, and the <i>truth of the Gospel</i>, and uses the like expressions to the <i>Ephesians</i> and <i>Colossians</i>. This is that <i>mystery</i> which he is so much concerned that the <i>Ephesians</i> should understand and adhere to firmly, and which was revealed to him according to that Gospel whereof he was made a minister. And it is probable that this grand <i>mystery</i> of bringing the Gentiles into the kingdom of God, without passing through the <i>rites</i> of the Mosaic law, was revealed more particularly to St. Paul than to any other of the apostles, and that he preached it more <i>pointedly</i>, and certainly with <i>more success</i>. See <i>Taylor</i> and <i>Locke</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which was kept secret</b></i> — This purpose of calling the Gentiles, and giving them equal privileges to the Jews, without obliging them to submit to <i>circumcision</i>, &amp;c.</p>
