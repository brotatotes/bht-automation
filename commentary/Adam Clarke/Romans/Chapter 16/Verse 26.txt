<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>. <i><b>But now is made manifest</b></i> — Now, under the New Testament dispensation, and by my preaching.</p>
<p><i><b>By the scriptures of the prophets</b></i> — Hints relative to this important work being scattered up and down through all their works, but no clear revelation that the Gentiles, who should be admitted into the Church, should be admitted <i>without passing under</i> <i>the yoke of the Mosaic law</i>. This was the <i>point</i> which was kept secret: as to the <i>calling</i> of the Gentiles, this was declared in general terms by the prophets, and the apostle quotes and makes a most important use of their predictions; but the other was a point on which the prophets gave no information, and it seems to have been peculiarly revealed to St. Paul, who received the <i>commandment</i> <i>of the everlasting God</i> to make it known εις παντα τα εθνη, to <i>all</i> <i>the Gentiles</i>-all the people of the earth that were not of Jewish extraction. And it was to be made known for the <i>obedience of</i> <i>faith</i>, that they might <i>believe</i> its <i>doctrines</i> and <i>obey</i> its <i>precepts</i>; its universal voice requiring repentance towards God, faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and circumcision of the heart, in the place of all Jewish rites and ceremonies.</p>
