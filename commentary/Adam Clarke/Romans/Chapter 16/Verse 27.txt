<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>. <i><b>To God only wise</b></i> — This comes in with great propriety. He alone who is the fountain of <i>wisdom</i> and <i>knowledge</i>, had all this mystery in himself; and he alone who knew the <i>times,</i> <i>places, persons</i>, and <i>circumstances</i>, could reveal the whole; and he has revealed all in such a way as not only to manifest his unsearchable <i>wisdom</i>, but also his infinite goodness: therefore, <i>to</i> <i>him be glory</i> for his <i>wisdom</i> in devising this most admirable plan; and his <i>goodness</i> in sending <i>Christ Jesus</i> to execute it; to Him, through Christ Jesus, be glory <i>for ever</i>! Because this plan is to last for <i>ever</i>; and is to have no issue but in eternal glory.</p>
<p><i><b>Written to the Romans from Corinthus</b></i>, c.] That this epistle was written from Corinth is almost universally believed. That <i>Phoebe</i> was a <i>deaconess</i> of the Church at Cenchrea, we have seen in the first verse of this chapter and that the epistle might have been sent by her to Rome is possible; but that she should have been the writer of the epistle, as this subscription states, εγραφη δια Φοιβης, is false, for <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span> shows that Tertius was the writer, though by inserting the words <i>and sent</i>, we represent her rather as the <i>carrier</i> than the writer. This subscription, however, stands on very questionable grounds. It is wanting in almost all the ancient MSS.; and even of those which are more modern, few have it <i>entirely</i>, as in our common editions. It has already been noted that the <i>subscriptions</i> to the sacred books are of little or no authority, all having been added in latter times, and frequently by injudicious hands. The most ancient have simply <i>To the Romans</i>, or the Epistle <i>to the Romans is finished</i>. The word <i>Amen</i> was seldom added by the inspired writers, and here it is wanting in almost all the ancient MSS. As this was a word in frequent use in religious services, pious people would naturally employ it in finishing the reading or copying of this epistle, as they would thereby express their conviction of the <i>truth</i> of its contents, and their desire that the promises contained in it might be fulfilled to them and to the Church at large; and in this sense the word is not only harmless but useful. May the fulness of the Gentiles be brought in, and may all Israel be saved! This is treated of at large in this epistle; and to this prayer let every pious reader say AMEN! Often this word seems to be used as we use the word <i>finis</i>, i.e. the end. See the observations on this word at the end of the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>BEFORE I conclude this work, I shall beg leave to add several important observations, chiefly extracted from <i>Dr. Taylor</i>.</p>
