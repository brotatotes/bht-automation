<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>. <i><b>Greet Priscilla and Aquila</b></i> â€” This pious couple had been obliged to leave Rome, on the edict of Claudius, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>, and take refuge in Greece. It is likely that they returned to Rome at the death of Claudius, or whenever the decree was annulled. It seems they had greatly contributed to assist the apostle in his important labours. Instead of <i>Priscilla</i>, the principal MSS. and versions have <i>Prisca</i>, which most critics suppose to be the genuine reading.</p>
