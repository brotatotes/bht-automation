Verse Romans 16:3. Greet Priscilla and Aquila â€” This pious couple had been obliged to leave Rome, on the edict of Claudius, see Acts 18:2, and take refuge in Greece. It is likely that they returned to Rome at the death of Claudius, or whenever the decree was annulled. It seems they had greatly contributed to assist the apostle in his important labours. Instead of Priscilla, the principal MSS. and versions have Prisca, which most critics suppose to be the genuine reading.
