<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>. <i><b>The Church that is in their house.</b></i> — In these primitive times no such <i>places</i> existed as those which we now term <i>churches</i>; the word always signifying the <i>congregation</i> or <i>assembly</i> of believers, and not the <i>place</i> they assembled in. See the term defined at the end of the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Epenetus-the first fruits of Achaia</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>, the <i>house</i> or family of <i>Stephanas</i> is said to be the first fruits of Achaia: how then can it be said here, that <i>Epenetus</i> was the first fruits, or first person who had received the Gospel in that district? <i>Ans</i>. - Epenetus might have been one of the family of Stephanas; for it is not said that <i>Stephanas</i> was the first fruits, but his <i>house</i> or <i>family</i>; and there can be no impropriety in supposing that one of that house or family was called <i>Epenetus</i>; and that this person, being the only one of the family now at Rome, might be mentioned as the <i>first fruits</i> of Achaia; that is, <i>one</i> of that <i>family</i> which <i>first</i> received the Gospel in that country. This would rationally account for the apparent difficulty, were we sure that αχαιας, of <i>Achaia</i>, was the true reading: but this is more than doubtful, for ασιας, <i>of Asia</i>, is the reading of ABCDEFG, some others; the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>; and some of the chief of the <i>fathers</i>. On this evidence <i>Griesbach</i> has admitted it into the text. Yet the other reading is sufficiently natural, for the reasons already assigned.</p>
