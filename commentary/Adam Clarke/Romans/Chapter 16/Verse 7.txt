<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span>. <i><b>Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen</b></i> — As the word συγγενεις signifies <i>relatives</i>, whether <i>male</i> or <i>female</i>, and as <i>Junia</i> may probably be the name of a <i>woman</i>, the wife of Andronicus, it would be better to say <i>relatives</i> than <i>kinsmen</i>. But probably St. Paul means no more than that they were <i>Jews</i>; for, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span>, he calls all the Jews <i>his kinsmen according to the flesh</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>My fellow prisoners</b></i> — As Paul was in prison often, it is likely that these persons shared this honour with him on some occasion, which is not distinctly marked.</p>
<p><i><b>Of note among the apostles</b></i> — Whether this intimates that they were <i>noted apostles</i> or only highly reputed <i>by the apostles</i>, is not absolutely clear; but the latter appears to me the most probable. They were not only well known to St. Paul, but also to the rest of the apostles.</p>
<p><i><b>In Christ before me.</b></i> — That is, they were converted to Christianity before Paul was; probably at the day of pentecost, or by the ministry of Christ himself, or by that of the seventy disciples.</p>
