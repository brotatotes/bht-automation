Verse Romans 16:7. Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen — As the word συγγενεις signifies relatives, whether male or female, and as Junia may probably be the name of a woman, the wife of Andronicus, it would be better to say relatives than kinsmen. But probably St. Paul means no more than that they were Jews; for, in Romans 9:3, he calls all the Jews his kinsmen according to the flesh.My fellow prisoners — As Paul was in prison often, it is likely that these persons shared this honour with him on some occasion, which is not distinctly marked.Of note among the apostles — Whether this intimates that they were noted apostles or only highly reputed by the apostles, is not absolutely clear; but the latter appears to me the most probable. They were not only well known to St. Paul, but also to the rest of the apostles.In Christ before me. — That is, they were converted to Christianity before Paul was; probably at the day of pentecost, or by the ministry of Christ himself, or by that of the seventy disciples.
