<p>Dr. Taylor makes the following sensible observations at the commencement of this chapter.</p>
<p>"The representation of the moral state of the heathen world, in the foregoing chapter, is a demonstration of the <i>necessity of the</i> <i>Gospel</i> for the reformation and salvation of man. And how rich is the favour wherewith God has visited the world! To have destroyed a race of apostate rebels, who had abused their understandings and every gift of a bountiful Creator, would have been <i>justice</i>; to have spared them would have been <i>lenity</i> and <i>goodness</i>; but to send his only begotten Son from heaven to redeem us from all iniquity and ungodliness by his own blood; to grant us a free pardon for all our sins; to put us in a state of mercy and salvation; to take us into his kingdom and family; to give us an inheritance among his saints; to bless us with immortality and all spiritual blessings in heavenly places;-this is most wonderful and exuberant favour. Rightly is the doctrine which teaches it called the <i>Gospel</i>, or <i>glad tidings</i>. One would think it could not possibly have met with opposition from any part of mankind. But the JEW opposed it! He abhorred the <i>Gentile</i>, and contradicted the grace that honoured and saved him. The apostle pleads and defends our cause. His business is to confound the <i>Jew</i>, and to prove that <i>we</i> have as good a right as he to all the blessings of the Messiah's kingdom. And, by his description of the vicious state of the Gentiles, in the former chapter, he has wisely made his advantage of the prejudices of the <i>Jew</i>; for nothing could please him more than the preceding discourse, in which the Gentiles are reduced to so vile and abject a state. Thus the apostle gives him an opportunity to condemn the Gentiles; but he does this that he may the more effectually humble him in this chapter; in which he proves that the Jews, having in an aggravated manner despised the goodness and broken the law of God, were as obnoxious to his wrath as the Gentiles; and if so, how could they, with any conscience or modesty, arrogate all the Divine mercy to <i>themselves</i>, or pretend that others were unworthy of it, when <i>they</i> had done as much or more to forfeit it! Must they not exclude themselves from being the people of God under the Gospel, by the same reason that they would have the Gentiles excluded! But this was an argument highly ungrateful to the Jew; and it would be very difficult to fix any conviction upon his mind. Therefore the apostle addresses him in a covert way:-<i>Thou</i> <i>art therefore inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest</i>; not giving out expressly that he meant the <i>Jew</i>, that the Jew might more calmly attend to his reasoning, while he was not apprehensive that <i>he</i> was the man. This point secured, the apostle, very judiciously and with great force of reasoning, turns his thoughts from his present superior advantages to the awful day of judgment, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:5">Romans 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:6">Romans 2:6</span>, when God, in the most impartial equity, will render to all mankind, without exception, according to their works. Thus the apostle grounds his following argument, very methodically and solidly, in God's equal regards to all men, in all nations, who uprightly practise truth and godliness; and his disapproving, and at last condemning, all men, in any nation, however privileged, who live wickedly. This was a blow at the root, and demolished, in the most effectual manner, the <i>Jew's</i> prejudices in favour of his own nation, and the unkind thoughts he had entertained of the <i>Gentiles</i>. For, if a Jew could be convinced that a sober, upright heathen might be blessed with eternal salvation, he must be persuaded that it was no absurd matter that believing <i>Gentiles</i> should <i>now</i> be pardoned, and taken into the visible Church. Thus the apostle advances with great skill, insinuating himself, by degrees, into the Jew's conscience. It is reasoning is well adapted to encourage the <i>Gentile</i>, humbled by the dismal representation in the preceding chapter; for he would here see that he was not utterly abandoned of God, but might, upon good grounds, hope for his mercy and kindness."</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1">Romans 2:1</span>. <i><b>That judgest</b></i> — οκρινων, <i>the judger</i>; thou <i>assumest</i> the character of a judge, and in that character condemnest others who are less guilty than thyself.</p>
