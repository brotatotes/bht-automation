<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:11">Romans 2:11</span>. <i><b>For there is no respect of persons with God.</b></i> â€” The righteous Judge will not act according to any principle of <i>partiality</i>; the <i>character</i> and <i>conduct</i>, alone of the persons shall weigh with him. He will take no wicked man to glory, let his nation or advantages be what they may; and he will send no righteous man to perdition, though brought up in the very bosom of <i>Gentilism</i>. And as he will judge in that day according to <i>character</i> and <i>conduct</i>, so his judgment will proceed on the ground of the <i>graces, privileges</i>, and <i>blessings</i> which they had received, improved or abused. And as there is no respect of persons with God in judgment, so there can be none in the <i>previous</i> administration of his <i>saving</i> blessings. He that will be condemned for his unrighteousness, will be condemned on the ground that he had sufficient grace afforded him for the salvation of his soul; and his condemnation will rest on the simple principle, that he <i>abused the grace</i> which was sufficient to save him, by acting in opposition to its dictates and influence. No man, in that great day, shall be brought to heaven through any <i>partiality</i> of the Judge; and no man sent to hell because God did not afford him sufficient grace, or because he had made a <i>decree</i> which rendered even his use of it <i>ineffectual</i> to his salvation. In reference to the great design of God, in the salvation of man, it shall be said,-in time, at the day of judgment, and throughout eternity,- -THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS WITH GOD.</p>
