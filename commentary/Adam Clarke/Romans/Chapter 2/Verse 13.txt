Verse Romans 2:13. For not the hearers of the law, c.] It does not follow, because one people are favoured with a Divine revelation, that therefore they shall be saved while the others who have not had that revelation, shall finally perish: this is not God's procedure; where he has given a law-a Divine revelation, he requires obedience to that law; and only those who have been doers of that law-who have lived according to the light and privileges granted in that revelation, shall be justified-shall be finally acknowledged to be such as are fit for the kingdom of God.
