<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>. <i><b>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law</b></i>, c.] Nor does it follow that the Gentiles who have not had a Divine revelation, shall either perish, because they had it not or their unrighteous conduct pass <i>unpunished</i>, because not having this revelation might be considered as an excuse for their sins.</p>
<p><i><b>Do by nature the things contained in the law</b></i> â€” Do, without this Divine revelation, through that light which God imparts to every man, <i>the things contained in the law</i> - act according to justice, mercy, temperance and truth, the practice of which the revealed law so powerfully enjoins; <i>these are a law unto themselves</i> - they are not accountable to any other law, and are not to be judged by any dispensation different from that under which they live.</p>
<p><i>Rabbi Tanchum</i> brings in the Supreme Being as saying: <i>When I</i> <i>decreed any thing against the Gentiles, to whom I have not given</i> <i>laws and statutes</i>, and they know what I have decreed; immediately they repent; but the Israelites do not so. <i>Tanchum</i>, fol. 43. 2.</p>
