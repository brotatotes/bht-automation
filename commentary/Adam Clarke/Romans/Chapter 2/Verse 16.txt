<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>. <i><b>In the day when God shall judge</b></i> — And all this shall be farther exemplified and proved in the day when God shall judge the <i>secrets of men by Jesus Christ</i>; which judgment shall be according <i>to my Gospel</i>-according to what I am now laying down before you, relative to the <i>impartiality of God</i>, and his <i>righteous</i> procedure in judging men, not according to their opinions or prejudices, not according to revelations which they never possessed, but according to the various advantages or disadvantages of their political, religious, or domestic situation in life.</p>
<p>Much stress has been laid on the word, φυσει, <i>by nature</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>, as if the apostle designed to intimate that <i>nature</i>, independently of the influence of Divine grace, possessed such principles as were sufficient to guide a man to glory. But certainly the term cannot be so understood here. I rather think that the sense given to it in <i>Suicer's</i> Thesaurus, vol ii. col. 1475, <i>reipsa, revera</i>, CERTAINLY, TRULY, is its sense here: <i>for when the Gentiles, which</i> <i>have not the law</i>, φυσει ποιη, TRULY, or in <i>effect</i>, DO <i>the</i> <i>things contained in the law</i>, c. This seems to be its sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8">Galatians 4:8</span>: <i>When ye knew not God, ye did service to them which</i> φυσει, CERTAINLY <i>are no gods</i> i.e. are <i>false</i> gods. <i>Suicer</i> quotes <i>Cyril</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>, (sub Anathematismo iii. in Actis Ephesinis, p. 212,) speaking of the union of the two natures in Christ; he calls this <i>union</i> φυσικην, <i>natural</i>; that is, says he, αληθη, true, or <i>real</i>. He adds, that the word should be thus understood in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>: <i>We were by nature</i>, φυσει, <i>children of wrath</i>; and says, φυσει αντι του αληθως. φυσει <i>is here used for</i> αληθως, TRULY; <i>We</i> <i>were</i> TRULY, INCONTESTABLY, <i>the children of wrath, even as others</i>. That is, like the rest of mankind, we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God, and, consequently are exposed to <i>punishment</i>. Some think that this text refers to the <i>natural</i> <i>corruption</i> of man; but, although it is true that man comes into the world corrupt, and that all men, since the <i>fall</i>, are very far gone from original righteousness, yet it is not <i>clear</i> that the text in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>, speaks of any other thing than the <i>effects</i> of this degeneracy.</p>
<p>I prefer this sense, in the passage in question, to that which says the <i>light of nature</i>, or <i>natural instinct</i>, is here meant; for I know of no light in nature that is not kindled there by the <i>grace of God</i>. But I have no objection to this sense: "When the Gentiles, which have not the law, do, by the influence of God upon their hearts, the things contained in the law, they are a law unto themselves; that light and influence serving instead of a Divine revelation." That the Gentiles did <i>really</i> do the things contained in the law, in reference to what is termed <i>natural justice</i>, and made the wisest distinctions relative to the great principles of the doctrine of <i>civil</i> RIGHTS and WRONGS, every man conversant with their writings will admit. And in reference to this the word φυσει may be legitimately understood thus-they <i>incontestably</i> did the things contained in the law, c.</p>
<p>The passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>, <i>Their thoughts-accusing or excusing one another</i>, certainly does not refer to any expostulations or operations of <i>conscience</i> for this is referred to in the preceding clause. The words <i>accusing</i>, κατηγορουντων, and <i>excusing</i>, απολογουμενων, <i>answering</i> or <i>defending one another</i>, μεταζυαλληλων, <i>among themselves</i>, are all forensic or <i>law</i> terms, and refer to the mode of conducting <i>suits</i> <i>of law</i> in courts of justice, where one is <i>plaintiff</i>, who produces his <i>accusation</i>; another is <i>defendant</i>, who <i>rebuts</i> the <i>charge</i> and defends himself; and then the business is argued before the judges. This process shows that they have a law of <i>their own</i>, and that to this law it belongs to adjust differences-to right those who have suffered wrong, and to punish the guilty.</p>
<p>As to the phrase <i>written in their hearts</i>, it is here opposed to the Jewish laws, which were <i>written</i> on <i>tables of stone</i>. The <i>Jews</i> drew the maxims by which their conduct was regulated from a <i>Divine</i> <i>revelation</i>: the GENTILES theirs from what God, in the course of his providence and gracious influence, had shown them to be right, useful, and necessary. And with them this law was <i>well known and</i> <i>affectionately regarded</i>; for this is one meaning of the phrase, <i>written in the heart</i>. It was from this true light, enlightening the Gentiles, that they had so many wise and wholesome laws; laws which had been among them from time immemorial, and of which they did not know the origin. Thus Sophocles, in the noble speech which he puts in the mouth of Antigone:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Ου γαρ τι νυν γε κὐχθες, αλλ' αει ποτε</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Ζη ταυτα, κοὑδεις οιδεν εξ ὁτου φανη.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Not now, nor yesterday, but evermore</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> These laws have lived: nor know we whence they came."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Antig. ver. 463-4. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>These are the laws, νομινα, which the Spirit of God wrote originally on their hearts; and which, in different forms, they had committed to writing.</p>
