<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Knowest his will</b></i> — Hast been favoured with a revelation of his own will, immediately from himself.</p>
<p><i><b>The things that are more excellent</b></i> — τα δισφεροντα, <i>The things</i> <i>that differ</i>-that revelation which God has given of himself makes the nicest <i>distinctions</i> between <i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i>; between <i>vice</i> and <i>virtue</i>; showing how you should walk so as to please God, and, consequently, acquire the <i>most excellent</i> portion that human spirits can have on this side heaven: for all these <i>blessings</i> ye acknowledge to receive from your <i>law</i>, being instructed, κατηχουμενος, being <i>catechized</i>, from your infancy, in the knowledge of Divine things.</p>
