<p>Verse 20. <i><b>An instructer of the foolish</b></i>, c.] Ye believe the Gentiles to be <i>babes</i> and <i>fools</i> when compared with yourselves that ye alone possess the only <i>true knowledge</i>; that ye are the only <i>favourites</i> of Heaven; and that all nations must look up to you as possessing the only <i>form of knowledge</i>, μορφωσιν της γνωσεως, the grand <i>scheme</i> and <i>draught</i> of all true <i>science</i>, of every thing that is worthy to be learned: the system of eternal <i>truth</i>, derived <i>from</i> <i>the law</i>. If, therefore, ye act not as becomes those who have such eminent advantages, it must be to your endless disgrace and infamy.</p>
