<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Thou therefore</b></i> â€” Dr. Taylor has paraphrased this and the three following verses thus: "What signify your pretensions to knowledge, and the office of teaching others, if you have no regard to your own doctrine? What are you the better for preaching against <i>theft</i>, if you are a <i>thief</i> yourself? Or for declaring <i>adultery</i> unlawful, if you live in the practice of it? Or for representing <i>idolatry</i> abominable, if you are guilty of <i>sacrilege</i>? What honours or singular favours do you deserve, if, while you glory in the law and your religious privileges, you dishonour God, and discredit his religion, by transgressing his law, and living in open contradiction to your profession? And this is more than supposition; notorious instances might be produced of the forementioned crimes, whereby the Jews of the present age have brought a reproach upon religion among the <i>Gentiles</i>; as well as those Jews of former times, of whom the Prophet Ezekiel speaks, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:23">Ezekiel 36:23</span>: <i>And I will sanctify my great name, which was</i> PROFANED <i>among the</i> HEATHEN, <i>which ye have</i> PROFANED <i>in the midst of them</i>."</p>
<p>That the Jewish <i>priesthood</i> was exceedingly corrupt in the time of the apostle, and that they were so long before, is fully evident from the sacred writings and from Josephus. The high-priesthood was a matter of <i>commerce</i>, and was <i>bought</i> and <i>sold</i> like other commodities. Of this Josephus gives many instances. The <i>rapine</i> of Eli's sons descended to several generations. Dr. Whitby well observes that of all these things mentioned by the apostle the Jewish doctors were notoriously guilty; and of most of them they were accused by our Lord.</p>
<p>1. <i>They said and did not</i>; and <i>laid heavy burdens upon others, which they would not touch with</i> <i>their own fingers</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:3">Matthew 23:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>.</p>
<p>2. They made the house of God a den of <i>thieves</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:13">Matthew 21:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:16">John 2:16</span>.</p>
<p>3. They were guilty of <i>adultery</i> by unjust <i>divorces</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:9">Matthew 19:9</span>.</p>
<p>4. Their <i>polygamy</i> was scandalous: even their rabbins, when they came to any place, would exclaim, <i>Who will be my wife for a day</i>?</p>
<p>As to <i>idolatry,</i> they were perfectly saved from it ever since the Babylonish captivity but to this succeeded <i>sacrilege</i>, as is most evident in the profanation of the temple, by their commerce transacted even within its courts; and their teaching the people that even their aged parents might be left to starve, provided the children made a <i>present to the temple</i> of that which should have gone for their support. According to Josephus, <i>Bell. Jud</i>. l. vi. c. 26, <i>They</i> <i>were guilty of theft, treachery, adultery, sacrilege, rapine, and</i> <i>murder</i>. And he adds, that <i>new ways of wickedness were invented by</i> <i>them; and that of all their abominations the temple was the</i> <i>receptacle</i>. In his <i>Antiquities</i> of the Jews, lib. xx. c. 8, he says: <i>The servants of the high priests took away, by violence, the</i> <i>tithes of the priests, so that many of them perished for want of</i> <i>food</i>. Even their own writers acknowledge that there were great irregularities and abominations among the rabbins.</p>
<p>So <i>Bereshith rabba</i>, sect. 55, fol. 54:</p>
<p>"Rabbi Abun proposed a parable concerning a master who taught his disciples not to pervert justice, and yet did it himself; not to show respect of persons, and yet did it himself; not to receive bribes, and yet received them himself; not to take usury, and yet took it himself. The disciple replied:-Rabbi, thou teachest me not to take usury, and yet thou takest it thyself! Can that be lawful to <i>thee</i> which is forbidden to <i>me</i>?"</p>
