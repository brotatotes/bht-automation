<p><i><b>If it fulfil the law</b></i> — If such a person act according to the spirit and design of the law; <i>judge</i> κρινει <i>condemn thee</i>, who, whilst thou dost enjoy the <i>letter</i>, the written law, and bearest in thy body the proof of the <i>circumcision</i> which it requires, <i>dost</i> <i>transgress that law</i>?</p>
