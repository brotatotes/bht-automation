<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>. <i><b>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness</b></i> — Wilt thou render of none effect that marked benevolence of God towards thee which has given so many superior advantages, and that <i>forbearance</i> which has tolerated thy many miscarriages, and that <i>long-suffering</i> which, after repeated provocations, still continues to bear with thee?</p>
<p><i><b>Not knowing</b></i> — αγνοων, not <i>acknowledging</i> that this goodness of God, which has so long manifested itself in <i>forbearance</i> and <i>long-suffering, leadeth thee to repentance</i>-was designed to accomplish this blessed end; which thy want of <i>consideration</i> and <i>acknowledgment</i> has rendered, hitherto, ineffectual. This was a maxim among the Jews themselves; for, in <i>Synopsis Sohar</i>, it is said:-<i>The holy blessed God delays his anger against the wicked, to</i> <i>the end that they may repent and be converted</i>.</p>
