<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:5">Romans 2:5</span>. <i><b>But after thy hardness</b></i> â€” Occasioned by thy long course of iniquity. <i>And impenitent heart</i> - produced by thy hardness, through which thou art callous to the calls and expostulations of conscience. <i>Treasurest up</i> - continuest to <i>increase thy debt</i> to the Divine justice, which will infallibly inflict <i>wrath</i> - punishment in <i>the day of wrath</i> - the judgment day, in which he will render to every man according to his works. The word <i>treasure</i> the Hebrew uses to express any kind of <i>store</i> or <i>collection: - Treasure</i> or plenty of <i>rain</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+28:12">Deuteronomy 28:12</span>: <i>The Lord shall open unto thee his good</i> TREASURE, <i>to give the</i> RAIN <i>unto thy land</i>. Treasure of <i>punishment</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:34">Deuteronomy 32:34</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+32:35">Deuteronomy 32:35</span> : <i>Is not this sealed up among my</i> TREASURES? <i>To me</i> belongeth VENGEANCE <i>and</i> RECOMPENSE. Treasures of <i>mines</i>, i.e. abundance of minerals. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+33:19">Deuteronomy 33:19</span>: <i>They shall suck of the</i> ABUNDANCE <i>of the seas, and of</i> TREASURES <i>hid</i> <i>in the sand</i>. So treasures of <i>gold, silver, corn, wine, oil</i>, c., mean <i>collections</i> or an <i>abundance</i> of such things: the word is used by the Greek <i>writers</i> precisely in the same sense. By <i>wrath</i> we are to understand <i>punishment</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span> and it is used so by the very best Greek writers. See <i>Kypke</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>treasure of wrath</i>, in this verse, is opposed to the <i>riches</i> of <i>goodness</i>, in the preceding. As surely as thou despisest, or neglectest to improve the RICHES <i>of God's</i> GOODNESS, so surely thou shalt share in the TREASURES of his WRATH. The <i>punishment</i> shall be proportioned to the <i>mercy</i> thou hast abused.</p>
