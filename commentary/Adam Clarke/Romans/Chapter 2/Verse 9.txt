<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:9">Romans 2:9</span>. <i><b>Tribulation and anguish</b></i> â€” Misery of all descriptions, without the possibility of escape, will this righteous Judge inflict upon every impenitent sinner. The <i>Jew first</i>, as possessing greater privileges, and having abused greater mercies; and also on the <i>Gentile</i>, who, though he had not the same advantages, had what God saw was sufficient for his state; and, having sinned against them, shall have punishment proportioned to his demerit.</p>
