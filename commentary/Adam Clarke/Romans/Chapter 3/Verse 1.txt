<p>Dr. Taylor observes:- "In the preceding chapter the apostle has carried his argument to the utmost length: what remains is to keep the Jew in temper, to fix his convictions, and to draw the grand conclusion.</p>
<p>"He has shown that the Jews were more wicked than the Gentiles; that their possession of the law, circumcision, and outward profession of relation to God, were no ground of acceptance with him. This was in effect to say that the Jews had forfeited their right to the privileges of God's peculiar people, and that they were as unworthy to be <i>continued</i> in the Church as the Gentiles were to be taken into it; and consequently, in order to their enjoying the privileges of the Church under the Messiah, they stood in need of a fresh display of grace, which if they rejected, God would cast them out of the vineyard. The apostle was sensible that the Jew would understand what he said in this sense; and that it must be very irritating to him to hear that his law, circumcision, and all his external advantages, were utterly insufficient to procure him the favour of God. This at once stripped him of all his peculiar honours and privileges; and the apostle, who had often argued with his countrymen on these points, knew what they would be ready to say on this subject; and, therefore, introduces a <i>dialogue</i> between himself and a Jew, in which he gives him leave to answer and defend himself. In this dialogue the apostle undoubtedly refers to the <i>rejection of the</i> <i>Jews</i>, which he considers at large in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh chapters. After the dialogue is finished, he resumes his argument, and proves, by their own <i>Scriptures</i>, that the Jews were guilty as well as other men; and that no part of mankind could have any right to the blessings of God's kingdom by <i>any works</i> which they had performed, but merely through the propitiatory sacrifice offered by Christ; and that this, far from destroying the law, was just the thing that the law required, and by which its claims were established.</p>
<p>"The sum and force of the apostle's argument is this: All sorts of men, <i>Jews</i> as well as <i>Gentiles</i>, have <i>sinned</i>; therefore, none of them can lay claim to the blessings of his kingdom on the ground of <i>obedience</i>. The <i>Jew</i>, therefore, stands as much in need of God's <i>grace</i> to give him a title to those blessings as the <i>Gentile</i>; and, consequently, the <i>Gentile</i> has as good a title as the <i>Jew</i>. And, when <i>all</i> are in the same circumstances, it is perfectly absurd for <i>any</i> to pretend to engross it to themselves, exclusively of others, who are only as bad as they.</p>
<p>"Thus the apostle solidly proves that we, <i>Gentiles</i>, through <i>faith alone</i>, have a good and firm title to all the blessings of the Gospel <i>covenant-election, adoption, pardon, privileges,</i> <i>ordinances</i>, the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, and the <i>hope of eternal life</i>."</p>
<p>As the nine first verses are a <i>dialogue</i> between the <i>apostle</i> and a <i>Jew</i>, I shall prefix the speakers to their respective questions and answers, to make the whole the more intelligible to the reader.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1">Romans 3:1</span>. JEW. <i><b>What advantage then hath the Jew? Or what</b></i><b> </b><i><b>profit</b></i><b> is there </b><i><b>of circumcision?</b></i> â€” As if he had said: You lately allowed, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:25">Romans 2:25</span>,) that <i>circumcision verily profited</i>; but if circumcision, or our being in covenant with God, raises us no higher in the Divine favour than the Gentiles; if the virtuous among <i>them</i> are as acceptable as any of <i>us</i>; nay, and condemn our nation too, as no longer deserving the Divine regards; pray tell me, wherein lies the superior honour of the Jew; and what benefit can arise to him from his <i>circumcision</i>, and being vested in the privileges of God's peculiar people?</p>
