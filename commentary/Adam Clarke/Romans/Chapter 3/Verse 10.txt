<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10">Romans 3:10</span>. <i><b>As it is written</b></i> — See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1-3">Psalms 14:1-3</span>; from which this and the two following verses are taken.</p>
<p><i><b>There is none righteous</b></i> — This is true, not only of the <i>Jews</i>, but of the Gentiles; of every soul of man, considered in his natural and practical state, previously to his receiving the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ. There is no righteous principle in them, and, consequently, no righteous act can be expected from them; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:12">Romans 3:12</span>. God himself is represented as looking down from heaven to see if there were any that feared and sought after him; and yet he, who cannot be deceived, could find <i>none</i>! And therefore we may safely conclude there was <i>none</i> to be found.</p>
