<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:12">Romans 3:12</span>. <i><b>They are all gone out of the way</b></i> — παντες εξεκλιναν, they have all <i>diverged</i> from the right way, they have either <i>abandoned</i> or <i>corrupted</i> the <i>worship</i> of God: the <i>Jews</i>, in forsaking the <i>law</i> and the <i>prophets</i>, and the <i>Gentiles</i>, in acting contrary to the <i>law which God had written on their hearts</i>. And the departure of both from the <i>truth</i> proves the evil propensity of human nature in general.</p>
<p><i><b>They are together become unprofitable</b></i> — ηχρειωθησαν. They are <i>useless</i>, good for nothing; or, as the Hebrew has it, נאלחו <i>neelachu</i>, <i>they are putrid</i>: he views the whole mass of mankind as <i>slain</i> and <i>thrown together</i>, to <i>putrefy in heaps</i>. This is what is termed the <i>corruption</i> of human nature; they are <i>infected</i> and <i>infectious</i>. What need of the <i>mercy</i> of God to save from such a state of degeneracy!</p>
<p><i><b>There is none that doeth good</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10">Romans 3:10</span> it is said, <i>There is none righteous</i>; here, <i>There is none that doeth good</i>: the first may refer to the want of a <i>righteous principle</i>; the second, to the necessary consequence of the absence of such a principle. If there be no <i>righteousness</i> within, there will be no <i>acts</i> of <i>goodness</i> without.</p>
