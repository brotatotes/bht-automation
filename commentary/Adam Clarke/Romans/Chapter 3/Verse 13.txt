<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:13">Romans 3:13</span>. <i><b>Their throat is an open sepulchre</b></i> â€” This and all the following verses to the end of the 18th <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:13-18">Romans 3:13-18</span> are found in the <i>Septuagint</i>, but not in the <i>Hebrew</i> text; and it is most evident that it was from this version that the apostle quoted, as the verses cannot be found in any other place with so near an approximation to the apostle's meaning and words. The verses in question, however, are not found in the <i>Alexandrian</i> MS. But they exist in the <i>Vulgate</i>, the <i>AEthiopic</i>, and the <i>Arabic</i>. As the most ancient copies of the Septuagint do not contain these verses, some contend that the apostle has quoted them from <i>different parts</i> of Scripture; and later transcribers of the Septuagint, finding that the 10th, 11th, and 12th, verses were quoted from the xivth Psalm, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:3">Psalms 14:3</span> imagined that the rest were found originally there too, and so incorporated them in their copies, from the apostle's text.</p>
<p>Their throat is an open sepulchre-By their malicious and wicked words they bury, as it were, the <i>reputation</i> of all men. The whole of this verse appears to belong to their habit of <i>lying,</i> <i>defamation, slandering</i>, &amp;c., by which they wounded, blasted, and poisoned the reputation of others.</p>
