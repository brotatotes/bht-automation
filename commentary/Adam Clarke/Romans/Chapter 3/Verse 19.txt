<p>Verse 19. <i><b>What things soever the law saith</b></i> — That the word <i>law</i>, here, does not mean the <i>pentateuch</i>, is evident from the preceding quotations, not one of which is taken from that work. Either the term <i>law</i> must here mean the <i>Jewish writings in general</i>, or that <i>rule of moral conduct</i> which God had given to both Jews and Gentiles: to the former in their own <i>Scriptures</i>; to the latter in that law written in their hearts by his own Spirit, and acknowledged in their written codes, and in their pleadings in every civil case. Now, according to this great law, <i>this rule of</i> <i>moral conduct</i>, whether given in a <i>written</i> revelation, as to the Jews, or by the secret inspiration of his Spirit, as in certain cases to the Gentiles, <i>every mouth must be stopped, and the whole</i> <i>world</i>, πας ο κοσμος, both Jews and Gentiles, <i>stand convicted</i> <i>before God</i>: for all mankind have sinned against this law.</p>
