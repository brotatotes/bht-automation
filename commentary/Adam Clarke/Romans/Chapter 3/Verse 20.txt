<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Therefore, by the deeds of the law</b></i> — On the score of <i>obedience</i> to this moral law, <i>there shall no flesh</i>, ουπασασαρξ, <i>no human being</i>, be justified; none can be accepted in the sight of God. And why? Because <i>by the law is the knowledge of sin</i>: it is that which <i>ascertains</i> what sin is; shows how men have deviated from its righteous demands; and sentences them to death because they have broken it. Thus the law is properly considered as the <i>rule of right</i>; and, unless God had given some such means of discovering <i>what</i> SIN <i>is</i>, the darkened heart of man could never have formed an adequate conception of it. For, as an acknowledged <i>straight edge</i> is the only way in which the <i>straightness</i> or <i>crookedness</i> of a <i>line</i> can be determined, so the moral obliquity of human actions can only be determined by the law of God; that <i>rule</i> <i>of right</i> which proceeds from his own immaculate holiness.</p>
