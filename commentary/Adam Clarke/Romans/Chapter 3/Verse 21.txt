<p>Verse 21. <i><b>But now the righteousness of God</b></i> â€” God's <i>method of</i> <i>saving sinners</i> is now shown, by the Gospel, to be through his own mere mercy, by Christ Jesus; <i>without the law</i>-without any right or claim which might result from obedience to the law; and is evidently that which was intended by God from the beginning; for <i>it is witnessed by the law and the prophets</i>-the <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i> of the <i>one</i>, and the <i>preachings</i> and <i>predictions</i> of the <i>others</i>, all bearing testimony to the great design of God, and to the absolute necessity there was for the sacrifice and salvation which God has provided.</p>
