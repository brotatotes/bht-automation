<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Even the righteousness of God</b></i> â€” That method of saving sinners which is not of <i>works</i>, but by faith in Christ Jesus; and it is not restrained to any <i>particular people</i>, as the law and its privileges were, but is <i>unto all</i> mankind in its <i>intention</i> and <i>offer</i>, and becomes effectual to them that believe; for God hath now made <i>no difference</i> between the Jews and the Gentiles.</p>
