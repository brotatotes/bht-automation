<p>Verse 23. <i><b>For all have sinned:</b></i> — And consequently are equally helpless and guilty; and, as God is no respecter of persons, all human creatures being equally his offspring, and there being <i>no</i> <i>reason</i> why <i>one</i> should be <i>preferred</i> before <i>another</i>, therefore his endless mercy has embraced ALL.</p>
<p><i><b>And come short of the glory of God</b></i> — και υστερουνται της δοξης του θεου. These words have been variously translated. <i>Failed of</i> attaining <i>the glory of God: Have not been able to bring glory to</i> <i>God: Stand in need of the glory</i>, that is, <i>the mercy of God</i>. The simple meaning seems to be this: that all have <i>sinned</i>, and none can enjoy God's glory but they that are <i>holy</i>; consequently both Jews and Gentiles have failed in their endeavours to attain it, as, by the works of <i>any law</i>, no human being can be justified.</p>
