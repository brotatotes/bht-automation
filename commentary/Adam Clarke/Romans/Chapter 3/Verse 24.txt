<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Being justified freely by his grace</b></i> — So far from being able to attain the glory of God by their obedience, they are all guilty: and, to be saved, must be freely pardoned by God's grace; which is shown to them who believe, through the redemption, απολυτρωσεως, the <i>ransom price</i>, which <i>is in</i> the sacrifice of <i>Christ Jesus</i>. The original is compounded of απο, <i>from</i>, and λυτροω, <i>I redeem</i>, and properly means the <i>price</i> laid down for the <i>redemption of a captive</i>. Comprehendit haec Christi απολυτρωσις, quicquid is docuit, fecit et passus est, eo consilio, ut homines malis liberati, praecipue peccato, malorum fonte immunes, veram felicitatem adipiscerentur.-<i>Rosenmuller</i>. This redemption of Christ comprehends whatsoever he <i>taught, did</i>, or <i>suffered</i>, in order to free men from evil; especially to free them from sin, the source of evils; that they might attain true felicity. And that it here means the <i>liberation</i> purchased by the blood-shedding of Christ, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>: <i>We have</i> REDEMPTION, απολυτρωσιν δια του αιματος αυτου, THROUGH HIS BLOOD, <i>the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace</i>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:14">Colossians 1:14</span>, where the same words are found.</p>
<p>λυτρα according to Suidas, is μισθος, η τα παρεχομενα υπερ ελευθεριας, επι τω λυτρωσασθαι βαρβαρων δουλειας. A reward; or <i>the price given to be redeemed from the slavery of the barbarians</i>. <i>Schleusner</i>, under the word απολυτρωσις, says, Negari quidem non potest, hanc vocem proprie notare redemptionem ejus, qui <i>captivus</i> detinetur, sive bello, sive alio captus sit modo, quae fit per <i>pretti solutionem</i>; quo sensu verbum απολυτροω legitur haud raro in Scripp. Graecis. No man certainly can deny that this word properly means the <i>redemption of a captive</i>, (whether he may have been taken in war or in any other way,) which is procured by the <i>payment of a price</i>. That the word also means <i>any deliverance</i>, even where <i>no price</i> is paid down, nobody will dispute; but that it means redemption by a <i>price laid down</i>, and the redemption of the soul by the <i>price of the death of Christ</i>, the above scriptures sufficiently prove.</p>
