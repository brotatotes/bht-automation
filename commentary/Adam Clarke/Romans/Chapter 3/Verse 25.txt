<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Whom God hath set forth</b></i> — Appointed and published to be a <i>propitiation</i>, ιλαστηριον, the <i>mercy-seat</i>, or <i>place</i> of atonement; because the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on and before <i>that</i>, in order to obtain remission of sin, punishment, c. The <i>mercy-seat</i> was the <i>lid</i> or <i>cover</i> of the ark of the <i>covenant,</i> where God was manifest in the symbol of his presence, between the cherubim therefore the atonement that was made in <i>this place</i> was properly made <i>to God</i> himself. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Through faith in his blood</b></i> — This shows <i>what</i> we are to understand both by the απολυτρωσις, <i>redemption</i>, and the ιλαστηριον, <i>propitiation</i>; viz. that they refer to the <i>sacrificial death</i> of Jesus Christ, as the <i>atonement</i> made, and the <i>price</i> paid down, for the redemption of the souls of men.</p>
<p><i><b>To declare his righteousness</b></i> — εις ενδειξις, for the manifestation of his righteousness; his <i>mercy</i> in saving sinners, by sending Jesus Christ to make an atonement for them; thereby declaring his readiness to remit all past transgressions committed both by Jews and Gentiles, during the time in which his merciful forbearance was exercised towards the world; and this applies to all who hear the Gospel now: to them is freely offered remission of all <i>past sins</i>.</p>
