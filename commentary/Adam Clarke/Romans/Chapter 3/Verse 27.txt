<p>Verse 27. JEW. <i><b>Where is boasting, then?</b></i> — 'η καυχησις, <i>This</i> <i>glorying</i> of ours. Have we nothing in which we can <i>trust</i> for our acceptance with God? No <i>merit</i> of our <i>own</i>? Nothing accruing to us from our circumcision and being in covenant with God.</p>
<p>APOSTLE, <i><b>It is excluded</b></i> — εξεκλεισθη, <i>It is shut out</i>; the door of heaven is <i>shut</i> against every thing of this kind.</p>
<p>JEW. <i><b>By what law?</b></i> — By what <i>rule, doctrine</i>, or <i>reason</i> is it shut out? by the law <i>of works</i>? The rule of obedience, which God gave to us, and by which obedience we are accepted by him?</p>
<p>APOSTLE. <i><b>Nay</b></i> — Not by the law of works; glorying is not cut off or <i>shut out</i> by that; it stands in full force as the rule of life; but you have <i>sinned</i> and need pardon. <i>The law of works</i> grants no <i>pardon</i>, it requires <i>obedience</i>, and threatens the disobedient with <i>death</i>. But all glorying in the expectation of salvation, through your <i>own obedience</i>, is excluded by the <i>law, the doctrine of faith</i>: faith alone, in the mercy of God, through the propitiation made by the blood of Jesus, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>,) is that by which you can be <i>justified</i>, pardoned, and taken into the Divine favour.</p>
