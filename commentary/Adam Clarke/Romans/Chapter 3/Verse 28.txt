<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Therefore we conclude</b></i>, c.] Seeing these things cannot be denied, viz., that all have sinned: that all are guilty, that all are helpless: that none can deliver his own soul, and that God, in his endless mercy, has opened <i>a new and living way to</i> <i>the holiest by the blood of Jesus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-20">Hebrews 10:19-20</span>, &amp;c: therefore we, apostles and Christian teachers, conclude, λογιζομεθα, prove by <i>fair, rational consequence, that a man</i> - any man, <i>is</i> <i>justified</i> - has his sins blotted out, and is received into the Divine favour, <i>by faith in Christ's blood, without the deeds of</i> <i>the law</i>, which never could afford, either to <i>Jew</i> or <i>Gentile</i>, a <i>ground</i> for justification, because <i>both</i> have sinned against the law which God has given them, and, consequently, forfeited all right and title to the blessings which the <i>obedient</i> might claim.</p>
