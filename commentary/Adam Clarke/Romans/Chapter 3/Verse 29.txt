<p>Verse 29. <b>Is he </b><i><b>the God of the Jews only?</b></i> â€” Do not begin to suppose that because you cannot be justified by the works of the law and God has in his mercy found out a new method of saving you, that therefore this mercy shall apply to the <i>Jews</i> exclusively. Is not God the maker, preserver, and redeemer, <i>also of the Gentiles?</i> <i>Yes, of the Gentiles also</i>, as much as of the <i>Jews</i>; for all have equally sinned and there is no reason, if God be disposed to show mercy at all, that he should prefer the one to the other; since they are all equally guilty, sinful, and necessitous.</p>
