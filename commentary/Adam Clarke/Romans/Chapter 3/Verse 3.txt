If some of the Jewish nation have abused their privileges, and acted contrary to their obligations, shall their wickedness <i>annul</i> the PROMISE which God made to Abraham, that he would, by an <i>everlasting</i> covenant, be a God to him and to his seed after him? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:7">Genesis 17:7</span>. Shall God, therefore, by stripping the Jews of their peculiar honour, as you intimate he will, falsify his promise to the <i>nation</i>, because some of the Jews are bad men?</p>
