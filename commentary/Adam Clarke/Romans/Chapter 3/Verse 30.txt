<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Seeing</b></i><b> it is </b><i><b>one God</b></i> — επιπερ εις ο θεος. This has been rendered, <i>Seeing God is one</i>. It however makes little difference in the sense: the apostle's meaning most evidently is, it is one and the same God who made both Jews and Gentiles, who shall <i>justify</i>-pardon, <i>the circumcision</i>-the believing <i>Jews, by</i> <i>faith</i>; and the <i>uncircumcision</i>-the believing <i>Gentiles</i>, by the same faith; as there is but <i>one Saviour</i> and one <i>atonement</i> provided for the whole.</p>
<p>It is fanciful to suppose that the apostle has one meaning when he says, εκ πιστεως, BY <i>faith</i>, and a different meaning when he says, δια της πιστεως, THROUGH <i>faith</i>. Both the prepositions are to be understood in precisely the same sense; only the addition of the article της, in the last case, <i>extends</i> and more pointedly <i>ascertains</i> the meaning. It is one and the same God who shall justify the believing Jews by faith; and the believing Gentiles δια της πιστεως, <i>by</i> THAT SAME <i>faith</i>.</p>
