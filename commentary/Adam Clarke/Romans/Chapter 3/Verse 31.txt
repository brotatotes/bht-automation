<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:31">Romans 3:31</span>. <i><b>Do we then make void the law through faith?</b></i> — 1. By <i>law</i> here we may understand the whole of the Mosaic law, in its <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i>; of which Jesus Christ was the <i>subject</i> and the <i>end</i>. All that law had respect to <i>him</i>; and the <i>doctrine</i> of faith in Christ Jesus, which the Christian religion proclaimed, established the very claims and demands of that law, by showing that all was accomplished in the passion and death of Christ, for, <i>without shedding of blood</i>, the law would allow of <i>no remission</i>; and Jesus was that Lamb of God which was slain from the foundation of the world, in whose blood we have redemption, even the remission of sins. 2. We may understand, also, the <i>moral law</i>, that which relates to the regulation of the <i>manners</i> or <i>conduct</i> of men. This law also was <i>established</i> by the doctrine of salvation by faith; because this faith works by love, and love is the principle of obedience: and whosoever receives salvation through faith in Christ, receives power to live in holy obedience to every moral precept; for such are God's workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus, unto good works; in which they find it their duty and their interest incessantly to live.</p>
<p>1. IN the notes on the preceding chapter, I have, in general, followed the <i>plan</i> of Dr. Taylor, and especially in regard to its <i>dialogue</i> form, but I have often differed much from that very learned and judicious man, in the application of many words and doctrines. He cannot allow that the death of Christ should be considered as a <i>price paid down</i> for the salvation of men and, I confess, I cannot understand the apostle in <i>any other way</i>. Nor can I see the weight of many of his observations, nor the force of his conclusions, on any other ground than this, that the passion and death of Christ were an atonement made to Divine justice in the behalf of man; and that it is through the merit of that great sacrifice that God forgives sin. Nor can I see any reason why such great stress should be laid on <i>faith</i>, but as that lays hold on and takes up the sacrifice of Christ as a <i>ransom price</i> for the redemption of the soul from the thraldom and misery of sin and Satan.</p>
<p>2. This chapter contains a fine and striking synopsis of the whole Christian system. The wretched state of man is awfully exhibited, from the 10th to the 18th verse; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-18">Romans 3:10-18</span> and the plan of salvation, in the 24th, 25th, and 26th verses. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24-26">Romans 3:24-26</span> A pious writer calls these the Catechism of Christian Righteousness. The following points in this catechism are worthy of high consideration - viz. <i>How is God glorified in us, and we in</i> <i>him</i>? - By his GRACE. <i>What does his grace work in us</i>? - True holiness. <i>Upon what motive</i>? - Because it is <i>pleasing</i> to him. <i>By whom does he</i> <i>give us salvation</i>? - By Jesus Christ. <i>How has Christ obtained this</i> <i>for us</i>? - By <i>redeeming us</i>. <i>What price did he give</i>? - His BLOOD. <i>What does his blood effect</i>? - It <i>reconciles</i> us to God. <i>How is it</i> <i>applied</i>? - By FAITH. <i>Who has given this victim of reconciliation</i>? - God the Father. <i>Why did he choose these means</i>? - To confound the <i>false</i> righteousness of the Gentiles; to abolish the FIGURATIVE righteousness of the Jews; and to establish his <i>own</i>. <i>What does</i> <i>this grace of God perform</i>? - It pardons sin and purifies the heart. <i>For whom is this designed</i>? - For <i>all mankind</i>, both Jews and Gentiles. <i>To whom are these blessings actually communicated</i>? - To all who <i>repent, turn from</i> their <i>sin</i>, and <i>believe</i> on the Lord Jesus. <i>Why did not God make known this grand method of salvation</i> <i>sooner</i>?</p>
<p>(1) To make it the more valued:</p>
<p>(2) To show his fidelity in the performance of his promises: and,</p>
<p>(3) To make known the virtue and efficacy of the blood of Christ, which sanctifies the <i>present</i>, extends its influence to the <i>past</i>, and continues the availing sacrifice and way of salvation to all <i>future</i> ages.</p>
<p>3. On considering this glorious scheme of salvation, there is great danger, lest, while we stand amazed at what was done FOR us, we neglect what must be done IN us. Guilt in the conscience and sin in the heart ruin the man. Pardon in the conscience and Christ in the heart save the soul. Christ has done much to save us, and the way of salvation is made plain; but, unless he <i>justify</i> our conscience from dead works, and <i>purify</i> our <i>hearts</i> from all sin, his passion and death will profit us nothing. While we <i>boast</i> in Christ Jesus, let us see that our <i>rejoicing</i>, καυχησις, our <i>boasting</i>, be this, <i>the testimony of our conscience, that in</i> <i>simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by</i> <i>the grace of God, we have our conversation in the world</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>.</p>
<p>4. We must beware of <i>Antinomianism</i>; that is, of supposing that, because Christ has been <i>obedient</i> unto death, there is no necessity for our <i>obedience</i> to his righteous commandments. If this were so, the grace of Christ would tend to the <i>destruction</i> of the law, and not to its <i>establishment</i>. He only is saved from his sins who has the law of God written in his heart; and he alone has the law written in his heart who lives an <i>innocent, holy</i>, and <i>useful</i> life. Wherever Christ <i>lives</i> he works: and his work of righteousness will <i>appear</i> to his servants, and its effect will be quietness and <i>assurance</i> for ever. The life of God in the soul of man is the principle which <i>saves</i> and <i>preserves</i> eternally.</p>
