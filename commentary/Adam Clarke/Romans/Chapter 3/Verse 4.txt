Verse Romans 3:4. APOSTLE. God forbid — μηγενοιτο, Let it not be, far from it, by no means. Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar, c. We must ever maintain that God is true, and that if, in any case, his promise appear to fail, it is because the condition on which it was given has not been complied with which is the sense of what is written, Psalms 51:4: I acknowledge my sin, and condemn myself that the truth of thy promise (2 Samuel 7:15-16) to establish my house and throne for ever, may be vindicated when thou shalt execute that dreadful threatening, (2 Samuel 12:10,) that the sword shall never depart from my house, which I own I have brought upon myself by my own iniquity. Should any man say that the promise of God had failed toward him, let him examine his heart and his ways, and he will find that he has departed out of that way in which alone God could, consistently with his holiness and truth, fulfil the promise.
