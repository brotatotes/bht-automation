<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>. APOSTLE. <i><b>God forbid</b></i> — μηγενοιτο, <i>Let it not be, far</i> <i>from it, by no means. Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar</i>, c. We must ever maintain that God is true, and that if, in any case, his promise appear to fail, it is because the condition on which it was given has not been complied with which is the sense of what is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:4">Psalms 51:4</span>: I acknowledge my sin, and condemn <i>myself</i> that the truth of thy promise (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:15-16">2 Samuel 7:15-16</span>) to <i>establish my house and throne for ever</i>, may be vindicated when thou shalt execute that dreadful threatening, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+12:10">2 Samuel 12:10</span>,) that <i>the sword shall never depart from my house</i>, which I own I have brought upon myself by my own iniquity. Should any man say that the promise of God had failed toward him, let him examine his heart and his ways, and he will find that he has departed out of that way in which alone God could, consistently with his holiness and truth, fulfil the promise.</p>
