<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:9">Romans 3:9</span>. JEW. <i><b>What then?</b></i> — After all, have not we Jews a better claim to the privileges of the kingdom of God than the <i>Gentiles</i> have?</p>
<p>APOSTLE. <i><b>No, in no wise</b></i> — For I have already proved that both Jews and Gentiles are under the guilt of sin; that they are equally unworthy of the blessings of the Messiah's kingdom; and that they must both, equally, owe their salvation to the <i>mere</i> <i>mercy of God</i>. From this, to the end of the 26th verse, the apostle proceeds to prove his assertion, that <i>both Jews and</i> <i>Gentiles were all under sin</i>; and, that he might enforce the conviction upon the heart of the Jew, he quotes his own Scriptures, which he acknowledged had been given by the inspiration of GOD, and consequently <i>true</i>.</p>
