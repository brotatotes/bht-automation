<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:10">Romans 4:10</span>. <i><b>How was it then reckoned?</b></i> — In what <i>circumstances</i> was Abraham when this blessing was bestowed upon him? When he was <i>circumcised</i>, or <i>before</i>?</p>
<p><i><b>Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</b></i> — Faith was reckoned to Abraham for justification, as we read <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span>, (where see the note;) but circumcision was not instituted till about fourteen or fifteen years after, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:1">Genesis 17:1</span>, c. for faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness or justification at least <i>one year</i> before Ishmael was born; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:0">Genesis 15:0</span>, and 16. At Ishmael's birth he was eighty-six years of age, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+16:16">Genesis 16:16</span>; and, at the institution of circumcision, Ishmael was thirteen, and Abraham ninety-nine years old. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:24">Genesis 17:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:25">Genesis 17:25</span>; and see Dr. <i>Taylor</i>.</p>
