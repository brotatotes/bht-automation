Verse Romans 4:10. How was it then reckoned? — In what circumstances was Abraham when this blessing was bestowed upon him? When he was circumcised, or before?Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. — Faith was reckoned to Abraham for justification, as we read Genesis 15:6, (where see the note;) but circumcision was not instituted till about fourteen or fifteen years after, Genesis 17:1, c. for faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness or justification at least one year before Ishmael was born; compare Genesis 15:0, and 16. At Ishmael's birth he was eighty-six years of age, Genesis 16:16; and, at the institution of circumcision, Ishmael was thirteen, and Abraham ninety-nine years old. See Genesis 17:24, Genesis 17:25; and see Dr. Taylor.
