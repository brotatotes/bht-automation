<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>. <i><b>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal</b></i>, c.] So far was <i>obedience</i> to the law of <i>circumcision</i> from being the reason of his justification, that he not only received this justification <i>before</i> he was circumcised, but he received the <i>sign</i> of circumcision, as a <i>seal</i> of the pardon which he had <i>before</i> actually received. And thus he became the <i>father</i>, the great <i>head</i> and <i>representative</i>, of all them that believe particularly the <i>Gentiles</i>, who are now in precisely the same state in which Abraham was when he received the mercy of God. Hence it appears, says Dr. Taylor, that the covenant established with Abraham, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:2-15">Genesis 17:2-15</span>, is the <i>same</i> with that, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:2">Genesis 12:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:5">Genesis 15:5</span>, c. for circumcision was not a seal of any <i>new grant</i>, but of the justification and promise which Abraham had received before he was circumcised; and that justification and promise included the Gospel covenant in which we are now interested. St. Paul refers to this, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>: The Scripture foreseeing that God would justify <i>us</i>, heathens, through faith, preached before the Gospel <i>unto Abraham, saying,</i> <i>In thee shall all nations be blessed</i>. The whole of the apostle's argument, in this fourth chapter to the Romans, proves that we, believing Gentiles, are the seed of Abraham, to whom, as well as to himself, the promise was made; and that the promise made to him is the same in effect as that promise which is now made to <i>us</i>; consequently, it is the Abrahamic covenant in which we now stand; and any argument taken from the nature of that covenant, and applied to ourselves, must be good and valid. It is also undeniably evident, from this eleventh verse, as well as from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:1-11">Genesis 17:1-11</span>, that <i>circumcision</i> was a <i>seal</i> or <i>sign</i> of the <i>Gospel</i> covenant in which we now stand. See <i>Taylor</i>.</p>
<p>There is nothing more common in the Jewish writers than the words אוה <i>oth</i>, SIGN, and חותם <i>chotham</i>, SEAL, as signifying the <i>mark</i> in the flesh, by the rite of circumcision; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:15">Genesis 4:15</span>. SOHAR <i>Genes</i>., fol. 41, col. 161, has these words: And God <i>set a</i> <i>mark upon Cain</i>; this <i>mark</i> was the <i>sign</i> of the covenant of circumcision. TARGUM, Cant. iii. 8: The <i>seal</i> of circumcision is in your flesh; as Abraham was <i>sealed</i> in the flesh. YALCUT RUBENI, fol. 64: Joseph did not defile the <i>sign</i> of the holy covenant; i.e. he did not commit adultery with the wife of Potiphar. Liber <i>Cosri</i>, part i., c. 115, p. 70: Circumcision is a Divine <i>sign</i> which God has placed on the member of concupiscence, to the end that we may overcome evil desire. SHEMOTH RABBA, sec. 19, fol. 118: Ye shall not eat the passover unless the SEAL of Abraham be in your flesh. <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 36: God said to Abraham, I will seal thy flesh. <i>Sohar Levit</i>. fol. 6: Abraham was sealed with the holy seal. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
