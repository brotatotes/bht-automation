<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:12">Romans 4:12</span>. <i><b>And the father of circumcision</b></i> â€” He is also the <i>head</i> and <i>representative</i> of all the circumcision of all the JEWS <i>who</i> <i>walk in the steps of that faith</i>; who seek for justification by <i>faith only</i>, and not by the <i>works of the law</i>; for this was the faith that Abraham had before he received circumcision. For, the covenant being made with Abraham while he was a <i>Gentile</i>, he became the representative of the <i>Gentiles</i>, and they <i>primarily</i> were included in that covenant, and the Jews were brought in only <i>consequentially</i>; but <i>salvation</i>, implying <i>justification by faith</i>, originally belonged to the <i>Gentiles</i>; and, when the Gospel came, they laid hold on <i>this</i> as their original right, having been granted to them by the free mercy of God in their father and representative, Abraham. So that the Jews, to be saved, must come under that Abrahamic covenant, in which the <i>Gentiles</i> are included. This is an unanswerable conclusion, and must, on this point, for ever confound the Jews.</p>
