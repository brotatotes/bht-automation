<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:13">Romans 4:13</span>. <i><b>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>world</b></i> â€” This promise intimated that he should be the medium through whom the mercy of God should be communicated to the <i>world</i>, to both <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>; and the <i>manner</i> in which <i>he</i> was justified, be the <i>rule</i> and <i>manner</i> according to which all men should expect this blessing. Abraham is here represented as having all the <i>world</i> given to him as his <i>inheritance</i>; because <i>in</i> <i>him</i> all nations of the earth are blessed: this must therefore relate to their being all interested in the <i>Abrahamic covenant</i>; and every person, now that the covenant is fully explained, has the privilege of claiming justification through faith, by the blood of the Lamb, in virtue of this original grant.</p>
