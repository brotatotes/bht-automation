<p><i><b>God, who quickeneth the dead</b></i>, c.] God is the most proper object of trust and dependence for being <i>almighty, eternal</i>, and <i>unchangeable</i>, he can even raise the dead to life, and <i>call those</i> <i>things which be not as though they were</i>. He is the <i>Creator</i>, he gave <i>being</i> when there was <i>none</i>; he can as infallibly assure the existence of those things which are not, as if they were already actually in being. And, on this account, he can never fail of accomplishing whatsoever he has promised.</p>
