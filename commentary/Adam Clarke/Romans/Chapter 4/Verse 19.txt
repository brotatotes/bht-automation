<p>Verse 19. <i><b>He considered not his own body now dead</b></i> â€” He showed at once the correctness and energy of his faith: God <i>cannot</i> lie; Abraham <i>can</i> believe. It is true that, according to the course of nature, he and Sarah are so old that they cannot have children; but God is almighty, and can do whatsoever he will, and will fulfil his promise. This was certainly a wonderful degree of faith; as the promise stated that it was in <i>his posterity</i> that all the nations of the earth were to be blessed; that he had, as yet, no child by Sarah; that he was 100 years old; that Sarah was 90; and that, added to the utter improbability of her bearing at that age, she had ever been barren before. All these were so many reasons why he should not credit the promise; yet he believed; therefore it might be well said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span>, <i>that he staggered not at the promise</i>, though every thing was unnatural and improbable; <i>but he was strong in faith</i>, and, by this almost inimitable confidence, <i>gave glory to God</i>. It was to God's honour that his servant put such unlimited confidence in him; and he put this confidence in him on the rational ground that God was <i>fully able</i> to perform what he had promised.</p>
