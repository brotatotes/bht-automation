<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:2">Romans 4:2</span>. <i><b>For if Abraham were justified by works</b></i> — The JEW proceeds: - I conclude, therefore, that Abraham was <i>justified by</i> <i>works</i>, or by his <i>obedience to this law of circumcision</i>; and, consequently, he has cause for <i>glorying</i>, καυχημα, to <i>exult</i> in something which he has done to entitle him to these blessings. Now, it is evident that he has this <i>glorying</i>, and consequently that he was <i>justified</i> by <i>works</i>.</p>
<p>APOSTLE. <i><b>But not before God</b></i> — These seem to be the apostle's words, and contain the beginning of his answer to the arguments of the Jew, as if he had said: - Allowing that Abraham might <i>glory</i> in being called from heathenish darkness into such marvellous light, and <i>exult</i> in the privileges which God had granted to him; yet this <i>glorying</i> was not <i>before God</i> as a <i>reason</i> why those privileges should be granted; the <i>glorying</i> itself being a <i>consequence</i> of these very privileges.</p>
