<p>Verse 22. <i><b>And therefore it was imputed to him for</b></i><b> </b><i><b>righteousness</b></i> â€” The verse is thus paraphrased by Dr. Taylor: "For which reason God was graciously pleased to <i>place</i> his faith <i>to</i> <i>his account</i>; and to allow his fiducial reliance upon the Divine goodness, power, and faithfulness, for a <i>title</i> to the Divine blessing, which, otherwise, having been an idolater, he had no right to."</p>
<p>Abraham's strong faith in the promise of the coming Saviour, for this was essential to his faith, was reckoned to him for justification: for it is not said that any <i>righteousness</i>, either <i>his own</i>, or <i>that of another</i>, was imputed or reckoned to him for justification; but <i>it</i>, i.e. his <i>faith</i> in God. His faith was fully persuaded of the most merciful intentions of God's goodness; and <i>this</i>, which, in effect, laid hold on Jesus Christ, the future Saviour, was the means of his justification; being reckoned unto him in the <i>place</i> of personal righteousness, because it laid hold on the <i>merit</i> of Him who died to make an atonement for our offences, and rose again for our justification.</p>
