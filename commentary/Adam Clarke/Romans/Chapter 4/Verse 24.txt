<p>Verse 24. <i><b>But for us also</b></i> â€” The mention of this circumstance has a much more extensive design than merely to honour Abraham. It is recorded as the <i>model</i>, according to which God will save both Jews and Gentiles: indeed there can be no other way of salvation; as all have <i>sinned</i>, all must either be saved by faith through Christ Jesus, or finally perish. If God, therefore, will our salvation, it must be by <i>faith</i>; and faith contemplates his <i>promise</i>, and his <i>promise</i> comprehends the <i>Son of his love</i>.</p>
