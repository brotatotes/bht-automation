<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>. <i><b>Who was delivered for our offences</b></i> — Who was delivered up to death as a <i>sacrifice for our sins</i>; for in what other way, or for what other purpose could He, who is <i>innocence</i> itself, be <i>delivered for our offences</i>?</p>
<p><i><b>And was raised again for our justification.</b></i> — He was raised that we might have the fullest assurance that the death of Christ had accomplished the end for which it took place; viz. our reconciliation to God, and giving us a title to that eternal life, into which he has entered, and taken with him our <i>human nature</i>, as the first-fruits of the resurrection of <i>mankind</i>.</p>
<p>1. FROM a careful examination of the Divine oracles it appears that the <i>death of Christ</i> was an <i>atonement</i> or <i>expiation</i> for the <i>sin of the world: For him hath God set forth to be a</i> PROPITIATION <i>through</i> FAITH <i>in</i> HIS BLOOD, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>. <i>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ</i> DIED FOR <i>the</i> UNGODLY, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>. <i>And when we were</i> ENEMIES, <i>we were</i> RECONCILED <i>to God by the</i> DEATH <i>of his Son</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>. <i>In whom we have</i> REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS BLOOD, <i>the</i> FORGIVENESS <i>of</i> SINS, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>. <i>Christ hath loved us, and</i> GIVEN HIMSELF FOR US, <i>an</i> OFFERING <i>and a</i> SACRIFICE <i>to God for a sweet-smelling savour</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>. <i>In whom we have</i> REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS BLOOD, <i>the</i> FORGIVENESS <i>of</i> SINS, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:14">Colossians 1:14</span>. <i>And having made</i> PEACE THROUGH <i>the</i> BLOOD <i>of his</i> CROSS, <i>in the</i> BODY <i>of</i> HIS FLESH, <i>through</i> DEATH, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>. <i>Who</i> GAVE HIMSELF <i>a</i> RANSOM <i>for all</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:6">1 Timothy 2:6</span>. <i>Who</i> GAVE HIMSELF FOR US, <i>that he might</i> REDEEM <i>us from all</i> <i>iniquity</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>. <i>By which will we are sanctified, through the</i> OFFERING <i>of the</i> BODY <i>of Jesus Christ</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:10">Hebrews 10:10</span>. <i>So Christ was once</i> OFFERED TO BEAR THE SINS <i>of many</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>.

But it would be transcribing a very considerable part of the New Testament to set down all the texts that refer to this most important and glorious truth.</p>
<p>2. And as his <i>death</i> was an <i>atonement</i> for our sins, so his <i>resurrection</i> was the <i>proof</i> and <i>pledge</i> of our <i>eternal life</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:17">1 Corinthians 15:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>, c.,c.</p>
<p>3. The doctrine of <i>justification by faith</i>, which is so nobly proved in the preceding chapter, is one of the grandest displays of the mercy of God to mankind. It is so very plain that <i>all</i> may <i>comprehend</i> it and so <i>free</i> that all may <i>attain</i> it. What more simple than this? Thou art a sinner, in consequence condemned to perdition, and utterly unable to save thy own soul. All are in the same state with thyself, and no man can give a ransom for the soul of his neighbour. God, in his mercy, has provided a Saviour for thee. As thy life was forfeited to death because of thy transgressions, Jesus Christ has redeemed thy life by giving up his <i>own</i> he died in <i>thy stead</i>, and has made an atonement to God for thy <i>transgressions</i>; and offers thee the pardon he has thus purchased, on the simple condition, that thou <i>believe that his</i> <i>death is a sufficient sacrifice, ransom, and oblation for thy sin</i>; and that thou bring it as <i>such</i>, by confident faith, to the throne of God, and plead it in thy own behalf there. When thou dost so, thy <i>faith</i> in that sacrifice shall be imputed to thee for righteousness; i.e. it shall be the means of receiving that salvation which Christ has bought by his blood.</p>
<p>4. The doctrine of the <i>imputed righteousness of Christ</i>, as held by many, will not be readily found in this chapter, where it has been supposed to exist in all its proofs. It is repeatedly said that FAITH <i>is imputed for righteousness</i>; but in no place here, that <i>Christ's obedience to the moral law</i> is imputed to any man. The truth is, the <i>moral law</i> was <i>broken</i>, and did not now require <i>obedience</i>; it required this <i>before</i> it was <i>broken</i>; but, <i>after</i> it was broken, it required <i>death</i>.</p>
<p>Either the <i>sinner</i> must <i>die</i>, or some <i>one</i> in his <i>stead</i>: but there was none whose <i>death</i> could have been an equivalent for the transgressions of the <i>world</i> but JESUS CHRIST. Jesus therefore <i>died</i> for man; and it is through his <i>blood</i>, the merit of his <i>passion</i> and <i>death</i>, that we have redemption; and not by his <i>obedience to the moral law in our stead</i>. Our salvation was obtained at a <i>much higher price</i>. Jesus could not but be <i>righteous</i> and <i>obedient</i>; this is consequent on the immaculate purity of his nature: but his <i>death</i> was not a <i>necessary consequent</i>. As the law of God can claim only the <i>death</i> of a <i>transgressor</i>-for such only forfeit their right to life-it is the greatest miracle of all that Christ <i>could die</i>, whose <i>life</i> was never <i>forfeited</i>. Here we see the indescribable <i>demerit</i> of sin, that it <i>required such</i> a <i>death</i>; and here we see the stupendous mercy of God, in providing the <i>sacrifice</i> required. It is therefore by Jesus Christ's <i>death</i>, or <i>obedience unto death</i>, that we are saved, and not by his fulfilling any moral law. That he fulfilled the moral law we know; without which he could not have been qualified to be our mediator; but we must take heed lest we attribute that to <i>obedience</i> (which was the necessary consequence of his immaculate nature) which belongs to his <i>passion</i> and <i>death</i>. These were free-will offerings of eternal goodness, and not even a necessary consequence of his incarnation.</p>
<p>5. This doctrine of the <i>imputed righteousness of Christ</i> is capable of great abuse. To say that Christ's <i>personal</i> <i>righteousness</i> is imputed to every true believer, is not Scriptural: to say that he has fulfilled all righteousness for us, or in our stead, if by this is meant his fulfilment of all moral duties, is neither Scriptural nor true: that he has <i>died in our</i> <i>stead</i>, is a great, glorious, and Scriptural truth: that there is no redemption but through his blood is asserted beyond all contradiction; in the oracles of God. But there are a multitude of duties which the moral law requires which Christ never fulfilled in our stead, and never could. We have various duties of a domestic kind which belong solely to ourselves, in the relation of <i>parents, husbands, wives, servants</i>, c., in which relations Christ never stood. He has fulfilled none of these duties for us, but he furnishes grace to every true believer to fulfil them to God's glory, the edification of his neighbour, and his own eternal profit. The salvation which we receive from God's free mercy, through Christ, binds us to live in a strict conformity to the <i>moral law</i> that law which prescribes our <i>manners</i>, and the spirit by which they should be regulated, and in which they should be performed. He who lives not in the due performance of every Christian duty, whatever faith he may profess, is either a vile hypocrite, or a scandalous <i>Antinomian</i>.</p>
