<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>. <i><b>But to him that worketh not</b></i> — Which was the case with Abraham, for he was called when he was <i>ungodly</i>, i.e. an <i>idolater</i>; and, on his believing, was freely justified: and, as all men have <i>sinned</i>, none can be justified by <i>works</i>; and, therefore, justification, if it take place at all, must take place in behalf of the <i>ungodly</i>, forasmuch as all mankind are <i>such</i>. Now, as Abraham's <i>state</i> and <i>mode</i> in which he was justified, are the plan and rule according to which God purposes to save men; and as his state was <i>ungodly</i>, and the <i>mode</i> of his justification was by <i>faith</i> in the goodness and mercy of God; and this is precisely the state of <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i> at present; there can be no other mode of justification than by faith in that Christ who is Abraham's seed, and in whom, according to the promise, all the nations of the earth are to be blessed.</p>
<p>It is necessary to observe here, in order to prevent confusion and misapprehension, that although the verb δικαιοω has a variety of senses in the New Testament, yet here it is to be taken as implying the <i>pardon of sin; receiving a person into the favour of</i> <i>God</i>. See these different acceptations cited in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span><i>"</i>, and particularly under No. 7. It is also necessary to observe, that our translators render the verb λογιζομαι differently in different parts of <i>this</i> chapter. It is rendered <i>counted</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>; <i>reckoned</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:4">Romans 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:9-10">Romans 4:9-10</span>; <i>imputed</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:6">Romans 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:8">Romans 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:22-24">Romans 4:22-24</span>. <i>Reckoned</i> is probably the best sense in all these places.</p>
