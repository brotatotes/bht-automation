Verse Romans 4:7. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven — That is, the man is truly happy whose iniquities αιανομιαι, whose transgressions of the law are forgiven; for by these he was exposed to the most grievous punishment. Whose sins, αιαμαρτιαι, his innumerable deviations from the strict rule of truth and righteousness, are covered-entirely removed out of sight, and thrown into oblivion. See the meaning of the word sin in Clarke's note on "Genesis 13:13".
