Verse Romans 4:8. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. â€” That man is truly happy to whose charge God does not reckon sin; that is, they alone are happy who are redeemed from the curse of the law and the consequence of their ungodly life, by having their sins freely forgiven, through the mercy of God.
