<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:9">Romans 4:9</span>. <b>Cometh </b><i><b>this blessedness - upon the circumcision</b></i><b> only</b>] The word μονον, <i>only</i>, is very properly supplied by our translators, and indeed is found in some excellent MSS., and is here quite necessary to complete the sense. The apostle's question is very nervous. If this pardon, granted in this way, be essential to <i>happiness</i> - and David says it is so - then is it the privilege of the <i>Jews</i> exclusively? This cannot be; for, as it is by the mere <i>mercy</i> of God, through <i>faith</i>, the <i>circumcision</i> cannot even claim it. But if God offer it to the circumcision, not because they have been <i>obedient</i>, for they also have <i>sinned</i>, but because of his <i>mere mercy</i>, then of course the same blessedness may be offered to the <i>Gentiles</i> who believe in the Lord Jesus. And this is evident; <i>for we say</i>, following our own Scriptures, <i>that</i> <i>faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness</i>; he had no <i>merit</i>, he was an <i>idolater</i>; but he <i>believed in God</i>, and his <i>faith</i> was reckoned to him ειςδικαιοσυνην, <i>in reference to his</i> <i>justification</i>; he brought <i>faith</i> when he could not bring <i>works</i>; and God accepted his <i>faith</i> in the place of <i>obedience</i>; and this became the <i>instrumental</i> cause of his justification.</p>
