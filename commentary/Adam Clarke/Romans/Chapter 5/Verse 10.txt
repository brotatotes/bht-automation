<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>. <i><b>For if, when we were enemies</b></i> — See under <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>We were reconciled</b></i> — The <i>enmity</i> existing before rendered the <i>reconciliation</i> necessary. In every human heart there is a measure of <i>enmity</i> to holiness, and, consequently to the author of it. Men seldom suspect this; for one property of sin is to <i>blind the</i> <i>understanding</i>, so that men do not know their own state.</p>
<p><i><b>We shall be saved by his life.</b></i> —</p>
<p>1. For, as he <i>died</i> for our sins, so he <i>rose</i> again for our justification; and his <i>resurrection</i> to <i>life</i>, is the grand proof that he has accomplished whatever he had purposed in reference to the salvation of man.</p>
<p>2. This may be also understood of his life of <i>intercession</i>: for it is written. <i>He ever</i> LIVETH <i>to make</i> INTERCESSION <i>for us</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>. Through this life of intercession at the right hand of God we are <i>spared</i> and blessed.</p>
<p>3. And it will not be amiss to consider that, as our salvation implies the <i>renovation</i> of our nature, and our being restored to the <i>image of God</i>, so, σωθησομεθα εν τη ζωναυτου, may be rendered: <i>we shall be saved</i> IN <i>his life</i>; for, I suppose, it is pretty generally agreed, that <i>the life of God in the soul of</i> <i>man</i> is essential to its salvation.</p>
<p>4. The <i>example</i> also of the <i>life</i> of Christ is a means of salvation. He hath left us an example that we should follow his steps: and he that followeth him, <i>shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of</i> LIFE, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>.</p>
