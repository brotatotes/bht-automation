<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:11">Romans 5:11</span>. <i><b>We also joy</b></i><b> (καυχωμενοι, </b><i><b>we exult</b></i><b>, or </b><i><b>glory</b></i><b>) </b><i><b>in God</b></i><b>, c.</b>] We now <i>feel</i> that God is reconciled to us, and we are reconciled to him: the <i>enmity</i> is removed from our souls and He, for Christ's sake, <i>through whom we have received the atonement</i>, καταλλαγην, <i>the reconciliation</i>, has remitted the <i>wrath</i>, the <i>punishment</i> which we deserved: and now, through this <i>reconciliation</i>, we expect an eternal glory.</p>
<p>It was certainly improper to translate καταλλαγη here by <i>atonement</i>, instead of <i>reconciliation</i>; as καταλλασσω signifies to <i>reconcile</i>, and is so rendered by our translators in all the places where it occurs. It does not mean the atonement here, as we generally understand that word, viz. the <i>sacrificial death of</i> <i>Christ</i>; but rather the <i>effect</i> of that atonement, the removal of the <i>enmity</i>, and by this, the change of our condition and state; from κατα, intensive, and αλλασσω to <i>change</i>; the <i>thorough</i> <i>change</i> of our state from enmity to friendship. God is reconciled to us, and <i>we are reconciled to him by the death of his Son</i>; and thus there is a glorious <i>change</i> from <i>enmity</i> to <i>friendship</i>; and we can exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have received this <i>reconciliation</i>. Though <i>boasting</i> is forbidden to a Jew, because his is a <i>false</i> confidence, yet boasting is enjoined to a <i>Christian</i>, to one reconciled to God; for, his boasting is <i>only</i> in that reconciliation, and <i>the endless mercy</i> by which it is procured. So he that glorieth (boasteth) must glory in the <i>Lord</i>.</p>
