<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13">Romans 5:13</span>. <i><b>For until the law sin was in the world</b></i> â€” As <i>death</i> reigned from Adam to Moses, so also did <i>sin</i>. Now, as there was no <i>written law</i> from Adam to that given to Moses, the <i>death</i> that prevailed could not be the breach of that law; for sin, so as to be punished with temporal death, <i>is not imputed where there is no</i> <i>law</i>, which shows the penalty of sin to be death. Therefore, men are not subjected to death for their <i>own personal transgressions</i>, but for the sin of Adam; as, through his transgression, all come into the world with the seeds of death and corruption in their own nature, superadded to their moral depravity. All are <i>sinful</i>-all are <i>mortal</i>-and all <i>must die</i>.</p>
