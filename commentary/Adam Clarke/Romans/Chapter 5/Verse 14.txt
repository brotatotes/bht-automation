<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span>. <i><b>Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses</b></i> — This supposes, as Dr. Taylor very properly observes:-</p>
<p>1. That <i>sin</i> was in the world from Adam to Moses.</p>
<p>2. That <i>law</i> was not in the world from Adam to Moses during the space of about 2500 years; for, after Adam's transgression, that law was abrogated; and, from that time, men were either under the general <i>covenant of grace</i> given to Adam or Noah, or under that which was specially made with <i>Abraham</i>.</p>
<p>3. That, therefore, the sins committed were not imputed unto them <i>to death</i>, for they did not sin <i>after the similitude of</i> <i>Adam's transgression</i>; that is, they did not, like him, transgress a law, or rule of action, to which <i>death</i>, as the penalty, was annexed. And yet-</p>
<p>4. Death reigned over mankind during the period between Adam and Moses; therefore men did not die for their own transgressions, but in consequence of Adam's one transgression.</p>
<p><i><b>Who is the figure of him that was to come.</b></i> — Adam was the <i>figure</i>, τυπος, the <i>type, pattern</i>, or <i>resemblance of him who was</i> <i>to come</i>; i.e. of the <i>Messiah</i>. The correspondence between them appears in the following particulars:-</p>
<p>1. Through him, as its spring and fountain, <i>sin</i> became diffused through the world, so that every man comes into the world with sinful propensities: for <i>by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so</i> <i>death passed upon all men</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>. Through Christ, as its spring and fountain, <i>righteousness</i> becomes diffused through the earth; so that every man is made partaker of a principle of grace and truth; for <i>he is the true light that lighteth every man that</i> <i>cometh into the world</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>.</p>
<p>2. <i>As in Adam all die; so in Christ shall all be made alive</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:22">1 Corinthians 15:22</span>. <i>For, since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of</i> <i>the dead</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:21">1 Corinthians 15:21</span>.</p>
<p>3. As in or through Adam <i>guilt</i> came upon all men, so, through Christ, the <i>free gift</i> comes upon all men unto <i>justification of</i> <i>life</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>. These alone seem to be the instances in which a similitude exists between Adam and Christ.</p>
