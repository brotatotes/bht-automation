<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>. <i><b>But not as the offence, so also</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the free gift.</b></i> — The same learned writer, quoted above, continues to observe:- "It is evident that the apostle, in this and the two following verses, is running a <i>parallel</i>, or making a <i>comparison</i> between the offence of Adam and its consequence; and the opposite <i>gift</i> of God and its consequences. And, in these three verses, he shows that the comparison will not hold good in all respects, because the <i>free</i> <i>gift</i>, χαρισμα, bestows blessings <i>far beyond</i> the consequences of the offence, and which, therefore, have no relation to it. And this was necessary, not only to prevent mistakes concerning the consequence of Adam's offence, and the extent of Gospel grace; but it was also necessary to the apostle's main design, which was not only to prove that the grace of the Gospel extends to all men, so far as it takes off the consequence of Adam's offence, [i.e. <i>death</i>, without the promise or probability of a <i>resurrection</i>,] but that it likewise extends to all men, with respect to the surplusage of blessings, in which it stretches far beyond the consequence of Adam's offence. For, the grace that takes off the consequence of Adam's offence, and the grace which <i>abounds</i> beyond it, are both included in the same χαρισμα, or <i>free gift</i>, which should be well observed; for in this, I conceive, lie the connection and sinews of the argument: the <i>free gift</i>, which stands opposed to Adam's offence, and which, I think, was bestowed immediately after the offence; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>: <i>The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head</i>. This gift, I say, includes both the grace which exactly answers to the offence, and is that part of the grace which stretches far beyond it. And, if the one part of the gift be freely bestowed on all mankind, as the Jews allow, why not the other? especially, considering that the <i>whole gift</i> stands upon a reason and foundation in excellence and worth, vastly surpassing the malignity and demerit of the offence; and, consequently, capable of producing benefits vastly beyond the sufferings occasioned by the offence. This is the force of the apostle's argument; and therefore, supposing that in the 18th and l9th verses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:19">Romans 5:19</span> literally understood, he compares the consequence of Adam's offence and Christ's obedience, only so far as the one is commensurate to the other, yet his reasoning, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15-17">Romans 5:15-17</span>, plainly shows that it is his meaning and intention that we should take into his conclusion the whole of the gift, so far as it can reach, to all mankind."</p>
<p><i><b>For if, through the offence of one, many be dead</b></i> — That the οι πολλοι, <i>the many</i> of the apostle here means <i>all mankind</i> needs no proof to any but that person who finds himself qualified to deny that all men are <i>mortal</i>. And if <i>the many</i>, that is, <i>all mankind</i>, have died through the offence of one; certainly, the <i>gift by</i> <i>grace</i>, which abounds unto τουςπολλους, <i>the many</i>, by Christ Jesus, must have reference to <i>every human being</i>. If the consequences of Christ's incarnation and death extend only to a <i>few</i>, or a <i>select number</i> of mankind-which, though they may be considered <i>many</i> in themselves, are <i>few</i> in comparison of the whole human race-then the consequences of Adam's sin have extended only to a <i>few</i>, or to the <i>same select number</i>: and if only <i>many</i>, and not <i>all</i> have fallen, only that <i>many</i> had need of a Redeemer. For it is most evident that the same persons are referred to in both clauses of the verse. If the apostle had believed that the benefits of the death of Christ had extended only to a select number of mankind, he never could have used the language he has done here: though, in the first clause, he might have said, without any qualification of the term, <i>Through the offence of one,</i> MANY <i>are</i> <i>dead</i>; in the 2nd clause, to be consistent with the doctrine of particular redemption, he must have said, <i>The grace of God, and</i> <i>the gift by grace, hath abounded unto</i> SOME. <i>As by the offence of</i> <i>one judgment came upon</i> ALL <i>men to condemnation; so, by the</i> <i>righteousness of one, the free gift came upon</i> SOME <i>to</i> <i>justification</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>. <i>As, by one man's disobedience,</i> MANY <i>were made sinners; so, by the</i> <i>obedience of one, shall</i> SOME <i>be made righteous</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:19">Romans 5:19</span>. <i>As in Adam</i> ALL <i>die; so, in Christ, shall</i> SOME <i>be made alive</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:22">1 Corinthians 15:22</span>. But neither the doctrine nor the thing ever entered the soul of this divinely inspired man.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath abounded unto many.</b></i> — That is, Christ Jesus died for every man; salvation is free for all; saving grace is tendered to every soul; and a measure of the Divine light is actually communicated to every heart, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>. And, as the grace is <i>offered</i>, so it may be <i>received</i>; and hence the apostle says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>: <i>They which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of</i> <i>righteousness, shall reign in life by Christ Jesus</i>: and by <i>receiving</i> is undoubtedly meant not only the act of <i>receiving</i>, but <i>retaining</i> and <i>improving</i> the grace which they <i>receive</i>; and, as all may receive, so ALL <i>may</i> improve and retain the grace they do receive; and, consequently, ALL <i>may</i> be eternally saved. But of multitudes Christ still may say, <i>They</i> WILL <i>not come unto me, that</i> <i>they might have life</i>.</p>
