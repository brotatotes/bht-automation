<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>. <i><b>And not as it was by one that sinned</b></i> â€” That is, the judicial act that followed Adam's sin (the sentence of death pronounced upon him, and his expulsion from paradise) took its rise from his <i>one offence</i> alone, and terminated in condemnation; but the free gift of God in Christ takes its rise also from the <i>many offences</i> which men, in a long course of life, have personally committed; and the object of this grace is to justify them freely, and bring them to eternal life.</p>
