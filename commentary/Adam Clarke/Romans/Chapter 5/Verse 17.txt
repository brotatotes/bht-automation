<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Death reigned by one</b></i> — Death is here <i>personified</i>, and is represented as reigning over the human race; and death, of course, reigns unto death; he is known as reigning, by the <i>destruction</i> of his subjects.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall reign in life</b></i> — Those who <i>receive</i>, retain, and improve the abundant grace offered by Jesus Christ, shall be redeemed from the <i>empire</i> of death, and exalted to the <i>throne</i> of God, to live and <i>reign</i> with him ever, world without end. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+2:11">Revelation 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>.</p>
<p>If we carefully compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>, we shall find that there is a correspondence between περισσειαν, the <i>abounding</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>, and επερισευσε <i>hath abounded</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>; between της δωρεας της δικαιοσυνης, the <i>gift of righteousness</i>, i.e. <i>justification</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>, and η δωρεα εν χαριτι, <i>the gift by grace</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>; therefore, if we understand <i>the abounding of grace, and the gift</i> <i>of justification</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>, we shall understand <i>the grace of God, and the gift by grace which</i> <i>hath abounded unto the many</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>. But the <i>abounding of grace</i>, and the <i>gift of justification</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>, is that <i>grace</i> and <i>gift</i> which is RECEIVED by those who shall <i>reign</i> <i>in eternal life. Reigning</i> in <i>life</i> is the consequence of <i>receiving</i> the <i>grace</i> and <i>gift</i>. Therefore, receiving the grace is a necessary qualification on our part for reigning in life; and this necessarily implies our believing in Christ Jesus, as having died for our offences, receiving the grace so freely offered us; using the means in order to get <i>more</i> grace, and bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit. <i>Receive</i> must here have the same sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:20">Matthew 13:20</span>: <i>He heareth the word, and anon with joy</i> RECEIVETH <i>it</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>: <i>But as many as</i> RECEIVED <i>him, to them gave he power to become the</i> <i>sons of God</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11">John 3:11</span>: <i>Ye</i> RECEIVE <i>not our witness</i>. - See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:32">John 3:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:5">3 John 1:5</span>:43 : <i>I am come in my Father's name, and ye</i> RECEIVE <i>me not</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:48">John 12:48</span>: <i>He that</i> RECEIVETH <i>not my words</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:20">John 13:20</span>: <i>He that receiveth whomsoever I send</i>, RECEIVETH <i>me</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:17">John 14:17</span>: <i>The Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot</i> RECEIVE. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:8">John 17:8</span>: <i>I have given them the words which thou gavest me; and they have</i> RECEIVED <i>them</i>. In all these passages it is evident that <i>receiving</i> and not receiving imply improving or not improving.</p>
