<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Therefore, as by the offence of one</b></i>, c.] The Greek text of this verse is as follows:- Αρα ουν, ὡς δι' ἑνος παραπτωματος, εις παντας ανθρωπους εις κατακριμα· αυτω και ἑνος δικαιωματος, εις παντας ανθρωπους, εις δικαιωσιν ζωης; which literally rendered stands thus:-<i>Therefore, as by one offence unto</i> <i>all men, unto condemnation; so likewise, by one righteousness unto</i> <i>all men, to justification of life</i>. This is evidently an elliptical sentence, and its <i>full</i> meaning can be gathered only from the context. He who had no particular purpose to serve would, most probably, understand it, from the context, thus:- <i>Therefore, as by one sin all men</i> came <i>into condemnation; so also</i> <i>by one righteous act all men</i> came <i>unto justification of life</i>: which is more fully expressed in the following verse. Now, leaving all particular <i>creeds</i> out of the question, and taking in the scope of the apostle's reasoning in this and the preceding chapter, is not the sense evidently this? - Through the disobedience of Adam, a sentence of condemnation to death, without any promise or hope of a resurrection, passed upon all men; so, by the obedience of Christ unto death, this one grand righteous act, the sentence was so far reversed, that death shall not <i>finally</i> triumph, for all shall again be restored to life. <i>Justice</i> must have its due; and therefore all must <i>die</i>. The <i>mercy</i> of God, in Christ Jesus, shall have its due also; and therefore all shall be put into a <i>salvable</i> state here, and the whole human race shall be raised to <i>life</i> at the great day. Thus both <i>justice</i> and <i>mercy</i> are magnified; and neither is exalted at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>The apostle uses <i>three</i> remarkable words in these three verses:-</p>
<p>1. δικαιωμα, <i>justification</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>.</p>
<p>2. δικαιοσυνη, which we render <i>righteousness</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>; but is best rendered <i>justification</i>, as expressing that <i>pardon</i> and <i>salvation</i> offered to us in the Gospel: <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span></span>.</p>
<p>3. δικαιωσις, which is also rendered <i>justification</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> word, δικαιωμα, is found in the following places: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:26">Romans 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1">Hebrews 9:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:10">Hebrews 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+15:4">Revelation 15:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+19:8">Revelation 19:8</span>; to which the reader may refer. δικαιωμα signifies, among the Greek writers, <i>the sentence of a judge,</i> <i>acquitting the innocent, condemning and punishing the guilty</i>; but in the New Testament it signifies whatever God has <i>appointed</i> or <i>sanctioned</i> as a <i>law</i>; and appears to answer to the Hebrew משפט יהוה <i>mishpat Yehovah, the statute</i> or <i>judgment, of the Lord;</i> It has evidently this sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>: <i>Walking in all the commandments and</i> ORDINANCES, δικαιωμασι, <i>of the</i> <i>Lord blameless</i>; and it has the like meaning in the principal places referred to above; but in the verse in question it most evidently means <i>absolution</i>, or <i>liberation, from punishment</i>, as it is opposed to κατακριμα, condemnation, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span></span>; and see <i>Schleusner</i> in voce.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> word, δικαιοσυνη, I have explained at large in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>, already referred to.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> word δικαιωσις, is used by the Greek writers, almost universally, to denote the <i>punishment</i> inflicted on a <i>criminal</i>, or the <i>condemnatory sentence</i> itself; but in the New Testament where it occurs only <i>twice</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>, <i>he was raised for our justification</i>, δικαιωσιν; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>, <i>unto justification of life</i>, δικαιωσιν ζωης,) it evidently signifies the <i>pardon</i> and <i>remission of sins</i>; and seems to be nearly synonymous with δικαιωμα. Dr. Taylor thinks that "δικαιοσυνη is <i>Gospel pardon</i> and <i>salvation</i>, and has reference to <i>God's mercy</i>. δικαιωμα is our being set <i>quite clear</i> and <i>right</i>; or our being restored to <i>sanctity, delivered from eternal death</i>, and being <i>brought to eternal life</i>; and has reference to the <i>power</i> and <i>guilt</i> of <i>sin</i>. And δικαιωσις he thinks may mean no more than our being <i>restored to life at the resurrection</i>." Taking these in their order, there is:</p>
<p><i>First, pardon of sin.</i></p>
<p><i>Secondly, purification</i> of <i>heart</i>, and preparation for glory.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, the <i>resurrection</i> of the <i>body</i>, and its being made like to his glorious body, so as to become a fit tabernacle for the soul in a glorified state for ever and ever.</p>
<p>The same writer observes that, when the apostle speaks of <i>forgiveness of sins</i> simply, he insists on <i>faith</i> as the <i>condition;</i> but <i>here</i>, where he speaks of <i>justification of life</i>, he mentions no <i>condition</i>; and therefore he supposes <i>justification of life</i>, the phrase being understood in a forensic sense, to mean no more than the <i>decree</i> or <i>judgment</i> that determines the <i>resurrection from the</i> <i>dead</i>. This is a favourite point with the doctor, and he argues largely for it: see his <i>notes</i>.</p>
