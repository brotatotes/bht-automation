<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>. <i><b>By whom also</b></i> — We are not only indebted to our Lord Jesus Christ for the free and full pardon which we have received, but our <i>continuance</i> in a justified state depends upon his gracious influence in our hearts, and his intercession before the throne of God.</p>
<p><i><b>We have access</b></i> — προσαγωγην εσχηκαμεν, <i>We have received this</i> <i>access</i>. It was only through Christ that we could at first <i>approach God</i>; and it is only through him that the privilege is continued to us. And this access to God, or <i>introduction</i> to the Divine presence, is to be considered as a lasting privilege. We are not brought to God for the purpose of an <i>interview</i>, but to <i>remain</i> with him; to be his <i>household</i>; and, by <i>faith</i>, to behold his face, and walk in the light of his countenance.</p>
<p><i><b>Into this grace</b></i> — This <i>state</i> of favour and acceptance.</p>
<p><i><b>Wherein we stand</b></i> — Having firm footing, and a just title through the blood of the Lamb to the full salvation of God.</p>
<p><i><b>And rejoice</b></i> — Have solid happiness, from the <i>evidence</i> we have of our <i>acceptance</i> with Him.</p>
<p><i><b>In hope of the glory of God.</b></i> — Having our sins <i>remitted</i>, and our souls <i>adopted</i> into the heavenly family, we are become <i>heirs</i>; for if <i>children</i>, then <i>heirs</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span>; and that glory of God is now become our endless inheritance. While the Jews boast of their external privileges-that they have the <i>temple of God</i> among them; that their <i>priests</i> have an <i>entrance</i> to God as their representatives, carrying before the mercy-seat the <i>blood of their</i> <i>offered victims</i>; we exult in being introduced by <i>Jesus Christ</i> to the Divine presence; <i>his blood</i> having been shed and sprinkled for this purpose; and thus we have, spiritually and <i>essentially</i>, all that these Jewish rites, &amp;c., signified. We are in the peace of God, and we are happy in the enjoyment of that peace, and have a blessed foretaste of eternal glory. Thus we have heaven upon earth, and the ineffable glories of God in prospect.</p>
