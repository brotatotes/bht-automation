<p>Verse 20. <i><b>The law entered that</b></i><b> (ινα) </b><i><b>the offence might</b></i><b> </b><i><b>abound.</b></i> — After considering various opinions concerning the true meaning of this verse, (see under <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>,) I am induced to prefer my own, as being the most simple. By <i>law</i> I understand the Mosaic law. By <i>entering in</i>, παρεισηλθεν, or, rather, <i>coming in</i> <i>privily</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4">Galatians 2:4</span>, (the only place where it occurs besides,) I understand the temporary or limited use of that law, which was, as far as its <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i> are considered, confined to the Jewish people, and to them only till the Messiah should come; but considered as the <i>moral law</i>, or <i>rule of conscience</i> and <i>life</i>, it has in its <i>spirit</i> and <i>power</i> been <i>slipped in-introduced</i> into every conscience, <i>that sin might abound</i>-that the true nature, deformity, and extent of sin might appear; for by the law is the knowledge of sin: for how can the finer deviations from a <i>straight line</i> be ascertained, without the application of a known <i>straight edge</i>? Without this <i>rule of right</i>, sin can only be known in a sort of <i>general</i> way; the innumerable <i>deviations</i> from <i>positive rectitude</i> can only be known by the application of the righteous statutes of which the law is composed. And it was necessary that this law should be given, that the true nature of <i>sin</i> might be seen, and that men might be the better prepared to receive the Gospel; finding that this law worketh only <i>wrath</i>, i.e. denounces <i>punishment</i>, forasmuch as all have sinned. Now, it is wisely ordered of God, that wherever the Gospel goes there the law goes also; <i>entering</i> every where, that <i>sin</i> may be seen to <i>abound</i>, and that men may be led to despair of salvation in any other way or on any terms but those proposed in the Gospel of Christ. Thus the sinner becomes a <i>true penitent</i>, and is glad, seeing the curse of the <i>law</i> hanging over his soul, to flee for refuge to the hope set before him in the <i>Gospel</i>. On the meaning of ινα, in various places, see Chrysost. vol. iii. p. 241. See also Hammond on the word in his notes on the New Testament.</p>
<p><i><b>But where sin abounded</b></i> — Whether in the <i>world</i>, or in the <i>heart</i> of the <i>individual</i>, being discovered by this most pure and righteous <i>law, grace did much more abound</i>: not only <i>pardon</i> for all that is past is offered by the Gospel, so that all the transgressions for which the soul is condemned to death by the law, are freely and fully forgiven; but also the Holy Spirit, in the abundance of his gifts and graces, is communicated, so as to prepare the receiver for an exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Thus the grace of the Gospel not only redeems from death, and restores to life, but brings the soul into such a relationship with God, and into such a participation of eternal glory, as we have no authority to believe ever would have been the portion even of <i>Adam</i> himself, had he even eternally retained his innocence. Thus, <i>where sin abounded, grace doth much more abound</i>.</p>
