<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>. <i><b>And not only so</b></i> — We are not only happy from being in this state of communion with our God, and the prospect of being eternally with him;</p>
<p><i><b>But we glory in tribulations also</b></i> — All the sufferings we endure for the testimony of our Lord are so sanctified to us by his grace, that they become powerful instruments of increasing our happiness.</p>
<p><i><b>Tribulation worketh patience</b></i> — υπομονην, Endurance under trials, without sustaining loss or deterioration. It is a metaphor taken from refining metals. We do not speak thus from any sudden raptures, or extraordinary sensations we may have of spiritual joy: for we find that the tribulations through which we pass are the <i>means</i> of exercising and increasing our patience, our meek forbearance of injuries received, or persecutions experienced, on account of the Gospel.</p>
