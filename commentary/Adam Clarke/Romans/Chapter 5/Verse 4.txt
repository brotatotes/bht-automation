<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span>. <i><b>And patience, experience</b></i> — δοκιμεν, <i>Full proof, by</i> <i>trial</i>, of the truth of our religion, the solidity of our Christian state, and the faithfulness of our God. In such cases we have the opportunity of putting our religion to the <i>test</i>; and, by every such test, it receives the <i>deeper sterling stamp</i>. The apostle uses here also a metaphor taken from the <i>purifying, refining</i>, and <i>testing</i> of silver and gold.</p>
<p><i><b>Experience, hope</b></i> — For we thus calculate, that he who has supported us in the <i>past</i> will support us in those which may <i>yet</i> <i>come</i>; and as we have received so much spiritual profiting by means of the sufferings through which we have already passed, we may profit equally by those which are yet to come: and this <i>hope</i> prevents us from dreading coming trials; we receive them as <i>means</i> <i>of grace</i>, and find that all things work together for good to them that love God.</p>
