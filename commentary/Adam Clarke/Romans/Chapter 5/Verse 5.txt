<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>. <i><b>And hope maketh not ashamed</b></i> — A hope that is not <i>rationally</i> founded will have its expectation cut off; and then <i>shame</i> and <i>confusion</i> will be the portion of its possessor. But our hope is of a different kind; it is founded on the <i>goodness</i> and <i>truth</i> of God; and our religious experience shows us that we have not misapplied it; nor exercised it on wrong or improper objects.</p>
<p><i><b>Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts</b></i> — We have the most solid and convincing <i>testimony</i> of God's love to us, by that measure of it which he has communicated to our hearts. There, εκκεχυται, it is <i>poured out</i>, and diffused abroad; filling, quickening, and invigorating all our powers and faculties. This love is the <i>spring</i> of all our <i>actions</i>; it is the <i>motive</i> of our <i>obedience</i>; the <i>principle</i> through which we <i>love God</i>, we love him because he first loved us; and we love him with a love worthy of himself, because it springs from him: it is his <i>own</i>; and every <i>flame</i> that rises from this pure and vigorous <i>fire</i> must be pleasing in his sight: it <i>consumes</i> what is <i>unholy; refines</i> every <i>passion</i> and <i>appetite; sublimes</i> the whole, and <i>assimilates</i> all to itself. And we know that this is the <i>love of God</i>; it differs widely from all that is <i>earthly</i> and <i>sensual</i>. The <i>Holy Ghost</i> comes with it; by his energy it is diffused and pervades every part; and by his <i>light</i> we discover <i>what</i> it is, and <i>know</i> the <i>state</i> of grace in which we stand. Thus we are furnished to every good word and work; have produced in us the mind that was in Christ; are enabled to obey the pure law of our God in its <i>spiritual</i> sense, by <i>loving</i> <i>him with all our heart, soul, mind</i>, and <i>strength</i>; and our <i>neighbour, any</i> and <i>every soul</i> of man, <i>as ourselves</i>. This <i>is</i>, or <i>ought</i> to be, the common experience of every genuine believer; but, in addition to this, the primitive Christians had, <i>sometimes</i>, the <i>miraculous</i> gifts of the Holy Spirit. These were <i>then needful</i>; and were they needful <i>now</i>, they would be again communicated.</p>
