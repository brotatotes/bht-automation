<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>. <i><b>For when we were yet without strength</b></i> — The apostle, having pointed out the glorious state of the believing Gentiles, takes occasion to contrast this with their former state; and the means by which they were redeemed from it. Their former state he points out in <i>four</i> particulars; which may be applied to men in general.</p>
<p>I. They were ασθενεις, <i>without strength</i>; in a <i>weak, dying</i> state: neither able to <i>resist sin</i>, nor <i>do</i> any <i>good</i>: utterly devoid of <i>power</i> to extricate themselves from the misery of their situation.</p>
<p>II. They were ασεβεις, <i>ungodly</i>; without either the <i>worship</i> or <i>knowledge</i> of the true God; they had not God <i>in them</i>; and, consequently, were not partakers of the Divine nature: Satan lived in, ruled, and enslaved their hearts.</p>
<p>III. They were αμαρτωλοι, <i>sinners</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>, <i>aiming</i> at <i>happiness</i>, but constantly <i>missing the mark</i>, which is the ideal meaning of the Hebrew חטא chata, and the Greek αμαρτανω. See this explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:13">Genesis 13:13</span>. And in <i>missing the mark</i>, they deviated from the right way; walked in the wrong way; <i>trespassed</i> in thus deviating; and, by breaking the commandments of God, not only missed the mark of <i>felicity</i>, but exposed themselves to everlasting <i>misery</i>.</p>
<p>IV. They were εχθροι <i>enemies</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>, from εχθος, <i>hatred, enmity</i>, persons who hated God and holiness; and acted in continual <i>hostility</i> to both. What a gradation is here!</p>
<p>1. In our fall from God, our first apparent state is, that we are <i>without strength</i>; have lost our principle of spiritual <i>power</i>, by having lost the image of God, righteousness and true holiness, in which we were created.</p>
<p>2. We are <i>ungodly</i>, having lost our strength to do good; we have also lost all power to <i>worship God</i> aright. The mind which was made for God is no longer his residence.</p>
<p>3. We are <i>sinners</i>; feeling we have lost our centre of rest, and our happiness, we go about seeking rest, but find none: what we have lost in losing God, we seek in earthly things; and thus are continually <i>missing the mark</i>, and multiplying transgressions against our Maker.</p>
<p>4. We are <i>enemies</i>; sin, indulged, increases in strength; evil <i>acts</i> engender fixed and rooted <i>habits</i>; the mind, every where poisoned with sin, increases in averseness from good; and mere <i>aversion</i> produces <i>enmity</i>; and <i>enmity, acts of hostility</i>, fell cruelty, c.: so that the enemy of God hates his Maker and his service is cruel to his fellow creatures; "a foe to God, was ne'er true friend to man;" and even torments his own soul! Though every man brings into the world the seeds of all these evils, yet it is only by <i>growing up</i> in him that they acquire their perfection-<i>nemo repente fuit turpissimus</i>-no man becomes a profligate at <i>once</i>; he arrives at it by slow degrees; and the speed he makes is proportioned to his circumstances, means of gratifying sinful passions, evil education, bad company, c., c. These make a great <i>diversity</i> in the moral states of men: all have the same seeds of evil-<i>nemo sine vitiis nascitur</i>-all come defiled into the world but all have not the same opportunities of <i>cultivating</i> these seeds. Besides, as God's <i>Spirit</i> is continually convincing the world of <i>sin, righteousness</i>, and <i>judgment</i>, and the <i>ministers</i> of God are seconding its influence with their pious exhortations, as the <i>Bible</i> is in almost every house, and is less or more heard or read by almost every person, these evil seeds are receiving continual <i>blasts</i> and <i>checks</i>, so that, in many cases, they have not a vigorous growth. These causes make the principal <i>moral differences</i> that we find among men though in evil <i>propensities</i> they are all radically the <i>same</i>.</p>
<p>That all the preceding characters are applied by some learned men to the <i>Gentiles</i>, exclusively as such, I am well aware; and that they may be all applied to them in a <i>national</i> point of view, there can be little doubt. But there are too many correspondences between the state of the <i>modern Gentiles</i> and that of the <i>ancient</i> <i>Gentiles</i>, to justify the propriety of applying the whole as fully to the <i>former</i> as to the <i>latter</i>. Indeed, the <i>four</i> particulars already explained point out the <i>natural</i> and <i>practical</i> state of every human being, previously to his regeneration by the grace and Spirit of God.</p>
<p><i><b>In due time Christ died for the ungodly.</b></i> — This due or proper time will appear in the following particulars:-</p>
<p>1. Christ was manifested in the flesh when the world needed him most.</p>
<p>2. When the powers of the human mind had been cultivated to the utmost both in <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i>, and had made every possible effort, but all in vain, to find out some efficient scheme of happiness.</p>
<p>3. When the Jews were in the lowest state of corruption, and had the greatest need of the promised deliverer.</p>
<p>4. When the fulness of the time came, foretold by the prophets.</p>
<p>5. When both Jews and Gentiles, the one from their <i>jealousy</i>, the other from their <i>learning</i>, were best qualified to detect imposture and to ascertain <i>fact</i>.</p>
<p>6. In a word, Christ came when his advent was most likely to promote its great object-glory to God in the highest, and peace and good will among men. And the <i>success</i> that attended the preaching of Christ and his apostles, together with the wide and rapid spread of the Gospel, all prove that it was the <i>due time</i>, κατα καιρον, the <i>proper season</i>; and that Divine wisdom was justified in fixing upon <i>that</i> time in preference to all others.</p>
<p><i><b>Died for the ungodly</b></i> — υπερ ασεβων απεθανε, <i>He died</i> INSTEAD <i>of the ungodly</i>, see also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>; so <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>. <i>The body of Christ</i>, το υπερ υμων διδομενον, <i>which is given</i> FOR <i>you</i>; i.e. <i>the life that is laid down in your</i> STEAD. In this way the preposition υπερ, is used by the best <i>Greek</i> writers.</p>
