<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:7">Romans 5:7</span>. <i><b>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die</b></i> — The Jews divide men, as to their moral character, into <i>four</i> classes:</p>
<p>1. First class, Those who say, "what is <i>mine</i>, is <i>my own</i>; and what is <i>thine</i>, is <i>thy own</i>." These may be considered the <i>just</i>, who render to every man his due; or rather, they who neither <i>give</i> nor <i>take</i>.</p>
<p>2. The second class is made up of those who say, "what is <i>mine</i>, is <i>thine</i>; and what is <i>thine</i>, is <i>mine</i>." These are they who accommodate each other, who <i>borrow</i> and <i>lend</i>.</p>
<p>3. The third class is composed of those who say, "What is <i>mine</i>, is <i>thine</i>; and what is <i>thine</i>, let it be <i>thine</i>." These are the <i>pious</i>, or <i>good</i>, who give up all for the benefit of their neighbour.</p>
<p>4. The fourth class are those who say, "What is <i>mine</i>, is <i>mine</i>; and what is <i>thine</i>, shall be <i>mine</i>." These are the <i>impious</i>, who <i>take all</i>, and <i>give nothing</i>. Now, for one of the first class, who would die? There is nothing amiable in his life or conduct that would so endear him to any man, as to induce him to risk his life to save such a person.</p>
<p><i><b>Peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</b></i> — This is for one of the third class, who gives all he has for the good of others. This is the truly <i>benevolent</i> man, whose life is devoted to the public good: for such a person, peradventure, some who have had their lives perhaps preserved by his bounty, would even dare to die: but such cases may be considered merely as <i>possible</i>: they exist, it is true, in <i>romance</i>; and we find a few rare instances of <i>friends</i> exposing themselves to death for their friends. See the case of Jonathan and David; Damon and Pythias, Val. Max. lib. iv. c, 7; Nisus and Euryalus, Virgil. And our Lord says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:13">John 15:13</span>: <i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life</i> <i>for his friends</i>. This is the utmost we can expect among men.</p>
