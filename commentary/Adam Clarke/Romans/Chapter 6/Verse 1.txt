<p>The apostle, having proved that salvation, both to Jew and Gentile, must come through the Messiah, and be received <i>by faith</i> <i>only</i>, proceeds in this chapter to show the obligations under which both were laid to live a holy life, and the means and advantages they enjoyed for that purpose. This he does, not only as a thing highly and indispensably necessary in itself-for without holiness none can see the Lord-but to confute a calumny which appears to have been gaining considerable ground even at that time, viz. that the doctrine of <i>justification by faith alone, through the grace of</i> <i>Christ Jesus</i>, rendered obedience to the moral law useless; and that the more evil a man did, the more the grace of God would abound to him, in his redemption from that evil. That this calumny was then propagated we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>; and the apostle defends himself against it in the 31st verse of the same, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:31">Romans 3:31</span> by asserting, that his doctrine, far from making void the law, served to establish it. But in this and the two following chapters he takes up the subject in a regular, formal manner; and shows both Jews and Gentiles that the principles of the Christian religion absolutely require a <i>holy heart</i> and a <i>holy</i> <i>life</i>, and make the amplest provisions for both.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>. <i><b>Shall we continue in sin</b></i> â€” It is very likely that these were the words of a believing <i>Gentile</i>, who-having as yet received but little instruction, for he is but just brought <i>out</i> of his <i>heathen</i> state to believe in Christ Jesus-might imagine, from the manner in which God had magnified his mercy, in blotting out his sin on his simply believing on Christ, that, supposing he even gave way to the evil propensities of his own heart, his transgressions could do him no hurt now that he was in the favour of God. And we need not wonder that a <i>Gentile</i>, just emerging from the deepest darkness, might entertain such thoughts as these; when we find that eighteen centuries after this, persons have appeared in the most Christian countries of Europe, not merely asking such a question, but defending the doctrine with all their might; and asserting in the most unqualified manner, "that believers were under <i>no obligation</i> to keep the <i>moral law</i> of God; that Christ had kept it for them; that his keeping it was <i>imputed to them</i>; and that God, who had exacted it from <i>Him</i>, who was their surety and representative, would not exact it from <i>them</i>, forasmuch as it would be <i>injustice</i> to require <i>two payments</i> for <i>one debt</i>." These are the <i>Antinomians</i> who once flourished in this land, and whose race is not yet utterly extinct.</p>
