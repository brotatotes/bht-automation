<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:11">Romans 6:11</span>. <i><b>Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead</b></i> â€” Die as truly <i>unto</i> sin, as he died <i>for</i> sin. Live as truly <i>unto</i> God, as he lives <i>with</i> God. This seems to be the spirit of the apostle's meaning.</p>
