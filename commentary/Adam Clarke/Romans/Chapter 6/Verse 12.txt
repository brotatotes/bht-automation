<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12">Romans 6:12</span>. <i><b>Let not sin therefore reign</b></i> — This is a prosopopoeia, or <i>personification</i>. Sin is represented as a <i>king,</i> <i>ruler</i>, or <i>tyrant</i>, who has the <i>desires of the mind</i> and the <i>members</i> of the <i>body</i> under his control so that by influencing the <i>passions</i> he governs the <i>body</i>. Do not let sin reign, do not let him work; that is, let him have no <i>place</i>, no <i>being</i> in your souls; because, wherever he is he governs, less or more: and indeed <i>sin</i> is not <i>sin</i> without this. How is sin known? By evil <i>influences</i> in the mind, and <i>evil acts</i> in the <i>life</i>. But do not these <i>influences</i> and these <i>acts</i> prove his <i>dominion</i>? Certainly, the very existence of an evil thought to which <i>passion</i> or <i>appetite attaches itself</i>, is a proof that there sin has <i>dominion</i>; for without dominion such passions could not be excited. Wherever sin is <i>felt</i>, there sin has <i>dominion</i>; for sin is <i>sin</i> only as it <i>works</i> in <i>action</i> or <i>passion</i> against God. Sin cannot be a <i>quiescent</i> thing: if it do not <i>work</i> it does not <i>exist</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</b></i> — Αυτῃ εν ταις επιθυμιαις αυτου. This clause is <i>wanting</i> in the most ancient and reputable MSS. and in the principal versions. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of his text; and Professor <i>White</i> says, <i>Certissime</i> delenda: "These words should certainly he expunged" they are not necessary to the apostle's argument; it was enough to say, <i>Let not sin reign</i> <i>in your mortal bodies, that ye should obey it</i>. If it be <i>there</i> it will <i>reign</i> there; and its reign supposes, necessarily, the <i>subjection</i> of that <i>in</i> which it reigns. A king reigns when his <i>laws are enforced</i>, and the <i>people obey them</i>. When there is no <i>executive</i> government there is no <i>reign</i>. There may be a <i>royal</i> <i>shadow</i> there, but there is no <i>king</i>.</p>
