<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span>. <i><b>Neither yield ye your members</b></i> — Do not yield to temptation. It is no sin to be <i>tempted</i>, the sin lies in <i>yielding</i>. While the sin exists only in Satan's solicitation, it is the <i>devil's sin</i>, not <i>ours</i>: when we yield, we make the devil's sin our <i>own</i>: then <i>we</i> ENTER INTO <i>temptation</i>. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Satan himself cannot <i>force</i> you to sin: till he <i>wins over</i> your <i>will</i>, he cannot bring you into <i>subjection</i>. You may be <i>tempted</i>; but <i>yield</i> not to the temptation.</p>
<p><i><b>Yield yourselves unto God</b></i> — Let God have your <i>wills</i>; keep them ever on his side; there they are <i>safe</i>, and there they will be <i>active</i>. Satan <i>cannot force</i> the will, and God will not. Indeed it would cease to be <i>will</i> were it <i>forced</i> by either: it is essential to its <i>being</i> that it be <i>free</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And your members as instruments</b></i>, c.] Let soul and body be employed in the service of your Maker let him have your <i>hearts</i>; and with them, your <i>heads</i>, your <i>hands</i>, your <i>feet</i>. <i>Think</i> and devise what is pure; <i>speak</i> what is true, and to the use of edifying; <i>work</i> that which is just and good; and <i>walk</i> steadily in the <i>way</i> that leads to everlasting felicity. Be holy <i>within</i> and holy <i>without</i>.</p>
