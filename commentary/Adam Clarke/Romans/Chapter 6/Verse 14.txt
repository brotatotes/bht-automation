<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span>. <i><b>Sin shall not have dominion over you</b></i> — God delivers you from it; and if you again become subject to it, it will be the effect of your own choice or negligence.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye are not under the law</b></i> — That law which exacts obedience, without giving <i>power</i> to obey; that condemns every transgression and every unholy thought without providing for the extirpation of evil or the pardon of sin.</p>
<p><i><b>But under grace.</b></i> — Ye are under the merciful and beneficent dispensation of the <i>Gospel</i>, that, although it requires the strictest conformity to the will of God, affords sufficient power to be thus conformed; and, in the death of Christ, has provided <i>pardon</i> for all that is past, and <i>grace</i> to help in every time of need.</p>
