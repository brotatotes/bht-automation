<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15">Romans 6:15</span>. <i><b>Shall we sin because we are not under the law</b></i> â€” Shall we abuse our high and holy calling because we are not under that <i>law</i> which makes no provision for <i>pardon</i>, but are under that <i>Gospel</i> which has opened the fountain to wash away all sin and defilement? Shall we sin because grace abounds? Shall we do evil that good may come of it? This be far from us!</p>
