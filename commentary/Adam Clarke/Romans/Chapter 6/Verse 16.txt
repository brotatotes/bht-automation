<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:16">Romans 6:16</span>. <i><b>To whom ye yield yourselves</b></i> — Can you suppose that you should continue to be the <i>servants</i> of Christ if ye give way to <i>sin</i>? Is he not the <i>master</i> who exacts the <i>service</i>, and to whom the service is performed? <i>Sin</i> is the service of <i>Satan;</i> <i>righteousness</i> the service of <i>Christ</i>. If ye sin ye are the servants of Satan, and not the servants of God.</p>
<p>The word δουλος, which we translate <i>servant</i>, properly signifies <i>slave</i>; and a slave among the Greeks and Romans was considered as his <i>master's property</i>, and he might dispose of him as he pleased. Under a <i>bad</i> master, the lot of the slave was most oppressive and dreadful; his ease and comfort were never consulted; he was treated worse than a beast; and, in many cases, his life hung on the mere caprice of the master. This state is the state of every poor, miserable sinner; he is the slave of Satan, and his own evil lusts and appetites are his most cruel task-masters. The same word is applied to the <i>servants of Christ</i>, the more forcibly to show that they are their <i>Master's property</i>; and that, as he is infinitely <i>good</i> and <i>benevolent</i>, therefore his service must be perfect freedom. Indeed, he exacts no obedience from them which he does not turn to their eternal advantage; for this master has no self-interest to secure. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span></span>.</p>
