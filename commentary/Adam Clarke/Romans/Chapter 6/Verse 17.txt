<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span>. <i><b>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>sin</b></i> — This verse should be read thus: <i>But thanks be to God that,</i> <i>although ye were the servants of sin, nevertheless ye have obeyed</i> <i>from the heart that form of doctrine that was delivered unto you</i>; or, <i>that mould of teaching into which ye were cast</i>. The apostle does not thank God that they <i>were sinners</i>; but that, <i>although</i> they were <i>such</i>, they had now received and obeyed the Gospel. The Hebrew phrase, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:1">Isaiah 12:1</span>, is exactly the same as that of the apostle here: <i>In that day thou shalt say, I will praise thee, for</i> <i>thou wast angry with me</i>: that is, <i>although thou wast angry with</i> <i>me, thou hast turned away thy wrath</i>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>That form of doctrine</b></i> — Τυπον διδαχης here Christianity is represented under the notion of a <i>mould</i>, or <i>die</i>, into which they were cast, and from which they took the <i>impression</i> of its excellence. The <i>figure</i> upon this <i>die</i> is the image of God, <i>righteousness and true holiness</i>, which was stamped on their souls in believing the Gospel and receiving the Holy Ghost. The words εις ὁν παρεδοθητε τυπον refer to the <i>melting</i> of <i>metal</i>; which, when it is liquified, is cast into the mould, that it may receive the impression that is <i>sunk</i> or <i>cut</i> in the mould; and therefore the words may be literally translated, <i>into which mould of doctrine ye</i> <i>have been cast</i>. They were <i>melted</i> down under the preaching of the word, and then were capable of receiving the stamp of its purity.</p>
