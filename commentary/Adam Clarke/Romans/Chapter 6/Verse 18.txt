<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:18">Romans 6:18</span>. <i><b>Being then made free from sin</b></i> — ελευθερωθεντες is a term that refers to the <i>manumission</i> of a <i>slave</i>. They were <i>redeemed</i> from the slavery of sin, and became the servants of righteousness. Here is another <i>prosopopoeia</i>: both <i>sin</i> and <i>righteousness</i> are <i>personified: sin</i> can enjoin no <i>good</i> and <i>profitable</i> work; <i>righteousness</i> can require none that is <i>unjust</i> or <i>injurious</i>.</p>
