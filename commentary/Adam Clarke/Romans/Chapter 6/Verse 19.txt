<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span>. <i><b>I speak after the manner of men</b></i> — This phrase is often used by the Greek writers to signify what was <i>easy to be</i> <i>comprehended</i>; what was <i>ad captum vulgi</i>, level with common understandings, delivered in a <i>popular style</i>; what was different from the <i>high flights</i> of the <i>poets</i>, and the studied <i>sublime</i> <i>obscurity</i> of the <i>philosophers</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Because of the infirmity of your flesh</b></i> — As if he had said: I make use of metaphors and figures connected with well-known natural things; with your <i>trades</i> and <i>situation</i> in life; because of your inexperience in heavenly things, of which ye are only just beginning to know the <i>nature</i> and the <i>names</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Servants to uncleanness</b></i>, &amp;c.] These different expressions show how deeply immersed in and enslaved by sin these Gentiles were before their conversion to Christianity. Several of the particulars are given in the first chapter of this epistle.</p>
