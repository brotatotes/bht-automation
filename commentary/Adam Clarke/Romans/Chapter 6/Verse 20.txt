<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:20">Romans 6:20</span>. <i><b>Ye were free from righteousness.</b></i> â€” These two servitudes are incompatible; if we cannot serve <i>God</i> and <i>Mammon</i>, surely we cannot serve <i>Christ</i> and <i>Satan</i>. We must be either <i>sinners</i> or <i>saints</i>; God's <i>servants</i> or the devil's <i>slaves</i>. It cannot be as a good mistaken man has <i>endeavoured</i> to <i>sing</i>: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "To good and evil equal bent,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> I'm both a devil and a saint."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>I know not whether it be possible to paint the utter prevalence of sin in stronger colours than the apostle does here, by saying <i>they were</i> FREE <i>from righteousness</i>. It seems tantamount to that expression in Genesis, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:5">Genesis 6:5</span>, where, speaking of the total degeneracy of the human race, the writer says, <i>Every imagination</i> <i>of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually</i>. They were all corrupt; they were altogether abominable: there was none that did good; no, not one.</p>
