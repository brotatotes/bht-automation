<p><i><b>Whereof ye are now ashamed?</b></i> — Ye blush to remember your former life. It was <i>scandalous</i> to yourselves, <i>injurious</i> to others, and highly <i>provoking</i> to God.</p>
<p><i><b>The end of those things is death.</b></i> — Whatever sin may promise of pleasure or advantage, the end to which it necessarily tends is the destruction of body and soul.</p>
