Verse Romans 6:21. What fruit had ye then in those things — God designs that every man shall reap benefit by his service. What benefit have ye derived from the service of sin?Whereof ye are now ashamed? — Ye blush to remember your former life. It was scandalous to yourselves, injurious to others, and highly provoking to God.The end of those things is death. — Whatever sin may promise of pleasure or advantage, the end to which it necessarily tends is the destruction of body and soul.
