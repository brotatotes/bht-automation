Verse Romans 6:22. But now being made free from sin — As being free from righteousness is the finished character of a sinner, so being made free from sin is the finished character of a genuine Christian.And become servants to God — They were transferred from the service of one master to that of another: they were freed from the slavery of sin, and engaged in the service of God.Fruit unto holiness — Holiness of heart was the principle; and righteousness of life the fruit.
