<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:22">Romans 6:22</span>. <i><b>But now being made free from sin</b></i> — As being <i>free</i> <i>from righteousness</i> is the finished character of a <i>sinner</i>, so being <i>made free</i> from <i>sin</i> is the finished character of a <i>genuine</i> <i>Christian</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And become servants to God</b></i> — They were transferred from the service of one master to that of another: they were freed from the slavery of sin, and engaged in the service of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Fruit unto holiness</b></i> — <i>Holiness</i> of heart was the <i>principle</i>; and <i>righteousness</i> of life the fruit.</p>
