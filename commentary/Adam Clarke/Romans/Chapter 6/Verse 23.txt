<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>. <i><b>For the wages of sin is death</b></i> — The second death, everlasting <i>perdition</i>. Every sinner <i>earns</i> this by long, sore, and painful service. O! what pains do men take to get to hell! Early and late they toil at sin; and would not Divine justice be in their <i>debt</i>, if it did not pay them their due wages?</p>
<p><i><b>But the gift of God is eternal life</b></i> — A man may MERIT <i>hell</i>, but he cannot MERIT <i>heaven</i>. The apostle does not say that the <i>wages</i> <i>of righteousness is eternal life</i>: no, but that this eternal life, even to the righteous, is το χαρισμα του θεου, THE <i>gracious</i> GIFT <i>of</i> GOD. And even this gracious gift comes <i>through Jesus Christ</i> <i>our Lord</i>. He alone has procured it; and it is given to all those who find redemption in his blood. A sinner goes to hell because he <i>deserves</i> it; a righteous man goes to heaven because Christ <i>has</i> <i>died for him</i>, and communicated that grace by which his sin is pardoned and his soul made holy. The word οψωνια, which we here render <i>wages</i>, signified the <i>daily pay</i> of a Roman soldier. So every sinner has a <i>daily pay</i>, and this pay is <i>death</i>; he has <i>misery</i> because he sins. Sin constitutes hell; the sinner has a hell in his own bosom; all is <i>confusion</i> and <i>disorder</i> where God does not reign: every indulgence of sinful passions increases the disorder, and consequently the misery of a sinner. If men were as much in earnest to get their souls saved as they are to prepare them for perdition, heaven would be highly peopled, and devils would be their own companions. And will not the <i>living</i> lay this to heart?</p>
<p>1. In the preceding chapter we see the <i>connection</i> that subsists between the doctrines of the Gospel and the practice of Christianity. A <i>doctrine</i> is a <i>teaching, instruction</i>, or <i>information</i> concerning some <i>truth</i> that is to be believed, as essential to our salvation. But all teaching that comes <i>from</i> God, necessarily leads <i>to</i> him. That Christ died for our sins and rose again for our justification, is a glorious doctrine of the Gospel. But this is of no use to him who does not die to sin, rise in the likeness of his resurrection, and walk in newness of life: this is the <i>use</i> that should be made of the <i>doctrine</i>. Every doctrine has its <i>use</i>, and the use of it consists in the <i>practice</i> founded on it. We hear there is a <i>free pardon</i>-we go to God and receive it; we hear that we may be made <i>holy</i>-we apply for the sanctifying Spirit; we hear there is a <i>heaven of glory</i>, into which the righteous alone shall enter-we watch and pray, believe, love, and obey, in order that, when he doth appear, we may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless. <i>Those</i> are the <i>doctrines</i>; these are the <i>uses</i> or <i>practice</i> founded on those doctrines.</p>
<p>2. It is strange that there should be found a person believing the whole Gospel system, and yet living in sin! SALVATION FROM SIN is the <i>long-continued sound</i>, as it is the spirit and design, of the Gospel. Our <i>Christian name</i>, our <i>baptismal covenant</i>, our <i>profession of faith</i> in Christ, and avowed belief in his word, all call us to this: can it be said that we have any louder calls than these? Our <i>self-interest</i>, as it respects the happiness of a godly life, and the glories of eternal blessedness; the pains and wretchedness of a life of sin, leading to the worm that never dies and the fire that is not quenched; second most powerfully the above calls. Reader, lay these things to heart, and: answer this question to God; <i>How shall I escape, if I neglect so</i> great <i>salvation</i>? And then, as thy conscience shall answer, let thy mind and thy hands begin to act.</p>
