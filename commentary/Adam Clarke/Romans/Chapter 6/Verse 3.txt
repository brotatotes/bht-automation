<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3">Romans 6:3</span>. <i><b>Know ye not</b></i>, &amp;c.] Every man who believes the Christian religion, and receives baptism as the proof that he believes it, and has taken up the profession of it, is bound thereby to a life of righteousness. <i>To be baptized into Christ</i>, is to receive the doctrine of Christ crucified, and to receive baptism as a proof of the genuineness of that faith, and the obligation to live according to its precepts.</p>
<p><i><b>Baptized into his death?</b></i> â€” That, as Jesus Christ in his crucifixion died completely, so that no spark of the <i>natural</i> or <i>animal life</i> remained in his body, so those who profess his religion should be so completely <i>separated</i> and <i>saved from sin</i>, that they have no more <i>connection</i> with it, nor any more <i>influence</i> from it, than a <i>dead man</i> has with or from his <i>departed</i> spirit.</p>
