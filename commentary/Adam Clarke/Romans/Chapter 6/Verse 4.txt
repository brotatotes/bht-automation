<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>. <i><b>We are buried with him by baptism into death</b></i> — It is <i>probable</i> that the apostle here alludes to the mode of administering baptism by <i>immersion</i>, the whole body being put <i>under</i> <i>the water</i>, which seemed to say, the man is <i>drowned</i>, is <i>dead</i>; and, when he came up out of the water, he seemed to have a <i>resurrection</i> to life; <i>the man is risen again; he is alive</i>! He was, therefore, supposed to throw off his old <i>Gentile</i> state as he threw off his clothes, and to assume a new character, as the baptized generally put on new or fresh garments. I say it is <i>probable</i> that the apostle alludes to this mode of immersion; but it is not absolutely <i>certain</i> that he does so, as some do imagine; for, in the next verse, our being incorporated into Christ by <i>baptism</i> is also denoted by our being <i>planted</i>, or rather, <i>grafted together in</i> <i>the likeness of his death</i>; and Noah's ark <i>floating</i> upon the water, and <i>sprinkled by the rain from heaven</i>, is a <i>figure</i> corresponding to <i>baptism</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20-21">1 Peter 3:20-21</span>; but neither of these gives us the same idea of the outward form as <i>burying</i>. We must be careful, therefore, not to lay too much stress on such circumstances. Drowning among the ancients was considered the most noble kind of death; some think that the apostle may allude to this. The grand point is, that this baptism represents our <i>death to sin</i>, and our <i>obligation to walk in newness of life</i>: without which, of what use can it or any other <i>rite</i> be?</p>
<p><i><b>Raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father</b></i> — From this we learn, that as it required the <i>glory of the Father</i>, that is, his <i>glorious energy</i>, to raise up from the grave tho dead body of Christ, so it requires the same glorious energy to <i>quicken</i> the dead soul of a sinner, and enable him to walk in newness of life.</p>
