<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>. <i><b>For if we have been planted together</b></i> — συμφυτοι γεγοναμεν. Dr. Taylor observes, that our translation does not completely express the apostle's meaning. Τα συμφυτα are such plants as grow, the one <i>upon</i> and <i>in the other</i>, deriving sap and nourishment from it, as the <i>mistletoe</i> upon the <i>oak</i>, or the <i>scion</i> upon the <i>stock</i> in which it is grafted. He would therefore translate the words: <i>For if we have been</i> growers together <i>with</i> <i>Christ in the likeness of his death</i>, (or in that which is like his death,) <i>we shall be also</i> growers together <i>with him in the likeness</i> <i>of his resurrection</i>; or in that which is like <i>his resurrection</i>. He reckons it a beautiful metaphor, taken from <i>grafting</i>, or making the scion <i>grow together</i> with a new <i>stock</i>.</p>
<p>But if we take the word <i>planted</i> in its usual sense, we shall find it to be a metaphor as beautiful and as expressive as the former. When the seed or plant is inserted in the ground, it derives from that ground all its nourishment, and all those juices by which it becomes developed; by which it increases in size, grows firm, strong, and vigorous; and puts forth its leaves, blossoms, and fruit. The <i>death</i> of Jesus Christ is represented as the <i>cause</i> whence his <i>fruitfulness</i>, as the author of eternal salvation to mankind is derived; and genuine believers in him are represented as being <i>planted in his death</i>, and growing <i>out of it</i>; deriving their growth, vigour, firmness, beauty, and fruitfulness from it. In a word, it is by his <i>death</i> that Jesus Christ redeems a lost world; and it is from that vicarious death that believers derive that pardon and holiness which makes them so <i>happy</i> in <i>themselves</i>, and so <i>useful</i> to <i>others</i>. This sacrificial death is the <i>soil</i> in which they are <i>planted</i>; and from which they derive their <i>life, fruitfulness</i>, and their final <i>glory</i>.</p>
