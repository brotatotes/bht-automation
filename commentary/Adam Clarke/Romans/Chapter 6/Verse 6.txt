<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>. <i><b>Our old man is crucified with</b></i> him] This seems to be a farther extension of the <i>same metaphor</i>. When a seed is planted in the earth, it appears as if the <i>whole body</i> of it <i>perished</i>. All <i>seeds</i>, as they are commonly termed, are composed of <i>two parts</i>; the <i>germ</i>, which contains the <i>rudiments</i> of the future plant; and the <i>lobes</i>, or <i>body</i> of the seed, which by their decomposition in the ground, become the first nourishment to the extremely fine and delicate roots of the embryo plant, and support it till it is capable of deriving grosser nourishment from the common soil. The <i>body</i> dies that the <i>germ</i> may live. Parables cannot go on all fours; and in metaphors or figures, there is always some <i>one</i> (or more) remarkable property by which the doctrine intended is illustrated. To apply this to the purpose in hand: how is the principle of <i>life</i> which Jesus Christ has <i>implanted</i> in us to be brought into full effect, vigour, and usefulness? By the destruction of the <i>body of sin</i>, our <i>old man</i>, our wicked, corrupt, and fleshly self, is to be crucified; to be as truly <i>slain</i> as Christ was crucified; that our souls may as truly be raised from a death of sin to a life of righteousness, as the body of Christ was raised from the grave, and afterwards ascended to the right hand of God. But how does this part of the metaphor apply to Jesus Christ? Plainly and forcibly. Jesus Christ took on him a body; a body <i>in the likeness of sinful flesh</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>; and gave up that body to death; through which <i>death</i> alone an atonement was made for sin, and the way laid open for the vivifying Spirit, to have the fullest access to, and the most powerful operation in, the human heart. Here, the <i>body</i> of Christ <i>dies</i> that he may be a <i>quickening</i> <i>Spirit</i> to mankind. Our <i>body of sin</i> is destroyed by this quickening Spirit, that henceforth we should live unto Him who died and rose again. Thus the metaphor, in all its leading senses, is complete, and applies most forcibly to the subject in question. We find that παλαιος ανθρωπος, <i>the old man</i>, used here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9">Colossians 3:9</span>, is the same as <i>the flesh with its affections and lusts</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:24">Galatians 5:24</span>; and <i>the body of the sins of the flesh</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>; and the very same which the Jewish writers term אדם הקדמוני, <i>Adam hakkadmoni</i>, the <i>old Adam</i>; and which they interpret by יצר הרע <i>yetsar hara</i>, "evil concupiscence," the same which we mean by <i>indwelling sin</i>, or the <i>infection of our nature</i>, in consequence of the <i>fall</i>. From all which we may learn that the design of God is to counterwork and destroy the very spirit and soul of sin, that we shall <i>no longer</i> <i>serve it</i>, δουλευειν, no longer be its <i>slaves</i>. Nor shall it any more be capable of performing its essential functions than a <i>dead</i> <i>body</i> can perform the functions of natural life.</p>
