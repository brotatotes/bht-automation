<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:7">Romans 6:7</span>. <i><b>He that is dead is freed from sin.</b></i> — δεδικαιωται, literally, <i>is justified</i> from sin; or, is <i>freed</i> or <i>delivered</i> from it. Does not this simply mean, that the man who has received Christ Jesus by faith, and has been, through believing, made a partaker of the Holy Spirit, has had his <i>old man</i>, all his <i>evil</i> <i>propensities</i> destroyed; so that he is not only justified freely from all sin, but wholly sanctified unto God? The context shows that this is the meaning. Every instance of violence is done to the whole scope and design of the apostle, by the opinion, that "this text is a proof that believers are <i>not</i> fully saved from sin <i>in this life</i>, because only he <i>that is dead is freed from sin</i>." Then <i>death</i> is his <i>justifier</i> and <i>deliverer</i>! Base and abominable insinuation, highly derogatory to the glory of Christ! Dr. Dodd, in his note on the preceding verse, after some inefficient criticism on the word καταργηθη, <i>destroyed</i>, which, he thinks, should be rendered <i>enervated</i>, has the following most unevangelical sentiment: "The body of sin in believers is, indeed, an enfeebled, conquered, and deposed tyrant, and the stroke of <i>death finishes</i> <i>its destruction</i>." So then, the death of Christ and the influences of the Holy Spirit were only sufficient to <i>depose</i> and <i>enfeeble</i> the tyrant sin; but OUR <i>death</i> must come in to effect his <i>total</i> <i>destruction</i>! Thus our death is, at least <i>partially</i>, our <i>Saviour</i>; and thus, that which was an <i>effect</i> of <i>sin</i> (for sin entered into the world, and death by sin) becomes the <i>means</i> of finally <i>destroying</i> it! That is, the <i>effect</i> of a <i>cause</i> can become so powerful, as to react upon that cause and produce its annihilation! The <i>divinity</i> and <i>philosophy</i> of this sentiment are equally absurd. It is the blood of Christ alone that cleanses from all unrighteousness; and the <i>sanctification</i> of a believer is no more dependent on <i>death</i> than his <i>justification</i>. If it he said, "that believers do not cease from sin till they die;" I have only to say, they are such <i>believers</i> as do not make a proper use of their <i>faith</i>; and what can be said more of the whole herd of transgressors and infidels? They <i>cease</i> to sin, when they <i>cease to</i> <i>breathe</i>. If the Christian religion bring no other privileges than this to its upright followers, well may we ask, wherein doth the <i>wise man</i> differ from the <i>fool</i>, for they have both one end? But the whole Gospel teaches a contrary doctrine.</p>
