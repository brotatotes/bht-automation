<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:9">Romans 6:9</span>. <i><b>Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more</b></i> â€” So we, believing in Christ Jesus, and having a death unto sin, and a life unto righteousness, should sin no more. If we be risen indeed with Christ, we should seek the things above, and set our affections on things above, and not on the earth. The man who walks in humble, loving obedience, to an indwelling Christ, sin has no more dominion over his soul than death has over the immortal and glorified body of his Redeemer.</p>
