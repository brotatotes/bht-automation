<p>The apostle having, in the preceding chapter, shown the <i>converted Gentiles</i> the obligations they were under to live a holy life, addresses himself here to the <i>Jews</i> who might hesitate to embrace the Gospel; lest, by this means, they should renounce the <i>law</i>, which might appear to them as a renunciation of their allegiance to God. As they rested in the law, as sufficient for justification and sanctification, it was necessary to convince them of their mistake. That the law was insufficient for their <i>justification</i> the apostle had proved, in chapters iii., iv., and v.; that it is insufficient for their <i>sanctification</i> he shows in this chapter; and introduces his discourse by showing that a believing Jew is discharged from his obligations to the law, and is at liberty to come under another and much happier constitution, viz. that of the Gospel of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:1-4">Romans 7:1-4</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span> he gives a general description of the state of a <i>Jew</i>, in servitude to sin, considered as under <i>mere law</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span> he gives a summary account of the state of a <i>Christian</i>, or believing Jew, and the advantages he enjoys under the Gospel. Upon <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span> he comments, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-25">Romans 7:7-25</span>, and upon <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span> he comments, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1-11">Romans 8:1-11</span>.</p>
<p>In explaining his position in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span> he shows:</p>
<p>1. That the law reaches to all the branches and latent principles of sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>.</p>
<p>2. That it subjected the sinner to death, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8-12">Romans 7:8-12</span>, without the expectation of pardon.</p>
<p>3. He shows the reason why the Jew was put under it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>.</p>
<p>4. He proves that the law, considered as a rule of action, though it was spiritual, just, holy, and good in itself, yet was insufficient for sanctification, or for freeing a man from the power of inbred sin.</p>
<p>For, as the prevalency of sensual appetites cannot wholly extinguish the voice of <i>reason</i> and <i>conscience</i>, a man may acknowledge the law to be holy, just, and good, and yet his <i>passions</i> reign within him, keeping him in the most painful and degrading servitude, while the law supplied no power to deliver him from them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14-24">Romans 7:14-24</span>, as that power can only be supplied by the grace of Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>. See Taylor.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:1">Romans 7:1</span>. <i><b>For I speak to them that know the law</b></i> — This is a proof that the apostle directs this part of his discourse to the <i>Jews</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>As long as he liveth?</b></i> — Or, <i>as long as</i> It <i>liveth</i>; law does not extend its influence to the dead, nor do <i>abrogated</i> laws <i>bind</i>. It is all the same whether we understand these words as speaking of a law <i>abrogated</i>, so that it cannot command; or of its objects being dead, so that it has none to bind. In either case the <i>law</i> has no force.</p>
