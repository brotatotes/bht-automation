Verse Romans 7:11. Sin, taking occasion — Sin, deriving strength from the law, threatening death to the transgressor, (Romans 7:8,) deceived me, drew me aside to disobedience, promising me gratification honour, independence, c., as it promised to Eve for to her history the apostle evidently alludes, and uses the very same expression, deceived me, εξηπατησε με. See the preceding note; and see the Septuagint, Genesis 3:13.And by it slew me.] Subjected me to that death which the law denounced against transgressors; and rendered me miserable during the course of life itself. It is well known to scholars that the verb αποκτεινειν signifies not only to slay or kill, but also to make wretched. Every sinner is not only exposed to death because he has sinned, and must, sooner or later, die; but he is miserable in both body and mind by the influence and the effects of sin. He lives a dying life, or a living death.
