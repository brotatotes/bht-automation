<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:12">Romans 7:12</span>. <i><b>Wherefore the law</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>holy</b></i> â€” As if he had said, to soothe his countrymen, to whom he had been showing the absolute insufficiency of the law either to justify or save from sin: I do not intimate that there is any thing <i>improper</i> or <i>imperfect</i> in the law as a <i>rule of life</i>: it prescribes what is <i>holy, just</i>, and <i>good;</i> for it comes from a holy, just, and good God. The LAW, which is to regulate the whole of the <i>outward conduct</i>, is holy; and the COMMANDMENT, <i>Thou shalt not covet</i>, which is to regulate the <i>heart</i>, is not less so. All is excellent and pure; but it neither pardons sin nor purifies the heart; and it is because it is holy, just, and good, that it condemns transgressors to <i>death</i>.</p>
