<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>. <i><b>Was then that which is good made death unto me?</b></i> — This is the question of the <i>Jew</i>, with whom the apostle appears to be disputing. "Do you allow the law to be <i>good</i>, and yet say it is the <i>cause</i> of our <i>death</i>?" The apostle answers:- <i>God forbid</i>! μη γενοιτο, by no means: it is not the <i>law</i> that is the <i>cause</i> of your death, but <i>sin</i>; it was sin which subjected us to death by the law, justly threatening sin with death: which law was given that sin might appear-might be set forth in its own colours; when we saw it subjected us to death by a law perfectly holy, just, and good; that sin, by the law, might be represented what it really is:- καθ' ὑπερβολην ἁμαρτωλος, an EXCEEDING GREAT and <i>deadly evil</i>.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that man cannot have a true notion of sin but by means of the law of God. For this I have already given sufficient reasons in the preceding notes. And it was one design of the law to show the abominable and destructive nature of sin, as well as to be a rule of life. It would be almost impossible for a man to have that just notion of the <i>demerit</i> of sin so as to produce repentance, or to see the nature and necessity of the death of Christ, if the law were not applied to his conscience by the light of the Holy Spirit; it is <i>then</i> alone that he sees himself to be carnal, and sold under sin; and that the law and the commandment are holy, just, and good. And let it be observed, that the law did not answer this end merely among the <i>Jews</i> in the <i>days of the apostle</i>; it is just as necessary to the <i>Gentiles</i> to the <i>present hour</i>. Nor do we find that true repentance takes place where the moral law is not preached and enforced. Those who preach only the <i>Gospel</i> to sinners, at best only heal the hurt of the daughter of my people <i>slightly</i>. The <i>law</i>, therefore, is the grand instrument in the hands of a faithful minister, to alarm and awaken sinners; and he may safely show that every sinner is <i>under</i> the law, and consequently under the curse, who has not fled for refuge to the hope held out by the Gospel: for, in this sense also, <i>Jesus Christ is the</i> END <i>of the</i> LAW <i>for justification to them</i> <i>that believe</i>.</p>
