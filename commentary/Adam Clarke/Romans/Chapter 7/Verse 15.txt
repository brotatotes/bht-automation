<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:15">Romans 7:15</span>. <i><b>For, that which I do, I allow not</b></i>, c.] The first clause of this verse is a general assertion concerning the employment of the person in question in the state which the apostle calls <i>carnal, and sold under sin</i>. The Greek word κατεργαξομαι which is here translated <i>I do</i>, means a <i>work</i> which the agent <i>continues</i> to <i>perform</i> till it is <i>finished</i>, and is used by the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:12">Philippians 2:12</span>, to denote the <i>continued employment</i> of God's saints in his service to the end of their lives. WORK OUT <i>your own salvation</i> the word here denotes an employment of a <i>different</i> kind; and therefore the man who now feels the galling dominion of sin says, What I am <i>continually labouring</i> at <i>I allow not</i>, ου γινωσκω, <i>I do not</i> <i>acknowledge</i> to be right, just, holy, or profitable.</p>
<p><i><b>But what I hate, that do I.</b></i> — I am a <i>slave</i>, and under the absolute control of my tyrannical master: I hate his service, but am <i>obliged</i> to work his will. Who, without blaspheming, can assert that the apostle is speaking this of a man in whom the <i>Spirit of</i> <i>the Lord dwells</i>? From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span> to this one the apostle, says Dr. Taylor, denotes the <i>Jew in the flesh</i> by a single <i>I</i>; here, he divides that <i>I</i> into two <i>I's</i>, or figurative persons; representing two different and opposite principles which were in him. The one <i>I</i>, or principle, assents to the law that it is good, and wills and chooses what the other does not practise, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:16">Romans 7:16</span>. This principle he expressly tells us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22">Romans 7:22</span>, is the <i>inward man; the law of the mind</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>; the <i>mind</i>, or rational faculty, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>; for he could find no other <i>inward man</i>, or <i>law of the mind</i>, but the rational faculty, in a person who was <i>carnal</i> and <i>sold under sin</i>. The other <i>I</i>, or principle, transgresses the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>, and does those things which the former principle <i>allows not</i>. This principle he expressly tells us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>, is the <i>flesh</i>, the <i>law in the members</i>, or <i>sensual appetite</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>; and he concludes in the last verse, that these two principles were opposite to each other; therefore it is evident that those two principles, residing and counteracting each other in the same person; are <i>reason</i> and <i>lust</i>, or <i>sin that dwells in us.</i> And it is very easy to distinguish these two <i>I's</i>, or principles, in every part of this elegant description of iniquity, domineering over the light and remonstrances of reason. For instance, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:17">Romans 7:17</span>: <i>Now then, it is no more I that do it, but</i> SIN <i>that dwelleth in me</i>. The <i>I</i> he speaks of here is opposed to indwelling or governing sin; and therefore plainly denotes the principle of reason, <i>the inward</i> <i>man</i>, or <i>law of the mind</i>; in which, I add, a measure of the light of the Spirit of God shines, in order to show the sinfulness of sin. These two different principles he calls, one <i>flesh</i>, and the other <i>spirit</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>; where he speaks of their contrariety in the same manner that he does here.</p>
<p>And we may give a probable reason why the apostle dwells so long upon the struggle and opposition between these two principles; it appears intended to answer a tacit but very obvious objection. The Jew might allege: "But the law is holy and spiritual; and I assent to it as good, as a right rule of action, which ought to be observed; yea, I esteem it highly, I <i>glory</i> and <i>rest</i> in it, convinced of its truth and excellency. And is not this enough to constitute the law a sufficient principle of sanctification?" The apostle answers, "No; <i>wickedness</i> is consistent with a <i>sense</i> of <i>truth</i>. A man may assent to the best rule of action, and yet still be under the dominion of lust and sin; from which nothing can deliver him but a principle and power proceeding from the <i>fountain of life</i>."</p>
<p>The sentiment in this verse may be illustrated by quotations from the ancient heathens; many of whom felt themselves in precisely the same state, (and expressed it in nearly the same language,) which some most monstrously tell us was the state of this heavenly apostle, when vindicating the claims of the Gospel against those of the Jewish ritual! Thus OVID describes the conduct of a depraved man:- </p>
<p>The whole spirit of the sentiment is well summed up and expressed by St. <i>Chrysostom</i>: ὁταν τινος επιθυμωμεν, ειτε κωλυωμεθα, αιρεται μαλλον της επιθυμιας ἡ φλοξ. If we lust after any thing which is afterwards prohibited, the flame of this desire burns the more <i>fiercely</i>.</p>
