<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Now then it is no more I</b></i> â€” It is not that <i>I</i> which constitutes <i>reason</i> and <i>conscience, but sin</i>-corrupt and sensual inclinations, <i>that dwelleth in me</i>-that has the entire domination over my reason, darkening my understanding, and perverting my judgment; for which there is <i>condemnation</i> in the law, but no <i>cure</i>. So we find here that there is a principle in the unregenerate man stronger than <i>reason</i> itself; a principle which is, properly speaking, not of the <i>essence of the soul</i>, but acts <i>in</i> it, as its <i>lord</i>, or as a <i>tyrant</i>. This is <i>inbred</i> and <i>indwelling sin</i>-the <i>seed of the serpent</i>; by which the whole soul is darkened, confused, perverted, and excited to rebellion against God.</p>
