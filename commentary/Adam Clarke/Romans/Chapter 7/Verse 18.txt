<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For I know that in me</b></i>, c.] I have learned by experience that in an unregenerate man there is <i>no good</i>. There is no principle by which the soul can be brought into the light no principle by which it can be <i>restored</i> to purity: fleshly appetites alone prevail; and the <i>brute</i> runs away with the <i>man</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>For to will is present with me</b></i> â€” Though the whole soul has suffered indescribably by the FALL, yet there are some faculties that appear to have suffered less than others; or rather have received larger measures of the supernatural light, because their concurrence with the Divine principle is so necessary to the salvation of the soul. Even the most unconcerned about spiritual things have <i>understanding, judgment, reason</i>, and <i>will</i>. And by means of these we have seen even scoffers at Divine revelation become very eminent in arts and sciences; some of our best metaphysicians, physicians, mathematicians, astronomers, chemists, c., have been known-to their reproach be it spoken and published-to be <i>without religion</i> nay, some of them have blasphemed it, by leaving God out of his own work, and ascribing to an idol of their own, whom they call <i>nature</i>, the operations of the wisdom, power, and goodness of the Most High. It is true that many of the most eminent in all the above branches of knowledge have been conscientious believers in Divine revelation; but the case of the others proves that, <i>fallen</i> as man is, he yet possesses extra-ordinary powers, which are capable of very high cultivation and improvement. In short, the soul seems capable of <i>any thing</i> but <i>knowing, fearing, loving</i>, and <i>serving God</i>. And it is not only incapable, <i>of itself</i>, for any truly religious acts; but what shows its fall in the most indisputable manner is its <i>enmity</i> to sacred things. Let an unregenerate man <i>pretend</i> what he pleases, his conscience knows that he <i>hates religion</i>; his <i>soul revolts against</i> <i>it</i>; his <i>carnal mind is not subject to the law of God, neither</i> <i>indeed can it be</i>. There is no reducing this fell principle to subjection; it is SIN, and <i>sin</i> is <i>rebellion</i> against God; therefore sin must be <i>destroyed</i>, not <i>subjected</i>; if <i>subjected</i>, it would <i>cease to be sin</i>, because <i>sin</i> is in <i>opposition</i> to God: hence the apostle says, most conclusively, <i>it cannot be subjected</i>, i.e. it must be <i>destroyed</i>, or it will destroy the soul for ever. When the apostle says, <i>to will is present with me</i>, he shows that the <i>will</i> is on the side of God and truth, so far that it consents to the <i>propriety</i> and <i>necessity</i> of obedience. There has been a strange clamour raised up against this faculty of the soul, as if the very essence of evil dwelt in it; whereas the apostle shows, throughout this chapter, that the <i>will</i> was regularly on God's side, while every other faculty appears to have been in <i>hostility</i> to him. The truth is, men have confounded the <i>will</i> with the <i>passions</i>, and laid to the charge of the <i>former</i> what properly belongs to the <i>latter</i>. The <i>will</i> is <i>right</i>, but the <i>passions</i> are <i>wrong</i>. It <i>discerns</i> and <i>approves</i>, but is without <i>ability</i> to <i>perform</i>: it has no power over sensual appetites; in these the principle of <i>rebellion</i> dwells: it <i>nills</i> evil, it <i>wills</i> good, but can only <i>command</i> through the power of Divine grace: but this the person in question, the unregenerate man, has not received.</p>
