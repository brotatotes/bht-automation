<p>Verse 19. <i><b>For the good that I would I do not</b></i> — Here again is the most decisive proof that the <i>will</i> is on the side of God and truth.</p>
<p><i><b>But the evil which I would not</b></i> — And here is equally decisive proof that the will is against, or opposed to evil. There is not a man in ten millions, who will carefully watch the operations of this faculty, that will find it opposed to good and obstinately attached to evil, as is generally supposed. Nay, it is found almost uniformly on God's side, while the whole sensual system is against him.-It is not the WILL that leads men astray; but the corrupt PASSIONS which oppose and oppress the <i>will</i>. It is truly astonishing into what endless mistakes men have fallen on this point, and what <i>systems of divinity</i> have been built on these mistakes. The <i>will</i>, this almost only <i>friend</i> to God in the human soul, has been slandered as God's <i>worst enemy</i>, and even by those who had the <i>seventh</i> chapter to the Romans before their eyes! Nay, it has been considered so fell a foe to God and goodness that it is bound in the adamantine chains of a dire necessity to do <i>evil</i> <i>only</i>; and the doctrine of <i>will</i> (absurdly called <i>free will</i>, as if <i>will</i> did not essentially imply what is <i>free</i>) has been considered one of the most destructive heresies. Let such persons put themselves to school to their <i>Bibles</i> and to <i>common sense</i>.</p>
<p>The plain state of the case is this: the soul is so completely fallen, that it has no <i>power</i> to <i>do good</i> till it receive that power from on high. But it has power to <i>see</i> good, to <i>distinguish</i> between <i>that</i> and <i>evil</i>; to <i>acknowledge</i> the excellence of this good, and to <i>will</i> it, from a conviction of that excellence; but <i>farther</i> it cannot go. Yet, in various cases, it is solicited and <i>consents</i> to sin; and because it is <i>will</i>, that is, because it is a <i>free principle</i>, it must necessarily possess this power; and although it can do no good unless it receive grace from God, yet it is impossible to <i>force</i> it to sin. Even Satan himself cannot do this; and before he can get it to <i>sin</i>, he must gain its <i>consent</i>. Thus God in his endless mercy has endued this faculty with a power in which, humanly speaking, resides the <i>salvability</i> of the soul; and without this the soul must have eternally continued <i>under the</i> <i>power of sin</i>, or been saved as an inert, absolutely passive machine; which supposition would go as nearly to prove that it was as incapable of vice as it were of virtue.</p>
<p>"But does not this arguing destroy the doctrine of free grace?" No! it establishes that doctrine.</p>
<p>1. It is through the grace, the unmerited kindness, of God, that the soul has such a faculty, and that it has not been extinguished by sin.</p>
<p>2. This will, though a <i>free principle</i>, as it respects its <i>nilling</i> of <i>evil</i> and <i>choosing</i> good, yet, properly speaking, has <i>no power</i> by which it can <i>subjugate</i> the <i>evil</i> or <i>perform</i> the <i>good</i>.</p>
<p>We know that the <i>eye</i> has a power to discern objects, but without <i>light</i> this power is perfectly useless, and no object can be discerned by it. So, of the person represented here by the apostle, it is said, <i>To will</i> <i>is present with me</i>, το γαρ θελειν παρακειται μοι. <i>To will is ever</i> <i>in readiness</i>, it is <i>ever at hand, it lies constantly before me;</i> <i>but how to perform that which is good, I find not</i>; that is, the man is unregenerate, and he is seeking justification and holiness from the <i>law</i>. The law was never designed to give these-it gives the <i>knowledge</i>, not the <i>cure of sin</i>; therefore, though he <i>nills</i> <i>evil</i> and <i>wills good</i>, yet he can neither <i>conquer</i> the <i>one</i> nor <i>perform</i> the <i>other</i> till he receives the grace of Christ, till he seeks and finds redemption in his blood. Here, then, the <i>free</i> <i>agency</i> of <i>man</i> is <i>preserved</i>, without which he could not be in a <i>salvable state</i>; and the <i>honour</i> of the <i>grace of Christ</i> is maintained, without which there can be no actual salvation. There is a good sentiment on this subject in the following words of an eminent poet:- </p>
