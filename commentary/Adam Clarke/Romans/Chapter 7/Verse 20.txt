<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:20">Romans 7:20</span>. <i><b>It is no more I</b></i> â€” My <i>will</i> is against it; my <i>reason</i> and <i>conscience</i> condemn it. <i>But sin that dwelleth in me</i>-the <i>principle of sin</i>, which has possessed itself of all my <i>carnal</i> <i>appetites</i> and <i>passions</i>, and thus subjects my reason and domineers over my soul. Thus I am in perpetual contradiction to myself. Two principles are continually contending in me for the mastery: my <i>reason</i>, on which the light of God shines, to show what is evil; and my <i>passions</i>, in which the <i>principle of sin</i> works, to bring forth fruit unto death.</p>
<p>This strange self-contradictory propensity led some of the ancient philosophers to imagine that man has <i>two souls</i>, a <i>good</i> and a <i>bad</i> one; and it is on this principle that <i>Xenophon</i>, in his <i>life</i> <i>of Cyrus</i>, causes <i>Araspes</i>, a Persian nobleman, to account for some misconduct of his relative to <i>Panthea</i>, a beautiful female captive, whom <i>Cyrus</i> had entrusted to his care:-"O Cyrus, I am convinced that I have <i>two souls</i>; if I had but <i>one soul</i>, it could not at the same time pant after <i>vice</i> and <i>virtue; wish</i> and <i>abhor</i> the <i>same</i> <i>thing</i>. It is certain, therefore, that we have <i>two</i> souls; when the <i>good soul</i> rules, I undertake noble and virtuous actions; but when the <i>bad soul</i> predominates, I am constrained to do evil. All I can say at present is that I find my <i>good</i> soul, encouraged by thy presence, has got the better of my <i>bad</i> soul." See Spectator, vol. viii. No. 564. Thus, not only the <i>ancients</i>, but also many <i>moderns</i>, have trifled, and all will continue to do so who do not acknowledge the Scriptural account of the <i>fall of man</i>, and the lively comment upon that doctrine contained in the <i>seventh chapter</i> <i>of the Epistle to the Romans</i>.</p>
