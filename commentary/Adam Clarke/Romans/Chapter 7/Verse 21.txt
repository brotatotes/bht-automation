<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:21">Romans 7:21</span>. <i><b>I find then a law</b></i> — I am in such a condition and state of soul, under the power of such habits and sinful propensities, <i>that when I would do good</i>-when my <i>will</i> and <i>reason</i> are strongly bent on obedience to the law of God and opposition to the principle of sin, <i>evil is present with me</i>, κακον παρακειται, <i>evil is at hand, it lies constantly before me</i>. That, as the <i>will</i> to do good is <i>constantly at hand</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>, so the principle of <i>rebellion</i> exciting me to sin is <i>equally present</i>; but, as the one is only <i>will, wish</i>, and <i>desire</i>, without <i>power</i> to <i>do</i> what is <i>willed</i>, to <i>obtain</i> what is <i>wished</i>, or to <i>perform</i> what is <i>desired</i>, sin continually prevails.</p>
<p>The word νομος, <i>law</i>, in this verse, must be taken as implying any <i>strong</i> or <i>confirmed habit</i>, συνηθεια, as <i>Hesychius</i> renders it, under the influence of which the man <i>generally acts</i>; and in this sense the apostle most evidently uses it in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>.</p>
