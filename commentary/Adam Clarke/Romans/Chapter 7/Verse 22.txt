<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22">Romans 7:22</span>. <i><b>I delight in the law of God after the inward man</b></i> — Every <i>Jew</i>, and every <i>unregenerate man</i>, who receives the Old Testament as a revelation from God, must acknowledge the great purity, excellence and utility of its <i>maxims</i>, c., though he will ever find that without the <i>grace of our Lord Jesus</i> he can never <i>act</i> according to those heavenly maxims and without the <i>mercy</i> of God, can never be redeemed from the <i>curse</i> entailed upon him for his past transgressions. To say that the <i>inward man</i> means the <i>regenerate part</i> of the soul, is supportable by no argument. Ὁ εσω ανθρωπος, and ὁ εντος ανθρωπος, especially the <i>latter</i>, are expressions frequently in use among the purest Greek ethic writers, to signify the <i>soul</i> or <i>rational</i> part of man, in opposition to the <i>body</i> of <i>flesh</i>. See the quotations in Wetstein from <i>Plato</i> and <i>Plotinus</i>. The Jews have the same form of expression; so in <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 10, 3, it is said: <i>The flesh</i> <i>is the inward garment of the man; but the</i> SPIRIT <i>is the</i> INWARD <i>man, the garment of which is the body</i>; and St. Paul uses the phrase in precisely the <i>same sense</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>. If it be said that it is impossible for an unregenerate man <i>to</i> <i>delight in the law of God</i>, the experience of millions contradicts the assertion. Every true <i>penitent</i> admires the moral law, longs most earnestly for a conformity to it, and feels that he can never be satisfied till he awakes up after this Divine likeness; and he hates himself, because he feels that he has <i>broken</i> it, and that his evil passions are still in a state of <i>hostility</i> to it.

<p>The following observations of a pious and sensible writer on this subject cannot be unacceptable: "The <i>inward man</i> always signifies the <i>mind</i>; which either may, or may not, be the subject of grace. That which is asserted of either the <i>inward</i> or <i>outward</i> <i>man</i> is often performed by <i>one member</i> or <i>power</i>, and not with the <i>whole</i>. If any member of the body perform an <i>action</i>, we are said to do it with the <i>body</i>, although the other members be not employed. In like manner, if any <i>power</i> or <i>faculty</i> of the mind be employed about any action, the <i>soul</i> is said to act. This expression, therefore, <i>I delight in the law of God after the</i> <i>inward man</i>, can mean no more than this, that there are some <i>inward</i> <i>faculties</i> in the soul which delight in the law of God. This expression is particularly adapted to the principles of the <i>Pharisees</i>, of whom St. Paul was one before his conversion. They received the law as the oracles of God, and confessed that it deserved the most serious regard. Their veneration was inspired by a sense of its original, and a full conviction that it was true. To some parts of it they paid the most superstitious regard. They had it written upon their <i>phylacteries</i>, which they carried about with them at all times. It was often read and expounded in their synagogues: and they took delight in studying its precepts. On that account, both the prophets and our Lord agree in saying that <i>they delighted in the law of God</i>, though they regarded not its chief and most essential precepts." See farther observations on this point at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>So far, then, is it from being true that <i>none but a</i> REGENERATE <i>man can delight in the law of God</i>, we find that even a <i>proud,</i> <i>unhumbled</i> PHARISEE can do it; and much more a <i>poor sinner</i>, who is humbled under a sense of his sin, and sees, in the light of God, not only the <i>spirituality</i>, but the <i>excellence</i> of the Divine law.</p>
