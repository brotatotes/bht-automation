<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>. <i><b>But I see another law in my members</b></i> — Though the person in question is less or more under the continual influence of <i>reason</i> and <i>conscience</i>, which offer constant testimony against sin, yet as long as help is sought only from the <i>law</i>, and the grace of Christ in the Gospel is not received, the remonstrances of reason and conscience are rendered of no effect by the prevalence of sinful passions; which, from repeated gratifications, have acquired all the force of <i>habit</i>, and now <i>give</i> <i>law</i> to the whole carnal man.</p>
<p><i><b>Warring against the law of my mind</b></i> — There is an allusion here to the case of a <i>city besieged</i>, at last <i>taken by storm</i>, and the inhabitants carried away into captivity; αντιστρατευομενον, carrying on a <i>system of warfare</i>; laying <i>continual siege</i> to the soul; <i>repeating incessantly</i> its <i>attacks; harassing, battering</i>, and <i>storming</i> the spirit; and, by all these <i>assaults</i>, reducing the man to <i>extreme misery</i>. Never was a picture more impressively drawn and more effectually finished; for the next sentence shows that this spiritual city was at last taken by storm, and the inhabitants who survived the sackage led into the most shameful, painful, and oppressive captivity.</p>
<p><i><b>Bringing me into captivity to the law of sin</b></i> — He does not here speak of an <i>occasional advantage</i> gained by sin, it was a <i>complete</i> and final victory gained by corruption; which, having stormed and reduced the city, carried away the inhabitants with irresistible force, into captivity. This is the consequence of being overcome; he was now in the hands of the foe as the victor's lawful captive; and this is the import of the original word, αιχμαλωτιζοντα, and is the very term used by our Lord when speaking of the final ruin, dispersion, and captivity of the Jews. He says, αιχμαλωτισθησονται, <i>they shall be led away captives</i> into all the nations, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:24">Luke 21:24</span>. When all this is considered, who, in his right mind, can apply it to the holy soul of the apostle of the Gentiles? Is there any thing in it that can belong to his <i>gracious</i> state? Surely nothing. The <i>basest slave of sin</i>, who has any remaining checks of conscience, cannot be brought into a <i>worse</i> state than that described here by the apostle. Sin and corruption have a <i>final</i> <i>triumph</i>; and <i>conscience</i> and <i>reason</i> are taken <i>prisoners, laid</i> <i>in fetters</i>, and <i>sold for slaves</i>. Can this ever be said of a man in whom the Spirit of God dwells, and whom <i>the law of the Spirit</i> <i>of life in Christ Jesus has made free from the law of sin and</i> <i>death</i>?
