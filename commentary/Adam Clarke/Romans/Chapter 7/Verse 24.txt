<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>. <i><b>O wretched man that I am</b></i>, c.] This affecting account is finished more impressively by the <i>groans</i> of the <i>wounded</i> captive. Having long maintained a useless conflict against innumerable hosts and irresistible might, he is at last <i>wounded</i> and taken prisoner and to render his state more miserable, is not only encompassed by the slaughtered, but <i>chained to a dead body</i>; for there seems to be here an allusion to an ancient custom of certain tyrants, who bound a <i>dead body</i> to a <i>living man</i>, and obliged him to carry it about, till the contagion from the putrid mass took away his life! <i>Virgil</i> paints this in all its horrors, in the account he gives of the tyrant Mezentius. <i>AEneid</i>, lib. viii. ver. 485. </p>
<p>We may naturally suppose that the cry of such a person would be, <i>Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this dead</i> <i>body</i>? And how well does this apply to the case of the person to whom the apostle refers! A <i>body</i>-a whole <i>mass of sin</i> and <i>corruption</i>, was <i>bound to his soul</i> with <i>chains</i> which he could not break and the mortal <i>contagion</i>, transfused through his whole nature, was pressing him down to the bitter pains of an eternal death. He now finds that the <i>law</i> can afford him no deliverance; and he despairs of help from any <i>human being</i>; but while he is emitting his <i>last</i>, or <i>almost expiring groan</i>, the <i>redemption</i> by Christ Jesus is proclaimed to him; and, if the apostle refers to his <i>own case</i>, Ananias unexpectedly accosts him with-<i>Brother Saul!</i> <i>the Lord Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way, hath sent me</i> <i>unto thee, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled</i> <i>with the Holy Ghost</i>. He sees then an open door of hope, and he immediately, though but in the <i>prospect</i> of this deliverance, returns God thanks for the well-grounded <i>hope</i> which he has of salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
