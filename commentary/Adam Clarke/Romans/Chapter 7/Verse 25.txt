<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>. <i><b>I thank God through Jesus Christ</b></i> — Instead of ευχαριστω τῳ Θεῳ, <i>I thank God</i>, several excellent MSS., with the <i>Vulgate</i>, some copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and several of the <i>fathers</i>, read ἡ χαρις του Θεου, or του Κυριου, <i>the grace of God</i>, or <i>the</i> <i>grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>; this is an <i>answer</i> to the almost despairing question in the preceding verse. The whole, therefore, may be read thus: <i>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me</i> <i>from the body of this death</i>? ANSWER-<i>The grace of God through our</i> <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>. Thus we find that a case of the kind described by the apostle in the preceding verses, whether it were <i>his own</i>, before he was brought to the knowledge of Christ, particularly during the three days that he was at Damascus, without being able to eat or drink, in deep penitential sorrow; or whether he personates a <i>pharisaic</i> yet <i>conscientious Jew</i>, deeply concerned for his salvation: I say, we find that such a case can be relieved by the Gospel of Christ only; or, in other words, that no scheme of redemption can be effectual to the salvation of any soul, whether <i>Jew</i> or <i>Gentile</i>, but that laid down in the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>Let any or all means be used which human wisdom can devise, <i>guilt</i> will still continue <i>uncancelled</i>; and <i>inbred sin</i> will laugh them all to scorn, prevail over them, and finally triumph. And this is the very conclusion to which the apostle brings his argument in the following clause; which, like the rest of the chapter, has been most awfully abused, to favour <i>anti-evangelical</i> purposes.</p>
<p><i><b>So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God</b></i> — That this clause contains the <i>inference</i> from the preceding train of argumentation appears evident, from the αρα ουν, <i>therefore</i>, with which the apostle introduces it. As if he had said: "To conclude, the sum of what I have advanced, concerning the <i>power of sin</i> in the <i>carnal man</i>, and the utter <i>insufficiency</i> of all <i>human means</i> and <i>legal observances</i> to pardon sin and expel the corruption of the heart, is this: that the very same person, the αυτος εγω, <i>the</i> <i>same I</i>, while without the Gospel, under the killing power of the law, will find in himself <i>two opposite principles</i>, the one subscribing to and approving the law of God; and the other, notwithstanding, bringing him <i>into captivity</i> to sin: his <i>inward</i> <i>man</i>-his <i>rational powers</i> and <i>conscience</i>, will assent to the <i>justice</i> and <i>propriety</i> of the requisitions of the law; and yet, notwithstanding this, his <i>fleshly appetites</i>-the <i>law in his</i> <i>members</i>, will <i>war against the law of his mind</i>, and continue, till he receives the Gospel of Christ, to keep him in the galling captivity of sin and death."</p>
<p>1. THE strong expressions in this clause have led many to conclude that the <i>apostle</i> himself, in his <i>regenerated state</i>, is indisputably <i>the person</i> intended. That all that is said in this chapter of the <i>carnal man, sold under sin</i>, did apply to <i>Saul of</i> <i>Tarsus</i>, no man can doubt: that what is here said can ever be with propriety applied to <i>Paul the Apostle</i>, who can believe? Of the former, all is natural; of the latter, all here said would be monstrous and absurd, if not blasphemous.</p>
<p>2. But it is supposed that the words must be understood as implying a <i>regenerate man</i>, because the apostle says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22">Romans 7:22</span>, <i>I delight in the law of God</i>; and in this verse, <i>I myself with</i> <i>the mind serve the law of God</i>. These things, say the objectors, cannot be spoken of a wicked Jew, but of a <i>regenerate</i> man such as the apostle then was. But when we find that the former verse speaks of a man who is <i>brought into captivity to the law of sin</i> <i>and death</i>, surely there is no part of the regenerate state of the apostle to which the words can possibly apply. Had he been in captivity to the law of sin and death, <i>after</i> his conversion to Christianity, what did he gain by that conversion? <i>Nothing</i> for his personal holiness. He had found no salvation under an inefficient law; and he was left in thraldom under an equally inefficient Gospel. The very genius of Christianity demonstrates that nothing like this can, with any propriety, be spoken of a <i>genuine Christian</i>.</p>
<p>3. But it is farther supposed that these things cannot be spoken of a proud or wicked Jew; yet we learn the contrary from the infallible testimony of the word of God. Of this people in their <i>fallen</i> and iniquitous state, God says, by his prophet, <i>They</i> SEEK <i>me</i> DAILY, <i>and</i> DELIGHT <i>to know my ways, as a nation that did</i> RIGHTEOUSNESS, <i>and</i> FORSOOK <i>not the</i> ORDINANCES <i>of their God: they</i> <i>ask of me the ordinances of</i> JUSTICE, <i>and</i> TAKE DELIGHT <i>in</i> <i>approaching to God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:2">Isaiah 58:2</span>. Can any thing be <i>stronger</i> than this? And yet, at that time, they were <i>most dreadfully carnal</i>, and <i>sold under sin</i>, as the rest of that chapter proves. It is a most notorious fact, that how little soever the life of a Jew was conformed to the law of his God, he notwithstanding professed the highest <i>esteem</i> for it, and <i>gloried</i> in it: and the apostle says nothing stronger of them in this chapter than their <i>conduct</i> and <i>profession</i> verify to the <i>present</i> <i>day</i>. They are still <i>delighting in the law of God</i>, after the <i>inward man; with their mind serving the law of God; asking for the</i> <i>ordinances of justice, seeking God daily</i>, and <i>taking delight in</i> <i>approaching to God</i>; they even <i>glory</i>, and greatly <i>exult</i> and <i>glory</i>, in the Divine <i>original</i> and <i>excellency</i> of their LAW; and all this while they are most abominably <i>carnal, sold under sin</i>, and <i>brought into the most degrading captivity to the law of sin and</i> <i>death</i>. If then all that the apostle states of the person in question be true of the <i>Jews</i>, through the whole period of their history, even to the <i>present time</i>; if they do in all their <i>professions</i> and their <i>religious services</i>, which they zealously maintain, confess, and conscientiously too, that the <i>law is holy</i>, and the <i>commandment holy, just</i>, and <i>good</i>; and yet, with their <i>flesh, serve the law of sin</i>; the same certainly may be said with equal propriety of a <i>Jewish penitent</i>, deeply convinced of his lost estate, and the total insufficiency of his legal observances to deliver him from his <i>body of sin and death</i>. And consequently, all this may be said of <i>Paul the</i> JEW, while <i>going about to establish</i> <i>his own righteousness</i>-his own plan of justification; he had not as yet <i>submitted to the righteousness of God</i>-the Divine plan of redemption by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>4. It must be allowed that, whatever was the <i>experience</i> of so eminent a man, Christian, and apostle, as St. Paul, it must be a very proper <i>standard of Christianity</i>. And if we are to take what is here said as <i>his experience</i> as a <i>Christian</i>, it would be presumption in <i>us</i> to expect to go higher; for he certainly had pushed the principles of his religion to their utmost consequences. But his whole life, and the account which he immediately gives of himself in the succeeding chapter, prove that he, as a <i>Christian</i> and an <i>apostle</i>, had a <i>widely different</i> <i>experience</i>; an experience which amply justifies that <i>superiority</i> which he attributes to the <i>Christian</i> religion over the <i>Jewish</i>; and demonstrates that it not only is well calculated to <i>perfect</i> all preceding dispensations, but that it affords <i>salvation to the</i> <i>uttermost</i> to all those who flee for refuge to the hope that it sets before them. Besides, there is nothing spoken here of the state of a <i>conscientious Jew</i>, or of St. <i>Paul</i> in his <i>Jewish state</i>, that is not true of every genuine <i>penitent</i>; even <i>before</i>, and it may be, <i>long before</i>, he has believed in Christ to the saving of his soul. The assertion that "every Christian, howsoever advanced in the Divine life, will and must feel all this inward conflict," c., is as <i>untrue</i> as it is <i>dangerous</i>. That many, called <i>Christians</i>, and probably <i>sincere</i>, do feel all this, may be readily granted and such we must consider to be in the same state with <i>Saul of Tarsus</i>, previously to his conversion; but that they must <i>continue</i> thus is no where intimated in the Gospel of Christ. We must take heed how we make <i>our experience</i>, which is the result of our <i>unbelief</i> and <i>unfaithfulness</i>, the <i>standard</i> for the people of God, and lower down <i>Christianity</i> to our most reprehensible and <i>dwarfish</i> state: at the same time, we should not be <i>discouraged</i> at what we thus feel, but apply to God, through Christ, as Paul did; and then we shall soon be able, with him, to declare, to the eternal glory of <i>God's grace</i>, that <i>the law of the Spirit of life,</i> <i>in Christ Jesus, has made us free from the law of sin and death</i>. This is the inheritance of God's children; and their salvation is of me, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude these observations without recommending to the notice of my readers a learned and excellent discourse on the latter part of this chapter, preached by the Rev. <i>James Smith</i>, minister of the Gospel in <i>Dumfermline</i>, Scotland; a work to which I am indebted for some useful observations, and from which I should have been glad to have copied much, had my limits permitted. Reader, do not plead for Baal; try, fully try, the efficiency of the blood of the covenant; and be not content with less salvation than God has provided for thee. Thou art not straitened in God, be not straitened in thy own bowels.</p>
