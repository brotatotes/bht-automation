<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:3">Romans 7:3</span>. <i><b>So then, if, while</b></i><b> her </b><i><b>husband liveth</b></i> — The object of the apostle's similitude is to show that each party is equally bound to the other; but that the death of either dissolves the engagement.</p>
<p><i><b>So - she is no adulteress, though she be married to another</b></i> — And do not imagine that this change would argue any disloyalty in you to your Maker; for, as he has determined that this law of ordinances shall cease, you are no more bound to it than a woman is to a deceased husband, and are as free to receive the Gospel of Christ as a woman in such circumstances would be to remarry.</p>
