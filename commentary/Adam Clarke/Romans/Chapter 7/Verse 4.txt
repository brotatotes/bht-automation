<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>. <i><b>Wherefore, my brethren</b></i> — This is a parallel case. You were once under the law of Moses, and were bound by its injunctions; but now ye are become dead to that law - a modest, inoffensive mode of speech, for, <i>The law, which was once your</i> <i>husband, is dead</i>; God has determined that it shall be no longer in force; so that now, as a woman whose husband is dead is freed from the law of that husband, or from her conjugal vow, and may legally be married to another, so God, who gave the law under which ye have hitherto lived, designed that it should be in force only till the advent of the Messiah; that advent <i>has</i> taken place, the <i>law</i> has consequently ceased, and now ye are called to take on you the yoke of the <i>Gospel</i>, and lay down the yoke of the law; and it is the design of God that you should do so.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye should be married to another - who is raised from the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>dead</b></i> — As <i>Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to</i> <i>every one that believeth</i>, the object of God in giving the law was to unite you to Christ; and, as he has died, he has not only abolished that law which condemns every transgressor to <i>death</i>, without any hope of a <i>revival</i>, but he has also made that atonement for sin, by his own death, which is represented in the sacrifices prescribed by the law. And as Jesus Christ is <i>risen again from</i> <i>the dead</i>, he has thereby given the fullest proof that by his death he has procured the resurrection of mankind, and made that atonement required by the law. <i>That we should bring forth fruit</i> <i>unto God</i> - we, Jews, who believe in Christ, have, in consequence of our <i>union</i> with him, received the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit; so that we bring forth that fruit of holiness unto God which, without this union, it would be impossible for us to produce. Here is a delicate allusion to the case of a promising and numerous progeny from a legitimate and happy marriage.</p>
