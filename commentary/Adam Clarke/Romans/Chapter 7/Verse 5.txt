<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>. <i><b>For, when we were in the flesh</b></i> — When we were without the Gospel, in our carnal and unregenerated state, though believing in the law of Moses, and performing the <i>rites</i> and <i>offices</i> of our religion.</p>
<p><i><b>The motions of sins, which were by the law</b></i> — τα παθηματα των αμαρτιων, the <i>passions of sins</i>, the <i>evil propensities to sins</i>; to every particular sin there is a <i>propensity</i>: one propensity does not excite to all kinds of sinful acts; hence the apostle uses the <i>plural</i> number, <i>the</i> PASSIONS or <i>propensities of</i> SINS; sins being not more various than their <i>propensities</i> in the unregenerate heart, which excite to them. These παθηματα, <i>propensities</i>, constitute the <i>fallen nature</i>; they are the disease of the heart, the pollution and corruption of the soul.</p>
<p><i><b>Did work in our members</b></i> — The evil propensity acts εντοις μελεσιν, in the whole nervous and muscular system, applying that stimulus to every part which is necessary to excite them to action.</p>
<p><i><b>To bring forth fruit unto death.</b></i> — To produce those acts of transgression which subject the sinner to death, temporal and eternal. When the apostle says, <i>the motion of sin which were by</i> <i>the law</i>, he points out a most striking and invariable characteristic of sin, viz. its <i>rebellious nature</i>; it ever acts <i>against law</i>, and the most powerfully against <i>known</i> law. <i>Because</i> the law requires obedience, <i>therefore</i> it <i>will</i> transgress. The law is equally against <i>evil passions</i> and <i>evil actions</i>, and both these exert themselves against it. So, these motions which were by the law, became roused into the most powerful activity by the prohibitions of the law. They were comparatively dormant till the law said, <i>thou shalt</i> NOT <i>do this, thou shalt</i> DO <i>that</i>; then the <i>rebellious</i> principle in the evil <i>propensity</i> became roused, and <i>acts</i> of <i>transgression</i> and <i>omissions</i> of <i>duty</i> were the immediate consequences.</p>
