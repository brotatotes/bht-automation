<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span>. <i><b>But now we are delivered from the law</b></i> — We, who have believed in Christ Jesus, are delivered from that yoke by which we were bound, which sentenced every transgressor to <i>perdition</i>, but provided no <i>pardon</i> even for the <i>penitent</i>, and no <i>sanctification</i> for those who are weary of their inbred corruptions.</p>
<p><i><b>That being dead wherein we were held</b></i> — To us believers in Christ this commandment is abrogated; we are transferred to another constitution; that law which kills ceases to bind us; it is dead to us who have believed in Christ Jesus, who is the end of the law for justification and salvation to every one that believes.</p>
<p><i><b>That we should serve in newness of spirit</b></i> — We are now brought under a more spiritual dispensation; now we know the <i>spiritual</i> <i>import</i> of all the Mosaic precepts. We see that the law referred to the Gospel, and can only be fulfilled by the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>The oldness of the letter.</b></i> — The merely literal rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices are now done away; and the <i>newness of</i> <i>the spirit</i>, the true intent and meaning of all are now fully disclosed; so that we are got from an imperfect state into a state of perfection and excellence. We sought justification and sanctification, pardon and holiness, by the law, and have found that the law could not give them: we have sought these in the Gospel scheme, and we have found them. We serve God now, not according to the old literal sense, but in the true spiritual meaning.</p>
