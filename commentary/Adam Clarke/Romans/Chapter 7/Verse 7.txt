<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>. <i><b>Is the law sin?</b></i> — The apostle had said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span>: <i>The motions of sins, which were by the law, did bring forth fruit</i> <i>unto death</i>; and now he anticipates an objection, "Is therefore the law sin?" To which he answers, as usual, μηγεςοιτο, <i>by no</i> <i>means</i>. Law is only the means of <i>disclosing</i>; this sinful propensity, not of <i>producing</i> it; as a bright beam of the sun introduced into a room shows; millions of motes which appear to be dancing in it in all directions; but these were not introduced by the light: they were there before, only there was not light enough to make them manifest; so the evil propensity was there before, but there was not light sufficient to discover it.</p>
<p><i><b>I had not known sin, but by the law</b></i> — Mr. Locke and Dr. Taylor have properly remarked the skill used by St. Paul in dexterously avoiding, as much as possible, the giving offence to the Jews: and this is particularly evident in his use of the word <i>I</i> in this place. In the beginning of the chapter, where he mentions their knowledge of the law, he says YE; in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span> the 4th verse he joins himself with them, and says <i>we</i>; but <i>here</i>, and so to the end of the chapter, where he represents the power of sin and the inability of the law to subdue it, he appears to leave <i>them</i> out, and speaks altogether in the <i>first</i> person, though it is plain he means all those who are under the law. So, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:7">Romans 3:7</span>, he uses the singular pronoun, <i>why am I judged a sinner</i>? when he evidently means the whole body of unbelieving Jews.</p>
<p>There is another circumstance in which his address is peculiarly evident; his demonstrating the insufficiency of the law under colour of vindicating it. He knew that the Jew would take fire at the least reflection on the law, which he held in the highest veneration; and therefore he very naturally introduces him catching at that expression, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>, <i>the motions of sins, which were by the law</i>, or, notwithstanding the law. "What!" says this Jew, "do you vilify the law, by charging it with favouring sin?" By no means, says the apostle; I am very far from charging the law with favouring sin. <i>The law</i> <i>is holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:12">Romans 7:12</span>. Thus he writes in vindication of the law; and yet at the same time shows:</p>
<p>1. That the law requires the most extensive obedience, discovering and condemning sin in all its most secret and remote branches, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>.</p>
<p>2. That it gives sin a deadly force, subjecting every transgression to the <i>penalty of death</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8-14">Romans 7:8-14</span>. And yet,</p>
<p>3. supplies neither help nor hope to the sinner, but leaves him under the power of sin, and the sentence of death, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span>, c. This, says Dr. Taylor, is the most ingenious turn of writing I ever met with. We have another instance of the same sort, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1-7">Romans 13:1-7</span>.</p>
<p>It is not likely that a <i>dark, corrupt</i> human heart can <i>discern</i> the will of God. His <i>law</i> is his <i>will</i>. It <i>recommends</i> what is just, and right, and good and forbids what is improper, unjust, and injurious. If God had not revealed himself by this law, we should have done precisely what many nations of the earth have done, who have not had this revelation-put darkness for light, and sin for acts of holiness. While the human <i>heart</i> is its own <i>measure</i> it will rate its workings according to its own propensities for <i>itself</i> is its highest <i>rule</i>. But when God gives a true insight of his own perfections, to be applied as a <i>rule</i> both of <i>passion</i> and <i>practice</i>, then sin is discovered, and discovered too, to be <i>exceedingly sinful</i>. So strong propensities, because they appear to be inherent in our nature, would have passed for <i>natural</i> and <i>necessary operations</i>; and their <i>sinfulness</i> would not have been discovered, if the law had not said, <i>Thou</i> <i>shalt not covet</i>; and thus determined that the <i>propensity</i> itself, as well as its <i>outward operations</i>, is <i>sinful</i>. The law is the <i>straight edge</i> which determines the quantum of <i>obliquity</i> in the <i>crooked line</i> to which it is applied.</p>
