<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>. <i><b>Sin, taking occasion by the commandment</b></i> — I think the pointing, both in this and in the 11th verse, to be wrong: the comma should be after <i>occasion</i>, and not after <i>commandment. But</i> <i>sin taking occasion, wrought in me by this commandment all manner</i> <i>of concupiscence</i>. There are different opinions concerning the meaning of the word αφορμη, which we here translate <i>occasion</i>. Dr. Waterland translates the clause, <i>Sin, taking</i> ADVANTAGE. Dr. Taylor contends that all commentators have mistaken the meaning of it, and that it should be rendered <i>having received</i> FORCE. For this acceptation of the word I can find no adequate authority except in its etymology-απο, <i>from</i>, and ορμη, <i>impetus</i>. The word appears to signify, in general, whatsoever is necessary for the completion or accomplishment of any particular purpose. Xenophon uses αφορμαιειςτονβιον to signify <i>whatever is</i> <i>necessary for the support of life</i>. There is a personification in the text: sin is, represented as a <i>murderer</i> watching for <i>life</i>, and snatching at every means and embracing every opportunity to carry his fell purpose into effect. The miserable sinner has a murderer, sin, within him; this murderer can only destroy life in <i>certain circumstances</i>; finding that the law condemns the object of his cruelty to death, he takes occasion from this to work in the soul all manner of concupiscence, evil and irregular desires and appetites of every kind, and, by thus increasing the evil, exposes the soul to more condemnation; and thus it is represented as being <i>slain</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:11">Romans 7:11</span>. That is, the <i>law</i>, on the <i>evidence</i> of those <i>sinful dispositions</i>, and their corresponding <i>practices</i>, condemns the sinner to death: so that he is <i>dead in law</i>. Thus the very <i>prohibition</i>, as we have already seen in the preceding verse, becomes the instrument of exciting the evil propensity; for, although a sinner has the general propensity to do what is evil, yet he seems to feel most delight in transgressing <i>known</i> law: <i>stat pro ratione voluntas</i>; "I will do it, because I will."</p>
<p><i><b>For without the law, sin was dead.</b></i> — Where there is no law there is no transgression; for sin is the transgression of the law; and no fault can be imputed unto <i>death</i>, where there is no <i>statute</i> by which such a fault is made a <i>capital offence</i>.</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor thinks that χωριςνομον, <i>without the law</i>, means the <i>time</i> before the giving of the law from Mount Sinai, which took in the space of 430 years, during which time the people were under the Abrahamic covenant of grace; and <i>without the law</i> that was given on Mount Sinai, the sting of death, which is sin, had not power to slay the sinner; for, from the time that Adam sinned, the law was not <i>re-enacted</i> till it was given by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13">Romans 5:13</span>. The Jew was then <i>alive</i>, because he was not under the law subjecting him to death for his transgressions; <i>but when the commandment</i> <i>came</i>, with the penalty of death annexed, <i>sin revived, and the Jew</i> <i>died</i>. Then the sting of death acquired <i>life</i>; and the Jew, upon the first transgression, was <i>dead in law</i>. Thus sin, the sting of death, received <i>force</i> or <i>advantage</i> to destroy by the commandment, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:11">Romans 7:11</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>All manner of concupiscence.</b></i> — It <i>showed</i> what was <i>evil</i> and <i>forbade</i> it; and then the principle of <i>rebellion</i>, which seems essential to the very nature of sins rose up against the prohibition; and he was the more strongly incited to <i>disobey</i> in proportion as <i>obedience</i> was enjoined. Thus the apostle shows that the law had authority to <i>prohibit, condemn</i>, and <i>destroy</i>; but no <i>power</i> to <i>pardon</i> sin, <i>root out enmity</i>, or <i>save the soul</i>.</p>
<p>The word επιθυμια, which we render <i>concupiscence</i>, signifies simply <i>strong desire</i> of any kind; but in the New Testament, it is generally taken to signify <i>irregular</i> and <i>unholy desires</i>. Sin in the mind is the <i>desire</i> to <i>do</i>, or to <i>be</i>, what is <i>contrary</i> to the <i>holiness</i> and <i>authority</i> of GOD.</p>
<p><i><b>For without the law, sin</b></i><b> was </b><i><b>dead.</b></i> — This means, according to Dr. Taylor's hypothesis, the <i>time</i> previous to the giving of the law. See before. But it seems also consistent with the apostle's meaning, to interpret the place as implying the time in which Paul, in his unconverted Jewish state, had not the proper knowledge of the law-while he was unacquainted with its <i>spirituality</i>. He felt <i>evil desire</i>, but he did not know the <i>evil</i> of it; he did not consider that the law tried the <i>heart</i> and its <i>workings</i>, as well as <i>outward actions</i>. This is farther explained in the next verse.</p>
