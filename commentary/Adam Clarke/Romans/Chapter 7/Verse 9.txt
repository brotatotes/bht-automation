<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:9">Romans 7:9</span>. <i><b>I was alive without the law once</b></i> — Dr. Whitby paraphrases the verse thus:-"For the seed of Abraham <i>was alive</i> <i>without the law once</i>, before the law was given, I being not obnoxious to death for that to which the law had not threatened death; <i>but when the commandment came</i>, forbidding it under that penalty, <i>sin revived, and I died</i>; i.e. it got strength to draw me to sin, and to condemn me to death. Sin is, in Scripture, represented as an enemy that seeks our ruin and destruction; and takes all occasions to effect it. It is here said <i>to war against</i> <i>the mind</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>; elsewhere, <i>to war against the soul</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11">1 Peter 2:11</span>; to <i>surround</i> and <i>beset us</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>; to <i>bring us into bondage</i> and subjection, and get the dominion over us, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12">Romans 6:12</span>; to <i>entice us</i>, and so to work our death, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:14-16">James 1:14-16</span>; and to do all that Satan, the grand enemy of mankind, doth, by tempting us to the commission of it. Whence <i>Chrysostom</i>, upon those words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:4">Hebrews 12:4</span>: <i>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood</i>, προς την ἁμαρτιαν ανταγωνιζομενοι, <i>striving against sin</i>; represents sin as an <i>armed</i> and <i>flagrant adversary</i>. When, therefore, it finds a law which threatens death to the violater of it, it takes occasion thence more earnestly to tempt and allure to the violation of it, that so it may more effectually subject us to death and condemnation on that account; <i>for the sting of death is sin, and the strength of</i> <i>sin is the law</i>, condemning us to death for transgressing it. Thus, when God had forbidden, on pain of death, the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Satan thence took occasion to tempt our first parents to transgress, and so <i>slew</i> them, or made them subject to death; εξηπατησε, he <i>deceived them</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:13">Genesis 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:14">1 Timothy 2:14</span>; which is the word used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:11">Romans 7:11</span>. The phrase, <i>without the law, sin</i> was <i>dead</i>, means, that sin was then (before the law was given) comparatively dead, as to its power of condemning to death; and this sense the antithesis requires; <i>without the law</i>, ἁμαρτια νεκρα, εγω δε εζων, <i>sin was dead, but I</i> <i>was living; but when the commandment came,</i> (i.e. the law,) <i>sin</i> <i>revived, and I died</i>. How were men living <i>before</i> the law, but because then no law condemned them? Sin, therefore, must be then <i>dead</i>, as to its condemning power. How did they die when the law came but by the law condemning them to death? Sin therefore <i>revived</i>, then, as to its power of condemning, which it received first from the <i>sin of Adam</i>, which brought death into the world; and next, from the <i>law of Moses</i>, which <i>entered that the offence</i> <i>might abound</i>, and reign more unto death, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span>. For though sin was in the world from Adam to Moses, or until the law was given, yet it was not imputed unto <i>death, when there was no</i> <i>law that did threaten death</i>; so that death reigned from that interval by virtue of <i>Adam's sin</i> alone; even over them who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, i.e. against a positive law, forbidding it under the penalty of death; which law being delivered by Moses, <i>sin revived</i>; i.e. it had again its <i>force</i> to condemn men as before to death, by virtue of a law which threatened death. And in this sense the apostle seems to say, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>, <i>the law was added because of transgressions</i>, to convince us of the wrath and punishment due to them; and that <i>the law</i>, therefore, <i>worketh wrath</i>, because <i>where no law is there is no</i> <i>transgression</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>, subjecting us to wrath; or no such sense of the Divine wrath as where a plain Divine law, threatening death and condemnation, is violated."
