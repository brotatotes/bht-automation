<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>. <i><b>There is, therefore, now no condemnation</b></i> â€” To do justice to St. Paul's reasoning, this chapter must be read in the closest connection with the preceding. There we have seen the unavailing struggles of an awakened Jew, who sought pardon and holiness from that law which he was conscious he had broken; and in which he could find no provision for pardon, and no power to sanctify. This conviction having brought him to the very brink of despair, and, being on the point of giving up all hope, he hears of redemption by Jesus Christ, thanks God for the prospect he has of salvation, applies for and receives it; and now magnifies God for the unspeakable gift of which he has been made a partaker.</p>
<p>Those who restrain the word <i>now</i>, so as to indicate by it the <i>Gospel dispensation</i> only, do not take in the whole of the apostles meaning. The apostle has not been dealing in general matters only, but also in those which are particular. He has not been pointing out merely the difference between the two dispensations, the Mosaic and the Christian; but he marks out the state of a penitent under the former, and that of a believer under the latter. The last chapter closed with an account of the deep distress of the penitent; this one opens with an account of his <i>salvation</i>. The <i>now</i>, therefore, in the text, must refer more to the happy transition from darkness to light, from condemnation to pardon, which this believer now enjoys, than to the Christian dispensation taking the place of the Jewish economy.</p>
<p><i><b>Who walk not after the flesh</b></i>, c.] In this one verse we find the power and virtue of the Gospel scheme it <i>pardons</i> and <i>sanctifies</i>; the Jewish law could do neither. By faith in our Lord Jesus Christ the penitent, condemned by the law, is pardoned; the <i>carnal man</i>, labouring under the overpowering influence of the sin of his nature, is sanctified. He is first freely justified; he feels no condemnation; he is fully sanctified; <i>he walks not after</i> <i>the</i> FLESH, <i>but after the</i> SPIRIT.</p>
<p>This last clause is wanting in the principal MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers</i>. Griesbach has excluded it from the text; and Dr. <i>White</i> says, <i>Certissime delenda</i>; it should most undoubtedly be expunged. Without it, the passage reads thus: <i>There is,</i> <i>therefore, no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus; for</i> <i>the law of the Spirit of life</i>, c. It is a fairly assumed point, that those who are in <i>Christ Jesus</i>, who believe in his name, have redemption in his blood are made partakers of his Spirit, and have the mind in them that was in him; will not walk after the flesh, but after the Spirit: therefore the thing itself is included in the <i>being in Christ</i>, whether it be <i>expressed</i> or not: and it was probably to make the thing more obvious, that this explanatory clause was added by some copyist, for it does not appear to have made an original part of the text; and it is most likely that it was inserted here from the <i>fourth</i> verse.</p>
