<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>. <i><b>And if Christ be in you</b></i>, c.] This is the criterion by which you may judge of the state of grace in which ye stand. If Christ dwell in your hearts by faith, <i>the body</i> is <i>dead because</i> <i>of sin</i>, δι' ἁμαρτιαν, in reference to sin the members of your body no more perform the work of sin than the body of a dead man does the functions of natural life. Or the apostle may mean, that although, <i>because of sin</i>, the <i>life</i> of man is forfeited; and the sentence, <i>dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return</i>, must be fulfilled on every human being, until the judgment of the great day; yet, their souls being quickened by the indwelling Spirit of Christ, which enables them to live a life of righteousness, they receive a full assurance that their bodies, which are now condemned to death because of sin, shall be raised again to a life of immortal glory.</p>
