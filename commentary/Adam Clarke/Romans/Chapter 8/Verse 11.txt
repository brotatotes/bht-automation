<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>. <i><b>But if the Spirit</b></i>, c.] This verse confirms the sense given to the preceding. He who here receives the grace and Spirit of Christ, and continues to live under its influence a life of obedience to the Divine will, shall have a resurrection to eternal life and the resurrection of Christ shall be the <i>pattern</i> after which they shall be raised.</p>
<p><i><b>By his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</b></i> — Instead of δια του ενοικουντος αυτου πνευματος, <i>because of the Spirit of him who</i> <i>dwelleth in you</i>, DEFG, a great many others, with the <i>Vulgate,</i> <i>Itala</i>, and several of the fathers, have δια το ενοικουν αυτου πνευμα, which gives almost no variety of meaning. The latter may be neater Greek, but it is not better sense than the preceding.</p>
