<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12">Romans 8:12</span>. <i><b>Therefore, brethren</b></i>, c.] Dr. Taylor is of opinion that the apostle having spoken <i>separately</i>, both to Jews and Gentiles, concerning holiness and the obligations to it, now addresses himself to <i>both</i> conjointly, and,</p>
<p>I. Draws the general conclusion from <i>all</i> his arguments upon this subject, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12">Romans 8:12</span>.</p>
<p>II. Proves the validity of their claims to eternal life, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14-17">Romans 8:14-17</span>.</p>
<p>III. And as the affair of <i>suffering persecution</i> was a great stumbling block to the <i>Jews</i>, and might very much discourage the <i>Gentiles</i>, he introduces it to the best advantage, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>, and advances several arguments to fortify their minds under all trials: as -</p>
<p>(1.) That they suffered with <i>Christ</i> </p>
<p>(2.) In order to be <i>glorified</i> with him in a manner which will infinitely compensate all sufferings, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>.</p>
<p>(3.) All mankind are under <i>various pressures</i>, longing for a better state, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19-22">Romans 8:19-22</span>.</p>
<p>(4.) Many of the most <i>eminent Christians</i> are in the same distressed condition, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>.</p>
<p>(5.) According to the plan of the Gospel, we are to be brought to glory after a course of patience exercised in a variety of trials, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:25">Romans 8:25</span>.</p>
<p>(6.) The Spirit of God will supply patience to every upright soul under persecution and suffering, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span>.</p>
<p>(7.) All things, even the severest trials, shall work together for their good, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>. And this he proves, by giving us a view of the several steps which the wisdom and goodness of God have settled, in order to our complete salvation, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>. Thence he passes to the affair of our <i>perseverance</i>; concerning which he concludes, from the <i>whole</i> of his preceding arguments, that as we are brought into a state of <i>pardon</i> by the free grace of God, through the death of Christ, who is now our mediator in heaven; no possible cause, providing we continue to love and serve God, shall be able to pervert our minds, or separate us from his love in Christ Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:31-39">Romans 8:31-39</span>. <i>Therefore</i>, αρα ουν is the grand inference from all that he has been arguing in relation to sanctity of life, both to the <i>Gentiles</i>, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:0">Romans 6:0</span>, and to the <i>Jews</i>, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:0">Romans 7:0</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:0">Romans 8:0</span>, to this verse, where I suppose he begins to address himself to <i>both</i>, in a body, to the end of the chapter.- Taylor, page 317.</p>
