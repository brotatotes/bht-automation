<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>. <i><b>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die</b></i> — Though μελλετε αποθνησκειν may mean, <i>ye shall afterwards die</i>, and this seems to indicate a <i>temporal</i> death, yet not exclusively of an eternal death; for <i>both</i>, and especially the latter, are necessarily implied.</p>
<p><i><b>But if ye through the Spirit</b></i> — If ye seek that grace and spiritual help which the Gospel of Christ furnishes, resist, and, by resisting, <i>mortify the deeds of the flesh</i>, against which the law gave you no assistance, <i>ye shall live</i> a life of <i>faith, love</i>, and <i>holy obedience</i> here, and a life of <i>glory</i> hereafter.</p>
