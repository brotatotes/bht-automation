<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>. <i><b>Ye have not received the spirit of bondage</b></i> — All that were under the law were under bondage to its rites and ceremonies; and as, through the prevalence of that corrupt nature with which every human being is polluted, and to remove which the law gave no assistance, they were often <i>transgressing</i>, consequently they had forfeited their lives, and were continually, through <i>fear of death, subject to bondage</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:15">Hebrews 2:15</span>. The believers in Christ Jesus were brought from under <i>that</i> law, and from under its condemnation; and, consequently, were freed from its bondage. The Gentiles were also in a state of bondage as well as the Jews, they had also a multitude of burdensome rites and ceremonies, and a multitude of deities to worship; nor could they believe themselves secure of protection while one of their almost endless host of gods, celestial, terrestrial, or infernal, was left unpropitiated.</p>
<p><i><b>But ye have received the Spirit of adoption</b></i> — Ye are brought into the family of God by adoption; and the agent that brought you into this family is the Holy Spirit; and this very Spirit continues to witness to you the grace in which ye stand, by enabling you to call God your Father, with the utmost filial confidence and affection.</p>
<p><i><b>The Spirit of adoption</b></i> — Adoption was an act frequent among the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans; by which a person was taken out of one family and incorporated with another. Persons of property, who had no children of their own, adopted those of another family. The child thus adopted ceased to belong to his own family, and was in every respect bound to the person who had adopted him, as if he were his own child; and in consequence of the death of his adopting father he possessed his estates. If a person <i>after</i> he had adopted a child happened to have children of his own, then the estate was equally divided between the adopted and real children. The Romans had regular forms of law, by which all these matters were settled.-See in Aulus Gellius. Noctes Attic., vol. i. cap. xix. p. 331. Edit Beloe; and the note there.</p>
<p><i><b>Whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</b></i> — The reason why the Syriac and Greek words are here conjoined, may be seen in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>, to which the reader is referred. The introduction of the words here shows that the persons in question had the strongest evidence of the excellence of the state in which they stood; they knew that they were thus adopted; and they knew this by the Spirit of God which was given them on their adoption; and let me say, they could know it by no other means. The Father who had adopted them could be seen by no mortal eye; and the transaction being purely of a spiritual nature, and transacted in heaven, can be known only by God's supernatural testimony of it upon earth. It is a matter of such solemn importance to every Christian soul, that God in his mercy has been pleased not to leave it to <i>conjecture, assumption</i>, or <i>inductive reasoning</i>; but attests it by his own Spirit in the soul of the person whom he adopts through Christ Jesus. It is the grand and most observable case in which the intercourse is kept up between heaven and earth; and the genuine believer in Christ Jesus is not left to the <i>quibbles</i> or casuistry of polemic divines or critics, but receives the <i>thing</i>, and the <i>testimony</i> of it, immediately from God himself. And were not the testimony of the state thus given, no man could possibly have any assurance of his salvation which would beget confidence and love. If to any man his <i>acceptance with God</i> be <i>hypothetical</i>, then his <i>confidence</i> must be so too. His love to God must be hypothetical, his gratitude hypothetical, and his obedience also. IF God had forgiven me my sins, then I <i>should</i> love him, and I <i>should</i> be grateful, and I <i>should</i> testify this gratitude by <i>obedience</i>. But who does not see that these must necessarily depend on the IF in the first case. All this <i>uncertainty</i>, and the perplexities necessarily resulting from it, God has precluded by sending the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, by which we cry, Abba, Father: and thus our adoption into the heavenly family is testified and ascertained to us in the only way in which it can possibly be done, by the direct influence of the Spirit of God. Remove this from Christianity, and it is a <i>dead letter</i>.</p>
<p>It has been remarked that <i>slaves</i> were not permitted to use the term <i>Abba</i>, father, or <i>Imma</i>, mother, in accosting their <i>masters</i> and <i>mistresses</i>. The Hebrew canon, relative to this, is extant in the tract Berachoth, fol. 16. 2, העבדים והשפחות אין קורין אותם לא אבא פלוגי ולא אימא פלוגית <i>haabadim vehashshephachoth ein korin</i> <i>otham, lo</i> Abba N, velo Imma N. <i>Men-servants and maid-servants do</i> <i>not call to their master Abba, (father,) N. nor to their mistress</i> <i>Imma, (mother,) N</i>. And from this some suppose that the apostle intimates that being now brought from under the spirit of bondage, in which they durst not call God their <i>Father</i>, they are not only brought into a new state, but have got that language which is peculiar to that state. It is certain that no man who has not redemption in the blood of the cross has any right to call God <i>Father</i>, but merely as he may be considered the <i>Father of the</i> <i>spirits of all flesh</i>.</p>
<p>Some have supposed that the apostle, by using the <i>Syriac</i> and <i>Greek</i> words which express <i>Father</i>, shows the union of <i>Jewish</i> and <i>Gentile</i> believers in those devotions which were dictated by a filial spirit. Others have thought that these were the <i>first</i> <i>words</i> which those generally uttered who were made partakers of the Holy Spirit. It is enough to know that it was the <i>language</i> of their <i>sonship</i>, and that it expressed the clear assurance they had of being received into the Divine favour, the affection and gratitude they felt for this extraordinary blessing, and their complete readiness to come under the laws and regulations of the family, and to live in the spirit of obedience.</p>
