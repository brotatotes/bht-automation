<p>Verse 17. <i><b>And if children, then heirs</b></i> — For the <i>legitimate</i> children can alone inherit the estate. This is not an estate to which they succeed in consequence of the death of a former possessor; it is like the promised land, <i>given by God himself</i>, and divided among the children of the family.</p>
<p><i><b>Heirs of God</b></i> — It is neither an <i>earthly</i> portion nor a <i>heavenly</i> portion; but GOD <i>himself</i>, who is to be their portion. It is not heaven they are to inherit; it is GOD, who is infinitely greater and more glorious than heaven itself. With such powers has God created the soul of man, that nothing less than <i>himself</i> can be a sufficient and satisfactory portion for the mind of this most astonishing creature.</p>
<p><i><b>Joint heirs with Christ</b></i> — Partaking of the same eternal glory with the glorified human nature of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>If so be that we suffer with him</b></i> — Observe, says Dr. Taylor, how prudently the apostle advances to the harsh affair of <i>suffering</i>. He does not mention it till he had raised up their thoughts to the highest object of joy and pleasure-the happiness and glory of a joint inheritance with the ever-blessed Son of God.</p>
<p>We are <i>heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, if so</i> <i>be that we suffer with him</i>. This, with the additional consideration that we suffer <i>with Christ</i>, or, <i>as</i> he himself suffered, would greatly qualify the transitory afflictions of this world, and dispose them to attend to the other arguments he had to offer.</p>
