<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For I reckon that the sufferings</b></i>, &amp;c.] If the glory that is to be revealed be the enjoyment of God himself, (see above,) then the sufferings of this life, which, when compared with <i>eternity</i>, are but as for a <i>moment</i>, are not worthy to be put in competition with this glory which shall be revealed in us. This case is perfectly clear.</p>
