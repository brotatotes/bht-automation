<p>Verse 19. <i><b>For the earnest expectation of the creature</b></i> — There is considerable difficulty in this and the four following verses: and the difficulty lies chiefly in the meaning of the word ἡ κτισις, which we translate <i>the creature</i>, and <i>creation</i>. Some think that by it the <i>brute creation</i> is meant; others apply it to the <i>Jewish people</i>; others to the <i>godly</i>; others to the <i>Gentiles</i>; others to the <i>good angels</i>; and others to the <i>fallen spirits</i>, both <i>angelic</i> and <i>human</i>. Dissertations without end have been written on it; and it does not appear that the Christian world are come to any general agreement on the subject. Dr. Lightfoot's mode of explanation appears to me to be the best, on the whole. "There is," says he, "a <i>twofold</i> key hanging at this place, which may unlock the whole, and make the sense plain and easy.</p>
<p>1. The <i>first</i> is the phrase, πασα ἡ κτισις, which we render <i>the</i> <i>whole creation</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:22">Romans 8:22</span>, and with which we meet twice elsewhere in the New Testament. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>: <i>Preach the Gospel</i>, πασῃ τῃ κτισει, <i>to every creature</i>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>: <i>The Gospel was preached</i>, εν πασῃ τῃ κτισει, <i>to every creature</i>. Now it is sufficiently apparent what is meant by πασα κτισις in both these places, viz. <i>all nations</i>, or the <i>heathen world</i>. For that which in St. Mark is, <i>preach the Gospel to every creature</i>, is, in St. Matthew, <i>go and teach</i>, παντα τα εθνη, <i>all nations</i>. And this very phrase in this place lays claim to that very interpretation. And the Hebrew כל הבריות <i>col habberioth</i>, which answers to the <i>Greek</i> πασα ἡ κτισις, <i>every creature</i>, is applied by the Jews to the <i>Gentiles</i>, and that by way of opposition to <i>Israel</i>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>second</i> key is the word ματαιοτητι, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20">Romans 8:20</span>, which is not unfitly rendered <i>vanity</i>; but then this vanity is improperly applied to the <i>vanishing</i>, dying, changing state of the creation. For ματαιοτης, <i>vanity</i>, does not so much denote the <i>vanishing</i> <i>condition</i> of the <i>outward state</i>, as it does the <i>inward</i> vanity or <i>emptiness</i> of the mind. So the apostle, speaking of the Gentiles concerning whom he speaks here, tells us εματαιωθησαν, <i>They became</i> <i>vain in their imaginations</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>; and again, <i>The Gentiles walk</i> εν ματαιοτητι, <i>in the vanity of their mind</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>; so also, <i>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise</i>, ὁτι εισι ματαιοι, <i>that</i> <i>they are vain</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:20">1 Corinthians 3:20</span>. To all which let me add this farther observation, that throughout this whole place the apostle seems to allude to the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt, and their deliverance from it; with a comparison made betwixt the <i>Jewish</i> and the <i>Gentile</i> Church. When God would deliver Israel from his bondage, he challenges him for <i>his Son</i>, and his <i>first-born</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:22">Exodus 4:22</span>. And in like manner the <i>Gentiles</i> earnestly expect and wait for such a <i>kind of manifestation of the sons of God</i>, within and among themselves. The <i>Romans</i>, to whom the apostle writes, knew well how many predictions and promises it had pleased God to publish by his prophets, concerning gathering together and adopting <i>sons</i> to himself among the Gentiles; the <i>manifestation</i> of which <i>sons</i> the whole Gentile world with a <i>neck</i> as it were <i>stretched out</i>, as the word αποκαραδοκια implies, (απο, from, and καρα, <i>the head</i>, and δοκαω, <i>to expect</i>,) doth now wait for." See the observations at the end of this chapter.</p>
