<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>. <i><b>For the law of the Spirit of life</b></i> â€” The Gospel of the grace of Christ, which is not only a law or rule of life, but affords that sovereign <i>energy</i> by which guilt is removed from the conscience, the power of sin broken, and its polluting influence removed from the heart. The law was a <i>spirit of death</i>, by which those who were under it were bound down, because of their sin, to condemnation and death. The Gospel proclaims Jesus the Saviour; and what the <i>law</i> bound unto death, IT looses unto life eternal. And thus the apostle says, whether of <i>himself</i> or the man whom he is still personating, <i>the law of the Spirit of life in Christ</i> <i>Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death</i>. Most people allow that St. Paul is here speaking of his <i>own state</i>; and this state is so totally different from that described in the preceding chapter, that it is absolutely impossible that they should have been the state of the same being, at <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i> <i>time</i>. No creature could possibly be <i>carnal, sold under sin,</i> <i>brought into captivity to the law of sin and death</i>; and at the same time be <i>made free from</i> that <i>law of sin and death, by the law</i> <i>of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus</i>! Until the most palpable absurdities and contradictions can be reconciled, these two opposite states can never exist in the same person at the same time.</p>
