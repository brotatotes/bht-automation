<p>Verse 20. <i><b>For the creature was made subject to vanity</b></i> â€” The Gentile world were subject to vanity of mind; but how? <i>not</i> <i>willingly</i>, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same. May we not say, <i>it became vain willingly</i>, but was made subject to vanity <i>unwillingly</i>? For, let us recur to the origin of Gentilism, the confusion of languages, by reason of the attempt to build the tower of Babel; and though there are some passages in the gloss of the Targumists upon this matter that are sufficiently ridiculous, yet as to their <i>scope</i> and <i>design</i> they are worthy of notice. "<i>They</i> <i>said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, and let its head</i> <i>reach unto the top of heaven</i>; and let us make a house of worship in the top of it; and let us put a sword in his hand that he may wage war for us against our enemies, before we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth." It is an ancient tradition among the Jews, that this tower was built on an <i>idolatrous</i> account. The confusion of tongues, by which true religion was lost in the world, is a proof that the builders of this tower sinned against God in the highest degree. They were inclined to <i>vanity</i>, i.e. idolatry, WILLINGLY; but they were <i>subjected to</i> <i>vanity</i> UNWILLINGLY; for this proceeded from the just indignation and vengeance of God. From this time the world lay under heathenism till the bringing in of the Gospel, upwards of 2000 years after. See Lightfoot.</p>
