Verse 21. Because the creature — This and the preceding verse should be thus connected: in hope THAT (οτι) the creature itself also shall be delivered. The word φθορα denotes, very frequently, sinful corruption. So, 2 Peter 1:4: Corruption through lust, της εν επιθυμια φθορας. 2 Corinthians 11:3: Lest your minds should be corrupted. 1 Corinthians 15:33: Evil communications corrupt good manners. The sense, therefore, of the apostle in this place seems to be: the Gentile world shall, in time, be delivered from the bondage of their sinful corruption, i.e. the bondage of their lusts and vile affections; and be brought into such a noble liberty as the sons of God enjoy.
