<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Because the creature</b></i> — This and the preceding verse should be thus connected: <i>in hope</i> THAT (οτι) <i>the creature itself</i> <i>also shall be delivered</i>. The word φθορα denotes, very frequently, <i>sinful corruption</i>. So, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>: <i>Corruption through lust</i>, της εν επιθυμια φθορας. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span>: <i>Lest your minds should be corrupted</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:33">1 Corinthians 15:33</span>: <i>Evil communications corrupt good manners</i>. The sense, therefore, of the apostle in this place seems to be: the Gentile world shall, in time, be delivered from the bondage of their <i>sinful corruption</i>, i.e. the bondage of their lusts and vile affections; and be brought into such a noble liberty as the sons of God enjoy.</p>
