<p>Verse 22. <i><b>The whole creation groaneth and travaileth</b></i> â€” If it be inquired how the Gentile world groaned and travailed in pain; let them who explain this of the fabric of the material world, tell us how <i>that</i> groans and travails? They must needs own it to be a borrowed and allusive phrase: but in the sense above given, the very literal construction may be admitted.</p>
