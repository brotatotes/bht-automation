<p>Verse 23. <i><b>And not only they, but ourselves also</b></i> â€” Neither the <i>Gentiles</i> only, but we <i>Jews</i> also, (however we belong to a nation envious of the heathen,) to whom God hath granted the first fruits of the Spirit; we sigh among ourselves for their sakes, waiting for the adoption; that is, the redemption of our mystical body, whereof the Gentiles make a very great part. <i>Lightfoot's</i> works. vol. ii. p. 359 and 707.</p>
<p>The scope and design of St. Paul in these verses may be thus summed up:-The apostle shows that the whole creation is in a suffering state, into which it has been brought by the disobedience of one man, Adam; therefore, it was <i>made subject to</i> <i>vanity</i>-pain, sickness, and death; not willingly, for mankind had no part in that transgression which "brought death into the world and all our wo;" but God subjected the whole, purposing to afford them a deliverance and infusing into every heart a <i>hope</i> that a more auspicious era should take place; and it is through the influence of this <i>hope</i>, which every man possesses, that the present ills are so patiently borne, because all are expecting better days. The great deliverer is the Messiah, and the Gospel days the auspicious era which God intended to bring forward. They who believe in Christ with a heart unto righteousness are freed from the bondage of their <i>sinful corruption</i>, and brought into the glorious liberty of the sons of God; and they look forward with joyous expectation, waiting for the general resurrection, when their <i>bodies</i> also shall be redeemed from corruption, and the <i>whole</i> man, <i>body</i> and <i>soul</i>, be adopted into the <i>family of heaven</i> ABOVE, as their <i>souls</i> had been previously adopted into the <i>family of</i> <i>faith</i> BELOW. And although it may be said that the redemption provided by the Gospel can not be an object of hope to those who have never heard of it; yet, as every man has <i>hope</i>, and this hope is inspired by God for this very purpose; that it may be the means of supporting them in the ills of life, and God, in inspiring it, had respect to the glorious state of Christianity, therefore it is this state, in effect, that the whole creation are longing for. So Jesus Christ is said, by the Prophet Haggai, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="hag+2:7">Haggai 2:7</span>, to be <i>the desire of all nations</i>; and yet not one of the nations of the earth had, at that time, heard of him. And thus, as Dr. Whitby has very properly remarked, "desire and expectation are ascribed to creatures, in reference to things they <i>want</i>, and which tend to their advantage; notwithstanding they explicitly know nothing of them."</p>
