<p>Verse 24. <i><b>For we are saved by hope</b></i> — We are supported and are comfortable in the expectation we have of receiving from the hand of our God all the good we need in the troubles and adversities of this life, and of having our bodies raised from corruption and death at the general resurrection.</p>
<p><i><b>Hope that is seen is not hope</b></i> — As hope signifies <i>the</i> <i>expectation of future good</i>, so it necessarily supposes that the object of it is not <i>seen</i>, i.e. not <i>enjoyed</i>; for to <i>see</i>, in Scripture language, sometimes signifies to <i>enjoy</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+7:7">Job 7:7</span>: <i>Mine eye shall no more</i> SEE (<i>margin</i>, ENJOY) <i>good</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+9:25">Job 9:25</span>: <i>My days flee away, and</i> SEE <i>no good</i>; i.e. <i>enjoy</i> no prosperity. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+50:23">Psalms 50:23</span>: <i>I will</i> SHOW <i>the salvation of God</i>: I will give that man to <i>enjoy</i> my salvation who walks uprightly. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:8">Matthew 5:8</span>: <i>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall</i> SEE <i>God</i>; that is, they shall <i>enjoy</i> his favour and blessing. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>. <i>The hope that is seen</i>, that is, <i>enjoyed</i>, is no longer <i>hope</i>, it is <i>fruition</i>: and a man cannot <i>hope</i> for that which he has in his <i>possession</i>.</p>
