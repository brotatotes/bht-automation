<p>Verse 25. <i><b>But if we hope for that we see not</b></i> â€” If we have a well-grounded expectation of our resurrection and final glorification, knowing that such things are necessarily <i>future</i>, and must for a certain time be delayed; then <i>do we patiently wait</i> <i>for them</i>, continue patiently to endure the common ills of life, and whatever tribulations we may be exposed to in consequence of our Christian profession; for we know, FAITHFUL <i>is he who has</i> <i>promised. Hope</i> is a sort of universal blessing, and one of the greatest which God has granted to man. To mankind, in general, life would be intolerable without it; and it is as necessary as <i>faith</i> is even to the followers of God.</p>
<p>The ancients have a very instructive and elegant fable concerning it. "<i>Prometheus</i> having made a human body, went up to heaven, and stole some celestial fire to animate it: <i>Jupiter</i>, incensed at the theft, sent down <i>Pandora</i>, with a box full of diseases and plagues of every kind, as an ensnaring present to Prometheus; but he refused to accept it. <i>Epimetheus</i> took and opened it, and instantly all those diseases, c., by which mankind have been made miserable, flew out, and spread themselves over the whole earth and only HOPE remained at the bottom of the box." This fable explains itself, as to its main design. Men find life, with its various and unavoidable ills, only supportable by the <i>hope</i> they have of not only getting safely through them, but of enjoying a state of blessedness in the end. Hope is still at the bottom; and therefore man is encouraged to bear up in all the pressures of life. Take away <i>hope</i>, and then black <i>despair</i> and indescribable wretchedness would be the instant result. <i>Hope</i> stands justly among the highest mercies of God.</p>
