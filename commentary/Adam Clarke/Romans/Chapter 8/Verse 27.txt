<p>Verse 27. <i><b>He maketh intercession for the saints</b></i> — The word εντυγχανω signifies to apply one's self to a person in behalf of another; to <i>intercede</i> or <i>negotiate for</i>. Our Lord makes intercession for us, by <i>negotiating</i> and <i>managing</i>, as our friend and agent, all the affairs pertaining to our salvation. And the Spirit of God makes intercession for the saints, not by supplication to God on their behalf, but by <i>directing</i> and <i>qualifying</i> their supplications in a proper manner, by his agency and influence upon their hearts; which, according to the Gospel scheme, is the peculiar work and office of the Holy Spirit. See <i>Taylor</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the will of God.</b></i> — κατα θεον. According to the mind, intention, or design of God. And thus the prayers which we offer up, and the desires which subsist in the unutterable groanings, are all such as are pleasing in the sight of God. So that God, whose is the Spirit, and who is acquainted with the mind of the Spirit, knows what he means when he leads the saints to express themselves in words, desires, groans, sighs, or tears: in each God reads the language of the Holy Ghost, and prepares the answer according to the request.</p>
<p>From all this we learn that a <i>fluency in prayer</i> is not essential to <i>praying</i>: a man may pray most powerfully in the estimation of God, who is not able to utter even one word. The unutterable groan is big with meaning, and God understands it, because it contains the language of his own Spirit. Some desires are too mighty to be expressed; there is no language expressive enough to give them proper form and distinct vocal sound: such desires show that they came from God; and as they came from him, so they express what God is disposed to do, and what he has purposed to do. This is a matter of great encouragement to all those who are agonizing to enter in at the strait gate.</p>
