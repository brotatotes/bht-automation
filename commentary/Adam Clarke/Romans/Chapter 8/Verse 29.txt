<p>Verse 29. <i><b>For whom he did foreknow</b></i>, c.] "In this and the following verse the apostle shows <i>how</i> our <i>calling</i> is an argument that all things work together to advance our eternal happiness, by showing the several <i>steps</i> which the wisdom and goodness of God have settled, in order to complete our salvation. In order to this he first gives us, in this verse, the <i>foundation</i> and <i>finishing</i>, or the <i>beginning</i> and <i>end</i>, of the scheme of our redemption: <i>For whom God did foreknow, he also did predestinate to</i> <i>be conformed to the image of his Son</i>. To <i>foreknow</i>, here signifies to <i>design before</i>, or at the first forming of the scheme to bestow the <i>favour</i> and <i>privilege</i> of being God's people upon any set of men, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2">Romans 11:2</span>. This is the <i>foundation</i> or first step of our salvation; namely, the <i>purpose</i> and <i>grace of God</i>, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>. Then, he <i>knew</i> or <i>favoured</i> us; for in this sense the word <i>to know</i> is taken in a great variety of places, both in the Old and New Testaments. And as he <i>knew</i> the GENTILES <i>then</i>, when the scheme was laid, and before any part of it was executed, consequently, in reference to the execution of this scheme, he <i>foreknew</i> us. This is the first step of our salvation, and the <i>end</i> or <i>finishing</i> of it is our <i>conformity to the Son of God in eternal glory</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>, which includes and supposes our <i>moral</i> conformity to him. When God <i>knew</i> us, at the forming of the Gospel scheme; or, when he intended to bestow on us the privilege of being his people; he then <i>destinated</i> or designed us to be conformed to the image of his Son; and, as he <i>destinated</i> or <i>determined</i> us then to this very high honour and happiness, he <i>pre-destinated, fore-ordained</i>, or <i>pre-determined</i> us to it. Thus we are to understand the foundation and finishing of the scheme of our salvation. The <i>foundation</i> is the <i>foreknowledge</i>, or <i>gracious</i> purpose of God; the <i>finishing</i> is our being joint heirs with Christ. Now, our <i>calling</i> or <i>invitation</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17- :">Romans 8:17- :</span>) stands in connection with both these.</p>
<p>1. It stands in connection with God's <i>foreknowledge</i>; and so it is a true and valid calling: for we are <i>called, invited</i>, or <i>chosen according</i> <i>to the foreknowledge of God the Father</i>, who may bestow his blessings upon any people, as may seem good in his sight, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>; consequently, we have a good title to the blessings of the Gospel to which we are <i>called</i> or <i>invited</i>. And this was to be proved, that the Jew, to whom the apostle particularly wrote, might see that the Gentiles being now called into the Church of God was not an accidental thing, but a matter which God had determined when he conceived the Gospel scheme. Thus our calling is connected with God's <i>foreknowledge</i>.</p>
<p>2. It stands also in connection with our being <i>conformed to the image of his Son</i>; for we are <i>invited</i> by the Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:14">2 Thessalonians 2:14</span>. And therefore, supposing, what the apostle supposes, that we <i>love God</i>, it is certain, from our being <i>called</i>, that we shall be <i>glorified</i> with the sons of God; and so our calling proves the point, that all things should work together for our good in our present state, because it proves that we are intended for eternal glory; as he shows in the next verse. For we must understand his <i>foreknowing, predestinating, calling</i>, and <i>justifying</i>, in relation to his <i>glorifying</i>; and that none are finally <i>glorified</i>, but those who, according to his <i>purpose</i>, are <i>conformed to the image of his Son</i>." <i>Taylor</i>.</p>
