<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>. <i><b>For what the law could not do</b></i> — The law could not pardon; the law could not sanctify; the law could not dispense with its own requisitions; it is the rule of righteousness, and therefore must condemn unrighteousness. This is its unalterable nature. Had there been perfect obedience to its dictates, instead of <i>condemning</i>, it would have <i>applauded</i> and <i>rewarded</i>; but as the <i>flesh</i>, the <i>carnal</i> and <i>rebellious principle</i>, had prevailed, and transgression had taken place, it was rendered <i>weak</i>, inefficient to undo this word of the <i>flesh</i>, and bring the sinner into a state of pardon and acceptance with God.</p>
<p><i><b>God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh</b></i> — Did that which the law could not do; i.e. purchased pardon for the sinner, and brought every believer into the favour of God. And this is effected by the incarnation of Christ: He, in whom dwelt the fulness of the Godhead bodily, took upon him the <i>likeness of</i> <i>sinful flesh</i>, that is, a <i>human body</i> like ours, but not <i>sinful</i> as ours; and for sin, και περι ἁμαρτιας, <i>and as a</i> SACRIFICE FOR SIN, (this is the sense of the word in a multitude of places,) <i>condemned sin in the flesh</i>-condemned that to death and destruction which had condemned us to both.</p>
<p><i><b>Condemned sin in the flesh</b></i> — The design and object of the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ was to condemn sin, to have it <i>executed</i> and <i>destroyed</i>; not to <i>tolerate</i> it as some think, or to render it <i>subservient</i> to the purposes of his <i>grace</i>, as others; but to annihilate its <i>power, guilt</i>, and <i>being</i> in the soul of a believer.</p>
