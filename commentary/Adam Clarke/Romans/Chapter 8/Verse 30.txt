<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Whom he did predestinate</b></i>, c.] The <i>Gentiles</i>, whom He determined to call into his Church with the Jewish people, <i>He</i> <i>called</i>-He invited by the preaching of the Gospel, to believe on his Son Jesus Christ. It is worthy of note, that all that is spoken here refers to what <i>had already taken place</i> for the <i>calling, justifying</i>, and <i>glorifying</i> are here represented as having <i>already taken place</i>, as well as the <i>foreknowing</i> and the <i>predestinating</i>. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that the apostle refers to what God had <i>already done</i> among the Jews and Gentiles: though he may also speak of the things that <i>were not</i> as though they <i>were</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>He also justified</b></i> — Pardoned the sins of all those who with hearty repentance and true faith turned unto him.</p>
<p><i><b>He also glorified.</b></i> — He has <i>honoured</i> and <i>dignified</i> the Gentiles with the highest privileges, and he <i>has</i> already taken many of them to the kingdom of glory, and many more are on their way thither; and all who <i>love him</i>, and continue faithful unto death, shall inherit that glory eternally. Hence it is added, <i>them he also</i> <i>glorified</i>; for all the honours which he confers on them have respect to and are intended to promote their endless felicity; and though the terms are here used in a more general sense, yet, if we take them more restrictedly, we must consider that in the work of justification <i>sanctification</i> is implied; justification being the foundation and beginning of that work. From all this we learn that none will be <i>glorified</i> who have not been <i>sanctified</i> and <i>justified</i>; that the <i>justified</i> are those who have been <i>called</i> or <i>invited</i> by the Gospel of Christ; that those who have had this <i>calling</i> are they to whom God <i>determined</i> to grant this privilege-<i>they</i> did not choose this salvation first, but God sent it to them when they knew him not-and therefore the salvation of the Gentile world, as well as that of the Jews, comes through the gratuitous mercy of God himself, was the result of infinite designs, and stands on the same ground as the calling, c., of the Jewish people. The word δοξα, which we render <i>glory</i>, and δοξαζω, to <i>glorify</i>, both mean to <i>render illustrious, eminent</i>, c., &amp;c., in various parts of the New Testament and in this sense the verb is used <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:23">John 12:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28">John 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:32">John 13:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:13">John 14:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:8">John 15:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:13">Acts 11:13</span>; in none of which places <i>eternal beatification</i> can be intended. Here it seems to mean that those whom God had called into a state of justification he had rendered <i>illustrious</i> by innumerable gifts, graces, and privileges, in the same manner as he had done to the Israelites of old.</p>
<p>The whole of the preceding discourse will show that every thing here is <i>conditional</i>, as far as it relates to the ultimate salvation of any person professing the Gospel of Christ; for the promises are made to <i>character</i>, and not to <i>persons</i>, as some have most injudiciously affirmed. The apostle insists upon a <i>character</i> all along from the beginning of the chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>: <i>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who</i> <i>walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>: <i>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die</i>, c. The absolute necessity of <i>holiness</i> to salvation is the very <i>subject</i> of his discourse this necessity he positively affirms, and establishes by the most solid arguments. At the very entrance of his argument here, he takes care to settle the connection between our <i>calling</i> and our love and obedience to God, on purpose to prevent that mistake into which so many have fallen, through their great inattention to the <i>scope</i> of his reasoning. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>: <i>All things work together for good </i>- To whom? <i>To</i> THEM <i>that</i> LOVE GOD: <i>to them that are the called according to his purpose</i>. To <i>them that love God</i>, because they are called according to his purpose; for those only who love God can reap any benefit by this <i>predestination</i>, vocation, or any other instance of God's favour. See the <i>observations</i> at the end of this chapter, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:39">Romans 8:39</span> (note)).</p>
