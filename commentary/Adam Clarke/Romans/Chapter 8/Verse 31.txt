<p>Verse 31. <i><b>What shall we then say to these things?</b></i> â€” What conclusion should we draw from the above premises? From all that was already laid down in the preceding chapters, but especially in the preceding verses, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28-30">Romans 8:28-30</span> inclusive. As if he had said: What comfort may we derive from these doctrines? God has called us all to <i>holiness</i>, and to <i>love to him</i>, which is the principle of holiness. We are persecuted and despised, it is true, and we may be more so; but, as God has called us to love him, <i>and all things work together for good to them that love him</i>; and, as his covenant with Abraham, while he was in his <i>Gentile</i> state, shows his gracious <i>purpose</i> towards us <i>Gentiles</i>, whom he has foreknown, who have been objects of his <i>gracious foreknowledge</i>, as well as the <i>Jews</i>, and who have now the fullest proof that we were so, by his sending us the <i>Gospel</i>, and showing us, in it, that if the Israelites were to be a <i>holy priesthood</i>, a <i>royal nation</i>, we are no less favoured, as he has <i>predestinated</i>, from the <i>beginning</i> <i>determined</i>, that <i>we should be conformed to the image of his Son</i>, who is to be the <i>first-born among many brethren</i>, the <i>head</i> and <i>chief</i> of all <i>converted Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>, and, in order to our final salvation, has <i>called</i>, invited us to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, has <i>justified</i> those who do believe, and has <i>glorified</i>, highly <i>honoured</i>, and <i>adorned</i> them with <i>innumerable</i> <i>gifts and graces</i>, and, if they continue to possess that faith which worketh by love, will bring them, both <i>body</i> and <i>soul</i>, to his <i>eternal glory</i>, their <i>bodies being made like unto his glorious</i> <i>body</i>:- seeing, therefore, all these things are so, what comfort in our tribulations shall we derive from them? - Why this: <i>If God be</i> <i>for us, who</i> can be <i>against us</i>? He who is infinitely <i>wise</i> has undertaken to <i>direct</i> us: He who is infinitely <i>powerful</i> has undertaken to <i>protect</i> us: He who is infinitely <i>good</i> has undertaken to <i>save</i> us. What <i>cunning, strength</i>, or <i>malice</i>, can prevail against his <i>wisdom, power</i>, and <i>goodness</i>? None. Therefore we are safe who love God; and not only shall sustain no essential damage by the persecutions of ungodly men, but even these things work together for our good.</p>
