<p>Verse 32. <i><b>He that spared not his own Son</b></i> â€” And can we, his sincere followers, doubt of the safety of our state, or the certainty of his protection? No: for if he loved us, Gentiles and Jews, so intensely as to <i>deliver up</i> to death his own Son <i>for us</i> <i>all</i>, can he withhold from us any minor blessing? Nay, will he not, on the contrary, <i>freely give us all things</i>? For if he told Abraham, who is the father of the <i>faithful</i>, and representative of <i>us all</i>, and with whom the covenant was made, that, because he had not withheld from <i>him</i> his only son Isaac, but <i>delivered him up to</i> <i>that death</i> which he thought his God had required, in blessing, he would bless him; and in multiplying, he would multiply him; that his seed should possess the gate of his enemies; and that in it all the nations of the earth should be blessed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16-19">Genesis 22:16-19</span>; will HE not give US all that was spiritually intended by these promises, whose only begotten Son was not sacrificed in a <i>figure</i>, but <i>really</i>, in order to purchase every blessing that the soul of man can need and that the hand of God can dispense.</p>
