<p>Verse 35. <i><b>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</b></i> — I do think that this question has been generally misunderstood. The apostle is referring to the persecutions and tribulations to which genuine Christians were exposed through their attachment to Christ, and the gracious provision God had made for their support and final salvation. As in this provision God had shown his infinite love to them in providing Jesus Christ as their sin-offering, and Jesus Christ had shown his love in suffering death upon the cross for them; so, here, he speaks of the love of the <i>followers</i> of God to that Christ who had first loved <i>them</i>. Therefore the question is not, Who shall separate the love of Christ from us? or prevent Christ from loving us? but, Who shall separate <i>us</i> from the love of Christ? <i>Who</i> or <i>what</i> shall be able to remove <i>our affection</i> from him? And the questions that immediately follow show that this is the sense of the passage; for the <i>tribulation, distress</i>, c., which he enumerates, are things by which <i>they</i> might be affected, but by which <i>Christ</i> could not be affected and, consequently, the question most evidently refers to <i>their love to him</i> who had first loved them, and, while it affords a strong <i>presumption</i> of their <i>perseverance</i>, furnishes a most powerful argument against <i>apostasy</i>.</p>
<p><b>Shall </b><i><b>tribulation?</b></i> — φλιψις, grievous affliction, or distress of any kind; from φλιβω, to compress, oppress, straiten, c. any thing by which a man is rendered miserable.</p>
<p><i><b>Or distress?</b></i> — στενοχωρια, a word of nearly the same import with the former, but more <i>intense</i> in its signification. It signifies <i>straitness</i>, being <i>hemmed in</i> on every side, without the possibility of getting out or escaping; from στενος, <i>strait</i> or <i>narrow</i>, and χωρος, <i>a place</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Or persecution?</b></i> — διωγμος, from διωκω, to <i>pursue, press upon,</i> <i>prosecute</i>, signifies such <i>pursuing</i> as an enemy uses in order to overtake the object of his malice, that he may destroy him.</p>
<p><i><b>Or famine?</b></i> — λιμος, from λειπω, <i>to fail</i>; the total want of bread, and all the necessaries of life.</p>
<p><i><b>Or nakedness?</b></i> — γυμνοτης, being absolutely without clothing; forcibly expressed by the derivation of the word γυιαμοναεχων, <i>having one's limbs only</i>, being totally <i>unclothed</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Or peril?</b></i> — κινδυνος, a state of extreme and continued danger, perplexing and distressing with grievous forebodings and alarms; derived from κινειταςοδυνας, <i>it excites anguish</i>; because much evil is <i>felt</i>, and much more <i>feared</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Or sword?</b></i> — μαχαιρα, <i>slaughter</i>; the total destruction of life, and especially <i>beheading</i>, and such like, done by the order of the civil magistrate; for the word is used in this epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:4">Romans 13:4</span>, to signify the <i>authority</i> and <i>power</i> which he has of judicially terminating life; i.e. of inflicting <i>capital punishment</i>.</p>
