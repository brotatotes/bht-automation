<p>Verse 37. <i><b>Nay</b></i> â€” as the prophet adds in the same place, <i>all</i> <i>this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nor dealt</i> <i>falsely in thy covenant</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>, so all these things may happen unto us; but <i>in all these things we are more than</i> <i>conquerors</i>; WE abide faithful in the new covenant of our God; and HE is faithful who has promised to support and make us more than conquerors; i.e. to give us a complete <i>triumph</i> over sin, and death, and hell, not leaving one enemy unsubdued.</p>
