<p>Verse 38. <i><b>For I am persuaded</b></i> â€” After the blessed experience we have had of support by the grace and Spirit of him that loved us, that neither fear of <i>death</i>, nor hope of <i>life</i>, nor evil <i>angels</i>, <i>nor principalities, nor powers</i>, persecuting us for Christ's sake; nor the <i>things</i> we endure at <i>present, nor</i> the <i>things to come</i>, whatever tribulation we may be called to suffer in future;</p>
