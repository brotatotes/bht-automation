<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>. <i><b>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled</b></i><b> </b><i><b>in us</b></i> â€” That the guilt might be pardoned through the merit of that sacrifice; and that we might be enabled, by the power of his own grace and Spirit, to walk in newness of life; loving God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and our neighbour as ourselves: and thus the righteousness, the spirit, design, and purpose of the law is fulfilled in us, through the <i>strength of the</i> <i>Spirit of Christ</i>, which is here put in opposition to <i>the weakness</i> <i>of the law through the flesh</i>.</p>
<p>It is very likely that the concluding clause of this verse, which is the very same as that found in the common text of the first verse, has been transferred to that verse from this place.</p>
