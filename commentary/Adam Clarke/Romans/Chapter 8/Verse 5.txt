<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span>. <i><b>For they that are after the flesh</b></i> — And here is the great distinction between <i>Jews</i> and <i>genuine Christians</i>: the former are <i>after the flesh</i>-are under the power of the carnal, rebellious principle; and consequently <i>mind</i>, προνουσιν, <i>relish, the things of</i> <i>the flesh</i>-the things which appertain merely to the <i>present life</i>; having no relish for <i>spiritual</i> and <i>eternal things</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But they that are after the Spirit</b></i> — They who are regenerated, who are born of the Spirit, being redeemed from the influence and law of the carnal mind; these relish <i>the things of the Spirit</i>-they are spiritually minded, and pass through things <i>temporal</i>, so as not to lose the things which are <i>eternal</i>. And this, which in these apostolic times distinguished between the carnal Jew and the spiritual believer in Christ, is the grand mark of distinction between the <i>nominal</i> and the <i>real</i> Christian now. The former is earthly minded, and lives for <i>this world</i>; the latter is spiritually minded, and lives for the <i>world to come</i>.</p>
