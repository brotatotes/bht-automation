Verse Romans 8:5. For they that are after the flesh — And here is the great distinction between Jews and genuine Christians: the former are after the flesh-are under the power of the carnal, rebellious principle; and consequently mind, προνουσιν, relish, the things of the flesh-the things which appertain merely to the present life; having no relish for spiritual and eternal things.But they that are after the Spirit — They who are regenerated, who are born of the Spirit, being redeemed from the influence and law of the carnal mind; these relish the things of the Spirit-they are spiritually minded, and pass through things temporal, so as not to lose the things which are eternal. And this, which in these apostolic times distinguished between the carnal Jew and the spiritual believer in Christ, is the grand mark of distinction between the nominal and the real Christian now. The former is earthly minded, and lives for this world; the latter is spiritually minded, and lives for the world to come.
