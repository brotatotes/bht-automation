<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span>. <i><b>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God</b></i> — Because it is a <i>carnal mind</i>, and relishes earthly and sinful things, and lives in opposition to the pure and holy law of God: therefore, it <i>is enmity against God</i>; it is irreconcilable and implacable hatred.</p>
<p><i><b>It is not subject to the law of God</b></i> — It will come under no obedience; for it is <i>sin</i>, and the very principle of rebellion; and therefore it cannot be <i>subject</i>, nor <i>subjected</i>; for it is essential to sin to show itself in <i>rebellion</i>; and when it ceases to <i>rebel</i>, it ceases to be sin.</p>
<p>From this we learn that the design of God in the economy of the Gospel, is not to <i>weaken, curtail</i>, or <i>lay</i> the carnal principle <i>in</i> <i>bonds</i>, but to <i>destroy it</i>. As it is <i>not subject</i>, and cannot be subject, to the law of God, it must be <i>destroyed</i>, else it will continue to rebel against God. It cannot be <i>mended</i>, or rendered less offensive in its nature, even by the operations of God; it is ever sin, and sin is ever enmity; and enmity, wherever it has power, will invariably show itself in acts of hostility and rebellion.</p>
