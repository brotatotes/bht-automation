Verse Romans 8:8. So then — Because this carnal mind is enmity against God, they that are in the flesh-who are under the power of the workings of this carnal mind, (which every soul is that has not received redemption in the blood of the Lamb,)-Cannot please God. — Because of the rebellious workings of this principle of rebellion and hatred. And, if they cannot please God, they must be displeasing to him; and consequently in the broad road to final perdition.
