<p>To this and the tenth chapter, Dr. Taylor has prefixed the following judicious summary:-</p>
<p>The apostle has largely proved in the preceding chapters, that the <i>grace of God</i> extends to the <i>Gentiles</i> as well as to the <i>Jews;</i> and that the dispensation of God's mercy was absolutely, and in itself, free to all who believe, whether Jews or Gentiles, in opposition to the merit of any works, or of conformity to any law whatever; and that the Gentiles have, by <i>faith</i>, a good title to the blessings of God's covenant, to which blessings the Jews cannot have a title any other way. Hitherto the apostle has not considered the Jews as <i>rejected</i>, except in an indirect way, but that they had the possibility of continuing in the Church, from entering into which they should not attempt to prevent the Gentiles, but allow them to be sharers in the mercies of God; and hence his language is in sum this: Why may not believing Gentiles be admitted, pardoned, and saved, as well as you?</p>
<p>But in this chapter, and the two following, the apostle considers the reception of the Gentiles into the kingdom and covenant of God under the notion of <i>calling</i> or <i>invitation</i>, and of <i>election</i> or <i>choice</i>: which shows that he views the two parties in a light different to that in which he had before placed them. The <i>Gentiles</i> he considers as <i>invited</i> into the kingdom of God, and as <i>chosen</i> to be his people; and the <i>Jews</i> he considers as <i>left out</i> and <i>rejected</i>; for as the main body of them had now rejected the Gospel of Christ, he saw that God was about to unchurch them, overturn their polity, destroy their temple, and disperse them over the face of the earth. Thus he knew they would be accursed, or anathematized from Christ, and reduced to a level with the heathen nations of the world. And the event has proved that his declarations were dictated by the Spirit of truth.</p>
<p>It is observable that, agreeably to his delicate manner of writing, and his nice and tender treatment of his countrymen, he never mentions their <i>rejection</i>-a subject extremely painful to his thoughts-otherwise than in a <i>wish</i> that he <i>himself were accursed</i> <i>from Christ</i> for them, or to prevent them from being accursed from Christ, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span>,) till he comes to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:0">Romans 11:0</span>, where he has much to say in their favour, even considered, as at present, rejected. But it is very evident that his arguments in this chapter rest on the supposition that the main body of the Jewish nation would be cast out of the visible kingdom of God; and it is for this reason that in this and the two following chapters he considers the reception of any people into the kingdom and covenant of God under the relative notion of <i>inviting</i> and <i>choosing</i>, or of <i>calling</i> and <i>election</i>. The Jews were <i>rejected</i> and <i>reprobated</i>; the Gentiles were <i>chosen</i> and <i>called</i>, or <i>elected</i>. As this is most obviously the apostle's meaning, it is strange that any should apply his doctrine to the particular and unconditional reprobation and election of <i>individuals</i>.</p>
<p>It is upon this <i>rejection</i> of the <i>Jews</i> that the <i>calling</i> and <i>election</i> of the <i>Gentiles</i> rest. If the Jews be not rejected, but are still the visible Church and kingdom of God, then the <i>Gentiles</i>, according to the most proper inference from the apostle's doctrine, have no right to the blessings of the kingdom. Instead of being <i>invited</i> or <i>called</i>, they are intruders at the heavenly <i>feast</i>; and this the unbelieving Jews laboured to prove, and thus unhinge the believing Gentiles by persuading them that they were not duly taken into the Church of God; that the Jews were, and ever must continue to be, the <i>only</i> Church and kingdom of God, and that they could not be cast off so long as God was <i>faithful to his promise</i> to Abraham; and that the Gentiles were most miserably deceived when they supposed they were brought into that kingdom by faith in Christ, whereas there was no way of entering it, or of being entitled to its privileges, but by <i>submitting to the law of Moses</i>. This being the fixed opinion of the Jews, and the ground on which they opposed the Gentiles and endeavoured to sap the foundation of their hope of salvation from the Gospel of Christ, it was therefore a matter of the utmost importance to be able to prove that the Jews, by rejecting Christ and his Gospel, were themselves cast out of the Church, and this in a way perfectly consistent with the truth of the promise made to Abraham. He had slightly touched on this subject at the beginning of the third chapter; but it would have broken in too much on the thread of his discourse to have pursued the argument there, for which reason he appears to have reserved it to this place, where he</p>
<p>(1) solemnly declares his tenderest affection for his countrymen, and his real grief of heart for their infidelity and consequent rejection, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1-5">Romans 9:1-5</span>;</p>
<p>(2) Answers objections against this rejection, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6-23">Romans 9:6-23</span>;</p>
<p>(3) Proves the <i>calling of the Gentiles</i> from their own <i>Scriptures</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:24-30">Romans 9:24-30</span>;</p>
<p>(4) Gives the true state and reasons of the <i>rejection</i> of the Jews and the <i>calling</i> of the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14">Romans 10:14</span>;</p>
<p>(5) Proves the necessity of the apostolic mission to the Gentiles in order to their salvation, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14-21">Romans 10:14-21</span>.</p>
<p>And all this was intended at once to vindicate the Divine dispensations; to convince the infidel Jew; to satisfy the believing Gentile that his <i>calling</i> or <i>invitation</i> into the Church of God was <i>valid</i>; to arm him against the cavils and objections of the unbelieving Jews, and to dispose the Christian Jew to receive and own the believing Gentile as a member of the family and kingdom of God, by Divine right, equal to any to which he himself could pretend. See Taylor's notes, p. 321, c.</p>
<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span>. <i><b>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not</b></i> â€” This is one of the most solemn oaths any man can possibly take. He appeals to Christ as the searcher of hearts that he tells the truth asserts that his conscience was free from all guile in this matter, and that the Holy Ghost bore him testimony that what he said was true. Hence we find that the <i>testimony</i> of a man's <i>own conscience</i>, and the <i>testimony</i> of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, are two distinct things, and that the apostle had <i>both</i> at the same time.</p>
<p>As the apostle had still remaining a very awful part of his commission to execute, namely, to declare to the Jews not only that God had <i>chosen the Gentiles</i>, but had <i>rejected them</i> because they had rejected Christ and his Gospel, it was necessary that he should assure them that however he had been persecuted by them because he had embraced the Gospel, yet it was so far from being a gratification to him that they had now fallen under the displeasure of God, that it was a subject of continual distress to his mind, and that it produced in him <i>great heaviness and</i> <i>continual sorrow</i>.</p>
