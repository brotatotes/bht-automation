<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>. <i><b>For</b></i><b> the children </b><i><b>being not yet born</b></i> — As the word <i>children</i> is not in the text, the word <i>nations</i> would be more proper; for it is of <i>nations</i> that the apostle speaks, as the following verses show, as well as the history to which he refers.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither having done any good</b></i> — To merit the distinction of being made the peculiar people of God; <i>nor evil</i>, to deserve to be left out of this covenant, and the distinguishing national blessings which it conferred; <i>that the purpose of God according to</i> <i>election might stand</i>-that such distinctions might appear to depend on nothing but God's free choice, not <i>of works</i>, or any desert in the <i>people</i> or <i>nations</i> thus chosen; but of the mere purpose <i>of him</i> <i>who calleth</i> any people he pleases, to make them the depositories of his especial blessings, and thus to distinguish them from all others.</p>
