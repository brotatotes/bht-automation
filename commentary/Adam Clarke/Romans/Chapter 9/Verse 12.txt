<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:12">Romans 9:12</span>. <i><b>The elder shall serve the younger</b></i> â€” These words, with those of Malachi, <i>Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated</i>, are cited by the apostle to prove, according to their typical signification, that the <i>purpose of God, according to election</i>, does and will stand, not of <i>works</i>, but of <i>him that calleth</i>; that is, that the <i>purpose of God</i>, which is the ground of that <i>election</i> which he makes among men, unto the honour of being Abraham's seed, might appear to remain unchangeable in him; and to be even the <i>same</i> which he had declared unto Abraham. That these words are used in a <i>national</i> and not in a <i>personal</i> sense, is evident from this: that, taken in the latter sense they are <i>not true</i>, for <i>Jacob</i> never did exercise any power over <i>Esau</i>, nor was Esau ever <i>subject</i> to him. Jacob, on the contrary, was rather subject to Esau, and was sorely afraid of him; and, first, by his messengers, and afterwards personally, acknowledged his brother to be his <i>lord</i>, and himself to be his <i>servant</i>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:4">Genesis 32:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:8">Genesis 33:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:13">Genesis 33:13</span>. And hence it appears that neither <i>Esau</i> nor <i>Jacob</i>, nor even <i>their</i> <i>posterities</i>, are brought here by the apostle as instances of any <i>personal reprobation</i> from eternity: for, it is very certain that very many, if not the far <i>greatest part</i>, of <i>Jacob's</i> posterity were <i>wicked</i>, and rejected by God; and it is not less certain that some of <i>Esau's</i> posterity were partakers of the faith of their father Abraham.</p>
<p>From these premises the true sense of the words immediately following, <i>Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:2">Malachi 1:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:3">Malachi 1:3</span>, fully appears; that is, that what he had already cited from Moses concerning the two nations, styled by the names of their respective heads, <i>Jacob</i> and <i>Esau</i>, was but the same in substance with what was spoken many years after by the Prophet Malachi. The unthankful Jews had, in Malachi's time, either in words or in their heart, expostulated with God, and demanded of him wherein he had loved them? <i>I have loved you, saith the Lord: yet ye say,</i> <i>Wherein hast thou loved us</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:2-5">Malachi 1:2-5</span>. To this the Lord answers: <i>Was not Esau Jacob's brother? Yet I loved Jacob and</i> <i>hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the</i> <i>dragons of the wilderness. Whereas Edom saith, We are</i> <i>impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places;</i> <i>thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw</i> <i>down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The</i> <i>people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever. And your</i> <i>eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord will be magnified from</i> <i>the border of Israel</i>.</p>
<p>1. It incontestably appears from these passages that the prophet does not speak at all of the <i>person</i> of Jacob or Esau, but of their respective <i>posterities</i>. For it was not Esau in person that said, <i>We are impoverished</i>; neither were his <i>mountains</i> nor <i>heritage laid waste</i>. Now, if the <i>prophet</i> speaks neither of the person of the one nor of the person of the other, but of their <i>posterity</i> only, then it is evident that the <i>apostle</i> speaks of them in the <i>same way</i>.</p>
<p>2. If neither the <i>prophet</i> nor the <i>apostle</i> speaks of the <i>persons</i> of Jacob or Esau, but of their <i>posterity</i>, then it is evident that neither the <i>love of God to Jacob</i>, nor the <i>hatred of God to Esau</i>, were such, according to which the eternal states of men, either in happiness or misery, are to be determined; nor is there here any Scriptural or rational ground for the decree of unconditional personal election and reprobation, which, comparatively, modern times have endeavoured to build on these scriptures. For,</p>
<p>1. It is here proved that <i>Esau</i> is not mentioned under any <i>personal</i> consideration, but only as the <i>head</i> of his <i>posterity</i>.</p>
<p>2. The testimony of Scripture amply proves that all <i>Esau's posterity</i> were not, even in this sense, reprobated; nor all <i>Jacob's posterity</i> elected.</p>
<p>3. Neither does that <i>service</i>, or subjugation to Jacob, which the Divine oracle imposed on Esau, import any such <i>reprobation</i> as some contend for; as the <i>servant</i> may be <i>elected</i>, while the <i>master</i> himself is in a state of <i>reprobation</i>.</p>
<p>4. Were it even granted that <i>servitude</i> did import such a <i>reprobation</i>, yet it is certain that Esau, in person, never did <i>serve</i> Jacob.</p>
<p>5. Nor does the <i>hatred</i> of God against Esau import any such reprobation of the person of Esau, because it is demonstrable that it related, not to Esau <i>personally</i>, but to his <i>posterity</i>.</p>
<p>6. The scope of the apostle's reasoning is to show that God is the sovereign of his own ways, has a right to dispense his blessings as he chooses, and to give salvation to mankind, not in the ways of their devising, but in that way that is most suitable to his infinite wisdom and goodness.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>(1) He chose the Jewish people from all others, and revealed himself to them. Thus <i>they</i> were the <i>elect</i>, and all the <i>nations</i> of mankind <i>reprobate</i>.</p>
<p>(2) When the fulness of the time came he revealed himself also to the <i>Gentiles</i>, who gladly received the Gospel: and the <i>Jews</i> rejecting it, were <i>cast off</i>. Thus the <i>elect</i> became <i>reprobate</i>, and the <i>reprobate, elect</i>.</p>
<p>(3) He published to all mankind that the pardon of sin could and should be obtained ONLY <i>by faith in his Son Jesus</i>, and not by <i>any</i> <i>obedience to any law</i>. And the Jews, the descendants of Jacob, who rejected this way of salvation, became precisely like the <i>Edomites</i>, the descendants of Esau; <i>they builded, but God pulled</i> <i>down; their mountains and heritage are</i> NOW <i>laid waste for the</i> <i>dragons of the wilderness</i>; and <i>they</i> properly may now <i>be called the</i> <i>border of wickedness, a people against whom the Lord hath</i> <i>indignation for ever</i>: they have rejected the Lord that bought them, and so have brought upon themselves swift destruction.</p>
<p>7. That no <i>personal</i>, absolute, eternal reprobation of Esau can have been intended, we learn from this; that he was most amply <i>reconciled</i> to his brother, who had so deeply wronged and offended him, by depriving him of his birthright and his blessing: and his having forgiven his brother his trespasses, was no mean proof that God had forgiven him. See our Lord's words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span>. Therefore there can be assigned no competent ground of his damnation, much less of his <i>personal</i> reprobation from all eternity.</p>
<p>8. And were such a <i>personal</i> reprobation intended, is it not shocking to suppose that the God of endless mercy, in whose sight his pious parents had found favour, should inform <i>them</i>, even <i>before</i> their <i>child was born</i>, that he had <i>absolutely consigned him, by an</i> <i>irrevocable decree to eternal damnation</i>? A message of such horrid import coming immediately from the mouth of God, to a tender, weak, and delicate woman, whose hour of travail with two children was just at hand, could not have failed to produce abortion, and destroy her life. But the parents perfectly understood their God, and saw no decree of reprobation in his <i>message; two manner of</i> <i>nations are in thy womb-and the elder shall serve the younger.</i></p>
<p>9. There is no <i>reason</i>, worthy the most wise and gracious God, why he should make known to the world such a thing concerning <i>Esau</i>, who was yet unborn, that he had reprobated him from all eternity. Such a revelation could be of no spiritual advantage or edification to mankind, but rather of a malignant influence, as directly occasioning men to judge hardly of their Maker, and to conceive of him as no faithful Creator; as having no care, no love, no bowels of compassion towards the workmanship of his own hands.
