Shall we suggest that God's bestowing peculiar privileges in this unequal manner, on those who otherwise are in equal circumstances, is inconsistent with <i>justice</i> and <i>equity? By no means</i>. Whatever God does is <i>right</i>, and he may dispense his blessings to <i>whom</i> and or what <i>terms</i> he pleases.</p>
