<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:15">Romans 9:15</span>. <i><b>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy</b></i>, c.] The words of God to Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:19">Exodus 33:19</span>, show that God has a right to dispense his blessings as he pleases for, after he had declared that he would spare the Jews of old, and continue them in the relation of his peculiar people, when they had deserved to have been cut off for their idolatry, he said: <i>I will make all my</i> <i>goodness pass before thee; and I will proclaim the name of the</i> <i>Lord before thee; and I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy;</i> <i>and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion</i>. As if he had said: I will make such a display of my perfections as shall convince you that my nature is kind and beneficent; but know, that I am a debtor to none of my creatures. My benefits and blessings are merely from my own good will: nor can <i>any people</i>, much less a <i>rebellious</i> people, challenge them as their due in justice or equity. And therefore I now spare the Jews; not because either you, who intercede for them or they themselves have any <i>claim</i> upon my favour, but of my own free and sovereign grace I choose to show them mercy and compassion. I will give my salvation in my own way and on my own terms. He that believeth on my Son Jesus shall be saved; and he that believeth not shall be damned. This is God's ultimate design; this purpose he will never change; and this he has fully declared in the <i>everlasting Gospel</i>. This is the grand DECREE of <i>reprobation</i> and <i>election</i>.</p>
