<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:16">Romans 9:16</span>. <i><b>So then it is not of him that willeth</b></i>, c.] I conclude, therefore, from these several instances, that the making or continuing any body of men the peculiar people of God, is righteously determined not by the <i>judgment, hopes</i>, or <i>wishes</i> of men, but by the <i>will</i> and <i>wisdom</i> of God alone. For Abraham judged that the blessing ought, and he <i>willed</i>, desired, that it might be given to <i>Ishmael</i>; and Isaac also <i>willed</i>, designed, it for his first-born, <i>Esau</i>: and Esau, <i>wishing</i> and hoping that it might be his, <i>readily</i> went, <i>ran</i> a hunting for venison, that he might have the blessing regularly conveyed to him: but they were all disappointed-Abraham and Isaac, who <i>willed</i>, and Esau who <i>ran</i>: for God had originally intended that the blessing of being a great nation and distinguished people should, of his mere good pleasure, be given to Isaac and Jacob, and be confirmed in their posterity; and to them it was given. And when by their apostasy they had forfeited this privilege, it was not Moses' <i>willing</i>, nor any prior obligation God was under, but his own sovereign mercy, which <i>continued</i> it to them.</p>
