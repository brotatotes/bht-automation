<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh</b></i> â€” Instead of showing the Israelites mercy he might justly have suffered them to have gone on in sin, till he should have signalized his wisdom and justice in their destruction; as appears from what God in his word declares concerning his dealings with Pharaoh and the Egyptians, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:15">Exodus 9:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:16">Exodus 9:16</span> : <i>For now</i>, saith the Lord, <i>I had stretched forth my hand</i>, (in the plague of boils and blains,) <i>and I had smitten thee and thy people</i> <i>with the pestilence; and thou hadst</i> (by this plague) <i>been cut off</i> <i>from the earth</i>; (as thy cattle were by the murrain;) <i>but in very</i> <i>deed for this cause have I raised thee up</i>-I have restored thee to health by removing the boils and blains, and by respiting thy deserved destruction to a longer day, that I may, in thy instance, give such a demonstration of my power in thy final overthrow, that all mankind may learn that I am God, the righteous Judge of all the earth, the avenger of wickedness.
