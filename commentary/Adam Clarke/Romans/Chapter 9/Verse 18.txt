<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will</b></i> â€” This is the apostle's conclusion from the facts already laid down: that God, according to his own will and wisdom, in perfect righteousness, bestows <i>mercy</i>; that is to say, his blessings upon one part of mankind, (the Jews of old, and the Gentiles of the present time,) while he suffers another part (the <i>Egyptians</i> of old, and the <i>Jews</i> of the present day) to go on in the abuse of his goodness and forbearance, hardening themselves in sin, till he brings upon them a most just and exemplary punishment, unless this be prevented by their deep repentance and general return to God through Jesus the promised, the real <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
