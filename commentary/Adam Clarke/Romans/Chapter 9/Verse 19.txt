<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Why doth he yet find fault?</b></i> â€” The apostle here introduces the Jew making an objection similar to that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:7">Romans 3:7</span>: <i>If the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his</i> <i>glory</i>, that is, if God's faithfulness is glorified by my wickedness, <i>why yet am I also judged as a sinner</i>? Why am I condemned for that which brings so much glory to him? The question here is: If God's glory be so highly promoted and manifested by our obstinacy, and he suffers us to proceed in our hardness and infidelity, why does he find fault with us, or punish us for that which is according to his good pleasure?</p>
