<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Hath not the potter power over the clay</b></i> â€” The apostle continues his answer to the Jew. Hath not God shown, by the parable of the potter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:1">Jeremiah 18:1</span>, c., that he may justly dispose of nations, and of the Jews in particular, according as he in his infinite wisdom may judge most right and fitting even as the potter has a right, out of the same lump of clay, to make one vessel to a more <i>honourable</i> and another to a <i>less honourable</i> use, as his own judgment and skill may direct; for no potter will take pains to make a vessel merely that he may show that he has power to dash it to pieces? <i>For the word came to Jeremiah from the</i> <i>Lord, saying, Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there</i> <i>I will cause thee to hear my words. Then I went down to the</i> <i>potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work upon the wheels.</i> <i>And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hands of the</i> <i>potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the</i> <i>potter to make it</i>. It was not fit for the more honourable place in the mansion, and therefore he made it for a less honourable place, but as necessary for the master's use there, as it could have been in a more honourable situation. <i>Then the word of the</i> <i>Lord came to me, saying, O house of Israel, cannot I do with you</i> <i>as this potter? Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so</i> <i>are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. At what instant I shall</i> <i>speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up,</i> <i>and to pull down, and to destroy it; if that nation, against whom</i> <i>I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil</i> <i>that I thought to do unto them. And at what instant I shall speak</i> <i>concerning a nation-to build and to plant it; is it do evil in my</i> <i>sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good</i> <i>wherewith I said I would benefit them</i>. The reference to this parable shows most positively that the apostle is speaking of men, not <i>individually</i>, but <i>nationally</i>; and it is strange that men should have given his words any other application with this scripture before their eyes.</p>
