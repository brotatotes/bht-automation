<p>Verse 22. What <i><b>if God, willing to show</b></i> his <i>wrath</i>] The apostle refers here to the case of <i>Pharaoh</i> and the <i>Egyptians</i>, and to which he applies Jeremiah's parable of the potter, and, from them, to the then state of the Jews. Pharaoh and the Egyptians were <i>vessels of wrath</i>-persons deeply guilty before God; and by their obstinate refusal of his grace, and abuse of his goodness, they had fitted themselves for that destruction which the <i>wrath</i>, the vindictive justice of God, inflicted, after he had <i>endured</i> their obstinate rebellion <i>with much long-suffering</i>; which is a most absolute proof that the hardening of their hearts, and their ultimate punishment, were the consequences of their obstinate refusal of his grace and abuse of his goodness; as the history in Exodus sufficiently shows. As the Jews of the apostle's time had sinned after the similitude of the Egyptians, hardening their hearts and abusing his goodness, after every display of his long-suffering kindness, being now fitted for destruction, they were ripe for punishment; and that <i>power</i>, which God was <i>making</i> <i>known</i> for their salvation, having been so long and so much abused and provoked, was now about to show itself in their destruction as a nation. But even in this case there is not a word of their <i>final damnation</i>; much less that either <i>they</i> or any <i>others</i> were, by a sovereign decree, reprobated from all eternity; and that their very sins, the proximate cause of their punishment, were the necessary effect of that decree which had from all eternity doomed them to endless torments. As such a doctrine could never come from God, so it never can be found in the words of his apostle.</p>
