<p>Verse 23. <i><b>And that he might make known</b></i> — God endured with much long-suffering the <i>vessels of wrath</i>:</p>
<p>1. To <i>show his wrath</i>, and to make his power known. And also,</p>
<p>2. That he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy.</p>
<p><i><b>Which he had afore prepared unto glory</b></i> — The Jews were fitted for destruction long before; but the fittest time to destroy them was after he had prepared the believing Gentiles unto glory. For the rod of the Messiah's strength was to be sent out of Zion, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:2">Psalms 110:2</span>. The Jewish nation was to supply the first preachers of the Gospel, and from Jerusalem their sound was to go forth into all the earth. Therefore the Jewish state, notwithstanding its corruptions, was to be preserved till the Messiah came, and even till the Gospel preached by the apostles had taken deep root in the Gentile world. Another thing which rendered the time when the Jewish polity was overthrown the most proper, was this, because then the immediate occasion of it was the extensiveness of the Divine grace. They would not have the Gentiles admitted into the Church of God; but contradicted, and blasphemed, and rejected the Lord that bought them: thus, then, the extensiveness of the Divine grace occasioned their infidelity, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:3">Romans 10:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:12">Romans 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:15">Romans 11:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:28">Romans 11:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:30">Romans 11:30</span>. Thus the Jews were <i>diminished</i> by that <i>abundance of grace</i> which has <i>enriched</i> the Gentiles. And so the grace of God was illustrated; or, so God <i>made known the riches of his glory on the vessels of</i> <i>mercy</i>-the apostles and primitive believers among the Jews, and the <i>Gentile world</i>, which received the Gospel by the preaching of the apostles and their successors.</p>
