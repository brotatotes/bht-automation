<p>Verse 25. <i><b>As he saith also in Osee</b></i> â€” It is a cause of not a little confusion, that a uniformity in the orthography of the proper names of the Old and New Testaments has not been preserved. What <i>stranger</i> to our sacred books would suppose that the <i>Osee</i> above meant the Prophet <i>Hosea</i>, from whom, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:23">Hosea 2:23</span>, this quotation is taken: <i>I will have mercy on her that had not obtained mercy;</i> <i>and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my</i> <i>people</i>. The apostle shows that this calling of the Gentiles was no <i>fortuitous</i> thing, but a <i>firm purpose</i> in the Divine mind, which he had largely revealed to the prophets; and by opposing the calling of the Gentiles, the Jews in effect renounced their <i>prophets</i>, and fought against God.</p>
