<p>Verse 26. <i><b>And it shall come to pass</b></i>, c.] These quotations are taken out of Hosea, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:10">Hosea 1:10</span>, where (immediately after God had rejected the <i>ten tribes, or kingdom of Israel</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:9">Hosea 1:9</span>, <i>then saith God, Call his name Lo-ammi for ye are not my people,</i> <i>and I will not be your God</i>,) he adds, <i>yet the number of the</i> <i>children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot</i> <i>be measured nor numbered: and it shall come to pass, that in the</i> <i>place in which it was said unto them, Ye</i> are <i>not my people</i>; there <i>it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God</i>. As if he had said: The <i>decrease</i> of numbers in the Church, by God's utterly taking away the <i>ten tribes</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:6">Hosea 1:6</span>,) shall be well supplied by what shall afterwards come to pass, by calling the <i>Gentiles</i> into it. They, the rejected Jews, which had been the people of God, should become a <i>Lo-ammi-not my people</i>. On the contrary, they, the <i>Gentiles</i>, who had been a <i>Lo-ammi-not my</i> <i>people</i>, should become the <i>children of the living God</i>. Again, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:23">Hosea 2:23</span>: <i>I will sow her</i> (the Jewish Church) <i>unto me in the earth</i>, (alluding probably to the <i>dispersion</i> of the Jews over all the <i>Roman</i> empire; which proved a fruitful cause of preparing the Gentiles for the reception of the Gospel,) <i>and</i>, or <i>moreover, I will have mercy upon</i> <i>her</i>, the body of the believing Gentiles, <i>that had not obtained</i> <i>mercy</i>. See <i>Taylor</i>.</p>
