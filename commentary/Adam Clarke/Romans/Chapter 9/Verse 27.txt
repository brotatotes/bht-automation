<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Esaias also crieth</b></i> â€” The apostle pursues his argument, which had for its object the proof that God, for their infidelity, had rejected the great body of the Jews, and that but a few of them would embrace the Gospel, and be saved from that besom of destruction which was now coming to sweep them and their state away. Dr. Taylor paraphrases this and the following verses thus: And that but a small remnant of the Jews shall now be taken into the Church, is agreeable to former dispensations; for the Prophet Isaiah expressly declares concerning the Israelites, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:22-23">Isaiah 10:22-23</span>: <i>Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the</i> <i>sea</i>, (for the promise to Abraham has been amply fulfilled,) <i>only a</i> <i>remnant shall be saved; the consumption decreed shall overflow in</i> <i>righteousness. For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption,</i> <i>even determined in the midst of all the land</i>.</p>
