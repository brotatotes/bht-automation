<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span>. <i><b>What shall we say then?</b></i> â€” What is the final conclusion to be drawn from all these prophecies, facts, and reasonings?

I answer: The true notion of the calling or inviting of the Gentiles is this: whereas they had no apprehension of being reinstated in the privileges of God's peculiar kingdom, and consequently used no endeavours to obtain that blessing, yet, notwithstanding, they have attained to justification, <i>to the remission of sins</i>, and the privileges of God's people: not on account of their <i>prior worthiness</i> and <i>obedience</i>, but purely by the <i>grace and mercy of God</i>, received by <i>faith</i> on their part. And so, by embracing the scheme of life published by the Gospel, they are adopted into the family and Church of God. Thus the Gentiles are <i>called</i> or <i>invited</i>.</p>
