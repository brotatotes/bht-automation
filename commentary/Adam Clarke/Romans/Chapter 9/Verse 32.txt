<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:32">Romans 9:32</span>. <i><b>Wherefore?</b></i> â€” And where lies their mistake? <i>Being</i> <i>ignorant of God's righteousness</i>-of his method of saving sinners by faith in Christ, <i>they went about to establish their own</i> <i>righteousness</i>-their own method of obtaining everlasting salvation. They attend not to the <i>Abrahamic</i> covenant, which stands on the extensive principles of <i>grace</i> and <i>faith</i>; but they turn all their regards to the <i>law of Moses</i>. They imagine that their obedience to that law gives them a right to the blessings of the Messiah's kingdom. But, finding that the Gospel sets our special interest in God and the privileges of his Church on a different footing, they are offended, and refuse to come into it.</p>
