<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4">Romans 9:4</span>. <i><b>Who are Israelites</b></i> — Descendants of Jacob, a man so highly favoured of God, and from whom he received his name <i>Israel-a prince of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:28">Genesis 32:28</span>; from which name his descendants were called <i>Israelites</i>, and separated unto God for his glory and praise. Their very name of <i>Israelites</i> implied their very high dignity; they were a <i>royal nation; princes</i> of the <i>most high God</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The adoption</b></i> — The Israelites were all taken into the <i>family</i> of God, and were called his <i>sons</i> and <i>first-born</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:22">Exodus 4:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+14:1">Deuteronomy 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:9">Jeremiah 31:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+11:1">Hosea 11:1</span>; and this adoption took place when God made the covenant with them at Horeb.</p>
<p><i><b>The glory</b></i> — The manifestation of God among them; principally by the <i>cloud</i> and <i>pillar</i>, and the <i>Shekinah</i>, or Divine presence, appearing between the cherubim over the mercy-seat. These were peculiar to the Jews; no other nation was ever thus favoured.</p>
<p><i><b>The covenants</b></i> — The covenants made with Abraham, both that which relates to the <i>spiritual seed</i>, and that which was peculiar to his <i>natural descendants</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span>; which covenants were afterwards renewed by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+29:1">Deuteronomy 29:1</span>. Some suppose that the <i>singular</i> is here put for the plural, and that by <i>covenants</i> we are to understand the <i>decalogue</i>, which is termed ברית <i>berith</i>, or <i>covenant</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+4:13">Deuteronomy 4:13</span>. But it is more likely that the apostle alludes to the great <i>covenant</i> made with Abraham, and to its various <i>renewals</i> and <i>extensions</i> at different times afterwards, as well as to its twofold design-the grant of the <i>land of Canaan</i>, and the <i>rest</i> that remains for the people of God.</p>
<p><i><b>The giving of the law</b></i> — The revelation of God by God himself, containing a system of moral and political precepts. This was also peculiar to the Jews; for to no other nation had he ever given a revelation of his will.</p>
<p><i><b>The service</b></i> — λατρεια. The particular ordinances, rites, and ceremonies of their religious worship, and especially the sacrificial system, so expressive of the sinfulness of sin and the holiness of God.</p>
<p><i><b>The promises</b></i> — The land of Canaan, and the blessings of the Messiah and his kingdom; which promises had been made and often repeated to the patriarchs and to the prophets.</p>
