<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>. <i><b>Whose</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>the fathers</b></i> — Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, the twelve patriarchs, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, c., c., without controversy, the greatest and most eminent men that ever flourished under heaven. From these, is an uninterrupted and unpolluted line, the <i>Jewish people</i> had descended and it was no small glory to be able to reckon, in their genealogy, persons of such incomparable merit and excellency.</p>
<p><i><b>And of whom, as concerning the flesh Christ</b></i><b> came</b>] These ancestors were the more renowned, as being the <i>progenitors</i> of the <i>human nature</i> of the MESSIAH. Christ, the Messiah, κατα σαρκα, <i>according to the flesh</i>, sprang from them. But this Messiah was more than man, he is <i>God over all</i> the very Being who gave them being, though he appeared to receive a being from <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>Here the apostle most distinctly points out the <i>twofold</i> nature of our Lord-his <i>eternal Godhead</i> and his <i>humanity</i>; and all the transpositions of <i>particles</i>, and alterations of <i>points</i> in the universe, will not explain away this doctrine. As this verse contains such an eminent proof of the deity of Christ, no wonder that the opposers of his divinity should strive with their utmost skill and cunning to destroy its force. And it must be truly painful to a mind that has nothing in view but <i>truth</i>, to see the mean and hypocritical methods used to elude the force of this text. Few have met it in that honest and manly way in which Dr. Taylor, who was a conscientious Arian, has considered the subject. "Christ," says he, "is <i>God over all</i>, as he is by the Father appointed <i>Lord, King</i>, and <i>Governor of all</i>. The <i>Father hath</i> <i>committed all judgement to the Son</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>; has given <i>all things into his hands</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>; he is <i>Lord of all</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:36">Acts 10:36</span>. <i>God has given him a name above every name</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>; above <i>every name that is named</i>, not only in this world, but also in <i>that which is to come; and has put all things</i> (himself excepted, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27">1 Corinthians 15:27</span>) <i>under his feet</i> and <i>given him to be head over all things</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span>. This is our Lord's supreme Godhead. And that he is ευλογητος, <i>blessed for ever</i>, or the object of <i>everlasting</i> <i>blessing</i>, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span> : <i>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power-and blessing</i> <i>and honour be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the</i> <i>Lamb for ever and ever</i>. Thus it appears the words may be justly applied to our blessed Lord." Notes, p. 329. Yes, and when we take <i>other scriptures</i> into the account, where his <i>essential</i> <i>Godhead</i> is particularly expressed, such as <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16-17">Colossians 1:16-17</span>: <i>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that</i> <i>are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or</i> <i>dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created</i> BY <i>him, and</i> FOR <i>him: and he is</i> BEFORE <i>all things, and</i> BY <i>him do</i> <i>all things consist</i>; we shall find that he is not <i>God</i> by investiture or office, but properly and essentially such; for it is impossible to convey in human language, to human apprehension, a more complete and finished display of <i>what</i> is <i>essential</i> to <i>Godhead</i>, indivisible <i>from</i> it, and incommunicable to any created nature, than what is contained in the above verses. And while these words are allowed to make a part of Divine revelation, the <i>essential Godhead</i> of Jesus Christ will continue to be a doctrine of that revelation.</p>
<p>I pass by the groundless and endless conjectures about reversing some of the particles and placing points in different positions, as they have been all invented to get rid of the doctrine of Christ's divinity, which is so obviously acknowledged by the simple text; it is enough to state that there is no <i>omission</i> of these important words in any MS. or <i>version</i> yet discovered.</p>
