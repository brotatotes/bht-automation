<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6">Romans 9:6</span>. <i><b>Not as though the word of God hath taken none</b></i><b> </b><i><b>effect.</b></i> â€” A Jew might have objected, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:3">Romans 3:3</span>: "Is not God bound by his faithfulness to continue the Jews as his peculiar Church and people, notwithstanding the infidelity of the major part of them? If they are brought to a level with the Gentiles, will it not follow that God hath failed in the performance of his promise to Abraham? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:7">Genesis 17:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:8">Genesis 17:8</span> : <i>I will establish my covenant between me and thee for an</i> <i>everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and thy seed after</i> <i>thee</i>." To which it may be answered: This awful dispensation of God towards the Jews is not inconsistent with the veracity of the Divine promise; for even the whole body of natural born Jews are not the whole of the Israelites comprehended in the promise. Abraham is the father of <i>many</i> nations; and his seed is not only that which is of the <i>law</i>, but that also which is of the <i>faith of</i> <i>Abraham</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16">Romans 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span>. The <i>Gentiles</i> were included in the Abrahamic covenant as well as the <i>Jews</i>; and therefore the Jews have no <i>exclusive</i> right to the blessings of God's kingdom.</p>
