<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:8">Romans 9:8</span>. <i><b>That is, They which are the children of the flesh</b></i> â€” Whence it appears that not the children who descend from Abraham's loins, nor those who were circumcised as he was, nor even those whom he might expect and desire, are <i>therefore</i> the Church and people of God; but those who are made children by the good pleasure and promise of God, as <i>Isaac</i> was, are alone to be accounted for the seed with whom the covenant was established.</p>
