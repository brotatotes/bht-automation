<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:9">Romans 9:9</span>. <i><b>For this is the word of promise</b></i>, c.] That is, this is evidently implied in the promise recorded <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:10">Genesis 18:10</span>: <i>At this time I will come</i>, saith God, and exert my Divine power, and <i>Sarah</i>, though fourscore and ten years old, <i>shall have a son</i> which shows that it is the sovereign will and act of God alone, which singles out and constitutes the <i>peculiar seed</i> that was to inherit the promise made to Abraham.</p>
<p>It should be considered that the apostle, in this and the following quotations, does not give us the whole of the text which he intends should be taken into his argument, but only a <i>hint</i> or reference to the passages to which they belong; directing us to recollect or peruse the whole passage, and there view and judge of the argument.</p>
<p>That he is so to be understood appears from the conclusion he draws, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:16">Romans 9:16</span>: <i>So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,</i> <i>but of God that showeth mercy</i>. In his arguments, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:8">Romans 9:8</span>, c., he says not one word of Abraham's <i>willing</i> Ishmael to be the seed in whom the promise might be fulfilled nor of Isaac's <i>willing</i> Esau; nor of Moses' <i>willing</i> and interceding that the Israelites might be spared; nor of Esau's <i>running</i> for venison; but by introducing these particulars into his <i>conclusion</i>, he gives us to understand that his quotations are to be taken in connection with the whole story, of which they are a part; and without this the apostle's meaning cannot be apprehended.</p>
<p>The same may be said of his conclusion, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:18">Romans 9:18</span>: <i>Whom he will he hardeneth: hardeneth</i> is not in his argument, but it is in the <i>conclusion</i>. Therefore hardening is understood in the argument, and he evidently refers to the case of Pharaoh. The generality of the Jews were well acquainted with the Scripture, and a hint was sufficient to revive the memory of a whole passage. -<i>Taylor</i>, p. 330.</p>
