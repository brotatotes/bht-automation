<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>. <i><b>Paul, a servant of God</b></i> — In several places of his other epistles St. Paul styles himself the <i>servant of Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i>, but this is the only place where he calls himself <i>the</i> <i>servant of God</i>. Some think that he did this to vindicate himself against the Jews, who supposed he had renounced God when he admitted the Gentiles into his Church. But if <i>thus</i> to vindicate himself was at all necessary, why was it not done in his Epistle to the Romans, the grand object of which was to prove that the Gentiles came legally into the Church on believing in Christ, with out submitting to circumcision, or being laid under obligation to observe the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish law? This reason seems too fanciful. It is very likely that in the use of the phrase the apostle had no particular design; for, according to him, he who is the <i>servant of Christ</i> is the <i>servant of God</i>, and he who is <i>God's servant</i> is also the <i>servant of Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The faith of God's elect</b></i> — The Christians, who were now chosen in the place of the Jews, who, for their obstinate rejection of the Messiah, were reprobated; i.e. cast out of the Divine favour.</p>
<p><i><b>The acknowledging of the truth</b></i> — For the propagation of that truth, or system of doctrines, which is calculated to promote godliness, or a holy and useful life.</p>
