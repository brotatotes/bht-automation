<p>Verse 10. <i><b>There are many unruly</b></i> — Persons who will not receive the sound doctrine, nor come under wholesome discipline.</p>
<p><i><b>Vain talkers</b></i> — Empty boasters of knowledge, rights, and particular privileges; all noise, empty parade, and no <i>work</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Deceivers</b></i> — Of the souls of men by their specious pretensions.</p>
<p><i><b>They of the circumcision</b></i> — The Judaizing teachers, who maintained the necessity of circumcision, and of observing the rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic law, in order to the perfecting of the Gospel.</p>
