<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Whose mouths must be stopped</b></i> — Unmask them at once; exhibit them to the people; make manifest their ignorance and hypocrisy; and let them be confounded before the people whom they are endeavouring to seduce.</p>
<p><i><b>Subvert whole houses</b></i> — Turn whole Christian families from the faith, attributing to the <i>broad way</i> what belongs only to the <i>strait gate</i>; ministering to disorderly passions, and promising salvation to their proselytes, though not saved from their sins.</p>
