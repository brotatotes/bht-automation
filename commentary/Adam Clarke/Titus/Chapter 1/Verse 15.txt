<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Unto the pure all things are pure</b></i> — This appears to have been spoken in reference to the Jewish distinctions of <i>clean</i> and <i>unclean meats</i>. To the genuine Christian every kind of meat proper for human nourishment is pure, is lawful, and may be used without scruple. This our Lord had long before decided. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:39-41">Luke 11:39-41</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>But unto them that are defiled</b></i> — In their consciences, and <i>unbelieving</i>, απιστοις, <i>unfaithful</i> both to <i>offered</i> and <i>received</i> grace, <i>nothing is pure</i>-they have no part in Christ, and the wrath of God abides upon them. Their <i>mind</i> is contaminated with impure and unholy <i>images</i> and <i>ideas</i>, and <i>their conscience is</i> <i>defiled</i> with the <i>guilt of sins</i> already committed against God.</p>
