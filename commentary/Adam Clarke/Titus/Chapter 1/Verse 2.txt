<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span>. <i><b>In hope of eternal life</b></i> — In expectation of a state of <i>being</i> and <i>well being</i> which should last through eternity, when time should be no more. This includes, not only the <i>salvation of</i> <i>the soul</i> and its eternal <i>beatification</i>, but also the <i>resurrection</i> <i>of the body</i>. This was a point but ill understood, and not very clearly revealed, under the Mosaic law; but it was fully revealed under the Gospel, and the doctrine illustrated by the resurrection and ascension of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Which God, that cannot lie, promised</b></i> — We have often seen that the phrase, <i>the foundation of the world</i>, means the Jewish economy, and, <i>before the foundation of the world</i>, the times antecedent to the giving of the law. This is evidently the meaning here. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9-11">2 Timothy 1:9-11</span>.</p>
<p>Supposing the word αιωνιων in this verse to signify <i>eternal</i>, says Dr. Macknight, the literal translation of προ χρονων αιωνιων would be, <i>before eternal times</i>; but that being a contradiction in terms, our translators, contrary to the propriety of the Greek language, have rendered it <i>before the world began</i>, as Mr. Locke observes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>. The true literal translation is <i>before the secular times</i>, referring us to the Jewish <i>jubilees</i>, by which times were computed among the Hebrews, as among the Gentiles they were computed by <i>generations of men</i>. Hence, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>, <i>The mystery which was kept hid</i> απο των αιωνων και απο των γενεων, <i>from the ages and from the generations</i>, signifies the mystery which was kept hid from the Jews and from the Gentiles.</p>
