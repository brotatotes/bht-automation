<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>. <i><b>But hath in due times</b></i> — καιροις ιδιοις. In its own times. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:6">2 Timothy 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span>. God caused the Gospel to be published in that time in which it could be published with the greatest effect. It is impossible that God should prematurely hasten, or causelessly delay, the accomplishment of any of his works. Jesus was manifested precisely at the time in which that manifestation could best promote the glory of God and the salvation of man.</p>
<p><i><b>Manifested his word</b></i> — τονλογοναυτου. <i>His doctrine</i>-the doctrine of eternal life, by the incarnation, passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is committed unto me</b></i> — That is, to preach it among the Gentiles.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the commandment of God our Saviour</b></i> — This evidently refers to the commission which he had received from Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>: "He is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles." For, "I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee; to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light," c, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span>, c. This is the commandment and according to it he became the apostle of the Gentiles.</p>
<p><i>God our Saviour</i>.-As the commission was given by Jesus Christ alone, the person whom he terms here <i>God our Saviour</i> must be Jesus Christ only; and this is another proof that St. Paul believed Jesus Christ to be GOD. This <i>eternal life</i> God had <i>promised</i> in a comparatively <i>obscure</i> way before the foundation of the world, the Jewish dispensation; but now under the Gospel, he had <i>made it</i> <i>manifest</i>-produced it with all its brightness, illustrations, and proofs.</p>
