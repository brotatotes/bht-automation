<p>Verse 5. <i><b>For this cause left I thee in Crete</b></i> — That St. Paul had been in Crete, though nowhere else intimated, is clear from this passage. That he could not have made such an important visit, and evangelized an island of the first consequence, without its being mentioned by his historian, Luke, had it happened during the period embraced in the Acts of the Apostles, must be evident. That the journey, therefore, must have been performed <i>after</i> the time in which St. Luke ends his history, that is, after St. Paul's first imprisonment at Rome, seems almost certain.</p>
<p><i><b>Set in order the things that are wanting</b></i> — It appears from this that the apostle did not spend much time in Crete, and that he was obliged to leave it before he had got the Church properly organized. The supplying of this defect, he tells Titus, he had confided to him as one whose spiritual views coincided entirely with his own.</p>
<p><i><b>Ordain elders in every city</b></i> — That thou mightest <i>appoint</i>, καταστησης, <i>elders</i> - persons well instructed in Divine things, who should be able to instruct others, and observe and enforce the discipline of the Church. It appears that those who are called <i>elders</i> in this place are the same as those termed <i>bishops</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>. We have many proofs that bishops and elders were of the same order in the apostolic Church, though afterwards they became distinct. Lord Peter King, in his view of the primitive Church, has written well on this subject.</p>
<p><i>In every city</i>. - κατα πολιν. This seems to intimate that the apostle had gone over the whole of the <i>hecatompolis</i> or <i>hundred</i> <i>cities</i> for which this island was celebrated. Indeed it is not likely that he would leave one in which he had not preached Christ crucified.</p>
