<p>Verse 6. <i><b>If any be blameless</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Having faithful children</b></i> — Whose family is converted to God. It would have been absurd to employ a man to govern the Church whose children were not in subjection to himself for it is an apostolic maxim, that he who cannot rule his own house, cannot rule the Church of God; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:5">1 Timothy 3:5</span>.</p>
