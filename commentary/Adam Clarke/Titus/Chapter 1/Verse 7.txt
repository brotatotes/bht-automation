<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Not self-willed</b></i> — μη αυθαδη. Not one who is determined to have his own way in every thing; setting up his own judgment to that of all others; expecting all to pay homage to his understanding. Such a governor in the Church of God can do little good, and may do much mischief.</p>
<p><i><b>Not soon angry</b></i> — μη οπγιλον. Not a choleric man; one who is irritable; who is apt to be inflamed on every opposition; one who has not proper command over his own temper.</p>
