<p>Verse 8. <i><b>A lover of hospitality</b></i> — φιλοξενον. <i>A lover of</i> <i>strangers</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>. Instead of φιλοξενον, one MS. has φιλοπτωξον, <i>a lover of the poor</i>. That minister who neglects the <i>poor</i>, but is frequent in his visits to the <i>rich</i>, knows little of his Master's work, and has little of his Master's spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>A lover of good men</b></i> — φιλαγαθον. <i>A lover of goodness</i> or of <i>good things</i> in general.</p>
<p><i><b>Sober</b></i> — Prudent in all his conduct. <i>Just</i> in all his dealings. <i>Holy</i> in his heart. <i>Temperate</i>-self-denying and abstemious, in his food and raiment; not too nice on points of honour, nor magisterially rigid in the exercise of his ecclesiastical functions. Qualifications rarely found in spiritual governors.</p>
