<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Holding fast the faithful word</b></i> — Conscientiously retaining, and zealously maintaining, the true Christian doctrine, κατα την διδαχην, <i>according to the instructions</i>, or according to the <i>institutions, form of sound doctrine</i>, or <i>confession of faith</i>, which I have delivered to thee.</p>
<p><i><b>That he may be able by sound doctrine</b></i> — If the doctrine be not <i>sound</i>, vain is the profession of it, and vain its influence. It is good to be zealously affected in a good thing; but zeal for what is not of God will do no good to the souls of men, how sincere soever that zeal may be.</p>
<p><i><b>To exhort</b></i> — Them to hold the faith, that they may persevere.</p>
<p><i><b>And to convince</b></i> — Refute the objections, confound the sophistry, and convert the gainsayers; and thus defend the truth.</p>
