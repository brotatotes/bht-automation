Verse 10. Not purloining — μη νοσφιζομενους. Neither giving away, privately selling, nor in any way wasting, the master's goods. The word signifies, not only stealing but embezzling another's property; keeping back a part of the price of any commodity sold on the master's account. In Acts 5:2, we translate it, to keep back part of the price; the crime of which Ananias and Sapphira were guilty. It has been remarked that among the heathens this species of fraud was very frequent; and servants were so noted for purloining and embezzling their master's property that fur, which signifies a thief, was commonly used to signify a servant; hence that verse in Virgil, Eclog. iii. 16: -   "Dost thou blame me, thou man of three letters? Thou art a thief, and the most notorious of all knaves."  It was necessary, therefore, that the apostle should be so very particular in his directions to servants, as they were in general thieves almost by profession.
