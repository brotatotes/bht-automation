<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Not purloining</b></i> — μη νοσφιζομενους. Neither <i>giving</i> <i>away, privately selling</i>, nor in any way <i>wasting</i>, the master's goods. The word signifies, not only <i>stealing</i> but <i>embezzling</i> another's property; <i>keeping back a part of the price</i> of any commodity sold on the master's account. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:2">Acts 5:2</span>, we translate it, <i>to keep back part of the price</i>; the crime of which Ananias and Sapphira were guilty. It has been remarked that among the heathens this species of fraud was very frequent; and servants were so noted for purloining and embezzling their master's property that <i>fur</i>, which signifies a <i>thief</i>, was commonly used to signify a <i>servant</i>; hence that verse in Virgil, Eclog. iii. 16: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Dost thou blame me, thou man of three letters?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Thou art a thief, and the most notorious of all knaves." </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>It was necessary, therefore, that the apostle should be so very particular in his directions to <i>servants</i>, as they were in general <i>thieves</i> almost by profession.</p>
