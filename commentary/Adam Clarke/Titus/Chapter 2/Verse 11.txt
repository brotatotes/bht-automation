<p>Verse 11. <i><b>The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath</b></i> <i>appeared to all men</i>] Επεφανη γαρ ἡ χαρις του Θεου ἡ σωτηριος πασιν ανθρωποις· Literally translated, the words stand thus: <i>For</i> <i>the grace of God, that which saves, hath shone forth upon all men</i>. Or, as it is expressed in the margin of our authorized version: <i>The grace of God, that bringeth salvation to all men, hath</i> <i>appeared</i>. As God's <i>grace</i> signifies God's <i>favour</i>, any <i>benefit</i> received from him may be termed <i>God's grace</i>. In this place, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>, the <i>Gospel</i>, which points out God's infinite mercy to the world, is termed the <i>grace of God</i>; for it is not only a <i>favour</i> of infinite worth in itself, but it announces that greatest gift of God to man, the incarnation and atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Now it cannot be said, except in a very refined and spiritual sense, that this Gospel had then <i>appeared to all men</i>; but it may be well said that <i>it bringeth salvation to all men</i>; this is its design; and it was <i>to taste death for every man</i> that its author came into the world. There is a beauty and energy in the word επεφανη, <i>hath</i> <i>shined out</i>, that is rarely noted; it seems to be a metaphor taken from the <i>sun</i>. As by his rising in the east and <i>shining out</i>, he enlightens, <i>successively</i>, the whole world; so the Lord Jesus, who is called <i>the Sun of righteousness</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>, arises on the whole human race with healing in his wings. And as the <i>light</i> and <i>heat</i> of the sun are denied to no nation nor individual, so the grace of the Lord Jesus, this also <i>shines out upon all</i>; and God designs that all mankind shall be as equally benefited by it in reference to their <i>souls</i>, as they are in respect to their bodies by the sun that shines in the firmament of heaven. But as all the parts of the earth are not <i>immediately</i> illuminated, but come into the solar light <i>successively</i>, not only in consequence of the earth's diurnal revolution round its own axis, but in consequence of its annual revolution round its whole orbit; so this Sun of righteousness, who has <i>shined out</i>, is bringing every part of the habitable globe into his Divine light; that light is shining more and more to the perfect day; so that <i>gradually</i> and <i>successively</i> he is enlightening every nation, and every man; and, when his <i>great year</i> is filled up, every nation of the earth shall be brought into the light and heat of this unspotted, uneclipsed, and eternal Sun of righteousness and truth. Wherever the Gospel comes, it brings <i>salvation</i> - it offers <i>deliverance from all sin</i> to every soul that hears or reads it. As freely as the sun dispenses his genial influences to every inhabitant of the earth, so freely does Jesus Christ dispense the merits and blessings of his passion and death to every soul of man. From the influences of this spiritual Sun no soul is <i>reprobated</i> any more than from the influences of the natural sun. In both cases, only those who wilfully shut their eyes, and hide themselves in darkness, are deprived of the gracious benefit. It is no objection to this view of the subject, that whole nations have not yet received the Divine light. When the earth and the sun were created, every part of the globe did not come <i>immediately</i> into the light; to effect this purpose fully there must be a complete revolution, as has been marked above, and this could not be effected till the earth had not only revolved on its own axis, but passed successively through all the signs of the zodiac. When its <i>year</i> was completed, and not till then, every part had its due proportion of light and heat. God may, in his infinite wisdom, have determined the <i>times</i> and the <i>seasons</i> for the full manifestation of the Gospel to the nations of the world, as he has done in reference to the solar light; and when the Jews are brought in with the fulness of the Gentiles, then, and not till then, can we say that the <i>grand revolution of the important</i> YEAR <i>of the Sun of righteousness is completed</i>. But, in the meantime, the unenlightened parts of the earth are not left in total darkness; as there was light </p>

<p>light being created, and in a certain measure dispersed, at least three whole days before the <i>sun</i> was formed; (for his creation was a part of the <i>fourth</i> day's work;) so, previously to the incarnation of Christ, there was <i>spiritual light</i> in the world; for he diffused his <i>beams</i> while his orb was yet unseen. And even now, where by the preaching of his Gospel he is not yet manifested, he is that true light which enlightens every man coming into the world; so that the moral world is no more left to absolute darkness, where the Gospel is not yet preached, than the earth was the four days which preceded the creation of the sun, or those parts of the world are where the Gospel has not yet been preached. The <i>great year</i> is rolling on, and all the parts of the earth are coming successively, and now <i>rapidly</i>, into the light. The vast <i>revolution</i> seems to be nearly completed, and the whole world is about to be filled with the light and glory of God. A heathen poet, apparently under the inspiration of God (for God has his witnesses every where) speaks of those glorious times in <i>words</i> and <i>numbers</i> which nothing but the Spirit of God can equal. It gratifies myself to refer to them, and it will gratify my reader to find them entered here: - </p>
