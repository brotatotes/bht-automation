<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Looking for that blessed hope</b></i> — Expecting the grand object of our hope, <i>eternal life</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span>. This is what the Gospel teaches us to expect, and what the grace of God prepares the human heart for. This is called a <i>blessed hope</i>; those who have it are <i>happy</i> in the sure prospect of that glory which shall be revealed.</p>
<p><i><b>The glorious appearing</b></i> — Και επιφανειαν της δοξης του μεγαλου Θεου και σωτηρος ἡμων Ιησου Χριστου. This clause, literally translated, is as follows: And the appearing of the glory of the great God, even our Saviour Jesus Christ. On this passage I must refer the reader to the ESSAY ON THE GREEK ARTICLE, by H. S. Boyd, Esq., appended to the notes on the Epistle to the Ephesians, where both the <i>structure</i> and <i>doctrine</i> of this passage are explained at large.</p>
<p>Some think that the <i>blessed hope</i> and <i>glorious appearing</i> mean the same thing; but I do not think so. The <i>blessed hope</i> refers simply to eternal glorification in general; the <i>glorious</i> <i>appearing</i>, to the resurrection of the body; for when Christ appears he will change this vile body, and make it like unto his GLORIOUS BODY, according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things to himself.
