<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Who gave himself for us</b></i> — Who gave his own life as a <i>ransom price</i> to redeem ours. This is evidently what is meant, as the words λυτρωσηται and λαον περιουσιον imply. The verb λυτροω signifies to <i>redeem</i> or <i>ransom by paying a price</i>, as I have often had occasion to observe; and περιουσιος signifies such a <i>peculiar</i> <i>property</i> as a man has in what he has <i>purchased</i> with <i>his own money.</i> Jesus gave his life for the world, and thus has purchased men unto himself; and, having purchased the <i>slaves</i> from their thraldom, he is represented as stripping them of their sordid vestments, <i>cleansing</i> and <i>purifying them unto himself</i> that they may become his <i>own servants</i>, and bringing them out of their <i>dishonourable</i> and <i>oppressive servitude</i>, in which they had no proper motive to <i>diligence</i> and could have no affection for the despot under whose authority they were employed. Thus redeemed, they now become his willing servants, and are <i>zealous of good works</i>-affectionately attached to that noble employment which is assigned to them by that Master whom it is an inexpressible honour to serve. This seems to be the allusion in the above verse.</p>
