<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>. <i><b>That the aged men be sober</b></i> â€” It is very likely that the word <i>aged</i> is to be taken here in its literal sense; that it refers to <i>advanced years</i>, and not to any <i>office</i> in the Church: the whole context seems to require this sense.</p>
<p>For an old man to be a drunkard, a light and trifling person, and a glutton, and not to be <i>sober, grave</i>, and <i>temperate</i>, is not only blamable but monstrous. Seneca has well said: <i>Luxuriosus</i> <i>adolescens peccat; senew insanit</i>. "A young man addicted to a life of luxury transgresses; an old man thus addicted runs mad."</p>
