Verse Titus 2:3. The aged women likewise — I believe elderly women are meant, and not deaconesses.That they be in behaviour — εν καταστηματι ιεροπρεπεις. That they be in their dress, gait, and general deportment, such as their holy calling requires; that they be not like the world, but like the Church, decent without, and adorned with holiness within.Not false accusers — Μη διαβολους. Not devils; we have had the same expression applied in the same way, 1 Timothy 3:11, where see the note.Not given to much wine — Μη οινῳ πολλῳ δεδουλωμενας·. Not enslaved by much wine, not habitual drunkards or tipplers; habit is a species of slavery. Both among the Greeks and Romans old women were generally reputed to be fond of much wine; hence the ancient scholiast on Homer, II. vi., speaking of old women, says: Χαιρει τῳ οινῳ ἡ ἡλικια αυτη·. At this age they delight in wine; which words Ovid seems to have translated literally: Vinosior aetas haec erat. It is likely, therefore, that it was customary among the elderly women, both Greeks and Romans, to drink much wine, and because it was inconsistent with that moderation, which the Gospel requires, the apostle forbids it: doubtless it was not considered criminal among them, because it was a common practice; and we know that the Greek philosophers and physicians, who denied wine to young persons, judged it to be necessary for the aged. 1 Timothy 5:23.
