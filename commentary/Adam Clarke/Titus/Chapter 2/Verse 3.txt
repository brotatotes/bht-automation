<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>. <i><b>The aged women likewise</b></i> — I believe <i>elderly</i> women are meant, and not <i>deaconesses</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That</b></i><b> they be </b><i><b>in behaviour</b></i> — εν καταστηματι ιεροπρεπεις. That they be in their <i>dress, gait</i>, and general <i>deportment</i>, such as their holy calling requires; that they be not like the world, but like the Church, decent without, and adorned with holiness within.</p>
<p><i><b>Not false accusers</b></i> — Μη διαβολους. <i>Not devils</i>; we have had the same expression applied in the same way, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span>, where see the note.</p>
<p><i><b>Not given to much wine</b></i> — Μη οινῳ πολλῳ δεδουλωμενας·. Not <i>enslaved</i> by much wine, not habitual drunkards or tipplers; <i>habit</i> is a species of <i>slavery</i>. Both among the Greeks and Romans old women were generally reputed to be fond of much wine; hence the ancient scholiast on Homer, II. vi., speaking of old women, says: Χαιρει τῳ οινῳ ἡ ἡλικια αυτη·. <i>At this age they delight in wine</i>; which words Ovid seems to have translated literally: <i>Vinosior</i> <i>aetas haec erat</i>. It is likely, therefore, that it was customary among the elderly women, both Greeks and Romans, to drink much wine, and because it was inconsistent with that <i>moderation</i>, which the Gospel requires, the apostle forbids it: doubtless it was not considered criminal among them, because it was a common practice; and we know that the Greek philosophers and physicians, who denied wine to young persons, judged it to be necessary for the aged. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23">1 Timothy 5:23</span>.</p>
