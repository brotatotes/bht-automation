<p>Verse 4. <i><b>That they may teach the young women to be sober</b></i> — That it was natural for the young to imitate the old will be readily allowed; it was therefore necessary that the old should be an example of godly living to the young. St. Jerome, taking it for granted that <i>drunkenness</i> and <i>impurity</i> are closely connected, asks this serious question: <i>Quomodo potest docere anus</i> <i>adolescentulas castitatem, cum, si ebrietatem vetulae mulieris</i> <i>adolescentula fuerit imitata, pudica esse non possit</i>? "How can an elderly woman teach young women chastity, when, if the young woman should imitate the drunkenness of the matron, it would be impossible for her to be chaste?"</p>
<p><i><b>To love their husbands</b></i> — The duties recommended in this and the following verses are so plain as to need no comment; and so absolutely necessary to the character of a wife, that no one deserves the name who does not live in the practice of them.</p>
