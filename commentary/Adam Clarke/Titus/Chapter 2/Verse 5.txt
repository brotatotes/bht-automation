<p>Verse 5. <i><b>Keepers at home</b></i> — οικουρους. A woman who spends much time in <i>visiting</i>, must neglect her family. The idleness, dirtiness, impudence, and profligacy of the children, will soon show how deeply criminal the mother was in rejecting the apostle's advice. Instead of οικουρους, <i>keepers of the house</i>, or <i>keepers at</i> <i>home</i>, ACD*EFG, and several of the <i>Itala</i>, have οικουργους, <i>workers at home</i>; not only <i>staying in the house</i> and <i>keeping</i> the <i>house</i>, but <i>working</i> in the <i>house</i>. A woman may keep the house very closely, and yet do little in it for the support or comfort of the family.</p>
<p><i><b>That the word of God be not blasphemed.</b></i> — The enemies of the Gospel are quick-eyed to spy out imperfections in its professors; and, if they find women professing Christianity living an irregular life, they will not fail to decry the Christian doctrine on this account: "Behold your boasted religion! it professes to reform all things, and its very professors are no better than others! Our heathenism is as good as your Christianity." These are cutting reproaches; and much they will have to answer for who give cause for these blasphemies.</p>
