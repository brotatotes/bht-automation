<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Young men - exhort to be sober-minded.</b></i> â€” Reformation should begin with the old; they have the authority, and they should give the example. The young of both sexes must also give an account of themselves to God; <i>sober-mindedness</i> in young men is a rare qualification, and they who have it not plunge into excesses and irregularities which in general sap the foundation of their constitution, bring on premature old age, and not seldom lead to a fatal end.</p>
