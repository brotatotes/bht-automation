<p>Verse 7. <i><b>In all things showing thyself a pattern</b></i> — As the apostle had given directions relative to the conduct of <i>old men</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>, of <i>old women</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>, of <i>young women</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:4">Titus 2:4</span>, and of <i>young men</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:6">Titus 2:6</span>, the words περι παντα, which we translate <i>in all things</i>, should be rather considered in reference to the above persons, and the behaviour required in them: <i>showing thyself a pattern of good</i> <i>works to all these persons</i>-being, in <i>sobriety, gravity,</i> <i>temperance</i>, what thou requirest others to be.</p>
<p><i><b>In doctrine</b></i><b> showing </b><i><b>uncorruptness</b></i> — Mixing nothing with the truth; taking nothing from it; adding nothing to it; and exhibiting it in all its connection, energy, and fulness.</p>
