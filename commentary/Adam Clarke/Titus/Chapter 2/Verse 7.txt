In all things showing thyself a pattern — As the apostle had given directions relative to the conduct of old men, Titus 2:2, of old women, Titus 2:3, of young women, Titus 2:4, and of young men, Titus 2:6, the words περι παντα, which we translate in all things, should be rather considered in reference to the above persons, and the behaviour required in them: showing thyself a pattern of good works to all these persons-being, in sobriety, gravity, temperance, what thou requirest others to be.In doctrine showing uncorruptness — Mixing nothing with the truth; taking nothing from it; adding nothing to it; and exhibiting it in all its connection, energy, and fulness.
