<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Sound speech</b></i> — λογον υγιη. <i>Sound</i> or <i>healing</i> <i>doctrine</i>. Human nature is in a state of <i>disease</i>; and the doctrine of the Gospel is calculated to remove the disease, and restore all to perfect <i>health</i> and <i>soundness</i>. All false doctrines leave men under the influence of this spiritual disease; the unadulterated doctrine of the Gospel alone can <i>heal</i> men.</p>
<p><i><b>He that is of the contrary part</b></i> — Whether this may refer to the Judaizing teachers in general, or to some <i>one</i> who might, by his false doctrine, have been disturbing the peace of the Churches in Crete, we cannot tell.</p>
<p><i><b>Having no evil thing to say of you.</b></i> — Against a person who is sound in his doctrine, and holy in his life, no evil can be justly alleged. He who reports evil of such a person must be confounded when brought to the test. Instead of περι υμων, <i>of</i> YOU, περι ημων, <i>of</i> US, is the reading of CDEFG, and about forty others; with both the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, Slavonic, Vulgate, Itala</i>, and several of the primitive <i>fathers</i>. This reading makes a better sense, and is undoubtedly genuine.</p>
