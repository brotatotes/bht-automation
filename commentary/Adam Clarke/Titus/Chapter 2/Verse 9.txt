<p>Verse 9. <b>Exhort </b><i><b>servants to be obedient</b></i> — The apostle refers to those who were <i>slaves</i>, and the <i>property</i> of their masters; even these are exhorted to be obedient ιδιοις δεσποταις, <i>to their own</i> <i>despots</i>, though they had no right over them on the ground of <i>natural justice</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Please</b></i><b> them </b><i><b>well in all</b></i><b> things</b>] They were to endeavour to do this in all things, though they could not hope to succeed in every thing.</p>
<p><i><b>Not answering again</b></i> — μη αντιλεγοντας. <i>Not contradicting</i> or <i>gainsaying</i>. This is no part of a servant's duty; a servant is hired to do his master's work, and this his master has a right to appoint.</p>
