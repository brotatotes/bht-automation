Verse 9. Exhort servants to be obedient — The apostle refers to those who were slaves, and the property of their masters; even these are exhorted to be obedient ιδιοις δεσποταις, to their own despots, though they had no right over them on the ground of natural justice.Please them well in all things] They were to endeavour to do this in all things, though they could not hope to succeed in every thing.Not answering again — μη αντιλεγοντας. Not contradicting or gainsaying. This is no part of a servant's duty; a servant is hired to do his master's work, and this his master has a right to appoint.
