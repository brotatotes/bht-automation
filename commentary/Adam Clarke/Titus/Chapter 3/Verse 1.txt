<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:1">Titus 3:1</span>. <i><b>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities</b></i>, c.] By <i>principalities</i>, αρχαις, we are to understand the Roman <i>emperors</i>, or the supreme civil powers in any place.</p>
<p>By <i>powers</i>, εξουσιαις, we are to understand the <i>deputies</i> of the emperors, such as <i>proconsuls</i>, c., and all such as are in authority-under the supreme powers wherever we dwell.

<p>This doctrine of obedience to the civil powers was highly necessary for the Cretans, who were reputed a people exceedingly jealous of their civil privileges, and ready to run into a state of insurrection when they suspected any attempt on the part of their rulers to infringe their liberties. <i>Suidas</i>, under the word ανεσειον, <i>they stirred up</i>, gives the following fragment: Οἱ δε Κρητες, φοβουμενοι μη τι τιμωριας τυχωσιν, ανεσειον τα πληθη, παρακαλουντες την εξ αιωνος παραδεδομενην ελευθεριαν διαφυλαττειν. "But the Cretans, fearing lest they should be punished, stirred up the populace, exhorting them that they should carefully preserve that liberty which they had received from their ancestors." What part of the history of Crete this refers to I cannot tell the words stand thus insulated in Suidas, without introduction or connection. To be jealous of our civil rights and privileges, and most strenuously to preserve them, is highly praiseworthy but to raise a public tumult to avoid merited chastisement, under pretence that our civil privileges are in danger, is not the part of <i>patriots</i> but insurgents. For such advice as that given here the known character of the Cretans is a sufficient reason: "They were ever liars, ferocious wild beasts, and sluggish gluttons." Such persons would feel little disposition to submit to the wholesome restraints of law.</p>
