<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Is subverted</b></i> — <i>Is turned out of the way</i> in which he may be saved, and consequently <i>sinneth</i>-enters into that way that leads to destruction.</p>
<p><i><b>Being condemned of himself.</b></i> — This refers to the Judaizing teacher, who maintained his party and opinions for filthy lucre's sake. He was conscious of his own insincerity; and that he proclaimed not his system from a conscientious love of truth, but from a desire to get his livelihood. Were the Church in all countries, whether established by law or unestablished, strictly scrutinized, multitudes of <i>heretics</i> of this kind would be found. And perhaps this is the only bad sense in which the word should be understood.</p>
