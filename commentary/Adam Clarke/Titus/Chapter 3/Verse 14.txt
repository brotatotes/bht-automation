<p>Verse 14. <i><b>And let others also learn to maintain good works</b></i> — There is something very remarkable in this expression. The words καλων εργων προιστασθαι, which we translate <i>to maintain good</i> <i>works</i>, occur also in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span>; and some think they mean, <i>to provide for our own, and the</i> <i>necessities of others, by working at some honest occupation</i>; and that this was necessary to be taught to the Cretans, <i>let</i> OURS <i>also</i> <i>learn</i>, c., who were naturally and practically <i>idle gluttons</i>. Kypke observed that the words mean,</p>
<p>1. To be employed in good works.</p>
<p>2. To defend good works, and to recommend the performance of them.</p>
<p>3. To promote and forward good works to be always first in them.</p>
<p><i><b>For necessary uses</b></i> — That they may be able at all times to help the Church of God, and those that are in want.</p>
<p><i><b>That they be not unfruitful.</b></i> — As they must be if they indulge themselves in their <i>idle, slothful</i> disposition.</p>
