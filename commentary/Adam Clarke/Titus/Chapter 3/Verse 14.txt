Verse 14. And let others also learn to maintain good works — There is something very remarkable in this expression. The words καλων εργων προιστασθαι, which we translate to maintain good works, occur also in Titus 3:8; and some think they mean, to provide for our own, and the necessities of others, by working at some honest occupation; and that this was necessary to be taught to the Cretans, let OURS also learn, c., who were naturally and practically idle gluttons. Kypke observed that the words mean,1. To be employed in good works.2. To defend good works, and to recommend the performance of them.3. To promote and forward good works to be always first in them.For necessary uses — That they may be able at all times to help the Church of God, and those that are in want.That they be not unfruitful. — As they must be if they indulge themselves in their idle, slothful disposition.
