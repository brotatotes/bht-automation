<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:15">Titus 3:15</span>. <i><b>All that are with me</b></i> — He means his companions in the ministry.</p>
<p><i><b>Salute thee.</b></i> — Wish thee well, and desire to be affectionately remembered to thee.</p>
<p><i><b>Greet them that love us in the faith,</b></i> — All that love us for Christ's sake, and all that are genuine Christians.</p>
<p><i><b>Grace</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>with you</b></i> — May the Divine favour be your portion for ever.</p>
<p>Some MSS. read, <i>The grace of the Lord be with you all</i>; others, <i>The grace of God be with you all</i>; and one, <i>Grace be with</i> THY <i>spirit</i>, as if the greeting was sent to <i>Titus</i> only, whereas the others send it to the <i>whole Church</i> at Crete.</p>
<p><i><b>Amen.</b></i> — This is wanting in ACD, and some others.</p>
<p>The <i>subscriptions</i> are, as usual, various. Those of the VERSIONS are the following: - </p>

<p>To the man Titus. - AETHIOPIC.</p>

<p>The Epistle to Titus is ended, who was the first bishop of the Church of the Cretans: and it was written from Nicopolis of Macedonia. - PHILOXENIAN SYRIAC.</p>
<p>There is no subscription in the VULGATE.</p>
<p>The MANUSCRIPTS are also various.</p>
<p>To Titus. - C, and <i>Clarom</i>.</p>
<p>That to Titus is completed: that to Philemon begins. - DEFG.</p>
<p>To Titus, written from Nicopolis. - A.</p>
<p>To Titus, written from Nicopolis of Macedonia. - of the Macedonians. - From Nicopolis, which is a province of Macedonia.</p>
<p>Paul the apostle's Epistle to Titus.</p>
<p>To Titus, ordained the first bishop of the Church of the Cretans: written from Nicopolis of Macedonia. - <i>Common Greek Text</i>.</p>
<p>To Titus, archbishop of Crete. - <i>One of the Vienna MSS., written</i> A. D. 1331.</p>
<p>THERE is not one of these subscriptions of any authority, and some of them are plainly ridiculous. We do not know that Titus was what we term <i>bishop</i>, much less that he was <i>ordained bishop of</i> <i>Crete</i>, as appointed to a particular see; and still less that he was the <i>first</i> bishop there. As to his being <i>archbishop</i>, that is the fiction of a time of deep darkness. That the epistle was written from <i>some place near to Nicopolis</i>, of Epirus, is very probable. That it was <i>not</i> written <i>at</i> Nicopolis is evident; and that this was <i>not</i> Nicopolis of <i>Macedonia</i> is also very probable. See the preface to this epistle for farther information on this point. And see a treatise by old Mr. Prynne entitled, The unbishoping of Timothy and Titus, 4to. Lond. 1636 and 1660, where, among many crooked things, there are some just observations.</p>
