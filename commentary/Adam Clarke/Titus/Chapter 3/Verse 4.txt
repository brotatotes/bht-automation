<p>Verse 4. <i><b>But after that the kindness and love of God</b></i> — By χρηστοτης we may understand the <i>essential goodness</i> of the Divine nature; that which is the <i>spring</i> whence all kindness, mercy, and beneficence proceed.</p>
<p><i>Love toward man </i>- φιλανθρωπια. <i>Philanthropy</i>. It is to be regretted that this attribute of the Divine nature, as it stands in relation to man, should have been entirely lost by a paraphrastical translation. <i>Philanthropy</i> is a character which God gives here to himself; while human nature exists, this must be a character of the Divine nature. <i>God loves man</i>; he <i>delighted</i> in the <i>idea</i> when formed in his own infinite mind, he formed man according to that idea, and <i>rejoiced</i> in the work of his hands; when man fell, the same <i>love</i> induced him to devise his redemption, and God the <i>Saviour</i> flows from God the <i>Philanthropist</i>. Where <i>love</i> is it will be active, and will show itself. So the philanthropy of God <i>appeared</i>, επεφανη, <i>it shone out</i>, in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, and in his giving his life for the life of the world.</p>
