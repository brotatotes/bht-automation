<p>Verse 5. <i><b>Not by works of righteousness</b></i> — Those who were foolish, disobedient, and deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, could not possibly have <i>works of righteousness</i> to plead; therefore, if saved at all, they must be saved by <i>mercy</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>; and see a discourse entitled, <i>Salvation by Faith proved</i>, 8vo., 1816, in which I have examined every system invented by man for his restoration to the Divine favour and image: and have demonstrated, by mere reason, their utter insufficiency to answer the end for which they have been invented; and have proved that the doctrine of salvation by faith is the only <i>rational</i> way of salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>By the washing of regeneration</b></i> — δια λουτρου παλιγγενεσιας. Undoubtedly the apostle here means <i>baptism</i>, the rite by which persons were admitted into the Church, and the <i>visible sign</i> of the cleansing, purifying influences of the Holy Spirit, which the apostle immediately subjoins. Baptism is only a <i>sign</i>, and therefore should never be separated from the <i>thing signified</i>; but it is a <i>rite</i> commanded by God himself, and therefore the <i>thing</i> <i>signified</i> should never be expected without it.</p>
<p>By <i>the renewing of the Holy Ghost</i> we are to understand, not only the profession of being bound to <i>live a new life</i>, but the grace that <i>renews the heart</i>, and enables us thus to live; so the <i>renewing influences</i> are here intended. Baptism changes nothing; the grace signified by it cleanses and purifies. They who think <i>baptism</i> to be <i>regeneration</i>, neither know the Scriptures nor the power of God; therefore they do greatly err.</p>
