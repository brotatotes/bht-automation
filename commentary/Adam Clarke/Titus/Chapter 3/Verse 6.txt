<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Which he shed on us abundantly</b></i> — ου εξεχεεν. <i>Which</i> <i>he poured out</i> on us, as the water was poured out on them in baptism, to which there is here a manifest allusion; but as this was sometimes only <i>sprinkled</i> on the person, the heavenly gift was <i>poured</i> out, not in <i>drops</i>, but πλουσιως, <i>richly</i>, in <i>great</i> <i>abundance</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Through Jesus Christ</b></i> — Baptism is nothing in itself; and there had been no outpouring of the Holy Spirit, had there been no <i>saving</i> and <i>atoning Christ</i>. Through him alone all good comes to the souls of men.</p>
