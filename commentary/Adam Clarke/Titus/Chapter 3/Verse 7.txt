<p>Verse 7. <i><b>That, being justified by his grace</b></i> — Being freed from sin; for the term <i>justification</i> is to be taken here as implying the whole work of the grace of Christ on the heart, in order to its preparation for eternal glory.</p>
<p><i><b>Should be made heirs</b></i> — The Gospel not only gave them the hope of an endless state of glory for their <i>souls</i>, but also of the <i>resurrection</i> and final <i>glorification</i> of their <i>bodies</i>; and they who were <i>children</i> of God were to be made <i>heirs</i> of his glory.
