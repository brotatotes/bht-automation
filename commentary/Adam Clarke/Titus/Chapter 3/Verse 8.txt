<p>Verse 8. <b>This is </b><i><b>a faithful saying</b></i> — πιστος ο λογος. <i>This is</i> <i>the true doctrine</i>; the doctrine that cannot fail.</p>
<p><i><b>And these things I will</b></i> — Και περι τουτων βουλομαι σε διαβεβαιουσθαι· <i>And I will</i>, or <i>desire, thee to maintain earnestly</i> <i>what concerns these points</i>. The things to which the apostle refers are those of which he had just been writing, and may be thus summed up:-</p>
<p>1. The ruined state of man, both in soul and body.</p>
<p>2. The infinite goodness of God which devised his salvation.</p>
<p>3. The manifestation of this goodness, by the incarnation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>4. The justification which they who believed received through his blood.</p>
<p>5. The mission of the Holy Spirit, and the purification of the heart by his influence.</p>
<p>6. The hope of the resurrection of the body, and the final glorification of both it and the soul through all eternity.</p>
<p>7. The necessity of obedience to the will of God, and of walking worthy of the vocation wherewith they had been called.</p>
<p>8. And all these points he wills him to press continually on the attention of believers; and to keep constantly in view, that all good comes from God's infinite kindness, by and through Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>They which have believed in God</b></i> — All Christians; for who can maintain good works but those who have the principle from which good works flow, for without faith it is impossible to please God.</p>
<p><i><b>These things are good and profitable</b></i> — They are good in themselves, and calculated to promote the well-being of men.</p>
