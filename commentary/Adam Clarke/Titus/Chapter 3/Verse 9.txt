Verse 9. Avoid foolish questions, and genealogies — In these the Jews particularly delighted; they abounded in the most frivolous questions; and, as they had little piety themselves, they were solicitous to show that they had descended from godly ancestors.Of their frivolous questions, and the answers given to them by the wisest and most reputable of their rabbins, the following is a specimen:-Rabbi Hillel was asked: Why have the Babylonians round heads? To which he answered: This is a difficult question, but I will tell the reason: Their heads are round because they have but little wit. But ridiculous and trifling as these are, they are little in comparison to those solemnly proposed and most gravely answered by those who are called the schoolmen. Here is a specimen, which I leave the reader to translate:-Utrum essent excrementa in Paradiso? Utrum sancti resurgent cum intestinis? Utrum, si deipara fuisset vir, potuisset esse naturalis parens Christi?These, with many thousands of others, of equal use to religion and common sense, may be found in their writings. See the Summa of Thomas Aquinas, passim. Might not the Spirit have these religious triflers in view, rather than the less ridiculous Jews? 1 Timothy 1:4; "2 Timothy 2:23".Contentions, and strivings about the law — Of legal contentions, and different and conflicting decisions about the meaning of particular rites and ceremonies, the Talmud is full.
