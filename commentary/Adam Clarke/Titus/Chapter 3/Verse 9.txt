<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Avoid foolish questions, and genealogies</b></i> — In these the Jews particularly delighted; they abounded in the most frivolous questions; and, as they had little piety <i>themselves</i>, they were solicitous to show that they had descended from <i>godly</i> <i>ancestors</i>.</p>
<p>Of their frivolous questions, and the answers given to them by the wisest and most reputable of their rabbins, the following is a specimen:-</p>
<p>Rabbi Hillel was asked: <i>Why have the Babylonians round heads</i>? To which he answered: This is a difficult question, but I will tell the reason: <i>Their heads are round because they have but</i> <i>little wit</i>. </p>
<p>But ridiculous and trifling as these are, they are little in comparison to those solemnly proposed and most gravely answered by those who are called the <i>schoolmen</i>. Here is a specimen, which I leave the reader to translate:-</p>
<p><i>Utrum essent excrementa in Paradiso? Utrum sancti resurgent</i> <i>cum intestinis? Utrum, si deipara fuisset vir, potuisset esse</i> <i>naturalis parens Christi</i>?</p>
<p>These, with many thousands of others, of equal use to religion and common sense, may be found in their writings. See the <i>Summa</i> of Thomas Aquinas, <i>passim</i>. Might not the Spirit have these religious triflers in view, rather than the less ridiculous Jews? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span>; <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:23">2 Timothy 2:23</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Contentions, and strivings about the law</b></i> — Of legal contentions, and different and conflicting decisions about the meaning of particular rites and ceremonies, the Talmud is full.</p>
