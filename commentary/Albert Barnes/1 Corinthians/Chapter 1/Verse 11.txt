<p style=" "><b>For it hath been declared unto me - </b>Of the contentions existing in the church at Corinth, it is evident that they had not informed him in the letter which they had sent; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>, compare the introduction. He had incidentally heard of their contentions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My brethren - </b>A token of affectionate regard, evincing his love for them, and his deep interest in their welfare, even when he administered a needed rebuke.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the house of Chloe - </b>Of the family of Chloe. It is most probable that Chloe was a member of the church at Corinth, some of whose family had been at Ephesus when Paul was, and had given him information of the state of things there. Who those members of her family were, is unknown. Grotius conjectures that they were Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:17">1 Corinthians 16:17</span>, who brought the letter of the church at Corinth to Paul. But of this there is no certain evidence; perhaps not much probability. If the information had been obtained from them, it is probable that it would have been put in the letter which they bore. The probability is that Paul had received this information before they arrived.</p>
