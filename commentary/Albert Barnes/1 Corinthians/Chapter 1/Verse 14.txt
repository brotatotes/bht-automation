I thank God ... - Why Paul did not himself baptize, see in 1 Corinthians 1:17. To him it was now a subject of grateful reflection that he had not done it. He had not given any occasion for the suspicion that he had intended to set himself up as a leader of a sect or party.But Crispus - Crispus had been the chief ruler of the synagogue at Corinth; Acts 18:8.And Gaius - Gaius resided at Corinth, and at his house Paul resided when he wrote the Epistle to the Romans; Romans 16:23. It is also possible that the Third Epistle of John was directed to this man; see 3 John 1:1. And if so, then probably Diotrephes 3 John 1:9, who is mentioned as one who loved “to have the pre-eminence,” had been one cause of the difficulties at Corinth. The other persons at Corinth had been probably baptized by Silas and Timothy.
