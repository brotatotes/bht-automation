<p style=" "><b>I thank God ... - </b>Why Paul did not himself baptize, see in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>. To him it was now a subject of grateful reflection that he had not done it. He had not given any occasion for the suspicion that he had intended to set himself up as a leader of a sect or party.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But Crispus - </b>Crispus had been the chief ruler of the synagogue at Corinth; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:8">Acts 18:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And Gaius - </b>Gaius resided at Corinth, and at his house Paul resided when he wrote the Epistle to the Romans; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>. It is also possible that the Third Epistle of John was directed to this man; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1">3 John 1:1</span>. And if so, then probably Diotrephes <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:9">3 John 1:9</span>, who is mentioned as one who loved “to have the pre-eminence,” had been one cause of the difficulties at Corinth. The other persons at Corinth had been probably baptized by Silas and Timothy.</p>
