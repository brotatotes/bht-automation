<p style=" "><b>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth - </b>For an account of the time and manner in which the church was established in Corinth, see the introduction, and the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1-17">Acts 18:1-17</span>. The church is called “the church of God,” because it has been founded by His agency, and was devoted to his service. It is worthy of remark, that although great disorders had been introduced into that church; though there were separations and erroneous doctrines; though there were some who gave evidence that they were not sincere Christians, yet the apostle had no hesitation in applying to them the name of a “church of God.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>To them that are sanctified - </b>To those who are made holy. This does not refer to the profession of holiness, but implies that they were in fact holy. The word means that they were separateD from the mass of pagans around them, and devoted to God and his cause. Though the word used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἡγιασμένοις</span></span> hēgiasmenois) has this idea of separation from the mass around them, yet it is separation on account of their being in fact, and not in profession merely, different from others, and truly devoted to God; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Christ Jesus - </b>That is, “by” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν</span></span> en the agency of Christ. It was by his authority, his power, and his Spirit, that they had been separated from the mass of pagans around them, and devoted to God; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Called to be saints - </b>The word “saints” does not differ materially from the word “sanctified” in the former part of the verse. It means those who are separateD from the world, and set apart to God as holy. The idea which Paul introduces here is, that they became such because they were called to be such. The idea in the former part of the verse is, that this was done “by Christ Jesus;” here he says that it was because they were called to this privilege. He doubtless means to say that it was not by any native tendency in themselves to holiness, but because God had called them to it. And this calling does not refer merely to an external invitation, but it was that which was made effectual in their case, or that on which the fact of their being saints could be predicated; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:9">1 Corinthians 1:9</span>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>; “Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span>; the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:6-7">Romans 1:6-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With all ... - </b>This expression shows:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That Paul had the same feelings of attachment to all Christians in every place; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That he expected that this Epistle would be read, not only by the church at Corinth, but also by other churches. That this was the uniform intention of the apostle in regard to his epistles, is apparent from other places; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:27">1 Thessalonians 5:27</span>; “I charge you by the Lord that this Epistle be read unto all the holy brethren;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>; “And when this Epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans.” It is evident that Paul expected that his epistles would obtain circulation among the churches; and it was morally certain that they would be soon transcribed, and be extensively read - the ardent feelings of Paul embraced all Christians in every nation. He knew nothing of the narrowness of exclusive attachment to a sect. His heart was full of love, and he loved, as we should, all who bore the Christian name, and who evinced the Christian spirit.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Call upon the name of Jesus Christ - </b>To call upon the name of any person, in Scripture language, is to call on the person himself; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span>; the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:12">Acts 4:12</span>. The expression “to call upon the name” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπικαλουμένοις</span></span> epikaloumenois, to invoke the name, implies worship, and prayer; and proves:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That the Lord Jesus is an object of worship; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That one characteristic of the early Christians, by which they were known and distinguished, was their calling upon the name of the Lord Jesus, or their offering worship to him. That it implies worship, see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>; and that the early Christians called on Christ by prayer, and were distinguished by that, see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>, and compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>, also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:21">Acts 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13">Acts 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22">2 Timothy 2:22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Both theirs and ours - </b>The Lord of all - both Jews and Gentiles - of all who profess themselves Christians, of whatever country or name they might have originally been. Difference of nation or birth gives no pre-eminence in the kingdom of Christ but all are on a level, having a common Lord and Saviour; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:5">Ephesians 4:5</span>.</p>
