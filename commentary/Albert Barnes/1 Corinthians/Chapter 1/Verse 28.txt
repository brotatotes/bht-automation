<p style=" "><b>And base things of the world - </b>Those things which by the world are esteemed ignoble. Literally, those which are not of noble, or illustrious birth <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὰ ἀγειῆ</span></span> ta ageiē.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Things which are despised - </b>Those which the world regards as objects of contempt; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:12">Mark 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:19">Luke 18:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:11">Acts 4:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yea - </b>The introduction of this word by the translators does nothing to illustrate the sense, but rather enfeebles it. The language here is a striking instance of Paul’s manner of expressing himself with great strength. He desires to convey in the strongest terms, the fact, that God had illustrated his plan by choosing the objects of least esteem among people. He is willing to admit all that could be said on this point. He says, therefore, that he had chosen the things of ignoble birth and rank - the base things of the world; but this did not fully express his meaning. He had chosen objects of contempt among people; but this was not strong enough to express his idea. He adds, therefore, that he had chosen those things which were absolutely nothing, which had no existence; which could not be supposed to influence him in his choice.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And things which are not - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὰ μὴ ὄντα</span></span> ta mē onta. That which is nothing; which is worthless; which has no existence; those flyings which were below contempt itself; and which, in the estimation of the world, were passed by as having no existence; as not having sufficient importance to be esteemed worthy even of the slight notice which is implied in contempt. For a man who despises a thing must at least notice it, and esteem it worth some attention. But the apostle here speaks of things beneath even that slight notice; as completely and totally disregarded, as having no existence. The language here is evidently that of hyperbole (compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:25">John 21:25</span>). It was a figure of speech common in the East, and not unusual in the sacred writings; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:17">Isaiah 40:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">All nations before him are as nothing.</p>
<p style=" ">And they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity.</p>
<p style=" ">See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span>, “God, who - calleth those things which be not, as though they were.” This language was strongly expressive of the estimate which the Jews fixed on the Gentiles, as being a despised people, as being in fact no people; a people without laws, and organization, and religion, and privileges; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:10">Hosea 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:23">Hosea 2:23</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Rom 9:25</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:10">1 Peter 2:10</span>. “When a man of rank among the Hindus speaks of low-caste persons, of notorious profligates, or of those whom he despises, he calls them “alla-tha-varkal,” that is, “those who are not.” The term does not refer to life or existence, but to a quality or disposition, and is applied to those who are vile and abominable in all things. “My son, my son, go not among them ‘who are not.’” “Alas! alas! those people are all alla-tha-varkal.” When wicked men prosper, it is said, “this is the time for those ‘who are not.’” “Have you heard that those ‘who are not’ are now acting righteously?” Vulgar and indecent expressions are also called, “words that are not.” “To address men in the phrase ‘are not,’ is provoking beyond measure” - Roberts, as quoted in Bush’s <i>Illustrations of Scripture</i>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To bring to naught - </b>To humble and subdue. To show them how vain and impotent they were.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Things that are - </b>Those who on account of their noble birth, high attainments, wealth, and rank placed a high estimate on themselves and despised others.</p>
