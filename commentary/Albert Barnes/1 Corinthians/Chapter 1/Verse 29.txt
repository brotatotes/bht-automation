<p style=" "><b>That no flesh - </b>That no person; no class of people. The word “flesh” is often thus used to denote human beings. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:22">Matthew 24:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:6">Luke 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:24">1 Peter 1:24</span>; etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Should glory - </b>Should boast; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:27">Romans 3:27</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In his presence - </b>Before him. That man should really have nothing of which to boast; but that the whole scheme should be adapted to humble and subdue him. On these verses we may observe:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) That it is to be expected that the great mass of Christian converts will be found among those who are of humble life - and it may be observed also, that true virtue and excellence; sincerity and amiableness; honesty and sincerity, are usually found there also.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) That while the mass of Christians are found there, there are also those of noble birth, and rank, and wealth, who become Christians. The aggregate of those who from elevated ranks and distinguished talents have become Christians, has not been small. It is sufficient to refer to such names as Pascal, and Bacon, and Boyle, and Newton, and Locke, and Hale, and Wilberforce, to show that religion can command the homage of the most illustrious genius and rank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) The reasons why those of rank and wealth do not become Christians, are many and obvious:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4) The gospel is designed to produce humility, and to place all people on a level in regard to salvation. There is no royal way to the favor of God. No monarch is saved because he is a monarch; no philosopher because he is a philosopher; no rich man because he is rich; no poor man because he is poor. All are placed on a level. All are to be saved in the same way. All are to become willing to give the entire glory to God. All are to acknowledge him as providing the plan, and as furnishing the grace that is needful for salvation. God’s design is to bring down the pride of man, and to produce everywhere a willingness to acknowledge him as the fountain of blessings and the God of all.</p>
