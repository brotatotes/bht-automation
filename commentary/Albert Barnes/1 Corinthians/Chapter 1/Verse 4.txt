<p style=" "><b>I thank my God ... - </b>No small part of this Epistle is occupied with reproofs for the disorders which had arisen in the church at Corinth. Before proceeding, however, to the specific statement of those disorders (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span> ff), the apostle commends them for the attainments which they had really made in divine knowledge, and thus shows that he was disposed to concede to them all that he could. It was no part of the disposition of Paul to withhold commendation where it was due. On the contrary, as he was disposed to be faithful in reproving the errors of Christians, he was no less disposed to commend them when it could be done; compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>. A willingness to commend those who do well is as much in accordance with the gospel, as a disposition to reprove where it is deserved; and a minister, or a parent, may frequently do as decided good by judicious commendation as by reproof, and much more than by fault-finding and harsh crimination.</p>
<p style=" "><b>On your behalf - </b>In respect to you; that God has conferred these favors on you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the grace of God - </b>On account of the favors which God has bestowed on you through the Lord Jesus. Those favors are specified in the following verses. For the meaning of the word “grace,” see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>.</p>
