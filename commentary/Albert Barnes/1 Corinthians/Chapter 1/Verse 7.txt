<p style=" "><b>So that - </b>God has so abundantly endowed you with his favors.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye come behind - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὑστερεῖσθαι</span></span> hustereisthai. You are not missing, or deficient. The word is usually applied to destitution, want, or poverty; and the declaration here is synonymous with what he had said, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5">1 Corinthians 1:5</span>, that they abounded in everything.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In no gift - </b>In no favor, or gracious endowment. The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χάρισμα</span></span> charisma, does not refer necessarily to extraordinary and miraculous endowments, but includes also all the kindnesses of God toward them in producing peace of mind, constancy, humility, etc. And the apostle meant evidently to say that they possessed, in rich abundance, all those endowments which were bestowed on Christians.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Waiting for - </b>Expecting, or looking for this coming with glad and anxious desire. This was, certainly, one of the endowments to which he referred, to wit, that they had grace given them earnestly to desire, and to wait for the second appearing of the Lord Jesus. An earnest wish to see him, and a confident expectation and firm belief that he will return, is an evidence of a high state of piety. It demands strong faith, and it will do much to elevate the feelings above the world, and to keep the mind in a state of peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The coming ... - </b>Greek The revelation - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὴν ἀποκάλυψιν</span></span> tēn apokalupsin - the manifestation of the Son of God. That is, waiting for his return to judge the world, and for his approbation of his people on that Day. The earnest expectation of the Lord Jesus became one of the marks of early Christian piety. This return was promised by the Saviour to his anxious disciples, when he was about to leave them; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span>. The promise was renewed when he ascended to heaven; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>. It became the settled hope and expectation of Christians that he would return; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:12">2 Peter 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>. And with the earnest prayer that be would quickly come, John closes the volume of inspiration; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20-21">Revelation 22:20-21</span>.</p>
