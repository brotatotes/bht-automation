<p style=" ">In regard to the design of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:0">1 Corinthians 10:0</span>, commentators have not been agreed. Some have supposed that there is no connection with the preceding, but that this is a digression. The ancient Greek expositors generally, and some of the moderns, as Grotius, supposed that the connection was this: Paul had in the previous chapter described himself as mortifying his flesh, and keeping his body under, that he might gain the prize. In this chapter they suppose that his object is to exhort the Corinthians to do the same; and that in order to do this he admonishes them not to be lulled into security by the idea of the many spiritual gifts which had been conferred upon them. This admonition he enforces by the example of the Jews, who had been highly favored also, but who had nevertheless been led into idolatry. This is also the view of Doddridge, Calvin, and others. Macknight regards the chapter as an independent discussion of the three questions, which he supposes had been submitted to Paul:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Whether they might innocently go with their friends into the pagan temples, and partake of the feasts which were there made in honor of the idol.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Whether they might buy and eat meat sold in the markets which had been sacrificed to idols.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Whether, when invited to the houses of the pagans, they might partake of the meat sacrificed to idols, and which was set before them as a common meal - I regard this chapter as having a very close connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1-13">1 Corinthians 8:1-13</span>. In the close of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1-13">1 Corinthians 8:1-13</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:13">1 Corinthians 10:13</span>, Paul had stated, when examining the question whether it was right to eat meat offered in sacrifice to idols, that the grand principle on which he acted, and on which they should act, was that of “self-denial.” To illustrate this he employs <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:0">1 Corinthians 9:0</span>, by showing how “he” acted on it in reference to a maintenance; showing that it was this principle that led him to decline a support to which he was really entitled. Having illustrated that, he returns in this chapter to the subject which he was discussing in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1-13">1 Corinthians 8:1-13</span>; and the design of this chapter is further to explain and enforce the sentiments advanced there, and to settle some other inquiries pertaining to the same general subject.</p>
<p style=" ">The first point, therefore, on which he insists is, “the danger of relapsing into idolatry” - a danger which would arise should they be in the habit of frequenting the temples of idols, and of partaking of the meats offered in sacrifice; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:1-24">1 Corinthians 10:1-24</span>. Against this he had cautioned them in general, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:9-12">1 Corinthians 8:9-12</span>. This danger he now sets forth by a variety of illustrations. the first shows them that the Jews had been highly favored, had been solemnly consecrated to Moses and to God, and had been under the divine protection and guidance <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:1-4">1 Corinthians 10:1-4</span>; yet that this had not kept them from the displeasure of God when they sinned; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:5">1 Corinthians 10:5</span>. He shows that notwithstanding their privileges, they had indulged in inordinate desires <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:6">1 Corinthians 10:6</span>; that they had become idolaters <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:7">1 Corinthians 10:7</span> that they had been guilty of licentiousness <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:8">1 Corinthians 10:8</span>; that they had tempted their leader and guide <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:9">1 Corinthians 10:9</span>; that they had complained <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:10">1 Corinthians 10:10</span>; and that, as a consequence of this, many of them had been destroyed.</p>
<p style=" ">In view of all this, Paul cautions the Corinthians not to be self-confident or to feel secure; and not to throw themselves in the way of temptation by partaking of the feasts of idolatry; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:12-14">1 Corinthians 10:12-14</span>. This danger he further illustrates <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:15">1 Corinthians 10:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:24">1 Corinthians 10:24</span> by showing that if they partook of those sacrifices, they in fact became identified with the worshippers of idols. This he proved by showing that in the Christian communion, those who partook of the Lord’s Supper were identified with Christians <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16-17">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</span>; that in the Jewish sacrifices the same thing occurred, and that those who partook of them were regarded as Jews, and as worshippers of the same God with them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:18">1 Corinthians 10:18</span>; and that the same thing must occur, in the suture of the case, by partaking of the sacrifices offered to idols. They were really partaking of that which had been offered to devilS; and against any such participation Paul would solemnly admonish them; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:19-22">1 Corinthians 10:19-22</span>. Going on the supposition, therefore, that there was nothing wrong in itself in partaking of the meat that had been thus killed in sacrifice, yet Paul says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>, that it was not expedient thus to expose themselves to danger; and that the grand principle should be to seek the comfort and edification of others; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:24">1 Corinthians 10:24</span>. Paul thus strongly and decisively admonishes them not to enter the temples of idols to partake of those feasts; not to unite with idolaters in their celebration; not to endanger their piety by these temptations.</p>
<p style=" ">There were, however, two other questions on the subject which it was important to decide, and which had probably been submitted to him in the letter which they had sent for counsel and advice. The first was, whether it was right to purchase and eat the meat which had been sacrificed, and which was exposed indiscriminately with other meat in the market; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:25">1 Corinthians 10:25</span>. To this Paul replies, that as no evil could result from this, as it could not be alleged that they purchased it as meat sacrificed to idols, and as all that the earth contained belonged to the Lord, it was not wrong to purchase and to use it. Yet if even this was pointed out to them as having been sacrificed to idols, he then cautioned them to abstain from it; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:28">1 Corinthians 10:28</span>. The other question was, whether it was right for them to accept the invitation of a pagan, and to partake of meat then that had been offered in sacrifice; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:27">1 Corinthians 10:27</span>. To this a similar answer was returned. The general principle was, that no questions were to be asked in regard to what was set before them; but if the food was expressly pointed out as having been offered in sacrifice, then to partake of it would be regarded as a public recognition of the idol; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:28-30">1 Corinthians 10:28-30</span>. Paul then concludes the discussion by stating the noble rule that is to guide in all this: that everything is to be done to the glory of God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:31">1 Corinthians 10:31</span>; and that the great effort of the Christian should be so to act in all things as to honor his religion, as not to lead others into sin; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:32-33">1 Corinthians 10:32-33</span>.</p>
