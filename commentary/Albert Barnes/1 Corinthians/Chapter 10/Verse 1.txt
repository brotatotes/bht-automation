<p style=" "><b>Moreover, brethren - </b>But, or now (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> de). This verse, with the following illustrations <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:1-4">1 Corinthians 10:1-4</span>, is properly connected in Paul’s argument with the statements which he had made in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>, etc., and is designed to show the danger which would result from their partaking of the feasts that were celebrated in honor of idols. It is not improbable, as Mr. Locke supposes, that the Corinthians might have urged that they were constantly solicited by their pagan friends to attend those feasts; that in their circumstances it was scarcely possible to avoid it; that there could be no danger of their relapsing into idolatry; and their doing so could not be offensive to God, since they were known to be Christians; since they had been baptized, and purified from sin; since they were devoted to his service; since they knew that an idol was nothing in the world; and since they had been so highly favored, as the people of God, with so many extraordinary endowments, and were so strongly guarded against the possibility of becoming idolaters. To meet these considerations, Paul refers them to the example of the ancient Jews. They also were the people of God. They had been solemnly dedicated to Moses and to God. They had been especially favored with spiritual food from heaven, and with drink miraculously, poured from the rock. Yet notwithstanding this, they had forgotten God, had become idolaters, and had been destroyed. By their example, therefore, Paul would warn the Corinthians against a similar danger.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I would not that ye should be ignorant - </b>A large part of the church at Corinth were Gentiles. It could hardly be supposed that they were well informed respecting the ancient history of the Jews. Probably they had read these things in the Old Testament; but they might not have them distinctly in their recollection. Paul brings them distinctly before their minds, as an illustration and an admonition. The sense is, “I would not have you unmindful or forgetful of these things; I would have you recollect this case, and suffer their example to influence your conduct. I would not have you suppose that even a solemn consecration to God and the possession of distinguished tokens of divine favor are a security against the danger of sin, and even apostasy; since the example of the favored Jews shows that even in such circumstances there is danger.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>How that all our fathers - </b>That is, the fathers of the Jewish community; the fathers of us who are Jews. Paul speaks here as being himself a Jew, and refers to his own ancestors as such. The word “all” here seems to be introduced to give emphasis to the fact that even those who were destroyed <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:5">1 Corinthians 10:5</span> also had this privilege. It could not be pretended that they had not been devoted to God, since all of them had been thus consecrated professedly to his service. The entire Jewish community which Moses led forth from Egypt had thus been devoted to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Were under the cloud - </b>The cloud - the “Shechinah” - the visible symbol of the divine presence and protection that attended them out of Egypt. This went before them by day as a cloud to guide them, and by night it became a pillar of fire to give them light; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:21-22">Exodus 13:21-22</span>. In the dangers of the Jews, when closely pressed by the Egyptians, it went beHinD them, and became dark to the Egyptians, but light to the Israelites, thus constituting a defense; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:20">Exodus 14:20</span>. In the wilderness, when traveling through the burning desert, it seems to have been expanded over the camp as a covering, and a defense from the intense rays of a burning sun; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:34">Numbers 10:34</span>, “And the cloud of Jehovah was upon them by day;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:14">Numbers 14:14</span>, “Thy cloud standeth over them.” To this fact the apostle refers here. It was a symbol of the divine favor and protection; comp <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:5">Isaiah 4:5</span>. It was a guide, a shelter, and a defense. The Jewish Rabbis say that “the cloud encompassed the camp of the Israelites as a wall encompasses a city, nor could the enemy come near them.” Pirke Eleazer, chapter 44, as quoted by Gill. The probability is, that the cloud extended over the whole camp of Israel, and that to those at. a distance it appeared as a pillar.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And all passed through the sea - </b>The Red Sea, under the guidance of Moses, and by the miraculous interposition of God; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:21-22">Exodus 14:21-22</span>. This was also a proof of the divine protection and favor, and is so adduced by the apostle. His object is to accumulate the evidences of the divine favor to them, and to show that they had as many securities against apostasy as the Corinthians had, on which they so much relied.</p>
