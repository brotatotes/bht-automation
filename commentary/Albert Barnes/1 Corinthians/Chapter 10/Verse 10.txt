<p style=" "><b>Neither murmur ye - </b>Do not repine at the allotments of Providence, or complain of His dealings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As some of them also murmured - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:2">Numbers 14:2</span>. The ground of their complaining was, that they had been disappointed; that they had been brought out of a land of plenty into a wilderness of want; and that instead of being conducted at once to the land of promise, they were left to perish in the desert. They therefore complained of their leaders, and proposed to return again into Egypt.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And were destroyed of the destroyer - </b>That is, they were doomed to die in the wilderness without seeing the land of Canaan; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:29">Exodus 14:29</span>. The “destroyer” here is understood by many to mean the “angel of death,” so often referred to in the Old Testament, and usually called by the Jews “Sammael.” The work of death, however, is attributed to an angel in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:23">Exodus 12:23</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:28">Hebrews 11:28</span>. It was customary for the Hebrews to regard most human events as under the direction of angels. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>, he is described as he “that had the power of death;” compare the Book of Wisdom 18:22, 25. The simple idea here, however, is, that they died for their sin, and were not permitted to enter the promised land,</p>
