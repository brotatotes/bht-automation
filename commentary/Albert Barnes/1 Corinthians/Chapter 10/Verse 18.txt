<p style=" "><b>Behold Israel - </b>Look at the Jews. The design here is to illustrate the sentiment which he was establishing, by a reference to the fact that among the Jews those who partook of the same sacrifices were regarded as being one people, and as worshipping one God. So, if they partook of the sacrifices offered to idols, they would be regarded also as being fellow-worshippers of idols with them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>After the flesh - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:1">Romans 4:1</span>. The phrase “after the flesh” is designed to denote the Jews who were not converted to Christianity; the natural descendants of Israel, or Jacob.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are not they which eat of the sacrifices - </b>A portion of the sacrifices offered to God was eaten by the offerer, and another portion by the priests. Some portions of the animal, as the fat, were burnt; and the remainder, unless it was a holocaust, or whole burnt-offering, was then the property of the priests who had officiated, or of the persons who had brought it; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:13">Exodus 29:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:22">Exodus 29:22</span>; Lev, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+3:4">Leviticus 3:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+3:10">Leviticus 3:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+3:15">Leviticus 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:9">Leviticus 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+7:3-4">Leviticus 7:3-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+8:26">Leviticus 8:26</span>. The right shoulder and the breast was the part which was assigned to the priests; the remainder belonged to the offerer.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Partakers of the altar - </b>Worshippers of the same God. They are united in their worship, and are so regarded. And in like manner, if you partake of the sacrifices offered to idols, and join with their worshippers in their temples, you will be justly regarded as “united” with them in their worship, and partaking with them in their abominations.</p>
