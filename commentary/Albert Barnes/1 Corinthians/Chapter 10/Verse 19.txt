<p style=" "><b>What say I then? - </b>This is in the present tense; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τί οὖν φημι</span></span> ti oun phēmi, what do I say? What is my meaning? What follows from this? Do I mean to say that an idol is anything; that it has a real existence? Does my reasoning lead to that conclusion; and am I to be understood as affirming that an idol is of itself of any consequence? It must be recollected that the Corinthian Christians are introduced by Paul <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4">1 Corinthians 8:4</span> as saying that they knew that an idol was nothing in the world. Paul did not directly contradict that; but his reasoning had led him to the necessity of calling the propriety of their attending on the feasts of idols in question; and he introduces the matter now by asking these questions, thus leading the mind to it rather than directly affirming it at once. “Am I in this reasoning to be understood as affirming that an idol is anything, or that the meat there offered differs from other meat? No; you know, says Paul, that this is not my meaning. I admit that an idol in itself is nothing; but I do not admit, therefore, that it is right for you to attend in their temples; for though the “idol” itself - the block of wood or stone - is nothing, yet the offerings are really made to devils; and I would not have you engage in such a service;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20-21">1 Corinthians 10:20-21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That the idol is anything? - </b>That the block of wood or stone is a real living object of worship, to be dreaded or loved? See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4">1 Corinthians 8:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything? - </b>Or that the meat which is offered “differs” from that which is not offered; that the mere act of offering it changes its qualities? I do not admit or suppose this.</p>
