<p style=" "><b>For the earth is the Lordâ€™s - </b>This is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+24:1">Psalms 24:1</span>. The same sentiment is also found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+50:11">Psalms 50:11</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:14">Deuteronomy 10:14</span>. It is here urged as a reason why it; is right to partake of the meat offered in the market. It all belongs to the Lord. It does not really belong to the idol, even though it has been offered to it. It may, therefore, be partaken of as his gift, and should be received with gratitude.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the fulness thereof - </b>All that the earth produces belongs to Him. He causes if to grow; and He has given it to be food for man; and though it may have been devoted to an idol, yet its nature is not changed. It is still the gift of God; still the production of His hand; still the fruit of His goodness and love.</p>
