<p style=" "><b>But if any man - </b>If any fellow guest; any scrupulous fellow Christian who may be present. That the word “any” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span> tis) refers to a fellow guest seems evident; for it is not probable that the host would point out any part of the food on his own table, of the lawfulness of eating which he would suppose there was any doubt. Yet there might be present some scrupulous fellow Christian who would have strong doubts of the propriety of partaking of the food, and who would indicate it to the other guests.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For his sake that showed it - </b>Do not offend him; do not lead him into sin;, do not pain and wound his feelings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And for conscience’ sake - </b>Eat not, out of respect to the conscientious scruples of him that told thee that it had been offered to idols. The word “conscience” refers to the conscience of the informer <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:29">1 Corinthians 10:29</span>; still he should make it a matter of conscience not to wound his weak brethren, or lead them into sin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the earth is the Lord’s ... - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:26">1 Corinthians 10:26</span>. These words are missing in many mss. (see Mill’s Greek Testament), and in the Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and Arabic versions; and are omitted by Griesbach. Grotius says that they should be omitted. There might easily have been a mistake in transcribing them from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:26">1 Corinthians 10:26</span>. The authority of the mss., however, is in favor of retaining them; and they are quoted by the Greek fathers and commentators. If they are to be retained, they are to be interpreted, probably, in this sense; “There is no “necessity” that you should partake of this food. All things belong to God; and he has made ample provision for your needs without subjecting you to the necessity of eating this. Since this is the case, it is best to regard the scruples of those who have doubts of the propriety of eating this food, and to abstain.”</p>
