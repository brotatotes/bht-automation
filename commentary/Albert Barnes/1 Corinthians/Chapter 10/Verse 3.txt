<p style=" "><b>And did all eat the same spiritual meat - </b>That is, “manna.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:15">Exodus 16:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:35">Exodus 16:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:15">Nehemiah 9:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:20">Nehemiah 9:20</span>. The word meat here is used in the old English sense of the word, to denote “food” in general. They lived on “manna.” The word “spiritual” here is evidently used to denote that which was given by the Spirit, or by God; that which was the result of his miraculous gift, and which was not produced in the ordinary way, and which was not the gross food on which people are usually supported. It had an excellency and value from the fact that it was the immediate gift of God, and is thus called “angels food.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:25">Psalms 78:25</span>. It is called by Josephus “divine and extraordinary food.” Ant. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+3:1">Psalms 3:1</span>. In the language of the Scriptures, that which is distinguished for excellence, which is the immediate gift of God, which is unlike that which is gross and of earthly origin, is called “spiritual,” to denote its purity, value, and excellence. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1">1 Corinthians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:44">1 Corinthians 15:44</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:46">1 Corinthians 15:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>. The idea of Paul here is, that all the Israelites were nourished and supported in this remarkable manner by food given directly by God; that they all had thus the evidence of the divine protection and favor, and were all under his care.</p>
