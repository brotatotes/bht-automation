<p style=" "><b>Give none offence - </b>Be inoffensive; that is, do not act so as to lead others into sin; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither to the Jews ... - </b>To no one, though they are the foes of God or strangers to him. To the Jews be inoffensive, because they think that the least approach to idol worship is to be abhorred. Do not so act as to lead them to think that you connive at or approve idol worship, and so as to prejudice them the more against the Christian religion, and lead them more and more to oppose it. In other words, do not attend the feasts in honor of idols.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor to the Gentiles - </b>Greek “Greeks.” To the pagans who are unconverted. They are attached to idol worship. They seek every way to justify themselves in it. Do not countenance them in it, and thus lead them into the sin of idolatry.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor to the church of God - </b>To Christians. Many of them are weak. They may not be as fully instructed as you are. Your example would lead them into sin. Abstain, therefore, from things which, though they are in themselves strictly “lawful,” may yet be the occasion of leading others into sin, and endangering their salvation.</p>
