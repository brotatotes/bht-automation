<p style=" "><b>Now these things - </b>The judgments inflicted on them by God for their sins.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Were our examples - </b>Greek: “types” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τύποι</span></span> tupoi). Margin, “figures.” They were not designed to be types of us, but they are to be held up as furnishing an admonition to us, or a warning that we do not sin in the same way. The same God directs our affairs that ordered theirs; and if we sin as they did, we also must expect to be punished, and excluded from the favor of God, and from heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lust after evil things - </b>Desire those things which are forbidden, and which would be injurious. They lusted after flesh, and God granted them their desires, and the consequence was a plague, and the destruction of multitudes <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+11:4">Exodus 11:4</span>. So Paul infers that the Corinthian Christians should not lust after, or desire the meat offered in sacrifice to idols, lest it should lead them also to sin and ruin.</p>
