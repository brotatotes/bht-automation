<p style=" "><b>Neither be ye idolaters - </b>This caution is evidently given in view of the danger to which they would be exposed if they partook of the feasts that were celebrated in honor of idols in their temples. The particular idolatry which is referred to here is, the worship of the golden calf that was made by Aaron <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:1-5">Exodus 32:1-5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As it is written - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:6">Exodus 32:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The people sat down to eat and to drink - </b>To worship the golden calf. They partook of a feast in honor of that idol. I have already observed that it was common to keep a feast in honor of an idol, and that the food which was eaten on such an occasion was mainly the meat which had been offered in sacrifice to it. This instance was particularly to the apostle’s purpose, as he was cautioning the Corinthians against the danger of participating in the feasts celebrated in the pagan temples.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And rose up to play - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παίζειν</span></span> paizein). The Hebrew word used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:6">Exodus 32:6</span> (<span class="_800000">צחק</span> tsaachaq) means “to laugh, to sport, to jest, to mock, to insult” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:9">Genesis 21:9</span>; and then to engage in dances accompanied with music, in honor of an idol. This was often practiced, as the worship of idols was celebrated with songs and dances. This is particularly affirmed of this instance of idol worship <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:19">Exodus 32:19</span>; and this was common among ancient idolaters; and this mode of worship was even adopted by David before the ark of the Lord; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Sa 6:5</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+13:8">1 Chronicles 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+15:29">1 Chronicles 15:29</span>. All that the word “to play” here necessarily implies is, that of choral songs and dances, accompanied with revelry in honor of the idol. It was, however, the fact that such worship was usually accompanied with much licentiousness; but that is not necessarily implied in the use of the word. Most of the oriental dances were grossly indecent and licentious, and the word here may be designed to include such indelicacy and licentiousness.</p>
