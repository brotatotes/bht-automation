<p style=" ">The first verse in this chapter properly belongs to the preceding, and is the conclusion of the discussion which the apostle had been carrying on in that and the previous chapters. It has been improperly separated from that chapter, and in reading should be read in connection with it. The remainder of the chapter is properly divided into two parts:</p>
<p style=" ">I. In regard to the first. it seems probable that some of the women who, on pretence of being inspired, had prayed or prophesied in the Corinthian church, had cast off their veils after the manner of the pagan priestesses. This indecent and improper custom the apostle reproves. He observes, therefore, that the pre-eminence belongs to man over the woman, even as pre-eminence belonged to Christ over the man; that it was a dishonor to Christ when a man prayed or prophesied with his head covered, and in like manner it was regarded everywhere as dishonorable and improper for a woman to lay aside the appropriate symbol of her sex, and the emblem of subordination, and to be uncovered in the presence of the man <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3-5">1 Corinthians 11:3-5</span>; that if a woman was not veiled, if she laid aside the appropriate emblem of her sex and of her subordinate condition, she might as well part with her hair, which all knew would be dishonorable and improper <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:6">1 Corinthians 11:6</span>; that the woman had been created for a subordinate station, and should observe it <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:7-9">1 Corinthians 11:7-9</span>; that she should have power on her head because of the angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:10">1 Corinthians 11:10</span>; and yet, lest this should depress her, and seem to convey the idea of her utter inferiority and unimportance, he adds, that in the plan of salvation they are in many respects on an equality with the man, that the same plan was adapted to both, that the same blessings are appointed for both sexes, and the same high hopes are held out to both <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:11-12">1 Corinthians 11:11-12</span>; and that nature on this subject was a good instructor, and showed that it was uncomely for a woman to pray with her head uncovered, that her hair had been given her for an ornament and for beauty, and that, as it would be as improper for her to remove her veil as to cut off her hair, nature itself required that this symbol of her subordination should be laid aside in public, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:13-16">1 Corinthians 11:13-16</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">II. Next, as to the irregularities in the observance of the Lord’s supper, the apostle observes <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:17">1 Corinthians 11:17</span>, that he could not commend them for what he was about to say. There had been and there were irregularities among them, which it was his duty to reprove. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:18-22">1 Corinthians 11:18-22</span>, he states what those irregularities were. He then <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-26">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</span> states the true nature and design of the Lord’s Supper, as it was very evident that they had not understood it, but supposed it was a common feast, such as they had been accustomed to observe in honor of idols. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:27-29">1 Corinthians 11:27-29</span>, he states the consequences of observing this ordinance in an improper manner, and the proper way of approaching it; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30-32">1 Corinthians 11:30-32</span> observes that their improper mode of observing it was the cause of the punishment which many of them had experienced. He then concludes by directing them to celebrate the Lord’s Supper “together;” to eat at home when they were hungry; and not to abuse the Lord’s Supper by making it an occasion of feasting; and assures them that the other matters of irregularity he would set in order when be should come among them.</p>
