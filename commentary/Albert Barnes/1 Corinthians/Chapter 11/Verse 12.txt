<p style=" "><b>As the woman is of the man - </b>In the original creation, she was formed from the man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So is the man also by the woman - </b>Is born of the woman, or descended from her. The sexes are dependent on each other, and should therefore cultivate an indissoluble union.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But all things of God - </b>All things were created and arranged by him. This expression seems designed to suppress any spirit of complaint or dissatisfaction with this arrangement; to make the woman contented in her subordinate station, and to make the man humble by the consideration that it is all owing to the appointment of God. The woman should therefore be contented, and the man should not assume any improper superiority, since the whole arrangement and appointment is of God.</p>
