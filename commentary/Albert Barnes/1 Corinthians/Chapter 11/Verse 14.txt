<p style=" "><b>Doth not even nature itself - </b>The word nature (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φύσις</span></span> phusis) denotes evidently that sense of propriety which all men have, and which is expressed in any prevailing or universal custom. That which is universal we say is according to nature. It is such as is demanded by the natural sense of fitness among people. Thus, we may say that nature demands that the sexes should wear different kinds of dress; that nature demands that the female should be modest and retiring; that nature demands that the toils of the chase, of the field, of war - the duties of office, of government and of professional life, should be discharged by people. Such are in general the customs the world over; and if any reason is asked for numerous habits that exist in society, no better answer can be given than that nature, as arranged by God, has demanded it. The word in this place, therefore, does not mean the constitution of the sexes, as Locke, Whitby, and Pierce maintain; nor reason and experience, as Macknight supposes; nor simple use and custom, as Grotius, Rosenmuller, and most recent expositors suppose; but it refers to a deep internal sense of what is proper and right; a sense which is expressed extensively in all nations. showing what that sense is.</p>
<p style=" ">No reason can be given, in the nature of things, why the woman should wear long hair and the man not; but the custom prevails extensively everywhere, and nature, in all nations, has prompted to the same course. “Use is second nature;” but the usage in this case is not arbitrary, but is founded in an anterior universal sense of what is proper and right. A few, and only a few, have regarded it as comely for a man to wear his hair long. Aristotle tells us, indeed (Rhet. 1: - see Rosenmuller), that among the Lacedemonians, freemen wore their hair long. In the time of Homer, also, the Greeks were called by him <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρηκομόωντες Ἀχαῖοι</span></span> karēkomoōntes Achaioi, long-haired Greeks; and some of the Asiatic nations adopted the same custom. But the general habit among people has been different. Among the Hebrews, it was regarded as disgraceful to a man to wear his hair long, except he had a vow as a Nazarite, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:1-5">Numbers 6:1-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:5">Judges 13:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+16:17">Judges 16:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:11">1 Samuel 1:11</span>. Occasionally, for affectation or singularity, the hair was suffered to grow, as was the case with Absalom <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+14:26">2 Samuel 14:26</span>; but the traditional law of the Jews on the subject was strict. The same rule existed among the Greeks; and it was regarded as disgraceful to wear long hair in the time of Aelian; Hist. lib. 9:c. 14. Eustath. on Hom. 2:v.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is a shame unto him? - </b>It is improper and disgraceful. It is doing that which almost universal custom has said appropriately belongs to the female sex.</p>
