<p style=" "><b>For first of all - </b>That is, I mention as the first thing to be reproved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When ye come together in the church - </b>When you come together in a religious assembly; when you convene for public worship. The word “church” here does not mean, as it frequently does with us, a “building.” No instance of such a use of the word occurs in the New Testament; but it means when they came together as a Christian assembly; when they convened for the worship of God. These divisions took place then; and from some cause which it seems then operated to produce alienations and strifes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I hear - </b>I have learned through some members of the family of Chloe; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11">1 Corinthians 1:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That there be divisions among you - </b>Greek, as in the margin, Schisms. The word properly means a rent, such as is made in cloth <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:21">Mark 2:21</span>, and then a division, a split, a faction among people; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:43">John 7:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:10">John 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:19">John 10:19</span>. It does not mean here that they had proceeded so far as to form separate churches, but that there was discord and division in the church itself; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10-11">1 Corinthians 1:10-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I partly believe it - </b>I credit a part of the reports; I have reason to think, that, though the evil may have been exaggerated, yet that it is true at least in part. I believe that there are dissensions in the church that should be reproved.</p>
