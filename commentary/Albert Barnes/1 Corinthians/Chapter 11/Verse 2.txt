<p style=" "><b>Now I praise you, brethren - </b>Paul always chose to commend Christians when it could be done, and never seemed to suppose that such praise would be injurious to them. See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4-5">1 Corinthians 1:4-5</span>. On this occasion he was the more ready to praise them as far as it could be done, because there were some things in regard to them in which he would have occasion to reprove them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye remember me in all things - </b>That you are disposed to regard my authority and seek my direction in all matters pertaining to the good order of the church. There can be little doubt that they had consulted him in their letter (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>) about the proper manner in which a woman ought to demean herself if she was called upon, under the influence of divine inspiration, to utter anything in public. The question seems to have been, whether, since she was inspired, it was proper for her to retain the marks ef her inferiority of rank, and remain covered; or whether the fact of her inspiration did not release her from that obligation, and make it proper that she should lay aside her veil, and appear as public speakers did among people. To this the apostle refers, probably, in the phrase “all things,” that even in matters of this kind, pertaining to the good order of the church, they were disposed to regard his authority.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And keep the ordinances - </b>Margin, “Traditions” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὰς παραδώσεις</span></span> tas paradōseis). The word does not refer to anything that had been delivered down from a former generation, or from former times, as the word “tradition” now usually signifies; but it means that which had been “delivered to them (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδίδωμι</span></span> paradidōmi); that is, by the apostles.” The apostles had “delivered” to them certain doctrines, or rules, respecting the good order and the government of the church; and they had in general observed them, and were disposed still to do it. For this disposition to regard his authority, and to keep what he had enjoined, he commends them. He proceeds to specify what would be proper in regard to the particular subject on which they had made inquiry.</p>
