<p style=" "><b>When ye come together therefore ... - </b>When you are assembled as a church, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span>, and see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span>. Christians were constantly in the habit of assembling for public worship. It is probable that at this early period all the Christians in Corinth were accustomed to meet in the same place. The apostle here particularly refers to their “assembling” to observe the ordinance of the Lord’s Supper. At that early period it is probable that this was done on every Lord’s Day.</p>
<p style=" "><b>This is not ... - </b>Margin, “Ye cannot eat.” The meaning of this expression seems to be this. “Though you come together professedly to worship God, and to partake of the Lord’s Supper, yet this cannot be the real design which you have in view. It cannot be that such practices as are allowed among you can be a part of the celebration of that supper, or consistent with it. Your greediness <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>; your intemperance <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>; your partaking of the food separately and not in common, cannot be a celebration of the Lord’s Supper. Whatever, therefore, you may profess to be engaged in, yet really and truly you are not celebrating the Lord’s Supper.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Lord’s supper - </b>That which the Lord Jesus instituted to commemorate his death. It is called “the Lord’s,” because it is his appointment, and is in honor of him; it is called “supper” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖπνον</span></span> deipnon), because the word denotes the evening repast; it was instituted in the evening; and it is evidently most proper that it should be observed in the after part of the day. With most churches the time is improperly changed to the morning - a custom which has no sanction in the New Testament; and which is a departure from the very idea of a supper.</p>
