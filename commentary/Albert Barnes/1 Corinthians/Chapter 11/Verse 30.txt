<p style=" "><b>For this cause - </b>On account of the improper manner of celebrating the Lord’s Supper; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Many are weak - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀσθενεῖς</span></span> astheneis). Evidently referring to prevailing bodily sickness and disease. This is the natural and obvious interpretation of this passage. The sense clearly is, that God had sent among them bodily distempers as an expression of the divine displeasure and judgment for their improper mode of celebrating the Lord’s Supper. That it was not uncommon in those times for God in an extraordinary manner to punish people with calamity, sickness, or death for their sins is evident from the New Testament; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:1-10">Acts 5:1-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span> note; and perhaps <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:16">1 John 5:16</span> note; and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14-15">James 5:14-15</span> notes. It may possibly have been the case that the intemperance and gluttony which prevailed on these occasions was the direct cause of no small part of the bodily disease which prevailed, and which in some cases terminated in death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And many sleep - </b>Have died. The death of Christians in the Scriptures is commonly represented under the image of “sleep;” Dan, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:2">1 Corinthians 12:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11-12">John 11:11-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Th 4:14</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10">1 Thessalonians 5:10</span>. Perhaps it may be implied by the use of this mild term here, instead of the harsher word “death,” that these were true Christians. This sentiment is in accordance with all that Paul states in regard to the church at Corinth. Notwithstanding all their irregularities, he does not deny that they were sincere Christians, and all his appeals and reasonings proceed on that supposition, though there was among them much ignorance and irregularity. God often visits his own people with trial; and though they are his children, yet this does not exempt them from affliction and discipline on account of their imperfections, errors, and sins. The “practical lesson” taught by this is, that Christians should serve God with purity; that they should avoid sin in every form; and that the commission of sin will expose them, as well as others, to the divine displeasure. The reason why this judgment was inflicted on the Corinthians was, that there might be a suitable impression made of the holy nature of that ordinance, and that Christians might be led to observe it in a proper manner. If it be asked whether God ever visits his people now with his displeasure for their improper manner of observing this ordinance, we may reply:</p>
<p style=" ">There is no reason to doubt that God may make it the occasion of manifesting his displeasure. It may be followed by a lack of spiritual comfort and peace; by a loss of communion with God; and by a withholding of those comforts from the soul which might have been enjoyed, and which are imparted to those who observe it in a proper manner. The general principle is, that an improper discharge of any duty will expose us to his displeasure, and to the certain loss of all those favors which might have resulted from a proper discharge of the duty, and to the tokens of the divine displeasure. And this is as true of prayer, or of any other religious duty, as of an improper observance of the Lord’s Supper.</p>
