<p style=" "><b>When ye come together to eat - </b>Professedly to eat the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Tarry one for another - </b>Do not be guilty of disorder, intemperance, and gluttony; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>. Doddridge understands this of the feast that he supposes to have preceded the Lord’s Supper. But the more obvious interpretation is, to refer it to the Lord’s Supper itself; and to enjoin perfect order, respect, and sobriety. The idea is, that the table was common for the rich and the poor; and that the rich should claim no priority or precedence over the poor.</p>
