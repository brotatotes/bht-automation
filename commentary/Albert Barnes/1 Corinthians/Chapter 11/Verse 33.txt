When ye come together to eat - Professedly to eat the Lord’s Supper.Tarry one for another - Do not be guilty of disorder, intemperance, and gluttony; see the note at 1 Corinthians 11:21. Doddridge understands this of the feast that he supposes to have preceded the Lord’s Supper. But the more obvious interpretation is, to refer it to the Lord’s Supper itself; and to enjoin perfect order, respect, and sobriety. The idea is, that the table was common for the rich and the poor; and that the rich should claim no priority or precedence over the poor.
