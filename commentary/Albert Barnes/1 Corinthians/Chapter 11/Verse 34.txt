<p style=" "><b>And if any man hunger ... - </b>The Lord’s Supper is not a common feast; it is not designed as a place where a man may gratify his appetite. It is designed as a simple “commemoration,” and not as a “feast.” This remark was designed to correct their views of the supper, and to show them that it was to be distinguished from the ordinary idea of a feast or festival.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye come not together unto condemnation - </b>That the effect of your coming together for the observance of the Lord’s Supper be not to produce condemnation; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the rest will I set in order ... - </b>Probably he refers here to other matters on which he had been consulted; or other things which he knew required to be adjusted. The other matters pertaining to the order and discipline of the church I will defer until I can come among you, and personally arrange them. It is evident from this, that Paul at this time purposed soon to go to Corinth; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15-16">2 Corinthians 1:15-16</span>. It was doubtless true that there might be many things which it was desirable to adjust in the church there, which could not be so well done by letter. The main things, therefore, which it was needful to correct immediately, he had discussed in this letter; the other matters he reserved to be arranged by himself when he should go among them. Paul was disappointed in his expectations of returning among them as soon as he had intended (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:17">2 Corinthians 1:17</span>), and under this disappointment he forwarded to them another epistle. If all Christians would follow implicitly his directions here in regard to the Lord’s Supper, it would be an ordinance full of comfort. May all so understand its nature, and so partake of it, that they shall meet the approbation of their Lord, and so that it may be the means of saving grace to their souls.</p>
