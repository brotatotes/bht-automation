<p style=" "><b>Every man praying or prophesying - </b>The word “prophesying” here means, evidently, “teaching;” or publicly speaking to the people on the subject of religion; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>. See also the subject considered more at length in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:0">1 Corinthians 14:0</span>. Whether these persons who are here said to prophesy were all inspired, or claimed to be inspired, may admit of a question. The simple idea here is, that they spoke in the public assemblies, and professed to be the expounders of the divine will.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having his head covered - </b>With a veil, or turban, or cap, or whatever else is worn on the head. To remove the hat, the turban, or the covering of the head, is a mark of respect for a superior when in his presence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Dishonoreth his head - </b>Does dishonor to Christ as his head <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>; that is, he does not, in his presence and in his service, observe the usual and proper custom by which a subordinate station is recognized, and which indicates respect for a superior. In the presence of a prince or a nobleman, it would be considered as a mark of disrespect should the head be covered. So in the presence of Christ, in whose name he ministers, it is a mark of disrespect if the head is covered. This illustration is drawn from the customs of all times and countries by which respect for a superior is indicated by removing the covering from the head. This is one reason why a man should not cover his head in public worship. Another is given in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:7">1 Corinthians 11:7</span>. Other interpretations of the passage may be seen in Bloomfield’s Critical Digest.</p>
