<p style=" "><b>For if the woman be not covered - </b>If her head be not covered with a veil.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let her also be shorn - </b>Let her long hair be cut off. Let her lay aside all the usual and proper indications of her sex and rank in life. If it is done in one respect, it may with the same propriety be done in all.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But if it be a shame ... - </b>If custom, nature, and habit; if the common and usual feelings and views among people would pronounce this to be a shame, the other would be pronounced to be a shame also by the same custom and common sense of people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let her be covered - </b>With a veil. Let her wear the customary attire indicative of modesty and a sense of subordination. Let her not lay this aside even on any pretence of religion.</p>
