<p style=" ">This chapter commences a new subject, the discussion of which continues to the close of the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:0">1 Corinthians 14:0</span>. The general subject is that of spiritual endowments, or the right mode of exercising their spiritual gifts, and the degree of honor which was due to those who had been distinguished by God by the special influences of his Spirit. It is evident that many in the church at Corinth had been thus favored; and it is evident that they had greatly abused these endowments, and that those who were thus favored had claimed a precedency of honor above those who had been less distinguished. It is not improbable that they had in their letter to Paul (see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>), requested his counsel on this subject, and asked him to teach them what measure of honor should be given to those who had been thus endowed. This subject, as it was of importance not only for them, but for the church at large in all future times, he proceeds to discuss in this, and the two following chapters; and this discussion closes the second part of the Epistle; see the Introduction. The general scope of these chapters is this:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) He shows that all those endowments were conferred by the Holy Spirit, and were all for the use of the church; that the church was one, but that there was a necessity for diversified operations in that church; and that, therefore, no one should value himself on that gift above his brother, and no one should feel himself dishonored because he had not been thus favored. All filled important places in the church, just as the various members and parts of the human system were necessary for its symmetry, action and health; and all therefore, should be willing to occupy the place which God had assigned them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:0">1 Corinthians 12:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1-13">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</span> he recommends love, or charity, as of more value than all other spiritual gifts put together, and therefore recommends that that should be especially the object of their desire.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:0">1 Corinthians 14:0</span> he gives particular rules about the proper exercise of spiritual gifts in their public assemblies.</p>
<p style=" ">This chapter, therefore, is occupied in stating and illustrating the position that all spiritual gifts are conferred by the Holy Spirit, and that no one should so value himself on this gift as to despise those who had not been thus endowed; and that no one who had not thus been favored should be dejected, or regard himself as dishonored. This statement is illustrated in the following manner:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Paul states the importance of the subject, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1">1 Corinthians 12:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He reminds them that they were formerly in a state of ignorance, sin, and idolatry, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:2">1 Corinthians 12:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) He states one mark of being under the influence of the Spirit of God - that is, that it would lead them to acknowledge and honor Jesus Christ. If the Spirit by which they were influenced led them to this, it was proof that it was the Holy Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>. If any “pretenders” to inspiration were in the habit of speaking disrespectfully of Jesus Christ, or of calling him “accursed,” it proved that they were not under the influence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) There were “diversities” in the operations of the Spirit, but however various were these operations, they all proceeded from the same agent, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4-11">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</span>. All were not, therefore, to expect precisely the same influences or operations; nor were they to suppose that because there were various operations, that therefore they were not influenced by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) Paul states and illustrates the truth that the church is one, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:12-27">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</span>. As the body is one, yet has many members, so is it with the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:12">1 Corinthians 12:12</span>. The body has many members, and no members in the body are useless, but all perform important parts, however unimportant they may seem to be; and no one member can say that it has no need of the others. So it is in the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13-27">1 Corinthians 12:13-27</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) This beautiful allegory, drawn from the functions of the various parts of the human body, Paul applies now to the church, and shows <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28-30">1 Corinthians 12:28-30</span> that the same thing should be expected in the church of Christ. It followed, therefore, that those who were not as highly favored as others should not regard themselves as useless, and decline their station in the church. It followed also, that those who were in inferior stations should not envy those who had been more highly favored; and that those who were in more elevated stations, and who had been more signally favored, should not look down on those beneath them with contempt. It followed also, that they should regard themselves as one body; and love and cherish each other with constant Christian affection.</p>
<p style=" ">(7) Paul tells them that it was not improper to desire the highest endowments, but says that he will propose an object of desire to be preferred to these gifts - and that is love, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>.</p>
