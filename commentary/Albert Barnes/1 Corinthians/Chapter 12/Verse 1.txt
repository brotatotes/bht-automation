<p style=" "><b>Now concerning - </b>it is now time that I should speak of spiritual endowments. He had no doubt been consulted in regard to them, and probably various questions had been proposed, which he now proceeded to answer.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Spiritual gifts - </b>The word “gifts” is not in the original. The Greek refers to “spiritual” things in general, or to anything that is of a spiritual nature. The whole discussion, however, shows that he refers to the various endowments, gifts, or graces that had been bestowed in different degrees on the members of the church - including the distinctions in graces, and in degrees of office and rank, which had been made in the Christian church in general <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:0">1 Corinthians 12:0</span>, as well as the extraordinary endowments of the gift of tongues which had been bestowed upon many, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:0">1 Corinthians 14:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I would not have you ignorant - </b>The subject is of so much importance that it demands particular attention and special care; compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:1">1 Corinthians 10:1</span>. I would not have you ignorant in regard to the nature of those endowments; the spirit with which they should be received; the rules to which they who are thus favored should be subjected; and the feelings and views which should be cherished in all the members of the church in regard to them. Nothing is of more importance in the church than the doctrine respecting the influences and endowments of the Holy Spirit.</p>
