<p style=" "><b>For as the body is one - </b>The general sentiment which the apostle had been illustrating and enforcing was, that all the endowments which were possessed in the church were the work of the same Holy Spirit, and that they ought to be appropriately cherished and prized, as being all useful and valuable in their places. This sentiment he now illustrates <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:12-27">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</span> by a beautiful similitude taken from the mutual dependence of the various parts of the human body. The human body is one, and yet is composed of various members and parts that all unite harmoniously in one whole.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being many - </b>Or, although they are many; or while they are in some respects separate, and perform distinct and different functions, yet they all unite in one harmonious whole.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So also is Christ - </b>The church is represented as the body of Christ <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:27">1 Corinthians 12:27</span>, meaning that it is one, and that he sustains to it the relation of Head; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22-23">Ephesians 1:22-23</span>. As the “head” is the most important part of the body, it may be put for the whole body; and the name “Christ” here, the head of the church, is put for the whole body of which he is the head; and means here the Christian society, or the church. This figure, of a part for the whole, is one that is common in all languages; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:4-5">Romans 12:4-5</span>.</p>
