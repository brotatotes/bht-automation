<p style=" "><b>Now ye - </b>Ye Christians of Corinth, as a part of the whole church that has been redeemed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are the body of Christ - </b>The allusion to the human body is here kept up. As all the members of the human body compose one body, having a common head, so it is with all the members and parts of the Christian church. The specific idea is, that Christ is the Head of the whole church; that he presides over all; and that all its members sustain to each other the relation of fellow-members in the same body, and are subject to the same head; compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3">1 Corinthians 11:3</span>. The church is often called the body of Christ; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And members in particular - </b>You are, as individuals, members of the body of Christ; or each individual is a member of that body.</p>
