<p style=" "><b>And God hath set - </b>That is, has appointed, constituted, ordained. He has established these various orders or ranks in the church. The apostle, having illustrated the main idea that God had conferred various endowments on the members of the church, proceeds here to specify particularly what he meant, and to refer more directly to the various ranks which existed in the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Some in the church - </b>The word “some,” in this place <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὅυς</span></span> hous, seems to mean rather whom, “and whom God hath placed in the church,” or, they whom God hath constituted in the church in the manner above mentioned are, first, apostles, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>First, apostles - </b>In the first rank or order; or as superior in honor and in office. He has given them the highest authority in the church; he has more signally endowed them and qualified them than he has others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Secondarily, prophets - </b>As second in regard to endowments and importance. For the meaning of the word “prophets,” see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thirdly, teachers - </b>As occupying the third station in point of importance and valuable endowments. On the meaning of this word, and the nature of this office, see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:7">Romans 12:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>After that, miracles - </b>Power. (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνάμεις</span></span> dunameis). Those who had the power of working miracles; referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Then gifts of healing - </b>The power of healing those who were sick; see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:9">1 Corinthians 12:9</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14-15">James 5:14-15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Helps - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀντιλήμψεις</span></span> antilēmpseis). This word occurs no where else in the New Testament. It is derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀντιλαμβάνω</span></span> antilambanō, and denotes properly, “aid, assistance, help;” and then those who render aid, assistance, or help; helpers. Who they were is not known. They might have been those to whom was entrusted the care of the poor, and the sick, and strangers, widows, and orphans, etc.; that is, those who performed the office of deacons. Or they may have been those who attended on the apostles to aid them in their work, such as Paul refers to in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>. “Greet Priscilla, and Aquilla, my “helpers” in Christ Jesus;” and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:9">1 Corinthians 12:9</span>,” Salute Urbane our helper in Christ;” see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>. It is not possible, perhaps, to determine the precise meaning of the word, or the nature of the office which they discharged; but the word means, in general, those who in any way aided or rendered assistance in the church, and may refer to the temporal affairs of the church, to the care of the poor, the distribution of charity and alms, or to the instruction of the ignorant, or to aid rendered directly to the apostles. There is no evidence that it refers to a distinct and “permanent” office in the church; but may refer to aid rendered by any class in any way. Probably many persons were profitably and usefully employed in various ways as aids in promoting the temporal or spiritual welfare of the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Governments - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυβερνήσεις</span></span> kubernēseis). This word is derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυβεριάω</span></span> kuberiaō, “to govern;” and is usually applied to the government or “steering” of a ship. The word occurs no where else in the New Testament, though the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυβερνήτης</span></span> kubernētēs (“governor”) occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:11">Acts 27:11</span>, rendered “master,” and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17">Revelation 18:17</span>, rendered “shipmaster.” It is not easy to determine what particular office or function is here intended. Doddridge, in accordance with Amyraut, supposes that distinct offices may not be here referred to, but that the same persons may be denoted in these expressions as being distinguished in various ways; that is, that the same persons were called helpers in reference to their skill in aiding those who were in distress, and governments in regard to their talent for doing business, and their ability in presiding in councils for deliberation, and in directing the affairs of the church.</p>
<p style=" ">There is no reason to think that the terms here used referred to permanent and established ranks and orders in the ministry and in the church; or in permanent offices which were to continue to all times as an essential part of its organization. It is certain that the “order” of “apostles” has ceased, and also the “order” of “miracles,” and the order of “healings,” and of “diversity of tongues.” And it is certain that in the use of these terms of office, the apostle does not affirm that they would be permanent, and essential to the very existence of the church; and from the passage before us, therefore, it cannot be argued that there was to be an order of men in the church who were to be called “helps,” or “governments.” The truth probably was, that the circumstances of the primitive churches required the aid of many persons in various capacities which might not be needful or proper in other times and circumstances.</p>
<p style=" ">Whether, therefore, this is to be regarded as a permanent arrangement that there should be “governments” in the church, or an order of men entrusted with the sole office of governing, is to be learned not from this passage, but from other parts of the New Testament. Lightfoot contends that the word which is used here and translated “governments” does not refer to the power of ruling, but to a person endued with a deep and comprehensive mind, one who is wise and prudent; and in this view Mesheim, Macknight, and Horsley coincide. Calvin refers it to the elders to whom the exercise of discipline was entrusted. Grotius understands it of the pastors <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>, or of the elders who presided over particular churches; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>. Locke supposes that they were the same as those who had the power of discerning spirits. The simple idea, however, is that of ruling, or exercising government; but whether this refers to a permanent office, or to the fact that some were specially qualified by their wisdom and prudence, and in virtue of this usually regulated or directed the affairs of the church by giving counsel, etc., or whether they were “selected” and appointed for this purpose for a time; or whether it refers to the same persons who might also have exercised other functions, and this in addition, cannot be determined from the passage before us. All that is clear is, that there were those who administered government in the church. But the passage does not determine the form, or manner; nor does it prove - whatever may be true - that such an office was to be permanent in the church.</p>
<p style=" ">(There can be little doubt that the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυβερνησεις</span></span> kubernēseis, or governments, refer to offices of rule and authority in the church. Two things, therefore, are plain from this text:</p>
<p style=" ">1. That in the primitive church there were rulers distinct from the people or church members, to whom these were bound to yield obedience.</p>
<p style=" ">2. That these rulers were appointed of God. “God set them in the church.” As to the question of “permanence,” on which our author thinks this passage affirms nothing: a distinction must be made between these offices which were obviously of an extraordinary kind, and which therefore must cease; and those of an ordinary kind, which are essential to the edification of the church in all ages. “The universal commission which the apostles received from their Master to make disciples of all nations, could not be permanent as to the extent of it, because it was their practice to ordain elders in every city, and because the course of human affairs required, that after Christianity was established, the teachers of it should officiate in particular places. The infallible guidance of the Spirit was not promised in the same measure to succeeding teachers. But being, in their case, vouched by the power of working miracles, it directed the Christians of their day, to submit implicitly to their injunctions and directions; and it warrants the Christian world, in all ages, to receive with entire confidence, that system of faith and morality which they were authorised to deliver in the name of Christ. But as all protestants hold that this system was completed when the canon of scripture was closed - it is admitted by them, that a great part of the apostolical powers ceased with those to whom Jesus first committed them.</p>
<p style=" ">Amongst the “ordinary” functions belonging to their office as teachers, are to be ranked not only preaching the word, and dispensing the sacraments, but also that rule and government over Christians as such, which is implied in the idea of the church as a society” - Hill’s Lectures, vol. ii, p. 479. Now, though these extraordinary offices and functions have ceased with the age of the apostles, and of miraculous influence; it by no means follows, that the ordinary offices of teaching and ruling have ceased also. What was plainly of a “peculiar kind,” and could not possibly be “imitated” after the withdrawment of miraculous power, is quite distinct from that which, not depending on such power, is suited to the condition of the church always. Proceeding on any other principle, we should find it impossible to argue at all on what ought to be the constitution of the church, from any hints we find in the New Testament. What is extraordinary cannot be permanent, but what is ordinary must be so. See the supplementary note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4">1 Corinthians 5:4</span>.)</p>
