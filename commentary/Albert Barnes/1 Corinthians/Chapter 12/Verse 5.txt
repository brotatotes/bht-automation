<p style=" "><b>Of administrations - </b>Margin, “Ministries.” The word properly denotes “ministries;” so that there are different ranks and grades in the ministries which Christ has appointed, to wit, those specified in <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 12:9-10</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But the same Lord - </b>This refers evidently to the Lord Jesus, by whom these various orders of ministers were appointed, and under whose control they are; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:5">Ephesians 4:5</span>. The term “Lord,” when it stands by itself in the New Testament, usually refers to the Lord Jesus, the name by which he was commonly known by the disciples; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:25">John 20:25</span>. The fact also that this stands between the mention of the work of the Spirit <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span> and the work of God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:6">1 Corinthians 12:6</span>, and the fact that to the Lord Jesus appertained the appointment of these various grades of officers in the church (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:1">Matthew 10:1</span> ff, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span> ff), is further proof that this refers to him. The design of the verse is, to show that all these offices had their appointment from him; and that since all were his appointment, and all were necessary, no one should be proud of an elevated station; no one should be depressed, or feel himself degraded, because he had been designated to a more humble office.</p>
