<p style=" "><b>To another faith - </b>Another shall he distinguished for simple confidence in God; and his endowment is also given by the same Spirit. Many of the most useful people in the church are distinguished mainly for their simple confidence in the promises of God; and often accomplish more by prayer and by their faith in God than others do who are distinguished for their wisdom and learning. Humble piety and reliance in the divine promises, and that measure of ardor, fearlessness, and zeal which result from such confidence; that belief that all obstacles must be and will be overcome that oppose the gospel; and that God will secure the advancement of his cause, will often do infinitely more in the promotion of his kingdom than the most splendid endowments of learning and talent. Indeed, if a man were disposed to do good on the widest scale possible, to do the utmost that he possibly could in saving people, he would best accomplish it by seeking simple “faith” in God’s aid and promises, and then under the influence of this, engage with ardor in doing what he could. Faith is one of the highest endowments of the Christian life; and yet, though all may obtain it, it is one of the rarest endowments. Perhaps by many it is despised, because it may be obtained by all; because it is a grace in which the poor and the humble may be as much distinguished as the man of splendid talents and profound learning.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To another the gifts of healing - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</span>. This was promised to the disciples of the Saviour; and in the early church was conferred on many; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:12">Acts 5:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15-16">Acts 5:15-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:12">Acts 19:12</span>. It would seem from this passage that the gift of healing was conferred on some in a more eminent degree than on others.</p>
