<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1-13">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</span> is a continuation of the subject commenced in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:0">1 Corinthians 12:0</span>. In that chapter Paul had introduced the subject of the various endowments which the Holy Spirit confers on Christians, and had shown that these endowments, however various they were, were conferred in such a manner as best to promote the edification and welfare of the church. In the close of that chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span> he had said that it was lawful for them to desire the most eminent of the gifts conferred by the Spirit; and yet says that there was “one” endowment that was more valuable than all others, and that might be obtained by all, and that he proposed to recommend to them. That was love; and to illustrate its nature, excellency, and power, is the design of this exquisitely beautiful and tender chapter. In doing this, he dwells particularly on three points or views of the excellency of love; and the chapter may be regarded as consisting of three portions.</p>
