<p style=" "><b>And though I have the gift of prophecy - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>; note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And understand all mysteries - </b>On the meaning of the word “mystery” see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>. This passage proves that it was one part of the prophetic office, as referred to here, to be able to understand and explain the “mysteries” of religion; that is, the things that were before unknown, or unrevealed. It does not refer to the prediction of future events, but to the great and deep truths connected with religion; the things that were unexplained in the old economy, the meaning of types and emblems; and the obscure portions of the plan of redemption. All these might be plain enough if they were revealed; but there were many things connected with religion which God had not chosen to reveal to people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And all knowledge - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>. Though I knew every thing. Though I were acquainted fully with all the doctrines of religion; and were with all sciences and arts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains - </b>Thould I should have the highest kind of faith. This is referred to by the Saviour <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span>, as the highest kind of faith; and Paul here had this fact doubtless in his eye.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am nothing - </b>All would be of no value. it would not save me. I should still be an unredeemed, unpardoned sinner. I should do good to no one; I should answer none of the great purposes which God has designed; I should not by all this secure my salvation. All would be in vain in regard to the great purpose of my existence. None of these things could be placed before God as a ground of acceptance in the Day of Judgment. Unless I should have love, I should still be lost. A somewhat similar idea is expressed by the Saviour, in regard to the Day of Judgment, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22-23">Matthew 7:22-23</span>, “Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you depart from me, ye that work iniquity.”</p>
