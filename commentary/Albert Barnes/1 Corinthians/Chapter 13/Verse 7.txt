<p style=" "><b>Beareth all things - </b>Compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:12">1 Corinthians 9:12</span>. Doddridge renders this, “covers all things.” The word used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στέγει</span></span> stegei) properly means to “cover” (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στέγη</span></span> stegē, a covering, roof; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:6">Luke 7:6</span>); and then to “hide,” “conceal,” not to make known. If this be the sense here, then it means that love is disposed to hide or conceal the faults and imperfections of others; not to promulgate or blazon them abroad, or to give any undue publicity to them. Benevolence to the individual or to the public would require that these faults and errors should be concealed. If this is the sense, then it accords nearly with what is said in the previous verse. The word may also mean, to forbear, bear with, endure. Thus, it is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>. And so our translators understand it here, as meaning that love is patient, long-suffering, not soon angry not disposed to revenge. And if this is the sense, it accords with the expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:4">1 Corinthians 13:4</span>, “love suffers long.” The more usual classic meaning is the former; the usage in the New Testament seems to demand the latter. Rosenmuller renders it, “bears all things;” Bloomfield prefers the other interpretation. Locke and Macknight render it “cover.” The “real” sense of the passage is not materially varied, whichever interpretation is adopted. It means, that in regard to the errors and faults of others, there is a disposition “not” to notice or to revenge them. There is a willingness to conceal, or to bear with them patiently.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All things - </b>This is evidently to be taken in a popular sense, and to he interpreted in accordance with the connection. All universal expressions of this kind demand to be thus limited. The meaning must be, “as far as it can consistently or lawfully be done.” There are offences which it is not proper or right for a man to conceal, or to suffer to pass unnoticed. Such are those where the laws of the land are violated, and a man is called on to testify, etc. But the phrase here refers to private matters; and indicates a disposition “not” to make public or to avenge the faults committed by others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Believeth all things - </b>The whole scope of the connection and the argument here requires us to understand this of the conduct of others. It cannot mean, that the man who is under the influence of love is a man of “universal credulity;” that he makes no discrimination in regard to things to be believed; and is as prone to believe a falsehood as the truth; or that he is at no pains to inquire what is true and what is false, what is right and what is wrong. But it must mean, that in regard to the conduct of others, there is a disposition to put the best construction on it; to believe that they may be actuated by good motives, and that they intend no injury; and that there is a willingness to suppose, as far as can be, that what is done is done consistently with friendship, good feeling, and virtue. Love produces this, because it rejoices in the happiness and virtue of others, and will not believe the contrary except on irrefragable evidence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hopeth all things - </b>Hopes that all will turn out well. This must also refer to the conduct of others; and it means, that however dark may be appearances; how much soever there may be to produce the fear that others are actuated by improper motives or are bad people, yet that there is a “hope” that matters may be explained and made clear; that the difficulties may he made to vanish; and that the conduct of others may be made to “appear” to be fair and pure. Love will “hold on to this hope” until all possibility of such a result has vanished and it is compelled to believe that the conduct is not susceptible of a fair explanation. This hope will extend to “all things” - to words and actions, and plans; to public and to private contact; to what is said and done in our own presence, and to what is said and done in our absence. Love will do this, because it delights in the virtue and happiness of others, and will not credit anything to the contrary unless compelled to do so.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Endureth all things - </b>Bears up under, sustains, and does not complain. Bears up under all persecutions at the hand of man; all efforts to injure the person, property, or reputation; and hears all that may be laid upon us in the providence and by the direct agency of God; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+13:15">Job 13:15</span>. The connection requires us to understand it principally of our treatment at the hands of our fellow-men.</p>
