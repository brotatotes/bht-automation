<p style=" ">This chapter is a continuation of the subject commenced in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:0">1 Corinthians 12:0</span> and pursued through <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1-13">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:0">1 Corinthians 12:0</span> Paul had entered on the discussion of the various endowments which the Holy Spirit confers on Christians, and had shown that these endowments were bestowed in a different degree on different individuals, and yet so as to promote in the best way the edification of the church. It was proper, he said <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>, to desire the more eminent of these endowments, and yet there was one gift of the Spirit of more value than all others, which might be obtained by all, and which should be an object of desire to all. That was love; and to show the nature, power, and value of this, was the design of the thirteenth chapter, certainly one of the most tender and beautiful portions of the Bible. In this chapter the subject is continued with special reference to the subject of “prophecy,” as being the most valuable of the miraculous endowments, or the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit.</p>
<p style=" ">In doing this, it was necessary to correct an erroneous estimate which they had placed on the power of speaking foreign languages. They had prized this, perhaps, because it gave them importance in the eyes of the pagan. And in proportion as they valued this, they undervalued the gift of being able to edify the church by speaking in a known and intelligible language. To correct this misapprehension; to show the relative value of these endowments, and especially to recommend the gift of “prophecy” as the more useful and desirable of the gifts of the Spirit, was the leading design of this chapter. In doing this, Paul first directs them to seek for charity. He also recommends to them, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>, to desire spiritual endowments, and of these endowments especially to desire prophecy; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span>. He then proceeds to set forth the advantage of speaking in intelligible language, or of speaking so that the church may be edified, by the following considerations, which comprise the chapter:</p>
