<p style=" "><b>Follow after charity - </b>Pursue love <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>; that is, earnestly desire it; strive to possess it; make it the object of your anxious and constant solicitude to obtain it, and to be influenced by it always. Cultivate it in your own hearts, as the richest and best endowment of the Holy Spirit, and endeavor to diffuse its happy influence on all around you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And desire spiritual gifts - </b>I do not forbid you, while you make the possession of love your great object, and while you do not make the desire of spiritual gifts the occasion of envy or strife, to desire the miraculous endowments of the Spirit and to seek to excel in those endowments which he imparts; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>. The main thing was to cultivate a spirit of love. Yet it was not improper also to desire to be so endowed as to promote their highest usefulness in the church. On the phrase “spiritual gifts,” see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1">1 Corinthians 12:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But rather that ye may prophesy - </b>But especially, or particularly desire to be qualified for the office of prophesying. The apostle does not mean to say that prophecy is to be preferred to love or charity; but that, of the spiritual gifts which it was proper for them to desire and seek, prophecy was the most valuable. That is, they were not most earnestly and especially to desire to be able to speak foreign languages or to work miracles; but they were to desire to be qualified to speak in a manner that would be edifying to the church. They would naturally, perhaps, most highly prize the power of working miracles and of speaking foreign languages. The object of this chapter is to show them that the ability to speak in a plain, clear, instructive manner, so as to edify the church and convince sinners, was a more valuable endowment than the power of working miracles, or the power of speaking foreign languages.</p>
<p style=" ">On the meaning of the word “prophesy,” see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span>. To what is said there on the nature of this office, it seems necessary only to add an idea suggested by Prof. Robinson (Greek and English Lexicon, under the article, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προφήτης</span></span> Prophētēs), that the prophets were distinguished from the teachers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδάσκαλοι</span></span> didaskaloi), “in that, while the latter spoke in a calm, connected, didactic discourse adapted to instruct and enlighten the hearers, the prophet spoke more from the impulse of sudden inspiration, from the light of a sudden revelation at the moment (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:30">1 Corinthians 14:30</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀποκάλυφθη</span></span> apokalupthē), and his discourse was probably more adapted, by means of powerful exhortation, to awaken the feelings and conscience of the hearers.” The idea of speaking from “revelation,” he adds, seems to be fundamental to the correct idea of the nature of the prophecy here referred to. Yet the communications of the prophets were always in the vernacular tongue, and were always in intelligible language, and in this respect different from the endowments of those who spoke foreign languages.</p>
<p style=" ">The same truth might be spoken by both; the influence of the Spirit was equally necessary in both; both were inspired; and both answered important ends in the establishment and edification of the church. The gift of tongues, however, as it was the most striking and remarkable, and probably the most rare, was most highly prized and coveted. The object of Paul here is, to show that it was really an endowment of less value, and should be less desired by Christians than the gift of prophetic instruction, or the ability to edify the church in language intelligible and understood by all, under the immediate influences of the Holy Spirit.</p>
