But if there be no interpreter - If there be no one present who has the gift of interpretation.And let him speak to himself and to God - See the note at 1 Corinthians 14:2, note at 1 Corinthians 14:4. Let him commune with himself, and with God; let him meditate on the truths which are revealed to him, and let him in secret express his desires to God.
