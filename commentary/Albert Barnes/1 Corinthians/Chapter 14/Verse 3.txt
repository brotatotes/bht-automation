<p style=" "><b>But he that prophesieth - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span>. He that speaks under the influence of inspiration in the common language of his hearers. This seems to be the difference between those who spoke in foreign languages and those who prophesied. Both were under the influence of the Holy Spirit; both might speak the same truths; both might occupy an equally important and necessary place in the church; but the language of the one was intelligible to the church, the other not; the one was designed to edify the church, the other to address those who spoke foreign tongues, or to give demonstration, by the power of speaking foreign languages, that the religion was from God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Speaketh unto men - </b>So as to be understood by those who were present.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To edification - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:8">1 Corinthians 10:8</span>, note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>. Speaks so as to enlighten and strengthen the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And exhortation - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>. He applies and enforces the practical duties of religion, and urges motives for a holy life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And comfort - </b>Encouragement. That is, he presents the promises and the “hopes” of the gospel; the various considerations adapted to administer comfort in the time of trial. The other might do this, but it would be in a foreign language, and would be useless to the church.</p>
