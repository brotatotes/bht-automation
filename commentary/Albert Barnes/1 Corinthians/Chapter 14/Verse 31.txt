<p style=" "><b>For ye may all prophecy ... - </b>There is time enough for all; there is no need of speaking in confusion and disorder. Every person may have an opportunity of expressing his sentiments at the proper time.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That all may learn - </b>In such a manner that there may be edification. This might be done if they would speak one at a time in their proper order.</p>
