So likewise ye ... - To apply the case. If you use a foreign language, how shall it be known what is said, or of what use will it be, unless it is made intelligible by interpretation?Utter by the tongue - Unless you speak.Words easy to be understood - Significant words (margin), words to which your auditors are accustomed.For ye shall speak into the air - You will not speak so as to be understood; and it will be just the same as if no one was present, and you spoke to the air.

All preaching should be plain, simple, perspicuous, and adapted to the capacity of the hearers.
