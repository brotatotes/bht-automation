<p style=" "><b>Then cometh the end - </b>Then is the end; or then “is” the consummation. It does not mean that the end, or consummation is to “follow” that event; but that this “will” be the ending, the winding up, the consummation of the affairs under the mediatorial reign of Christ. The word “end” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τέλος</span></span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="he-IL"> </span></span><span class="_0000ff">telos</span>) denotes properly a limit, termination, completion of anything. The proper and obvious meaning of the word here is, that then shall be the end or completion of the work of redemption. That shall have been done which was intended to be done by the incarnation and the work of the atonement; the race shall be redeemed; the friends of God shall be completely recovered; and the administration of the affairs of the universe shall be conducted as they were before the incarnation of the Redeemer. Some understand the word “end” here, however, as a metaphor, meaning “the “last,” or the rest of the dead;” but this is a forced and improbable interpretation. The word end here may refer to the end of human affairs, or the end of the kingdoms of this world, or it may refer to the ends of the mediatorial kingdom of the Redeemer; the consummation of his special reign and work resulting in the surrender of the kingdom to the Father. The connection demands the last interpretation, though this involves also the former.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When he shall have delivered up - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδῷ</span></span><span class="_800000"><span lang="he-IL"> </span></span><span class="_0000ff">paradō</span>). This word means properly to give “near, with,” or “to” anyone; to give over, to deliver up - Robinson. It is applied to the act of delivering up “persons” to the power or authority of others, as e. g. to magistrates for trial, and condemnation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:25">Matthew 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:1">Mark 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:20">Luke 20:20</span>; to lictors, or soldiers, for punishment <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:24">Matthew 18:24</span>; or to one’s enemies, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:15">Matthew 26:15</span>. It is applied also to persons or things delivered over or surrendered to do or suffer anything, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:26">Acts 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:3">1 Corinthians 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:19">Ephesians 4:19</span>. It is also applied to persons or things delivered over to the care, charge, or supervision of anyone, in the sense of giving up, entrusting, committing, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:14">Matthew 25:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:6">Luke 4:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:10">Luke 4:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:22">Luke 4:22</span>. Here the obvious sense is that of surrendering, giving back, delivering up, rendering up that which had been received, implying that an important trust had been received, which was now to be rendered back. And according to this interpretation, it means:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That he had executed the purpose implied in that trust or commission; and,</p>
<p style=" ">As the work had been accomplished which had been contemplated in his design; as there would be no further necessity for mediation when redemption should have been made, and his church recovered from sin and brought to glory; there would be no further need of that special arrangement which had been implied in the work of redemption, and, of course, all the entrustment of power involved in that would be again restored to the hands of God. The idea, says Grotius, is, that he would deliver up the kingdom as the governors of provinces render again or deliver up their commission and authority to the Caesars who appointed them. There is no absurdity in this view. For “if” the world was to be redeemed, it was necessary that the Redeemer should be entrusted with power sufficient for his work. When that work was done, and there was no further need of that special exercise of power, then it would be proper that it should be restored, or that the government of God should be administered as it was before the work of redemption was undertaken; that the Divinity, or the Godhead, as such, should preside over the destinies of the universe. Of course, it will not follow that the Second Person of the Trinity will surrender “all” power, or “cease” to exercise government. It will be that power only which he had as Mediator; and whatever part in the administration of the government of the universe he shared as divine before the incarnation, he will still share, with the additional “glory” and “honor” of having redeemed a world by his death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The kingdom - </b>This word means properly dominion, reign, the exercise of kingly power. In the New Testament it means commonly the reign of the Messiah, or the dominion which God would exercise through the Messiah; the reign of God over people by the laws and institutions of the Messiah; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. Here it means, I think, evidently, dominion in general. It cannot denote the peculiar administration over the world involved in the work of mediation, for that will be ended; but it means that the empire, the sovereignty, shall have been delivered up to God. His enemies shall have been subdued. His power shall have been asserted. The authority of God shall have been established, and the kingdom, or the dominion, shall be in the hands of God himself; and he shall reign, not in the special form which existed in the work of mediation, but absolutely, and as he did over obedient minds before the incarnation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To God - </b>To God “as” God; to the Divinity. The Mediator shall have given up the special power and rule as Mediator, and it shall be exercised by God as God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even the Father - </b>And (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καὶ</span></span> kai) the Father. The word “Father,” as applied to God in the Scriptures, is used in two senses - to designate “the” Father, the first person of the Trinity as distinguished from the Son; and in a broader, wider sense, to denote God as sustaining the relation of a Father to his creatures; as the Father of all. Instances of this use are too numerous to be here particularly referred to. It is in this latter sense, perhaps, that the word is used here - not to denote that the second person of the Trinity is to surrender all power into the hands of the first, or that he is to cease to exercise dominion and control; but that the power is to be yielded into the hands of God as God, that is, as the universal Father, as the Divinity, without being exercised in any special and special manner by the different persons of the Godhead, as had been done in the work of redemption. At the close of the work of redemption this “peculiar” arrangement would cease; and God, as the universal Father and Ruler of all, would exercise the government of the world; see, however, see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When he shall have put down - </b>When he shall have “abolished,” or brought to nothing, all that opposed the reign of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All rule ... - </b>All those mighty powers that opposed God and resisted his reign. The words used here do not seem intended to denote the several departments or forms of opposition, but to be general terms, meaning that whatever opposed God should be subdued. They include, of course, the kingdoms of this world; the sins, pride, and corruption of the human heart; the powers of darkness - the spiritual dominions that oppose God on earth, and in hell; and death and the grave. All shalt be completely subdued, and cease to interpose any obstacles to the advancement of his kingdom and to his universal reign. A monarch reigns when all his enemies are subdued or destroyed; or when they are prevented from opposing his will, even though all should not voluntarily submit to his will. The following remarks of Prof. Bush present a plausible and ingenious view of this difficult passage, and they are, therefore, subjoined here. “If the opinion of the eminent critic, Storr, may be admitted, that the kingdom here said to be delivered up to the Father is not the kingdom of Christ, but the rule and dominion of all adverse power - an opinion rendered very probable by the following words: “when he shall have “put down” (Greek: “done away, abolished”) all rule, and all authority and power,” and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:25">1 Corinthians 15:25</span>, “till he hath put all “enemies” under his feet” - then is the passage of identical import with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>, referring to precisely the same period: “And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever. It is, therefore, we conceive, but a special mode of denoting the “transfer,” the “making over” of the kingdoms of this world from their former despotic and antichristian rulers to the sovereignty of Jesus Christ, the appointed heir and head of all things, whose kingdom is to be everlasting.</p>
<p style=" ">If this interpretation be correct, we are prepared to advance a step further, and suggest that the phrase, “he shall have delivered up” (Greek, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδῷ</span></span> paradō), be understood as an instance of the idiom in which the verb is used without any personal nominative, but has reference to the “purpose of God as expressed in the Scriptures;” so that the passage may be read,” Then cometh the end (that is, not the close, the final winding up, but the perfect development, expansion, completion, consummation of the divine plans in regard to this world), when the prophetic announcements of the Scriptures require the delivering up (that is, the making over) of all adverse dominion into the hands of the Messiah, to whose supremacy we are taught to expect that everything will finally be made subject” - “<i>Illustrations of Scripture</i>.” A more extended examination of this difficult passage may be seen in Storr’s Opuscula, vol. i. pp. 274-282. See also Biblical Repository, vol. 3:pp. 748-755.</p>
