<p style=" "><b>For I delivered unto you - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span>. “First of all.” Among the first doctrines which I preached. As the leading and primary doctrines of Christianity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That which I also received - </b>Which had been communicated to me. Not doctrines of which I was the author, or which were to be regarded as my own. Paul here refers to the fact that he had received these doctrines from the Lord Jesus by inspiration; compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>, note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:2">Galatians 1:2</span>, note. This is one instance in which he claims to be under the divine guidance, and to have received his doctrines from God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How that Christ died for our sins - </b>The Messiah, The Lord Jesus, died as an expiatory offering on account of our sins. They caused his death; for them he shed his blood; to make expiation for them, and to wipe them away, he expired on the cross. This passage is full proof that Christ did not die merely as a martyr, but that his death was to make atonement for sin. That he died as an atoning sacrifice, or as a vicarious offering, is here declared by Paul to be among the “first” things that he taught; and the grand fundamental truth on which the church at Corinth had been founded, and by which it had been established, and by which they would be saved. It follows that there can be no true church, and no wellfounded hope of salvation, where the doctrine is not held that Christ died for sin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to the Scriptures - </b>The writings of the Old Testament; See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>. It is, of course, not certain to what parts of the Old Testament Paul here refers. He teaches simply that the doctrine is contained there that the Messiah would die for sin; and, in his preaching, he doubtless adduced and dwelt upon the particular places. Some of the places where this is taught are the following: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:0">Psalms 22:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1-12">Isaiah 53:1-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:26">Daniel 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:26">Luke 24:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:46">Luke 24:46</span>.
