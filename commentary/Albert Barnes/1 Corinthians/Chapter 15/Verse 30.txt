<p style=" "><b>And why stand we in jeopardy - </b>Why do we constantly risk our lives, and encounter danger of every kind? This refers particularly to Paul himself and the other apostles, who were constantly exposed to peril by land or by sea in the arduous work of making known the gospel. The argument here is plain. It is, that such efforts would be vain, useless, foolish, unless there was to be a glorious resurrection. They had no other object in encountering these dangers than to make known the truths connected with that glorious future state; and if there were no such future state, it would be wise for them to avoid these dangers. “It would not be supposed that we would encounter these perils constantly, unless we were sustained with the hope of the resurrection, and unless we had evidence which convinced our own minds that there would be such a resurrection.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Every hour - </b>Constantly; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:26">2 Corinthians 11:26</span>. So numerous were their dangers, that they might be said to occur every hour. This was particularly the case in the instance to which he refers in Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span>.</p>
