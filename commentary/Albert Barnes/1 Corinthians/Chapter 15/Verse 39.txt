<p style=" "><b>All flesh is not the same flesh - </b>This verse and the following are designed to answer the question <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:35">1 Corinthians 15:35</span>, “with what bodies do they come?” And the argument here is, that there are many kinds of bodies; that all are not alike; that while they are bodies, yet they partake of different qualities, forms, and properties; and that, therefore, it is not absurd to suppose that God may transform the human body into a different form, and cause it to be raised up with somewhat different properties in the future world. Why, the argument is, why should it be regarded as impossible? Why is it to be held that the human body may not undergo a transformation, or that it will be absurd to suppose that it may be different in some respects from what it is now? Is it not a matter of fact that there is a great variety of bodies even on the earth? The word flesh here is used to denote body, as it often is. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:22">Philippians 1:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:24">Philippians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:5">Colossians 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:6">1 Peter 4:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The idea here is, that although all the bodies of animals may be composed essentially of the same elements, yet God has produced a wonderful variety in their organization, strength, beauty, color, and places of abode, as the air, earth, and water. It is not necessary, therefore, to suppose that the body that shall be raised shall be precisely like that which we have here. It is certainly possible that there may be as great a difference between that and our present body, as between the most perfect form of the human frame here and the lowest repthe. It would still be a body, and there would be no absurdity in the transformation. The body of the worm; the chrysalis, and the butterfly is the same. It is the same animal still. Yet how different the gaudy and frivilous butterfly from the creeping and offensive caterpillar! So there may be a similar change in the body of the believer, and yet be still the same. Of a sceptic on this subject we would ask, whether, if there had been a revelation of the changes which a caterpillar might undergo before it became a butterfly - a new species of existence adapted to a new element, requiring new food, and associated with new and other beings - if he had never seen such a transformation, would it not be attended with all the difficulty which now encompasses the doctrine of the resurrection? The sceptic would no more have believed it on the authority of revelation than he will believe the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. And no infidel can prove that the one is attended with any more difficulty or absurdity than the other.</p>
