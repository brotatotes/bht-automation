<p style=" "><b>And that he was buried - </b>That is, evidently according to the Scriptures; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9">Isaiah 53:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And that he rose again the third day ... - </b>That is, that he should rise from the dead was foretold in the Scriptures. It is not of necessity implied that it was predicted that he should rise “on the third day,” but that he should rise from the dead. See the argument for this stated in the discourse of Peter, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24-32">Acts 2:24-32</span>. The particular passage which is there urged in proof of his resurrection is derived from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:1-11">Psalms 16:1-11</span>.</p>
