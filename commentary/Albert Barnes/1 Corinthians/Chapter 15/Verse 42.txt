<p style=" "><b>So also is the resurrection - </b>In a manner similar to the grain that is sown, and to the different degrees of splendor and magnificence in the bodies in the sky and on the earth. The dead shall be raised in a manner analogous to the springing up of grain; and there shall be a difference between the body here and the body in the resurrection.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is sown - </b>In death. As we sow or plant the kernel in the earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In corruption - </b>In the grave; in a place where it shall be corrupt; in a form tending to putrefaction, disorganization, and dust.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is raised in incorruption - </b>It will be so raised. In the previous verses <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36-41">1 Corinthians 15:36-41</span> he had reasoned from analogy, and had demonstrated that it was possible that the dead should rise, or that there was no greater difficulty attending it than actually occurred in the events which were in fact constantly taking place. He here states positively what would be, and affirms that it was not only possible, but that such a resurrection would actually occur. They body would be raised “in incorruption,” “uncorruptible” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>; that is, no more liable to decay, sickness, disorganization, and putrefaction. This is one characteristic of the body that shall be raised, that it shall be no more liable, as here, to wasting sickness, to disease, and to the loathsome corruption of the grave. That God can form a body of that kind, no one can doubt; that he actually will, the apostle positively affirms. That such will be the bodies of the saints is one of the most cheering prospects that can be presented to those who are here wasted away by sickness, and who look with dread and horror on the loathsome putrefaction of the tomb.</p>
