<p style=" "><b>As is the earthy - </b>Such as Adam was.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Such are they also ... - </b>Such are all his descendants; all who derive their nature from him. That is, they are frail, corruptible, mortal; they live in an animal body as he did, and like him, they are subject to corruption and decay.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And as is the heavenly - </b>As is he who was from heaven; as is the Lord Jesus now in is glorified body. “Such are they also, etc.” Such will they be also. They will be like him; they will have a body like his. This idea is more fully expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>, “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.”</p>
