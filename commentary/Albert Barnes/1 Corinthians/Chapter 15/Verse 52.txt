In an “atom,” scil. of time; a point of time which cannot be cut or divided (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> a, the alpha privative (“not”) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τομη</span></span> tomē, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τέμνω</span></span> temnō, “to cut”).

<p style=" "><b>In the twinkling of an eye - </b>This is an expression also denoting the least conceivable duration of time. The suddenness of the coming of the Lord Jesus is elsewhere compared to the coming of a thief in the night; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>. The word rendered “twinkling” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ῥιπῆ</span></span> ripē, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ῥίπτω</span></span> rhiptō, “to throw, cast”) means “a throw, cast, jerk,” as of a stone; and then “a jerk of the eye,” that is, “a wink” - Robinson.</p>
<p style=" "><b>At the last trump - </b>When the trumpet shall sound to raise the dead. The word “last” here does not imply that any trumpet shall have been before sounded at the resurrection, but is a word denoting that this is the consummation or close of things; it will end the economy of this world; it will be connected with the last state of things.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the trumpet shall sound - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>.</p>
