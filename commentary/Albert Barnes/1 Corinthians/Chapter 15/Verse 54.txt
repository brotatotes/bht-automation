<p style=" "><b>So when ... - </b>In that future glorious world, when all this shall have been accomplished.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Then shall be brought to pass - </b>Then shall be fully accomplished; these words shall then receive their entire fulfillment; or this event shall meet all that is implied in these words.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The saying that is written - </b>What is written, or the record which is made. These words are quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span>; and the fact that Paul thus quotes them, and the connection in which they stand, prove that they had reference to the times of the gospel, and to the resurrection of the dead. Paul does not quote directly from the Hebrew, or from the Septuagint, but gives the substance of the passage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Death - </b>Referring here, undoubtedly, to death in the proper sense; death as prostrating the living, and consigning them to the grave.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is swallowed up - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κατεπόθη</span></span> Katepothē (from katapinō, to drink down, to swallow down) means to absorb <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:16">Revelation 12:16</span>; to overwhelm, to drown <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:29">Hebrews 11:29</span>; and then to destroy or remove. The idea may be taken from a whirlpool, or maelstrom, that absorbs all that comes near it; and the sense is, that he will abolish or remove death; that is, cause it to cease from its ravages and triumphs.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In victory - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς νῖκος</span></span> eis nikos. Unto victory; so as to obtain a complete victory. The Hebrew <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span> is <span class="_800000">לנצח</span> laanetsach, The Septuagint often renders the word <span class="_800000">נצח <span lang="he-IL">drow</span></span> netsach which properly means “splendor, purity, trust, perpetuity, eternity, perfection,” by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νῖκος</span></span> nikos, “victory”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+36:7">Job 36:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="la+3:18">Lamentations 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="la+5:20">Lamentations 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+1:1-15">Amos 1:1-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+2:0">Amos 2:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+8:7">Amos 8:7</span>. The Hebrew word here may be rendered either “unto the end, that is,” to completeness or perfection, or unto victory, with triumph. It matters little which is the meaning, for they both come to the same thing. The idea is, that the power and dominion of death shall be entirely destroyed, or brought to an end.</p>
