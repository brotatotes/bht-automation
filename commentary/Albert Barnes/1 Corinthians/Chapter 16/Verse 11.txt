<p style=" "><b>Let no man, therefore, despise him - </b>Let no one despise him on account of his youth and inexperience. It is probable that some of the more wealthy and proud, some who valued themselves on their wisdom and experience, would be disposed to look upon him with contempt. On another occasion, he directed Timothy so to live as that no one should have occasion to despise him on account of his youth <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>; and he here urges on the Corinthians, that they should not despise him because be was a young man, and comparatively inexperienced. A minister of the gospel, though young, should receive the respect that is due to his office; and if he conducts himself in accordance with his high calling, his youth should be no barrier to the confidence and affection of even aged and experienced Christians. It should be rather a reason why they should treat him with affection, and encourage him in his work.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But conduct him forth in peace - </b>That is, when he leaves you. Attend him on his way, and help him forward on his journey to me; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:6">1 Corinthians 16:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For I look for him with the brethren - </b>Erastus accompanied Timothy in this journey <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>, and probably there were others with him. Titus also had been sent to Corinth <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:17-18">2 Corinthians 12:17-18</span>, and it is not improbable that Paul had desired Titus to bring with him to Ephesus some of the Corinthian brethren, as he might need their assistance there - Grotius.</p>
