<p style=" "><b>I beseech you, brethren - </b>The construction here is somewhat involved, but the sense is plain. The words, “I beseech you,” in this verse, are evidently to be taken in connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:16">1 Corinthians 16:16</span>, “I beseech you that ye submit yourselves unto such,” etc. The design is to exhort them to pay proper deference to Stephanas, and to all who sustained the same rank and character; and the remainder of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span> is designed to state the reason why they should show respect and kindness to the household of Stephanas.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye know the house - </b>You are acquainted with the household, or family. Probably a considerable portion, or all, of the family of Stephanas had been converted to the Christian faith.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of Stephanas - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:16">1 Corinthians 1:16</span>. Paul there says that he had baptized his family. That it is the first-fruits of Achaia. They were the first converted to the Christian religion in Achaia; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>. Respecting Achaia, see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That they have addicted themselves ... - </b>That they have devoted themselves to the service of Christians. That is, by aiding the ministry; by showing hospitality; by providing for their needs; by attending and aiding the apostles in their journeys, etc.</p>
