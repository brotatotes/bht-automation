<p style=" "><b>The salutation of me, Paul, with mine own hand - </b>It is evident that Paul was accustomed to employ an amanuensis (copyist) in penning his epistles (see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span>), though he signed his own name, and expressed his Christian salutation in every epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>. This gave a sanction to what was written; was a proof that it was his own, and was a valuable token of affectionate regard. It was a proof that there was no fraud or imposition. Why he employed an amanuensis is not known.</p>
