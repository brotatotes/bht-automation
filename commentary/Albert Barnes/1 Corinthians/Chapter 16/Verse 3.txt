<p style=" "><b>Whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters - </b>There has been great variety of opinion in regard to the proper construction of this verse. Macknight supposes that the “letters” here referred to were not letters either to or from the apostle, but letters signed and sent by the congregation at Corinth, designating their appointment and their authority. With this interpretation Doddridge coincides; and this is required by the usual pointing of the Greektext, where the comma is inserted after the word letters, as in our translation. But a different interpretation has been proposed by inserting the comma after the word “approve,” so that it shall read, “Whom you approve, or designate, them I will send with letters to convey your charity to Jerusalem.” This is followed by Griesbach, Locke, Rosenmuller, Bloomfield, Beza, Hammond, Grotius, Whitby, etc. Certainly this accords better with the design of the passage. For it is evident (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:4">1 Corinthians 16:4</span>) that, though Paul was willing to go, yet he was not expecting to go. If he did not go, what was more natural than that he should offer to give them letters of commendation to his brethren in Judea? Mill has doubted whether this construction is in accordance with Greek usage, but the names above cited are sufficient authority on that subject. The proper construction, therefore, is, that Paul would give them letters to his friends in Jerusalem, and certify their appointment to dispense the charity, and commend the persons sent to the favor and hospitality of the church there. “Your liberality.” Margin, “Gift.” Your donation; your alms. The Greek word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χάριν</span></span> charin, usually signifies grace, or favor. Here it means an act of grace or favor; kindness; a favor conferred; benefaction: compare <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 8:4</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6-7">2 Corinthians 8:6-7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>.</p>
