It is by such indications as this usually that we are able to determine the place where the Epistles were written. In regard to the situation of Ephesus, see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:19">Acts 18:19</span>.</p>

Doubtless the great festivals of the Jews were well known among most of the cities of Greece, as there were Jews in them all who were scrupulous in their observances. It is no improbable supposition, also, that Christians everywhere regarded this day with deep interest, as being the day on which the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles and on the people of Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span>.</p>
