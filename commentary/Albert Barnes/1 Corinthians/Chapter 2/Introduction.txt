<p style=" ">The design of this chapter is the same as the concluding part of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17-31">1 Corinthians 1:17-31</span>, to show that the gospel does not depend for its success on human wisdom, or the philosophy of men. This position the apostle further confirms:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1-5">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</span>, By a reference to his own example, as having been successful among them, and yet not endowed with the graces of elocution, or by a commanding address; yet.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Lest it should be thought that the gospel was real folly, and should be contemned, he shows in the remainder of the chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6-16">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</span>, that it contained true wisdom; that it was a profound scheme - rejected, indeed, by the people of the world, but seen to be wise by those who were made acquainted with its real nature and value, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:5-16">1 Corinthians 2:5-16</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The first division of the chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1-5">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</span>, is a continuation of the argument to show that the success of the gospel does not depend on human wisdom or philosophy. This he proves:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) By the fact that when he was among them, though his preaching was attended with success, yet he did not come with the attractions of human eloquence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) This was in accordance with his purpose, not designing to attempt anything like that, but having another object, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:2">1 Corinthians 2:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) In fact he had not evinced that, but the contrary, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:3-4">1 Corinthians 2:3-4</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) His design was that their conversion should not appear to have been made by human wisdom or eloquence, but to have been manifestly the work of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:5">1 Corinthians 2:5</span>.</p>
