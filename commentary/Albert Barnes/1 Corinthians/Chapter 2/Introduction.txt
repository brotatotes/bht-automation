The design of this chapter is the same as the concluding part of 1 Corinthians 1:17-31, to show that the gospel does not depend for its success on human wisdom, or the philosophy of men. This position the apostle further confirms:(1) 1 Corinthians 2:1-5, By a reference to his own example, as having been successful among them, and yet not endowed with the graces of elocution, or by a commanding address; yet.(2) Lest it should be thought that the gospel was real folly, and should be contemned, he shows in the remainder of the chapter 1 Corinthians 2:6-16, that it contained true wisdom; that it was a profound scheme - rejected, indeed, by the people of the world, but seen to be wise by those who were made acquainted with its real nature and value, 1 Corinthians 2:5-16.The first division of the chapter 1 Corinthians 2:1-5, is a continuation of the argument to show that the success of the gospel does not depend on human wisdom or philosophy. This he proves:(1) By the fact that when he was among them, though his preaching was attended with success, yet he did not come with the attractions of human eloquence, 1 Corinthians 2:1.(2) This was in accordance with his purpose, not designing to attempt anything like that, but having another object, 1 Corinthians 2:2.(3) In fact he had not evinced that, but the contrary, 1 Corinthians 2:3-4.(4) His design was that their conversion should not appear to have been made by human wisdom or eloquence, but to have been manifestly the work of God, 1 Corinthians 2:5.
