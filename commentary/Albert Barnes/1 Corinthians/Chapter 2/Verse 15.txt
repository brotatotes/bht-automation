<p style=" "><b>But he that is spiritual - </b>The man who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit in contradistinction from him who is under the influence of the senses only.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Judgeth - </b>Greek: “Discerns.” (margin); the same word as in the previous verse. It means that the spiritual man has a discernment of these truths in regard to which the sensual man was blind and ignorant.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All things - </b>Not absolutely all things; or not that he is omniscient; but that he has a view of those things to which the apostle had reference - that is, to the things which are revealed to man by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yet he himself is judged - </b>Greek, as in the margin, “is discerned;” that is, his feelings, principles, views, hopes, fears, joys, cannot be fully understood and appreciated by any natural or sensual man. He does not comprehend the principles which actuate him; he does not enter into his joys; he does not sympathize with him in his feelings. This is a matter of simple truth and universal observation. The reason is added in the following verse, that as the Christian is influenced by the Lord and as the natural man does not know him, so he cannot know him who is influenced by him; that is the Christian.</p>
