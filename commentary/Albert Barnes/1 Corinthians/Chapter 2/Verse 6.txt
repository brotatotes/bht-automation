<p style=" "><b>How be it - </b>But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> de. This commences the “second” head or argument in this chapter, in which Paul shows that if human wisdom is missing in his preaching, it is not devoid of true, and solid, and even divine wisdom - Bloomfield.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We speak wisdom - </b>We do not admit that we utter foolishness. We have spoken of the foolishness of preaching <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span>; and of the estimate in which it was held by the world <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:22-28">1 Corinthians 1:22-28</span>; and of our own manner among you as not laying claim to human learning or eloquence; but we do not design to admit that we have been really speaking folly. We have been uttering that which is truly wise, but which is seen and understood to be such only by those who are qualified to judge - by those who may be denominated “perfect,” that is, those who are suited by God to understand it. By “wisdom” here, the apostle means that system of truth which he had explained and defended - the plan of salvation by the cross of Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Among them that are perfect - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν τοῖς τελείοις</span></span> en tois teleios). This word “perfect” is here evidently applied to Christians, as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:15">Philippians 3:15</span>, “Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded.” And it is clearly used to denote those who were advanced in Christian knowledge; who were qualified to understand the subject; who had made progress in the knowledge of the mysteries of the gospel; and who thus saw its excellence. It does not mean here that they were sinless, for the argument of the apostle does not bear on that inquiry, but that they were qualified to understand the gospel in contradistinction from the gross, the sensual, and the carnally minded, who rejected it as foolishness. There is, perhaps, here an allusion to the pagan mysteries, where those who had been fully initiated were said to be perfect - fully instructed in those rites and doctrines. And if so, then this passage means, that those only who have been fully instructed in the knowledge of the Christian religion, will be qualified to see its beauty and its wisdom. The gross and sensual do not see it, and those only who are enlightened by the Holy Spirit are qualified to appreciate its beauty and its excellency.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not the wisdom of the world - </b>Not that which this world has originated or loved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor of the princes of this world - </b>Perhaps intending chiefly here the rulers of the Jews; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>. They neither devised it, nor loved it, nor saw its wisdom; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That come to naught - </b>That is, whose plans fail; whose wisdom vanishes; and who themselves, with all their pomp and splendor, come to nothing in the grave; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:0">Isaiah 14:0</span>. All the plans of human wisdom shall fail; and this which is originated by God only shall stand,</p>
