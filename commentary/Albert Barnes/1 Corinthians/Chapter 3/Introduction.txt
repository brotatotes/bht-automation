<p style=" ">The design of this chapter is substantially the same as the former. It is to reprove the pride, the philosophy, the vain wisdom on which the Greeks so much rested; and to show that the gospel was not dependent on that for its success, and that that had been the occasion of no small part of the contentions and strifes which had arisen in the church at Corinth. The chapter is occupied mainly with an account of his own ministry with them; and seems designed to meet an objection which either was made, or could have been made by the Corinthians themselves, or by the false teacher that was among them. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:12-16">1 Corinthians 2:12-16</span>, he had affirmed that, Christians were in fact under the influence of the Spirit of God; that they were enlightened in a remarkable degree; that they understood all things pertaining to the Christian religion. To this, it either was, or could have been objected that Paul, when among them, had not instructed them fully in the more deep and abstruse points of the gospel; and that he had confined his instructions to the very rudiments of the Christian religion.</p>
<p style=" ">Of this, probably the false teachers who had formed parties among them, had taken the advantage, and had pretended to carry the instruction to a much greater length, and to explain many things which Paul had left unexplained. Hence, this division into parties. It became Paul, therefore, to state why he had confined his instructions to the rudiments of the gospel among them - and this occupies the first part of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:0">1 Corinthians 3:0</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1-11">1 Corinthians 5:1-11</span>. The reason was, that they were not prepared to receive higher instruction, but were carnal, and he could not address them as being prepared to enter fully into the more profound doctrines of the Christian religion. The proof that this was so was found in the fact that they had been distracted with disputes and strifes, which demonstrated that they were not prepared for the higher doctrines of Christianity. He then REproves them for their contentions, on the ground that it was of little consequence by what instrumentality they had been brought to the knowledge of the gospel, and that there was no occasion for their strifes and sects.</p>
<p style=" ">all success, whoever was the instrument, was to be traced to God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5-7">1 Corinthians 3:5-7</span>, and the fact that one teacher or another had first instructed them, or that one was more eloquent than another, should not be the foundation for contending sects. God was the source of all blessings. Yet in order to show the real nature of his own work, in order to meet the whole of the objection, he goes on to state that he had done the most important part of the work in the church himself. He had laid the foundation; and all the others were but rearing the superstructure. And much as his instructions might appear to be elementary, and unimportant, yet it had been done with the same skill which an architect evinces who labors that the foundation may be well laid and firm, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10-11">1 Corinthians 3:10-11</span>. The others who had succeeded him, whoever they were, were but builders upon this foundation. The foundation had been well laid, and they should be careful how they built on it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:12-16">1 Corinthians 3:12-16</span>. The mention of this fact - that he had laid the foundation, and that that foundation was Jesus Christ, and that they had been reared upon that as a church, leads him to the inference <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16-17">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</span>, that they should be holy as the temple of God; and the conclusion from the whole is:</p>
