<p style=" "><b>If any manâ€™s work abide ... - </b>If it shall appear that he hast taught the true doctrines of Christianity, and inculcated right practices and views of piety, and himself cherished right feelings: if the trial of the great Day, when the real qualities of all objects shall be known, shall show this.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He shall receive a reward - </b>According to the nature of his work. See the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:8">1 Corinthians 3:8</span>. This refers, I suppose, to the proper rewards on the Day of Judgment, and not to the honors and the recompense which he may receive in this world. If all that he has taught and done shall be proved to have been genuine and pure, then his reward shall be in proportion.</p>
