<p style=" "><b>I have fed you with milk - </b>Paul here continues the metaphor, which is derived from the custom of feeding infants with the lightest food. Milk here evidently denotes the more simple and elementary doctrines of Christianity - the doctrines of the new birth, of repentance, faith, etc. The same figure occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11-14">Hebrews 5:11-14</span>; and also in Classical writers. See Wetstein.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And not with meat - </b>“Meat” here denotes the more sublime and mysterious doctrines of religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For hitherto - </b>Formerly, when I came among you, and laid the foundations of the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not able to bear it - </b>You were not sufficiently advanced in Christian knowledge to comprehend the higher mysteries of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither yet now ... - </b>The reason why they were not then able he proceeds immediately to state.</p>
