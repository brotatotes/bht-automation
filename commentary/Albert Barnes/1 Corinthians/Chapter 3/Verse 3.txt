<p style=" "><b>For ye are yet carnal - </b>Though you are Christians, and are the friends of God in the main, yet your divisions and strifes show that you are yet, in some degree, under the influence of the principles which govern the people of this world. People who are governed solely by the principles of this world, evince a spirit of strife, emulation and contention; and just so far as you are engaged in strife, just so far do you show that you are governed by their principles and feelings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For whereas - </b>In proof that you are carnal I appeal to your contentions and strifes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Envying - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζῆλος</span></span> zēlos, zeal; used here in the sense of envy, as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14">James 3:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:16">James 3:16</span>. It denotes, properly, any “fervour” of mind (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζέω</span></span> zeō), and may be applied to any exciting and agitating passion. The envy here referred to, was that which arose from the superior advantages and endowments which some claimed or possessed over others. Envy everywhere is a fruitful cause of strife. Most contentions in the church are somehow usually connected with envy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And strife - </b>Contention and dispute.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And divisions - </b>Dissensions and quarrels. The margin correctly renders it “factions.” The idea is, that they were split up into parties, and that those parties were embittered with mutual recriminations and reproaches, as they always are in a church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And walk as men - </b>Margin. “according to man.” The word “walk” is used often in the Scriptures in the sense of “conduct” or “act.” You conduct yourselves as human beings of this earth, that is, as people commonly do; you evince the same spirit that the great mass of mankind does. Instead of being filled with love; of being united and harmonious as the members of the same family ought to be, you are split up into factions as the people of the world are.</p>
