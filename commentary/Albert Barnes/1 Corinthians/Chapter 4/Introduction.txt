This chapter is a continuation of the subject discussed in those which go before, and of the argument which closes the last chapter. The proper division would have been at 1 Corinthians 4:6. The design of the first six verses is to show the real estimate in which the apostles ought to be held as the ministers of religion. The remainder of the chapter 1 Corinthians 4:7-21 is occupied in setting forth further the claims of the apostles to their respect in contradistinction from the false teachers, and in reproving the spirit of vain boasting and confidence among the Corinthians. Paul 1 Corinthians 4:7 reproves their boasting by assuring them that they had no ground for it, since all that they possessed had been given to them by God. In 1 Corinthians 4:8, he reproves the same spirit with cutting irony, as if they claimed to be eminently wise - Still further to reprove them, he alludes to his own self-denials and sufferings, as contrasted with their ease, and safety, and enjoyment, 1 Corinthians 4:9-14. He then shows that his labors and self-denials in their behalf, laid the foundation for his speaking to them with authority as a father, 1 Corinthians 4:15-16. And to show them that he claimed that authority, over them as the founder of their church, and that he was not afraid to discharge his duty toward them, he informs them that he had sent Timothy to look into their affairs 1 Corinthians 4:17, and; that himself would soon follow; and assures them that he had power to come to them with the severity of Christian discipline, and that it depended on their conduct whether he should come with a rod, or with the spirit of meekness and love, 1 Corinthians 4:21.
