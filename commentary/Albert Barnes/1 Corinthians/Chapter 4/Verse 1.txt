<p style=" "><b>Let a man - </b>Let all; let this be the estimate formed of us by each one of you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So account of us - </b>So think of us, the apostles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As the ministers of Christ - </b>As the servants of Christ. Let them form a true estimate of us and our office - not as the head of a faction; not as designing to form parties, but as unitedly and entirely the servants of Christ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And stewards - </b>Stewards were those who presided over the affairs of a family, and made provision for it, etc.; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>. It was an office of much responsibility; and the apostle by using the term here seems to have designed to elevate those whom he seemed to have depreciated in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the mysteries of God - </b>Of the gospel; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>. The office of steward was to provide those things which were necessary for the use of a family. And so the office of a minister of the gospel, and a steward of its mysteries, is to dispense such instructions, guidance, counsel, etc., as may be requisite to build up the church of Christ; to make known those sublime truths which are contained in the gospel, but which had not been made known before the revelation of Jesus Christ, and which are, therefore, called “mysteries.” It is implied in this verse:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) That the office of a minister is one that is subordinate to Christ - they are his servants.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) That those in the office should not attempt to be the head of sect or party in the church.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) That the office is honorable as that of a steward is; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4) That Christians should endeavor to form and cherish just ideas of ministers; to give them their TRUE honor; but not to overrate their importance.</p>
