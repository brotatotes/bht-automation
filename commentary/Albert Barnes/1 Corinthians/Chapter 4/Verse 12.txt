<p style=" "><b>And labour ... - </b>This Paul often did. See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:34">Acts 20:34</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Th 2:9</u></span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being reviled - </b>That they were often reviled or reproached, their history everywhere shows. See the Acts of the Apostles. They were reviled or ridiculed as Jews by the Gentiles; and jeered by all as “Nazarenes,” and as deluded followers of Jesus; as the victims of a foolish superstition and enthusiasm.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We bless - </b>We return good for evil. In this they followed the explicit direction of the Saviour; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:44">Matthew 5:44</span>. The main idea in these passages is, that they were reviled, were persecuted, etc. The other clauses, “we bless,” “we suffer it,” etc. seem to be thrown in “by the way” to show how they bore this ill treatment. As if he had said “we are reviled; and what is more, we bear it patiently, and return good for evil.” At the same time, that he was recounting his trials, he was, therefore, incidentally instructing them in the nature of the gospel, and showing how their sufferings were to be borne; and how to illustrate the excellency of the Christian doctrine.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being persecuted - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11">Matthew 5:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We suffer it - </b>We sustain it; we do not revenge it; we abstain from resenting or resisting it.</p>
