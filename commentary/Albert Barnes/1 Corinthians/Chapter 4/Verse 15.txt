<p style=" "><b>For though ye have ten thousand instructors - </b>Though you may have or though you should have. It matters not how many you have, yet it is still true that I only sustain the relation to you of spiritual father, and whatever respect it is proper for you to have toward them, yet there is a special right which I have to admonish you, and a special deference which is due to me, from my early labors among you, and from the fact that you are my spiritual children.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Instructers - </b>Greek: pedagogues; or those who conducted children to school, and who superintended their conduct out of school hours. Hence, those who had the care of children, or teachers (in general). It is then applied to instructors of any kind.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Christ - </b>In the Christian system or doctrine. The authority which Paul claims here, is that which a father has in preference to such an instructor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not many fathers - </b>Spiritual fathers. That is, you have but one. You are to remember that however many teachers you have, yet that I alone am your spiritual father.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Christ Jesus - </b>By the aid and authority of Christ. I have begotten you by preaching his gospel and by his assistance.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I have begotten you - </b>I was the instrument of your conversion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the gospel - </b>By means of the gospel; by preaching it to you, that is, by the truth.</p>
