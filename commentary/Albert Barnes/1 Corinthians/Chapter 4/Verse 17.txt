<p style=" "><b>For this cause - </b>In order to remind you of my doctrines and my manner of life. Since I am hindered from coming myself, I have sent a fellow laborer as my messenger, well acquainted with my views and feelings, that he might do what I would do if I were present.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have I sent unto you Timotheus - </b>Timothy, the companion and fellow laborer of Paul. This was probably when Paul was at Ephesus. He sent Timothy and Erastus into Macedonia, probably with instruction to go to Corinth if convenient. Yet it was not quite certain that Timothy would come to them, for in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span>, he expresses a doubt whether he would. Paul was probably deeply engaged in Asia, and did not think it proper then for him to leave his field of labor. He probably supposed also, that Timothy, as his ambassador, would be able to settle the difficulties in Corinth as well as if he were himself present.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My beloved son - </b>In the gospel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1-3">Acts 16:1-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>. He supposed, therefore, that they would listen to him with great respect.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And faithful in the Lord - </b>A true Christian and a faithful servant of Christ; and who is, therefore, worthy of your confidence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of my ways - </b>My doctrine, my teaching, my mode of life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which be in Christ - </b>That is, my Christian life; my ministry; or my conduct as a Christian and a follower of the Saviour.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As I teach everywhere ... - </b>This was designed probably to show them that he taught them no new or special doctrines; he wished them simply to conform to the common rules of the churches, and to be like their Christian brethren everywhere. The Christian church is founded every where on the same doctrines; is bound to obey the same laws; and is suited to produce and cherish the same spirit. The same spirit that was required in Ephesus or Antioch, was required at Corinth; the same spirit that was required at Corinth, at Ephesus, or at Antioch, is required now.</p>
