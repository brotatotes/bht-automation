<p style=" ">This chapter is entirely occupied with a notice of an offence which existed in the church at Corinth and with a statement of the measures which the apostle expected them to pursue in regard to it. Of the existence of this offence he had been informed, probably by “those of the house of Chloe,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11">1 Corinthians 1:11</span>, and there is reason to suppose that they had not even alluded to it in the letter which they had sent to him asking advice; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>; compare the Introduction. The apostle <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span> reproves them for tolerating a species of licentiousness which was not tolerated even by the pagans; he reproves them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span> for being puffed up with pride even while this scandal existed in their church; he ordered them immediately to purify the church by removing the incestuous person <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4-5">1 Corinthians 5:4-5</span>; and exhorted them to preserve themselves from the influence which a single corrupt person might have, operating like leaven in a mass; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6-7">1 Corinthians 5:6-7</span>. Then, lest they should mistake his meaning, and suppose that by commanding them not to keep company with licentious persons <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span>, he meant to say, that they should withdraw from all contact with the pagans who were known to be idolaters and corrupt, he says that that former command was not designed to forbid all contact with them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9-12">1 Corinthians 5:9-12</span>; but that he meant his injunction now to extend particularly to such as were professed members of the church; that they were not to cut off all contact with society at large because it was corrupt; that if any person professed to be a Christian and yet was guilty of such practices they were to disown him <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>; that it was not his province, nor did he assume it, to judge the pagan world which was without the church <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12">1 Corinthians 5:12</span>; but that this was entirely consistent with the view that he had a right to exercise discipline within the church, on such as professed to be Christians; and that therefore, they were bound to put away that wicked person.</p>
