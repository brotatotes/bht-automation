<p style=" "><b>It is reported - </b>Greek It is heard. There is a rumor. That rumor had been brought to Paul, probably by the members of the family of Chloe, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11">1 Corinthians 1:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Commonly - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ὅλως</span></span> Holōs. Everywhere. It is a matter of common fame. It is so public that it cannot be concealed; and so certain that it cannot be denied. This was all offence, he informs us, which even the pagan would not justify or tolerate; and, therefore, the report had spread not only in the churches, but even among the pagan, to the great scandal of religion - When a report obtains such a circulation, it is certainly time to investigate it, and to correct the evil.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That there is fornication - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>. The word is here used to denote incest, because the apostle immediately explains the nature of the offence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And such fornication ... - </b>An offence that is not tolerated or known among the pagan. This greatly aggravated the offence, that in a Christian church a crime should be tolerated among its members which even gross pagans would regard with abhorrence. That this offence was regarded with abhorrence by even the pagans has been abundantly proved by quotations from classic writers. See Wetstein, Bloomfield, and Whitby. Cicero says of the offence, expressly, that “it was an incredible and unheard of crime.” Pro Cluen. 5. 6 - When Paul says that it was not “so much as named among the Gentiles,” he doubtless uses the word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὀνομάζεται</span></span> onomazetai) in the sense of “named with approbation, tolerated,” or “allowed.” The crime was known in a few instances, but chiefly of those who were princes and rulers; but it was no where regarded with approbation, but was always treated as abominable wickedness. All that the connection requires us to understand by the word “named” here is, that it was not tolerated or allowed; it was treated with abhorrence, and it was therefore, more scandalous that it was allowed in a Christian church - Whitby supposes that this offence that was tolerated in the church at Corinth gave rise to the scandals that were circulated among the pagan respecting the early Christians, that they allowed of licentious contact among the members of their churches. This reproach was circulated extensively among the pagan, and the primitive Christians were at much pains to refute it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That one should have - </b>Probably as his wife; or it may mean simply that he had criminal contact with her. Perhaps some man had parted with his wife, on some account, and his son had married her, or maintained her for criminal contact. It is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:12">2 Corinthians 7:12</span>, that the person who had suffered the wrong, as well as he who had done it, was still alive - Whether this was marriage or concubinage, has been disputed by commentators, and it is not possible, perhaps, to determine. See the subject discussed in Bloomfield.</p>
