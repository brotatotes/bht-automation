<p style=" ">1. A public rumor with regard to the existence of an offence in the church should lead to discipline. This is due to the church itself that it may be pure and uninjured; to the cause, that religion may not suffer by the offence; and to the individual, that he may have justice done him, and his character vindicated if he is unjustly accused; or that if guilty he may be reclaimed and reformed - Offences should not be allowed to grow until they become scandalous; but when they do, every consideration demands that the matter should be investigated; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">2. People are often filled with pride when they have least occasion for it; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span>. This is the case with individuals - who are often elated when their hearts are full of sin - when they are indulging in iniquity; and it is true of churches also, that they are most proud when the reins of discipline are relaxed, and their members are cold in the service of God, or when they are even living so as to bring scandal and disgrace on the gospel.</p>
<p style=" ">3. We see in what way the Christian church should proceed in administering discipline; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span>. It should not be with harshness, bitterness, revenge, or persecution. It should be with mourning that there is necessity for it; with tenderness toward the offender; with deep grief that the cause of religion has been injured; and with such grief at the existence of the offence as to lead them to prompt and decided measures to remove it.</p>
<p style=" ">4. The exercise of discipline belongs to the church itself; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4">1 Corinthians 5:4</span>. The church at Corinth was to be assembled with reference to this offence, and was to remove the offender. Even Paul, an apostle, and the spiritual father of the church, did not claim the authority to remove an offender except through the church. The church was to take up the case; to act on it; to pass the sentence; to excommunicate the man. There could scarcely be a stronger proof that the power of discipline is in the church, and is not to be exercised by any independent individual, or body of people, foreign to the church, or claiming an independent right of discipline. If “Paul” would not presume to exercise such discipline independently of the church, assuredly no minister, and no body of ministers have any such right now. Either by themselves in a collective congregational capacity, or through their representatives in a body of elders, or in a committee appointed by them; every church is itself originate and execute all the acts of Christian discipline over its members. (See the supplementary note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4">1 Corinthians 5:4</span>.)</p>
<p style=" ">5. We see the object of Christian discipline; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>. It is not revenge, hatred, malice, or the more exercise of power that is to lead to it; it is “the good of the individual” that is to be pursued and sought. While the church endeavors to remain pure, its aim and object should be mainly to correct and reform the offender, that his spirit may be saved. When discipline is undertaken from any other motive than this; when it is pursued from private pique or rivalship, or ambition, or the love of power; when it seeks to overthrow the influence or standing of another, it is wrong. The salvation of the offender and the glory of God should prompt to all the measures which should be taken in the case.</p>
<p style=" ">6. We see the danger of indulging in any sin - both in reference to ourselves as individuals, or to the church; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6">1 Corinthians 5:6</span>. The smallest sin indulged in will spread pollution through the whole body, as a little leaven will effect the largest mass.</p>
<p style=" ">7. Christians should be pure; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7-8">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</span>. Their Saviour - their paschal lamb, was pure; and he died that they might be pure. He gave himself that his people might be holy; and by all the purity of his character; by all the labors and self-denials of his life; by all his sufferings and groans in our behalf, are we called on to be holy.</p>
<p style=" ">8. We are here presented with directions in regard to our contact with those who are not members of the church; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:10">1 Corinthians 5:10</span>. There is nothing that is more difficult to be understood than the duty of Christians respecting such contact. Christians often feel that they are in danger from it, and they are disposed to withdraw almost entirely from the world. And they ask with deep solicitude often, what course they are to pursue? Where shall the line be drawn? How far shall they go? And where shall they deem the contact with the world unlawful or dangerous? - A few remarks here as rules may aid us in answering these questions.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (I) Christians are not wholly to withdraw from contact with the people of this world. This was the error of the monastic system, and this error has been the occasion of innumerable corruptions and abominations in the papal church - They are not to do this because:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (II) The principles on which Christians should regulate their contact with the world, are these:</p>
<p style=" ">9. We see from this chapter who are not to be regarded as Christians, whatever may be their professions; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>. A person who is:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)A fornicator: or,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (2)Covetous; or,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (3)An idolater; or,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (4)A “railer;” or,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (5)A drunkard; or,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (6)An “extortioner,” is not to be owned as a Christian brother.</p>
<p style=" ">Paul has placed the covetous man, and the railer, and extortioners, in most undesirable company. They are ranked with fornicators and drunkards. And yet how many such persons there are in the Christian church - and many, too, who would regard it as a special insult to be ranked with a drunkard or an adulterer. But in the eye of God both are alike unfit for his kingdom, and are to be regarded as having no claims to the character of Christians.</p>
<p style=" ">10. God will judge the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12-13">1 Corinthians 5:12-13</span>. The world that is outside the congregation - the mass of people that make no profession of piety, must give an account to God. They are traveling to His bar; and judgment in regard to them is taken into God’s own hands, and He will pronounce their doom. It is a solemn thing “to be judged” by a holy God; and they who have no evidence that they are Christians, should tremble at the prospect of being soon arraigned at His bar.</p>
