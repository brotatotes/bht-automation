<p style=" "><b>In the name ... - </b>By the authority; or in the behalf; or acting by his commission or power. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span>. See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span>. This does not refer to Paul alone in declaring his opinion, but means that they were to be assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus, and that they were to proceed to exercise discipline by his authority. The idea is, that the authority to administer discipline is derived from the Lord Jesus Christ, and is to be exercised in his name, and to promote his honor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When ye are gathered together - </b>Or, “You being assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus.” This is to be connected with the previous words, and means:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That they were to be assembled for the purpose of administering discipline; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That this was to be done in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And my spirit - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:3">1 Corinthians 5:3</span>. As if I were with you; that is, with my declared opinion; knowing what I would advise, were I one of you; or, I being virtually present with you by having delivered my opinion. It cannot mean that Paul’s soul would be really present with them, but that, knowing his views and feelings, and what he would do, and knowing his love for them, they could act as if he were there. This passage proves that discipline belongs to the church itself; and so deep was Paul’s conviction of this, that even he would not administer it, without their concurrence and action. And if Paul would not do it, and in a case too where bodily pains were to be inflicted by miraculous agency, assuredly no other ministers have a right to assume the authority to administer discipline without the action and the concurrence of the church itself.</p>
<p style=" ">(The general doctrine of the New Testament is that the government of the church is invested, not in the people or church members at large, but in certain rulers or office-bearers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11-12">Ephesians 4:11-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12-13">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>. We find these elders or rulers existing in every church to which our attention is directed, while the people are continually exhorted to yield a willing submission to their authority. Now the passage under review must be explained in consistency with the analogy of truth, or the general scope of Scripture on the subject. It is unwise to build our conclusion on an insulated text. But, in reality, the language of the apostle, in this place, when fairly examined, gives no countenance to the idea that the judicial power of the church resides in the people. The case of the incestuous man was “judged by the apostle himself” previous to the transmission of his letter to the Corinthian church, which was therefore enjoined, not to adjudicate on the matter, but simply to give effect to the decision of Paul. “I verily ‘have judged already’ concerning him who hath done this deed; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,” etc. If it be still demanded why then were the people to assemble? the answer is obvious. It was necessary that the sentence should be published, where the crime had been committed, that the members of the church might concur in it, and withdraw from the society of the guilty person. The simple fact of the people being assembled is no proof that they were judges.</p>
<p style=" ">Yet candor requires us to state that the words in the third verse, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἤδη κεκρίκα</span></span> ēdē kekrika (I have already judged) are supposed by some to intimate, not the delivering of an authoritative sentence, but the simple expression of an opinion in regard to what ought to be done. This, however, seems neither consistent with the scope of the passage, nor with just ideas of apostolical authority. The apostles had “the care of all the churches, with power to settle matters of faith and order, to determine controversies, and exercise the rod of discipline on all offenders, whether pastors or flock; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:3-6">1 Corinthians 5:3-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:10">2 Corinthians 13:10</span>.”)</p>
<p style=" "><b>With the power ... - </b>This phrase is to be connected with the following verse. “I have determined what ought to be done. The sentence which I have passed is this. You are to be assembled in the name and authority of Christ. I shall be virtually present. And you are to deliver such a one to Satan, ‘by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ.’” That is, it is to be done by you; and the miraculous power which will be evinced in the case will proceed from the Lord Jesus. The word “power” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δύναμις</span></span> dunamis is used commonly in the New Testament to denote some miraculous and extraordinary power; and here evidently means that the Lord Jesus would put forth such a power in the infliction of pain and for the preservation of the purity of his church.</p>
