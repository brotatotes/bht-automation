<p style=" "><b>To deliver - </b>This is the sentence which is to be executed. You are to deliver him to Satan, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto Satan - </b>Beza, and the Latin fathers, suppose that this is only an expression of excommunication. They say, that in the Scriptures there are but two kingdoms recognized - the kingdom of God, or the church, and the kingdom of the world, which is regarded as under the control of Satan; and that to exclude a man from one is to subject him to the dominion of the other. There is some foundation for this opinion; and there can be no doubt that excommunication is here intended, and that, by excommunication, the offender was in some sense placed under the control of Satan. It is further evident that it is here supposed that by being thus placed under him the offender would be subject to corporal inflictions by the agency of Satan, which are here called the “destruction of the flesh.” Satan is elsewhere referred to as the author of bodily diseases. Thus, in the case of Job, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+2:7">Job 2:7</span>. A similar instance is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>, where Paul says he had delivered Hymeneus and Alexander to “Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme.” It may be observed here that though this was to be done by the concurrence of the church, as having a right to administer discipline, yet it was directed by apostolic authority; and there is no evidence that this was the usual form of excommunication, nor ought it now to be used. There was evidently miraculous power evinced in this case, and that power has long since ceased in the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the destruction of the flesh - </b>We may observe here:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That this does not mean that the man was to die under the infliction of the censure, for the object was to recover him; and it is evident that, whatever he suffered as the consequence of this, he survived it, and Paul again instructed the Corinthians to admit him to their fellowship, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:7">2 Corinthians 2:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It was designed to punish him for licentiousness of life - often called in the Scriptures one of the sins, or works of the flesh <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19">Galatians 5:19</span>, and the design was that the punishment should follow “in the line of the offence,” or be a just retribution - as punishment often does. Many have supposed that by the “destruction of the flesh” Paul meant only the destruction of his fleshly appetites or carnal affections; and that he supposed that this would be effected by the act of excommunication. But it is very evident from the Scriptures that the apostles were imbued with the power of inflicting diseases or bodily calamities for crimes. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span>. What this bodily malady was we have no means of knowing. It is evident that it was not of very long duration, since when the apostle exhorts them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:7">2 Corinthians 2:7</span> again to receive him, there is no mention made of his suffering then under it - This was an extraordinary and miraculous power. It was designed for the government of the church in its infancy, when everything was suited to show the direct agency of God; and it ceased, doubtless, with the apostles. The church now has no such power. It cannot now work miracles; and all its discipline now is to be moral discipline, designed not to inflict bodily pain and penalties, but to work a moral reformation in the offender.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That the spirit may be saved - </b>That his soul might be saved; that he might be corrected, humbled, and reformed by these sufferings, and recalled to the paths of piety and virtue. This expresses the true design of the discipline of the church, and it ought never to be inflicted but with a direct intention to benefit the offender, and to save the soul. Even when he is cut off and disowned, the design should not be vengeance, or punishment merely, but it should be to recover him and save him from ruin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the day of the Lord Jesus - </b>The Day of Judgment when the Lord Jesus shall come, and shall collect his people to himself.</p>
