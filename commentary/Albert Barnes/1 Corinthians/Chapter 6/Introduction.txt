<p style=" ">The main design of this chapter is to reprove the Corinthians for the practice of going to law before pagan courts, or magistrates, instead of settling their differences among themselves. It seems that after their conversion they were still in the habit of carrying their causes before pagan tribunals, and this the apostle regarded as contrary to the genius and spirit of the Christian religion, and as tending to expose religion to contempt in the eyes of the people of the world. He, therefore, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1-7">1 Corinthians 6:1-7</span>, reproves this practice, and shows them that their differences should be settled among themselves. It seems also that the spirit of litigation and of covetousness had led them in some instances to practice fraud and oppression of each other, and he, therefore, takes occasion <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:8-11">1 Corinthians 6:8-11</span> to show that this was wholly inconsistent with the hope of heaven and the nature of Christianity.</p>
<p style=" ">It would seem, also, that some at Corinth had not only indulged in these and kindred vices, but had actually defended them. This was done by plausible, but sophistical arguments, drawn from the strong passions of people; from the fact that the body was made for eating and drinking, etc. To these arguments the apostle replies in the close of the chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:12-20">1 Corinthians 6:12-20</span>, and especially considers the sin of fornication, to which they were particularly exposed in Corinth, and shows the heinousness of it, and its entire repugnance to the pure gospel of Christ.</p>
