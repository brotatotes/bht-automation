<p style=" "><b>And God hath both raised up ... - </b>This is the “second” argument against indulgences in this sin. It is this. “We are united to Christ. God has raised him from the dead, and made his body glorified. Our bodies will be like his (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>); and since our body is to be raised up by the power of God; since it is to be perfectly pure and holy, and since this is to be done by his agency, it is wrong that it should be devoted to purposes of pollution and lust.” It is unworthy:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Of our connection with that pure Saviour who has been raised from the dead - the image of our resurrection from the death and defilements of sin (compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1-12">Romans 6:1-12</span>); and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Unworthy of the hope that our bodies shall be raised up to perfect and immortal purity in the heavens. No argument could be stronger. A deep sense of our union with a pure and risen Saviour, and a lively hope of immortal purity, would do more than all other things to restrain from licentious indulgences.</p>
