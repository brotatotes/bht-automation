<p style=" "><b>What! know ye not ... - </b>This is the fifth argument against this sin. The Holy Spirit dwells in us; our bodies are his temples; and they should not be defiled and polluted by sin; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16-17">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</span>. As this Spirit is in us, and as it is given us by God, we ought not to dishonor the gift and the giver by pollution and vice.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And ye are not your own - </b>This is the sixth argument which Paul uses. We are purchased; we belong to God; we are his by redemption; by a precious price paid; and we are bound, therefore, to devote ourselves, body, soul, and spirit, as he directs, to the glory of his name, not to the gratification of the flesh; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7-8">Romans 14:7-8</span>.</p>
