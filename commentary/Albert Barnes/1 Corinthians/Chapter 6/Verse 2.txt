<p style=" "><b>Do ye not know ... - </b>The object of this verse is evidently to show that Christians were qualified to determine controversies which might arise among themselves. This the apostle shows by reminding them that they shall be engaged in determining matters of much more moment than those which could arise among the members of a church on earth; and that if qualified for that, they must be regarded as qualified to express a judgment on the questions which might arise among their brethren in the churches.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The saints - </b>“Christians,” for the word is evidently used in the same sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1">1 Corinthians 6:1</span>. The apostle says that they knew this, or that this was so well established a doctrine that none could doubt it. It was to be admitted on all hands.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall judge the world - </b>A great variety of interpretations has been given to this passage. Grotius supposes it means that they shall be first judged by Christ, and then act as assessors to him in the judgment, or join with him in condemning the wicked; and he appeals to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>, where Christ says that they which have followed him should “sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>. Whitby supposes that it means that Christians are to judge or condemn the world by their example, or that there shall be Christian magistrates, according to the prophecy of Isaiah <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:23">Isaiah 49:23</span>, and Daniel <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:18">Daniel 7:18</span> - Rosenmuller supposes it means that Christians are to judge the errors and sins of people pertaining to religion, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:13">1 Corinthians 2:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:16">1 Corinthians 2:16</span>; and that they ought to be able, therefore, to judge the smaller matters pertaining to this life. Bloomfield, and the Greek fathers, and commentators, suppose that this means, that the saints will furnish matter to condemn the world; that is, by their lives and example they shall be the occasion of the greater condemnation of the world. But to this there are obvious objections:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It is an unusual meaning of the word “judge.”</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It does not meet the case before us.</p>
<p style=" ">The apostle is evidently saying that Christians will occupy so high and important a station in the work of judging the world that they ought to be regarded as qualified to exercise judgment on the things pertaining to this life; but the fact that their holy lives shall be the occasion of the deeper condemnation of the world does not seem to furnish any plain reason for this - To the opinion, also, of Whitby, Lightfoot, Vitringa, etc. that it refers to the fact that Christians would be magistrates, and governors, etc. according to the predictions of Isaiah and Daniel, there are obvious objections:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The judgment to which Paul in this verse refers is different from that pertaining to things of this life <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span>, but the judgment which Christian magistrates would exercise, as such, would relate to them.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It is not easy to see in this interpretation how, or in what sense, the saints shall judge the angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span>, the common interpretation, that of Grotius, Beza, Calvin, Doddridge, etc. is that it refers to the future judgment, and that Christians will on that day be employed in some manner in judging the world.</p>
<p style=" ">That this is the true interpretation, is apparent for the following reasons:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It is the obvious interpretation - that which will strike the great mass of people, and is likely, therefore, to be the true one.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It accords with the account in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) It is the only one which gives a fair interpretation to the declaration that the saints should judge angels in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span>. If asked “in what way” this is to be done, it may be answered, that it may be meant simply that Christians shall be exalted to the right hand of the Judge, and shall encompass his throne; that they shall assent to, and approve of his judgment, that they shall be elevated to a post of honor and favor, as if they were associated with him in the Judgment. They shall then he regarded as his friends, and express their approbation, and that “with a deep sense of its justice,” of the condemnation of the wicked. Perhaps the idea is, not that they shall “pronounce” sentence, which will be done by the Lord Jesus, but that they shall then be qualified to see the justice of the condemnation which shall be passed on the wicked; they shall have a clear and distinct view of the case; they shall even see the propriety of their everlasting punishment, and shall not only approve it, but be qualified to enter into the subject, and to pronounce upon it intelligently. And the argument of the apostle is, that if they would be qualified to pronounce on the eternal doom of men and angels; if they had such views of justice and right, and such integrity as to form an opinion and express it in regard to the everlasting destiny of an immense host of immortal beings, assuredly they ought to be qualified to express their sense of the smaller transactions in this life, and pronounce an opinion between man and man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are ye unworthy - </b>Are you disqualified.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The smallest matters - </b>Matters of least consequence - matters of little moment, scarcely worth naming compared with the great and important realities of eternity. The “smallest matters” here mean, the causes, suits, and litigations relating to property, etc.</p>
