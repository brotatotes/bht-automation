<p style=" "><b>I speak to your shame - </b>I declare that which is a reproach to you, that your matters of dispute are carried before pagan tribunals.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is it so ... - </b>Can it be that in the Christian church - the church collected in refined and enlightened Corinth - there is not a single member so wise, intelligent and prudent that his brethren may have confidence in him, and refer their causes to him? Can this be the case in a church that boasts so much of its wisdom, and that prides itself so much in the number and qualifications of its intelligent members?</p>
