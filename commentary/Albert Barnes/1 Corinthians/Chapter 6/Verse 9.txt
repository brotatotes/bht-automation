<p style=" "><b>Know ye not ... - </b>The apostle introduces the declaration in this verse to show the evil of their course, and especially of the injustice which they did one to another, and their attempt to enforce and maintain the evil by an appeal to the pagan tribunals. He assures them, therefore, that the unjust could not be saved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The unrighteous - </b>The unjust <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄδικοι</span></span> adikoi - such as he had just mentioned - they who did injustice to others, and attempted to do it under the sanction of the courts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall not inherit - </b>Shall not possess; shall not enter into. The kingdom of heaven is often represented as an “inheritance;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:29">Matthew 19:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:17">Mark 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:25">Luke 10:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:18">Luke 18:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:50">1 Corinthians 15:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The kingdom of God - </b>Cannot be saved; cannot enter into heaven; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. This may refer either to the kingdom of God in heaven; or to the church on earth - most probably the former. But the sense is the same essentially, whichever is meant. The man who is not fit to enter into the one is not fit to enter into the other. The man who is fit to enter the kingdom of God on earth, shall also enter into that in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be not deceived - </b>A most important direction to be given to all. It implies:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) That they were in danger of being deceived:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) It implies, that there was “no necessity” of their being deceived. They might know the truth. They might easily understand these matters. It might be plain to them that those who indulged in these things could not be saved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) It implies that it was of high importance that they should not be deceived. For:</p>

<p style=" "><b>Nor effeminate - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλακοὶ</span></span> malakoi. This word occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:8">Matthew 11:8</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:25">Luke 7:25</span>, where it is applied to clothing, and translated “soft raiment;” that is, the light, thin garments worn by the rich and great. It occurs no where else in the New Testament except here. Applied to morals, as it is here, it denotes those who give themselves up to a soft, luxurious, and indolent way of living; who make self-indulgence the grand object of life; who can endure no hardship, and practice no self-denial in the cause of duty and of God. The word is applied in the classic writers to the Cinaedi, the Pathics, or Catamites; those who are given up to wantonness and sensual pleasures, or who are kept to be prostituted to others. Diog. Laer. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:5">Luke 7:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:4">Luke 7:4</span>. Xenoph.

The connection here seems to demand such an interpretation, as it occurs in the description of vices of the same class - sensual and corrupt indulgences - It is well known that this vice was common among the Greeks - and particularly prevailed at Corinth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Abusers of themselves with mankind - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀρσενοκοῖτοι</span></span> arsenokoitoi. Paederastae or Sodomites. Those who indulged in a vice that was common among all the pagan; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:27">Romans 1:27</span>.</p>
