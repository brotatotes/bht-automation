<p style=" "><b>Know ye not ... - </b>This is the third argument against licentiousness. It is, that we as Christians are united to Christ (compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1">John 15:1</span> ff); and that it is abominable to take the members of Christ and subject them to pollution and sin. Christ was pure - wholly pure. We are professedly united to him. We are bound therefore to be pure, as he was. Shall that which is a part, as it were, of the pure and holy Saviour, be prostituted to impure and unholy embraces?</p>
<p style=" "><b>God forbid! - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>. This expresses the deep abhorrence of the apostle at the thought. It needed not argument to show it. The whole world revolted at the idea; and language could scarcely express the abomination of the very thought.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Know ye not ... - </b>This is designed to confirm and strengthen what he had just said.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He which is joined - </b>Who is attached to; or who is connected with.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is one body - </b>That is, is to he regarded as one; is closely and intimately united. Similar expressions occur in Classic writers. See Grotius and Bloomfield.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For two, saith he ... - </b>This Paul illustrates by a reference to the formation of the marriage connection in Ger. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>. He cannot be understood as affirming that that passage had original reference to illicit connections; but be uses it for purposes of illustration. God had declared that the man and his wife became one; in a similar sense in unlawful connections the parties became one.</p>
