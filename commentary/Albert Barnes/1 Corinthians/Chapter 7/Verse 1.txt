<p style=" "><b>Now, concerning ... - </b>In reply to your inquiries. The first, it seems, was in regard to the propriety of marriage; that is, whether it was lawful and expedient.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is good - </b>It is well. It is fit, convenient, or, it is suited to the present circumstances, or, the thing itself is well and expedient in certain circumstances. The apostle did not mean that marriage was unlawful, for he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span> that “marriage is honorable in all.” But he here admits, with one of the parties in Corinth, that it was well, and proper in some circumstances, not to enter into the marriage relation; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7-8">1 Corinthians 7:7-8</span>, <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 7:26</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:28">1 Corinthians 7:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:31-32">1 Corinthians 7:31-32</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not to touch a woman - </b>Not to be connected with her by marriage. Xenophon (Cyro. b. 1) uses the same word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἅπτω</span></span> haptō, “to touch”) to denote marriage; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:4">Genesis 20:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:6">Genesis 20:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+26:11">Genesis 26:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+6:29">Proverbs 6:29</span>.</p>
