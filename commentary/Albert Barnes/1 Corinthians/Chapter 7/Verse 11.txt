<p style=" "><b>But and if she depart - </b>If she have withdrawn by a rash and foolish act; if she has attempted to dissolve the marriage vow, she is to remain unmarried, or be reconciled. She is not at liberty to marry another. This may refer, I suppose, to instances where wives, ignorant of the rule of Christ, and supposing that they had a right to separate themselves from their husbands, had rashly left them, and had supposed that the marriage contract was dissolved. Paul tells them that this was impossible; and that if they had so separated from their husbands, the pure laws of Christianity, did not recognize this right, and they must either be reconciled to their husbands, or remain alone. The marriage tie was so sacred that it could not be dissolved by the will of either party.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let her remain unmarried - </b>That is, let her not marry another.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or be reconciled to her husband - </b>Let this be done, if possible. If it cannot be, let her remain unmarried. It was a duty to be reconciled if it was possible. If not, she should not violate her vows to her husband so far as to marry another. It is evident that this rule is still binding, and that no one who has separated from her husband, whatever be the cause, unless there be a regular divorce, according to the law of Christ <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>, can be at liberty to marry again.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And let not the husband - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>. This right, granted under the Jewish law, and practiced among all the pagan, was to be taken away wholly under the gospel. The marriage tie was to be regarded as sacred; and the tyranny of man over woman was to cease.</p>
