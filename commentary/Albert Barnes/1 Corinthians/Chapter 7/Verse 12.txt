<p style=" "><b>But to the rest - </b>“I have spoken in regard to the duties of the unmarried, and the question whether it is right and advisable that they should marry, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1-9">1 Corinthians 7:1-9</span>. I have also uttered the command of the Lord in regard to those who are married, and the question whether separation and divorce were proper. Now in regard to “the rest of the person’s and cases” referred to, I will deliver my opinion.” “The rest,” or remainder, here referred to, relates particularly to the cases in which one party was a Christian and the other not. In the previous verses he had delivered the solemn, explicit law of Christ, that divorce was to take place on neither side, and in no instance, except agreeably. to the law of Christ; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>. That was settled by divine authority. In the subsequent verses he discusses a different question; whether a “voluntary separation” was not advisable and proper when the one party was a Christian and the other not. The word “rest” refers to these instances, and the questions which would arise under this inquiry.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not the Lord - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:6">1 Corinthians 7:6</span>. “I do not claim, in this advice, to be under the influence of inspiration; I have no express command on the subject from the Lord; but I deliver my opinion as a servant of the Lord <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40">1 Corinthians 7:40</span>, and as having a right to offer advice, even when I have no express command from God, to a church which I have founded, and which has consulted me on the subject.” This was a case in which both he and they were to follow the principles of Christian prudence and propriety, when there was no express commandment. Many such cases may occur. But few, perhaps none, can occur, in which some Christian principle shall not be found, that will be sufficient to direct the anxious inquirer after truth and duty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If any brother - </b>Any Christian.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That believeth not - </b>That is not a Christian; one who is a pagan.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And if she be pleased - </b>If it seems best to her; if she consents; approves of living together still. There might be many cases where the wife or the husband, that was not a Christian, would be so opposed to Christianity, and so violent in their opposition, that they would not be willing to live with a Christian. When this was the case, the Christian husband or wife could not prevent the separation. When this was not the case, they were not to seek a separation themselves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To dwell with him - </b>To remain in connection with him as his wife, though they differed on the subject of religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let him not put her away - </b>Though she is a pagan, though opposed to his religion, yet the marriage vow is sacred and inviolable. It is not to be sundered by any change which can take place in the opinions of either party. It is evident that if a man were at liberty to dissolve the marriage tie, or to discard his wife when his own opinions were changed on the subject of religion, that it would at once destroy all the sacredness of the marriage union, and render it a nullity. Even, therefore, when there is a difference of opinion on the vital subject of religion, the tie is not dissolved; but the only effect of religion should be, to make the converted husband or wife more tender, kind, affectionate, and faithful than they were before; and all the more so as their partners are without the hopes of the gospel, and as they may be won to love the Saviour, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:16">1 Corinthians 7:16</span>.</p>
