<p style=" "><b>Circumcision is nothing ... - </b>It is of no consequence in itself. It is not that which God requires now. And the mere external rite can be of no consequence one way or the other. The heart is all; and that is what God demands; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But the keeping of the commandments of God - </b>Is something, is the main thing, is everything; and this can be done whether a man is circumcised or not.</p>
