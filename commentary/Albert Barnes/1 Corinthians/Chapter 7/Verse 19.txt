Circumcision is nothing ... - It is of no consequence in itself. It is not that which God requires now. And the mere external rite can be of no consequence one way or the other. The heart is all; and that is what God demands; see the notes at Romans 2:29.But the keeping of the commandments of God - Is something, is the main thing, is everything; and this can be done whether a man is circumcised or not.
