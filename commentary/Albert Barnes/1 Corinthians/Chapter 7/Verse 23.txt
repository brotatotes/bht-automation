<p style=" "><b>Ye are bought with a price - </b>Though you are slaves to people, yet you have been purchased for God by the blood of His Son; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>. You are, therefore, in his sight of inestimable worth, and are bound to be His.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be not ye the servants of men - </b>That is, “Do not regard yourselves as the slaves of men. Even in your humble relation of life, even as servants under the laws of the land, regard yourselves as the servants of God, as obeying and serving him “even in this relation,” since all those who are bought with a price - all Christians, whether bond or free - are in fact the servant (slaves, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοῦλοι</span></span> douloi) of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22">1 Corinthians 7:22</span>. in this relation, therefore, esteem yourselves as the servants of God, as bound by his laws, as subject to him, and as really serving him, while you yield all proper obedience to your master.” Rosenmuller, Grotius, and some others, however, think that this refers to Christians in general; and that the apostle means to caution them against subjecting themselves to needless rites and customs which the false teachers would impose on them. Others have supposed (as Doddridge) that it means that they should not sell themselves into slavery; but assuredly a caution of this kind was not needful. The view given above I regard as the interpretation demanded by the connection. And in this view it would promote contentment, and would even prevent their taking any improper measures to disturb the relations of social life, by the high and solemn consideration that even in that relation they were in common with all Christians, the true and real servants of God. They belonged to God, and they should serve Him. In all things which their masters commanded, that were in accordance with the will of God, and that could be done with a quiet conscience, they were to regard themselves as serving God; if at any time they were commanded to do that which God had forbidden, they were to remember that they were the servants of God, and that he was to be obeyed rather than man.</p>
