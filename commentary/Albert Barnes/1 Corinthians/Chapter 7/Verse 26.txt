<p style=" "><b>I suppose - </b>I think; I give the following advice.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the present distress - </b>In the present state of trial. The word “distress” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀνάγκην</span></span> anagkēn, necessity) denotes calamity, persecution, trial, etc.; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:23">Luke 21:23</span>. The word rendered “present” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐνεστῶσαν</span></span> enestōsan) denotes that which “urges on,” or that which at that time presses on, or afflicts. Here it is implied:</p>
<p style=" ">What the “urgent distress” of this time was, is not certainly known. If the Epistle was written about 59 a.d. (see the introduction), it was in the time of Nero; and probably he had already begun to oppress and persecute Christians. At all events, it is evident that the Christians at Corinth were subject to some trials which rendered the cares of the marriage life undesirable.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is good for a man so to be - </b>The emphasis here is on the word “so” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οὕτως</span></span> houtōs; that is, it is best for a man to conduct “in the following manner;” the word so referring to the advice which follows. “I advise that he conduct in the following manner, to wit.” Most commentators suppose that it means “as he is:” that is, unmarried; but the interpretation proposed above best suits the connection. The advice given is in the following verses.</p>
