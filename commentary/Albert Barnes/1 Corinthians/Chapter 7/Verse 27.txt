<p style=" "><b>Art thou bound unto a wife? - </b>Art thou already married? Marriage is often thus represented as a “tie,” a “bond,” etc.; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Seek not to be loosed - </b>Seek not a “dissolution” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λύσιν</span></span> lusin) of the connection, either by divorce or by a separation from each other; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10-17">1 Corinthians 7:10-17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Art thou loosed from a wife? - </b>Art thou unmarried? It should have been rendered “free from” a wife; or art thou single? It does not imply of necessity that the person had been married, though it may have that meaning, and signify those who had been separated from a wife by her death. There is no necessity of supposing that Paul refers to persons who had divorced their wives. So Grotius, Schleusner, Doddridge, etc.</p>
