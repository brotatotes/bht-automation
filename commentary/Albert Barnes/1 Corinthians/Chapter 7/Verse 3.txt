<p style=" "><b>Let the husband ... - </b>“Let them not imagine that there is any virtue in bring separate from each other, as if they were in a state of celibacy” - “Doddridge.” They are bound to each other; in every way they are to evince kindness, and to seek to promote the happiness and purity of each other. There is a great deal of delicacy used here by Paul, and his expression is removed as far as possible from the grossness of pagan writers. His meaning is plain; but instead of using a word to express it which would be indelicate and offensive, he uses one which is not indelicate in the slightest degree. The word which he uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εὔνοιαν</span></span> eunoian,” benevolence”) denotes kindness, good-will, affection of mind. And by the use of the word “due” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὀφειλομένην</span></span> opheilomenēn, he reminds them of the sacredness of their vow, and of the fact that in person, property, and in every respect, they belong to each other. It was necessary to give this direction, for the contrary might have been regarded as proper by many who would have supposed there was special virtue and merit in living separate from each other; as facts have shown that many have imbibed such an idea - and it was not possible to give the rule with more delicacy than Paul has done. Many mss., however, instead of “due benevolence,” read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὀφειλὴν</span></span> opheilēn, “a debt, or that which is owed;” and this reading has been adopted by Griesbach in the text. Homer, with a delicacy not unlike the apostle Paul, uses the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλότητα</span></span> <i>filotēta</i>, “friendship,” to express the same idea.</p>
