<p style=" "><b>But I would have you - </b>I would advise you to such a course of life as should leave you without carefulness My advice is regulated by that wish, and that wish guides me in giving it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Without carefulness - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀμερίμνους</span></span> amerimnous). Without anxiety, solicitude, care; without such a necessary attention to the things of this life as to take off your thoughts and affections from heavenly objects; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25-31">Matthew 6:25-31</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>careth for the things that belong to the Lord - </b>Margin, “The things of the Lord;” the things of religion. His attention is not distracted by the cares of this life; his time is not engrossed, and his affections alienated by an attendance on the concerns of a family, and especially by solicitude for them in times of trial and persecution. He can give his main attention to the things of religion. He is at leisure to give his chief thoughts and anxieties to the advancement of the Redeemer’s kingdom. Paul’s own example showed that this was the course which he preferred; and showed also that in some instances it was lawful and proper for a man to remain unmarried, and to give himself entirely to the work of the Lord. But the divine commandment <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:28">Genesis 1:28</span>, and the commendation everywhere bestowed upon marriage in the Scriptures, as well as the nature of the case, show that it was not designed that celibacy should be general.</p>
