<p style=" "><b>careth for the things of the world - </b>Is under a necessity of giving attention to the things of the world; or cannot give his undivided attention and interest to the things of religion. This would be especially true in times of persecution.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How he may please his wife - </b>How he may gratify her; how he may accommodate himself to her temper and wishes, to make her happy. The apostle here plainly intimates that there would be danger that the man would be so anxious to gratify his wife, as to interfere with his direct religious duties. This may be done in many ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)The time may be taken up in devotion to her, which should be given to secret prayer, and to the duties of religion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)She may demand his “society and attention” when he ought to be engaged in doing good to others, and endeavoring to advance the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)She may be frivilous and fashionable, and may lead him into improper expenses, into a style of living that may be unsuitable for a Christian, and into society where his piety will be injured, and his devotion to God lessened; or,</p>
<p style=" ">Many a husband has thus been injured by a frivilous, thoughtless, and imprudent wife; and though that wife may be a Christian, yet her course may be such as shall greatly retard his growth in grace, and mar the beauty of his piety.</p>
