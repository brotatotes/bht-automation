<p style=" "><b>For your own profit - </b>That you may avail yourselves of all your advantages and privileges, and pursue such a course as shall tend most to advance your personal piety and salvation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not that I may cast a snare upon you - </b>The word rendered “snare” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρόχον</span></span> brochon) means a cord, a rope, a bond; and the sense is, that Paul would not BinD them by any rule which God had not made; or that he would not restrain them from that which is lawful, and which the welfare of society usually requires. Paul means, that his object in his advice was their welfare; it was not by any means to bind, fetter, or restrain them from any course which would be for their real happiness, but to promote their real and permanent advantage. The idea which is here presented by the word “snare,” is usually conveyed by the use of the word “yoke” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>, and sometimes by the word “burden;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span>.</p>
