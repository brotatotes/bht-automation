<p style=" "><b>The wife hath not power ... - </b>By the marriage covenant that power, in this respect, is transferred to the husband,</p>
<p style=" "><b>And likewise, also, the husband - </b>The equal rights of husband and wife, in the Scriptures, are everywhere maintained. They are to regard themselves as united in most intimate union, and in most tender ties.</p>
