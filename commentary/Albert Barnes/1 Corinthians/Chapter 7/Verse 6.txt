<p style=" "><b>But I speak this by permission ... - </b>It is not quite certain whether the word “this” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοῦτο</span></span> touto), in this verse, refers to what precedes, or to what follows. On this commentators are divided. The more natural and obvious interpretation would be to refer it to the preceding statement. I am inclined to think that the mare natural construction is the true one. and that Paul refers to what he had said in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span>. Most recent commentators, as Macknight and Rosenmuller, however, suppose it refers to what follows, and appeal to similar places in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joe+1:2">Joel 1:2</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Psa 49:2</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>. Calvin supposes it refers to what was said in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By permission - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγγνώμην</span></span> sungnōmēn. This word means “indulgence,” or “permission,” and stands opposed to that which is expressly enjoined; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>. “I am ‘allowed’ to say this; I have no express command on the subject; I give it as my opinion; I do not speak it directly under the influence of divine inspiration;” see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10">1 Corinthians 7:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40">1 Corinthians 7:40</span>. Paul here does not claim to be under inspiration in these directions which he specifics. But this is no argument against his inspiration in general, but rather the contrary. For:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It shows that he was an honest man, and was disposed to state the exact truth. An impostor, pretending to inspiration, would have claimed to have been always inspired. Who ever heard of a pretender to divine inspiration admitting that in any thing he was not under divine guidance? Did Mahomet ever do this? Do impostors now ever do it?</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It shows that in other cases, where no exception is made, he claimed to be inspired. These few exceptions, which he expressly makes, prove that in everywhere else he claimed to be under the influence of inspiration.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) We are to suppose, therefore, that in all his writings where he makes no express exceptions, (and the exceptions are very few in number,) Paul claimed to be inspired. Macknight, however, and some others, understand this as mere adVice, as an inspired man, though not as a command,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not of commandment - </b>Not by express instruction from the Lord; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>. I do not claim in this to be under the influence of inspiration; and my counsel here may be regarded, or not, as you may be able to receive it.</p>
