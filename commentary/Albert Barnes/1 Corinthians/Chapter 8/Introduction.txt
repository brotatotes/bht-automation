<p style=" ">In this chapter another subject is discussed, which had been proposed by the congregation at Corinth for the decision of the apostle. “Whether it was right for Christians to partake of the meat that had been offered in sacrifice to idols?” On this question there would be doubtless a difference of opinion among the Corinthian Christians. When those sacrifices were made to pagan gods, a part of the animal was given to the priest that officiated, a part was consumed on the altar, and a part (probably the principal part) was the property of him who offered it. This part was either eaten by him at home, as food which had been in some sense consecrated or blessed by having been offered to an idol; or it was partaken of at a feast in honor of the idol; or it was in some instances exposed for sale in the market in the same way as other meat. Whether, therefore, it would be right to partake of that food, either when invited to the house of a pagan friend, or when it was exposed for sale in the market, was a question which could not but present itself to a conscientious Christian. The objection to partaking of it would be, that to partake of it either in the temples or at the feasts of their pagan neighbors, would be to lend their countenance to idolatry. On the other hand, there were many who supposed that it was always lawful, and that the scruples of their brethren were needless. Some of their arguments Paul has alluded to in the course of the chapter: they were, that an idol was nothing in the world; that there was but one God, and that everyone must know this; and that, therefore, there was no danger that any worshipper of the, true God could be led into the absurdities of idolatry, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4-6">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</span>. To this the apostle replies, that though there might be this knowledge, yet:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Knowledge sometimes puffed up, and made us proud, and that we should be careful lest it should lead us astray by our vain self-confidence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1-2">1 Corinthians 8:1-2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That all had not that knowledge <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>; and that they even then, notwithstanding all the light which had been shed around them by Christianity, and notwithstanding the absurdity of idolatry, still regarded an idol as a real existence, as a god, and worshipped it as such; and that it would be highly improper to countenance in any way that idea. He left the inference, therefore, that it was not proper “from this argument,” to partake of the sacrifices to idols.</p>
<p style=" ">A second argument in favor of partaking of that food is alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>, to wit, that it must be in itself a matter of indifference; that it could make no difference before God, where all depended on moral purity and holiness of heart, whether a man had eaten meat or not; that we were really no better or worse for it; and that, therefore, it was proper to partake of that food. To this Paul replies:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That the effect on a weak brother would be to lead him to suppose that an idol was something, and to confirm him in his supposition that an idol should have some regard, and be worshipped in the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)That the consequence might be, that a Christian of little information and experience might be drawn away and perish, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:11">1 Corinthians 8:11</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)That this would be to sin against Christ, if a feeble Christian should be thus destroyed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:12">1 Corinthians 8:12</span>. And,</p>
