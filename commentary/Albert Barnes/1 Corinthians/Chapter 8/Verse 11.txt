<p style=" "><b>And through thy knowledge - </b>Because you knew that an idol was nothing, and that there could be really no danger of falling into idolatry from partaking of these entertainments. You will thus be the means of deceiving and destroying him. The argument of the apostle here is, that if This was to be the result, the duty of those who had this knowledge was plain.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall the weak brother - </b>The uninformed and ignorant Christian. That it means real Christian there can be no doubt. Because:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It is the usual term by which Christians are designated - the endearing name of “brother;” and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The scope of the passage requires it so to be understood; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:20">Romans 14:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Perish - </b>Be destroyed; ruined; lost; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:28">John 10:28</span>. So the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀπολεῖται</span></span> apoleitai properly and usually signifies. The sense is, that the tendency of this course would be to lead the weak brother into sin, to apostasy, and to ruin. But this does not prove that any who were truly converted should apostatize and be lost; for:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) There may be a tendency to a thing, and yet that thing may never happen. It may be arrested, and the event not occur.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The warning designed to prevent it may be effectual, and be the means of saving. A man in a canoe floating down the Niagara river may have a tendency to go over the falls; but he may be hailed from the shore, and the hailing may be effectual, and he may be saved. The call to him was designed to save him, and actually had that effect. So it may be in the warnings to Christians.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The apostle does not say that any true Christian would be lost. He puts a question; and affirms that if “one” thing was done, “another might” follow. But this is not affirming that anyone would be lost. So I might say that if the man continued to float on toward the falls of Niagara, he would be destroyed. If one thing was done, the other would be a consequence. But this would be very different from a statement that a man “had actually” gone over the falls, and been lost.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) It is elsewhere abundantly proved that no one who has been truly converted will apostatize and be destroyed; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:28">John 10:28</span>; compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29-30">Romans 8:29-30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For whom Christ died - </b>This is urged as an argument why we should not do anything that would tend to destroy the souls of people. And no stronger argument could be used. The argument is, that we should not do anything that would tend to frustrate the work of Christ, that would render the shedding of his blood vain. The possibility of doing this is urged; and that bare possibility should deter us from a course of conduct that might have this tendency. It is an appeal drawn from the deep and tender love, the sufferings, and the dying groans of the Son of God. If He endured so much to save the soul, assuredly we should not pursue a course that would tend to destroy it. If he denied himself so much to redeem, we should not, assuredly, be so fond of self-gratification as to be unwilling to abandon anything that would tend to destroy.</p>
