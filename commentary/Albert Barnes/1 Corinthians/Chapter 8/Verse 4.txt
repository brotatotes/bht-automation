<p style=" "><b>As concerning therefore ... - </b>The parenthesis closes with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:3">1 Corinthians 8:3</span>. The apostle now proceeds to the real question in debate, and repeats in this verse the question, and the admission that all had knowledge. The admission that all had knowledge proceeds through <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4-6">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</span>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span> he gives the answer to it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4-6">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</span> everything is admitted by Paul which they asked in regard to the real extent of their knowledge on this subject; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span> he shows that even on the ground of this admission, the conclusion would not follow that it was right to partake of the food offered in sacrifice in the temple of an idol.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The eating of those things ... - </b>Whether it is right to eat them. Here the question is varied somewhat from what it was in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>, but substantially the same inquiry is stated. The question was, whether it was right for Christians to eat the meat of animals that had been slain in sacrifice to idols.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We know - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>. We Corinthians know; and Paul seems fully to admit that they had all the knowledge which they claimed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>. But his object was to show that even admitting that, it would not follow that it would be right to partake of that meat. It is well to bear in mind that the object of their statement in regard to knowledge was, to show that there could be no impropriety in partaking of the food. This argument the apostle answers in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That an idol is nothing - </b>Is not the true God; is not a proper object of worship. We are not so stupid as to suppose that the block of wood, or the carved image, or the chiseled marble is a real intelligence and is conscious and capable of receiving worship, or benefiting its volaries. We fully admit, and know, that the whole thing is delusive; and there can be no danger that, by partaking of the food offered in sacrifice to them, we should ever be brought to a belief of the stupendous falsehood that they are true objects of worship, or to deny the true God. There is no doubt that the more intelligent pagan had this knowledge; and doubtless nearly all Christians possessed it, though a few who had been educated in the grosser views of paganism might still have regarded the idol with a superstitious reverence, For whatever might have been the knowledge of statesmen and philosophers on the subject, it was still doubtless true that the great mass of the pagan world did regard the dumb idols as the proper objects of worship, and supposed that they were inhabited by invisible spirits - the gods. For purposes of state, and policy, and imposition, the lawgivers and priests of the pagan world were careful to cherish this delusion; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is nothing - </b>Is delusive; is imaginary. There may have been a reference here to the name of an idol among the Hebrews. They called idols <span class="_800000">אלילים </span>'ĕlı̂yliym (Elilim), or in the singular <span class="_800000">אליל</span> 'ĕlı̂yl (Elil}, vain, null, nothingworth, nothingness, vanity, weakness, etc.; indicating their vanity and powerlessness; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+26:1">Leviticus 26:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+16:26">1 Chronicles 16:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:8">Isaiah 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:10">Isaiah 10:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+19:11">Isaiah 19:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+19:13">Isaiah 19:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+19:20">Isaiah 19:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+31:7">Isaiah 31:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+90:5">Psalms 90:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+30:13">Ezekiel 30:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:18">Habakkuk 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:17">Zechariah 11:17</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the world - </b>It is nothing at all; it has no power over the world; no real existence anywhere. There are no such gods as the pagans pretend to worship. There is but one God; and that fact is known to us all. The phrase “in the world” seems to be added by way of emphasis, to show the utter nothingness of idols; to explain in the most emphatic manner the belief that they had no real existence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And that there is none other God but one - </b>This was a great cardinal truth of religion; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:29">Mark 12:29</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4-5">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</span>. To keep this great truth in mind was the grand object of the Jewish economy; and this was so plain, and important, that the Corinthians supposed that it must be admitted by all. Even though they should partake of the meat that was offered in sacrifice to idols, yet they supposed it was not possible that any of them could forget the great cardinal truth that there was but one God.</p>
