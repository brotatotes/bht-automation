<p style=" "><b>But take heed - </b>This is the reply of Paul to the argument of the Corinthians in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>. “Though all that you say should be admitted to be true, as it must be; though a man is neither morally better nor worse for partaking of meat or abstaining from it; yet the grand principle to be observed is, so to act as not to injure your brethren. Though you may be no better or worse for eating or not eating, yet if your conduct shall injure others, and lead them into sin, that is a sufficient guide to determine you what to do in the case. You should abstain entirely. It is of far more importance that your brother should not be led into sin, than it is that you should partake of meat which you acknowledge <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span> is in itself of no importance.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lest by any means - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μή πως</span></span> mē pōs. You should be careful that by no conduct of yours your brother be led into sin. This is a general principle that is to regulate Christian conduct in all matters that are in themselves indifferent.</p>
<p style=" "><b>This liberty of yours - </b>This which you claim as a right; this power which you have, and the exercise of which is in itself lawful. The “liberty” or power <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐξουσία</span></span> exousia here referred to was that of partaking of the meat that was offered in sacrifice to idols; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>. A man may have a right abstractly to do a thing, but it may not be prudent or wise to exercise it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Become a stumbling-block - </b>An occasion of sin; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>; also see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>. See that it be not the occasion of leading others to sin, and to abandon their Christian profession; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To them that are weak - </b>To those professing Christians who are not fully informed or instructed in regard to the true nature of idolatry, and who still may have a superstitious regard for the gods whom their fathers worshipped.</p>
