<p style=" "><b>Am I not an apostle? - </b>This was the point to be settled; and it is probable that some at Corinth had denied that he could be an apostle, since it was requisite, in order to that, to have seen the Lord Jesus; and since it was supposed that Paul had not been a witness of his life, doctrines, and death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Am I not free? - </b>Am I not a free man; have I not the liberty which all Christians possess, and especially which all the apostles possess? The “liberty” referred to here is doubtless the privilege or right of abstaining from labor; of enjoying as others did the domestic relations of life; and of a support as a public minister and apostle. Probably some had objected to his claims of apostleship that he had not used this right, and that he was conscious that he had no claim to it. By this mode of interrogation, he strongly implies that he was a freeman, and that he had this right.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? - </b>Here it is implied, and seems to be admitted by Paul, that in order to be an “apostle” it was necessary to have seen the Saviour. This is often declared expressly; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:21-22">Acts 1:21-22</span>. The reason of this was, that the apostles were appointed to be witnesses of the life, doctrines, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and that in their “being witnesses” consisted the uniqueness of the apostolic office. That this was the case is abundantly manifest from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18-19">Matthew 28:18-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:48">Luke 24:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:21-22">Acts 1:21-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39-41">Acts 10:39-41</span>. Hence, it was essential, in order that anyone should be such a witness, and an apostle, that he should have seen the Lord Jesus. In the case of Paul, therefore, who was called to this office after the death and resurrection of the Saviour, and who had not therefore had an opportunity of seeing and hearing him when living, this was provided for by the fact that the Lord Jesus showed himself to him after his death and ascension, in order that he might have this qualification for the apostolic office, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:3-5">Acts 9:3-5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>. To the fact of his having been thus in a miraculous manner qualified for the apostolic office, Paul frequently appeals, and always with the same view that it was necessary to have seen the Lord Jesus to qualify one for this office, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14-15">Acts 22:14-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>. It follows from this, therefore, that no one was an apostle in the strict and proper sense who had not seen the Lord Jesus. And it follows, also, that the apostles could have no successors in that which constituted the uniqueness of their office; and that the office must have commenced and ended with them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are not ye my work in the Lord? - </b>Have you not been converted by my labors, or under my ministry; and are you not a proof that the Lord, when I have been claiminG to be an apostle, has owned me “as an apostle,” and blessed me in this work? God would not give his sanction to an impostor, and a false pretender; and as Paul had labored there as an apostle, this was an argument that he had been truly commissioned of God. A minister may appeal to the blessing of God on his labors in proof that he is sent of Him. And one of the best of all arguments that a man is sent from God exists where multitudes of souls are converted from sin, and turned to holiness, by his labors. What better credentials than this can a man need that he is in the employ of God? What more consoling to his own mind? What more satisfactory to the world?</p>
