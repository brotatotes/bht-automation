<p style=" "><b>Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? - </b>The word “altogether” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πάντως</span></span> pantōs) cannot mean that this was the “sole” and “only” design of the law, to teach that ministers of the gospel were entitled to support; for:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) This would be directly contrary to the law itself, which had some direct and undoubted reference to oxen;</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The scope of the argument here does not require this interpretation, since the whole object will be met by supposing that this settled a “principle” of humanity and equity in the divine law, according to which it was “proper” that ministers should have a support; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The word “altogether” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πάντως</span></span> pantōs) does not of necessity require this interpretation. It may be rendered “chiefly, mainly, principally, or doubtless;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:23">Luke 4:23</span>, “Ye will ‘surely’ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πάντως</span></span> pantōs certainly, surely, doubtless) say unto me this proverb,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:21">Acts 18:21</span>, “I must ‘by all means’ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πάντως</span></span> pantōs, certainly, surely) keep this feast; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:22">Acts 21:22</span>, “The multitude ‘must needs’ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πάντως</span></span> pantōs, will certainly, surely, inevitably) come together,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span>, “‘No doubt’ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πάντως</span></span> pantōs) this man is a murderer,” etc. The word here, therefore, means that the “principle” stated in the law about the oxen was so broad and humane, that it might “certainly, surely, particularly” be regarded as applicable to the case under consideration. An important and material argument might be drawn from it; an argument from the less to the greater. The precept enjoined justice, equity, humanity; and that was more applicable to the case of the ministers of the gospel than to the case of oxen.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For our sakes ... - </b>To show that the laws and requirements of God are humane, kind, and equitable; not that Moses had Paul or any other minister in his eye, but the “principle” was one that applied particularly to this case.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That he that ploweth ... - </b>The Greek in this place would be more literally and more properly rendered, “For (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὅτι</span></span> hoti) he that ploweth ought (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὀφείλει</span></span> opheilei) to plow in hope;” that is, in hope of reaping a harvest, or of obtaining success in his labors; and the sense is, “The man who cultivates the earth, in order that he may be excited to industry and diligence, ought to have a reasonable prospect that he shall himself be permitted to enjoy the fruit of his labors. This is the case with those who do plow; and if this should be the case with those who cultivate the earth, it is as certainly reasonable that those who labor in God’s husbandry, and who devote their strength to his service, should be encouraged with a reasonable prospect of success and support.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And that he that thresheth ... - </b>This sentence, in the Greek, is very elliptical and obscure; but the sense is, evidently, “He that thresheth ‘ought’ to partake of his hope;” that is, of the fruits of his hope, or of the result of his labor. It is fair and right that he should enjoy the fruits of his toil. So in God’s husbandry; it is right and proper that they who toil for the advancement of his cause should be supported and rewarded.” The same sentiment is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:6">2 Timothy 2:6</span>, “The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits.”</p>
