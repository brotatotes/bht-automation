<p style=" "><b>Mine answer - </b>Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ἡ ἐμὴ ἀπολογία</span></span> Hē emē apologia. My “apology;” my defense. The same word occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:1">Acts 22:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:16">Acts 25:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:7">Philippians 1:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:17">Philippians 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16">2 Timothy 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:15">1 Peter 3:15</span>; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:1">Acts 22:1</span>. Here it means his answer, or defense against those who sat in judgment on his claims to be an apostle.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To them that do examine me. - </b>To those who “inquire” of me; or who “censure” and condemn me as not having any claims to the apostolic office. The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀνακρίνω</span></span> anakrinō is properly a forensic term, and is usually applied to judges in courts; to those who sit in judgment, and investigate and decide in litigated cases brought before them; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:14">Luke 23:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:9">Acts 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:19">Acts 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:8">Acts 24:8</span>. The apostle here may possibly allude to the arrogance and pride of those who presumed to sit as judges on his qualification for the apostolic office. It is not meant that this answer had been given by Paul before this, but that this was the defense which he had to offer.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is this - </b>This which follows; the statements which are made in the following verses. In these statements (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:4-6">1 Corinthians 9:4-6</span>, etc.) he seems to have designed to take up their objections to his apostolic claims one by one, and to show that they were of no force.</p>
