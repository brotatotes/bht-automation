<p style=" "><b>And these things write we unto you - </b>These things respecting him who was manifested in the flesh, and respecting the results which flow from that.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That your joy may be full - </b>This is almost the same language which the Saviour used when addressing his disciples as he was about to leave them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:11">John 15:11</span>; and there can be little doubt that John had that declaration in remembrance when he uttered this remark. See the notes at that passage. The sense here is, that full and clear views of the Lord Jesus, and the fellowship with him and with each other, which would follow from that, would be a source of happiness. Their joy would be complete if they had that; for their real happiness was to be found in their Saviour. The best editions of the Greek Testament now read “your joy,” instead of the common reading “our joy.”</p>
