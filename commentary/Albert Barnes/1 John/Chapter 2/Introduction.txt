<p style=" ">The subjects which are introduced into this chapter are the following:</p>
<p style=" ">I. A statement of the apostle that the great object which he had in writing to them was that they should not sin; and yet if they sinned, and were conscious that they were guilty before God, they should not despair, for they had an Advocate with the Father who had made propitiation for the sins of the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1-2">1 John 2:1-2</span>. This is properly a continuation of what he had said in the close of the previous chapter, and should not have been separated from that.</p>
<p style=" ">II. The evidence that we know God, or that we are His true friends, is to be found in the fact that we keep His commandments, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:3-6">1 John 2:3-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">III. The apostle says that what he had been saying was no new commandment, but was what they had always heard concerning the nature of the gospel; but though in this respect the law of love which he meant particularly to enforce was no new commandment, none which they had not heard before, yet in another respect it was a new commandment, for it was one which in its peculiarity was originated by the Saviour, and which he meant to make the characteristic of his religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7-11">1 John 2:7-11</span>. A large part of the Epistle is taken up in explaining and enforcing this commandment requiring love to the brethren.</p>
<p style=" ">IV. The apostle specifies <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:12-14">1 John 2:12-14</span> various reasons why he had written to them - reasons derived from the unique character of different classes among them - little children, fathers, young men.</p>
<p style=" ">V. Each of these classes he solemnly commands not to love the world, or the things that are in the world, for that which constitutes the peculiarity of the “world” as such is not of the Father, and all “that there is in the world is soon to pass away,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15-17">1 John 2:15-17</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">VI. He calls their attention to the fact that the closing dispensation of the world had come, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18-20">1 John 2:18-20</span>. The evidence of this was, that antichrist had appeared.</p>
<p style=" ">VII. He calls their attention to the characteristics of the antichrist. The essential thing would be that antichrist would deny that Jesus was the Christ, involving a practical denial of both the Father and the Son. Persons of this character were abroad, and they were in great danger of being seduced by their arts from the way of truth and duty, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:21-26">1 John 2:21-26</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">VIII. The apostle, in the close of the chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:27-29">1 John 2:27-29</span> expresses the belief that they would not be seduced, but that they had an anointing from above which would keep them from the arts of those who would lead them astray. He earnestly exhorts them to abide in God the Saviour, that when he should appear they might have confidence and not be ashamed at his coming.</p>
