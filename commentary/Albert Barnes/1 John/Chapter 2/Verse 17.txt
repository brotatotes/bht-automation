<p style=" "><b>And the world passeth away - </b>Everything properly constituting this world where religion is excluded. The reference here does not seem to be so much to the material world, as to the scenes of show and vanity which make up the world. These things are passing away like the shifting scenes of the stage. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:31">1 Corinthians 7:31</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the lust thereof - </b>All that is here so much the object of desire. These things are like a pageant, which only amuses the eye for a moment, and then disappears forever.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever - </b>This cannot mean that he will never die; but it means that he has built his happiness on a basis which is secure, and which can never pass away.
