<p style=" "><b>It is the last time - </b>The closing period or dispensation; that dispensation in which the affairs of the world are ultimately to be wound up. The apostle does not, however, say that the end of the world would soon occur, nor does he intimate how long this dispensation would be. That period might continue through many ages or centuries, and still be the last dispensation, or that in which the affairs of the world would be finally closed. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:2">Isaiah 2:2</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> note. Some have supposed that the “last time” here refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the end of the Jewish economy; but the more natural interpretation is to refer it to the last dispensation of the world, and to suppose that the apostle meant to say that there were clear evidences that that period had arrived.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And as ye have heard that antichrist shall come - </b>The word “antichrist” occurs in the New Testament only in these Epistles of John, <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Jo 2:18</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Jo 4:3</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>. The proper meaning of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀντί</span></span> anti) in composition is:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)Over-against,” as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀντιτάσσειν</span></span> antitassein;</p>

<p style=" ">The word “antichrist,” therefore, might denote anyone who either was or claimed to be in the place of Christ, or one who, for any cause, was in opposition to him. The word, further, would apply to one opposed to him, on whatever ground the opposition might be; whether it were open and avowed, or whether it were only in fact, as resulting from certain claims which were adverse to his, or which were inconsistent with his. A “vice-functionary,” or an “opposing functionary,” would be the idea which the word would naturally suggest. If the word stood alone, and there were nothing said further to explain its meaning, we should think, when the word “antichrist” was used, either of one who claimed to be the Christ, and who thus was a rival; or of one who stood in opposition to him on some other ground. That which constituted the characteristics of antichrist, according to John, who only has used the word, he has himself stated. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>, “who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>, “and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; and this is that spirit of antichrist.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>, “for many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.”</p>
<p style=" ">From this it is clear, that John understood by the word all those that denied that Jesus is the Messiah, or that the Messiah has come in the flesh. If they held that Jesus was a deceiver, and that he was not the Christ, or if they maintained that, though Christ had come, he had not come in the flesh, that is, with a proper human nature, this showed that such persons had the spirit of antichrist. They arrayed themselves against him, and held doctrines which were in fact in entire opposition to the Son of God. It would appear then that John does not use the word in the sense which it would bear as denoting one who set up a rival claim, or who came in the place of Christ, but in the sense of those who were opposed to him by denying essential doctrines in regard to his person and advent. It is not certainly known to what persons he refers, but it would seem not improbable to Jewish adversaries, (see Suicer’s Thesaur. s. voc.,) or to some forms of the Gnostic belief. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>. The doctrine respecting antichrist, as stated in the New Testament, may be summed up in the following particulars:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That there would be those, perhaps in considerable numbers, who would openly claim to be the Christ, or the true Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That there would be a spirit, which would manifest itself early in the church, that would strongly tend to some great apostasy under some one head or leader, or to a concentration on an individual, or a succession of individuals, who would have eminently the spirit of antichrist, though for a time the developement of that spirit would be hindered or restrained. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1-7">2 Thessalonians 2:1-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) That this would be ultimately concentrated on a single leader - “the man of sin” - and embodied under some great apostasy, at the head of which would be that “man of sin,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3-4">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8-10">2 Thessalonians 2:8-10</span>. It is to this that Paul particularly refers, or this is the view which he took of this apostacy, and it is this which he particularly describes.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) That, in the meantime, and before the elements of the great apostasy should be concentrated and embodied, there might not be a few who would partake of the same general spirit, and who would be equally opposed to Christ in their doctrines and aims; that is, who would embody in themselves the essential spirit of antichrist, and by whose appearing it might be known that the last dispensation had come. It is to these that John refers, and these he found in his own age. Paul fixed the eye on future times, when the spirit of antichrist should be embodied under a distinct and mighty organization; John on his own time, and found then essentially what it had been predicted would occur in the church. He here says that they had been taught to expect that antichrist would come under the last dispensation; and it is implied that it could be ascertained that it was the last time, from the fact that the predicted opposer of Christ had come. The reference is probably to the language of the Saviour, that before the end should be, and as a sign that it was coming, many would arise claiming to be Christ, and, of course, practically denying that he was the Christ. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>, “many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>, “and there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets; and they shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” This prediction it is probable the apostles had referred to wherever they had preached, so that there was a general expectation that one or more persons would appear claiming to be the Christ, or maintaining such opinions as to be inconsistent with the true doctrine that Jesus was the Messiah. Such persons, John says, had then in fact appeared, by which it could be known that they were living under the closing dispensations of the world referred to by the Saviour. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2-5">2 Thessalonians 2:2-5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even now are there many antichrists - </b>There are many who have the characteristics which it was predicted that antichrist would have; that is, as explained above, there are many who deny that Jesus is the Messiah, or who deny that he has come in the flesh. If they maintained that Jesus was an impostor and not the true Messiah, or if, though they admitted that the Messiah had come, they affirmed, as the “Docetae” did, (Note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>) that he had come in “appearance” only, and not really come in the flesh, this was the spirit of antichrist. John says that there were many such persons in fact in his time. It would seem from this that John did not refer to a single individual, or to a succession of individuals who should come previous to the winding up of the affairs of the world, as Paul did (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> ff), but that he understood that there might be many at the same time who would evince the spirit of antichrist. Both he and Paul, however, refer to the expectation that before the coming of the Saviour to judge the world there would be prominent adversaries of the Christian religion, and that the end would not come until such adversaries appeared. Paul goes more into detail, and describes the characteristics of the great apostasy more at length (<span class="_0000ff"><u>2Th 2:2</u></span> ff; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span> ff; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:1">2 Timothy 3:1</span> ff) John says, not that the appearing of these persons indicated that the end of the world was near, but that they had such characteristics as to show that they were living in the last dispensation. Paul so describes them as to show that the end of the world was not to be immediately expected (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span> ff), John, without referring to that point, says that there were enough of that character then to prove that the last dispensation had come, though he does not say how long it would continue.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whereby we know it is the last time - </b>They have the characteristics which it was predicted many would have before the end of the world should come. The evidence that it was “the last time,” or the closing dispensation of the world, derived from the appearing of these persons, consists simply in the fact that it was predicted that such persons would appear under the Christian, or the last dispensation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24-27">Matthew 24:24-27</span>. Their appearance was to precede the coming of the Saviour, though it is not said “how long” it would precede that; but at any time the appearing of such persons would be an evidence that it was the closing dispensation of the world, for the Saviour, in his predictions respecting them, had said that they would appear before he should return to judgment. It cannot now be determined precisely to what classes of persons there is reference here, because we know too little of the religious state of the times to which the apostle refers. No one can prove, however, that there were “not” persons at that time who so fully corresponded to the predictions of the Saviour as to be a complete fulfillment of what he said, and to demonstrate that the last age had truly come. It would seem probable that there may have been reference to some Jewish adversaries, who denied that Jesus was the Messiah (Robinson Lexicon), or to some persons who had already broached the doctrine of the “Docetae,” that though Jesus was the Messiah, yet that he was a man in appearance only, and had not really come in the flesh. Classes of persons of each description abounded in the early ages of the church.</p>
