<p style=" "><b>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father - </b>That is, has no just views of the Father, and has no evidence of his friendship. It is only by the Son of God that the Father is made known to people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2-3">Hebrews 1:2-3</span>, and it is only through him that we can become reconciled to God, and obtain evidence of His favor. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But he that acknowledges the Son, hath the Father also - </b>This passage, in the common version of the New Testament, is printed in italics, as if it were not in the original, but was supplied by the translators. It is true that it is not found in all the manuscripts and versions; but it is found in a large number of manuscripts, and in the Vulgate, the Syriac, the Aethiopic, the Coptic, the Armenian, and the Arabic versions, and in the critical editions of Griesbach, Tittmann, and Hahn. It is probable, therefore, that it should be regarded as a genuine portion of the sacred text. It is much in the style of John, and though not necessary to complete the sense, yet it well suits the connection. As it was true that if one denied the Son of God he could have no pretensions to any proper acquaintance with the Father, so it seemed to follow that if anyone had any proper knowledge of the Son of God, and made a suitable confession of him, he had evidence that he was acquainted with the Father. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>. Though, therefore, this passage was wanting in many of the manuscripts consulted by the translators of the Bible, and though in printing it in the manner in which they have they showed the great caution with which they acted in admitting anything doubtful into their translation, yet the passage should be restored to the text, and be regarded as a genuine portion of the Word of God. The great truth can never be too clearly stated, or too often inculcated, that it is only by a knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ that we can have any true acquaintance with God. and that all who have just views of the Saviour are in fact acquainted with the true God, and are heirs of eternal life.</p>
