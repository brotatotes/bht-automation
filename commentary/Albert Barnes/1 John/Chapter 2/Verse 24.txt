<p style=" "><b>Let that therefore abide in you - </b>Adhere steadfastly to it; let the truth obtain a permanent lodgement in the soul. In view of its great importance, and its influence on your happiness here and hereafter, let it never depart from you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which ye have heard from the beginning - </b>That is, the same doctrines which you have always been taught respecting the Son of God and the way of salvation. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father - </b>Truly united to the Son and to the Father; or having evidence of the favor and friendship of the Son and the Father.</p>
