<p style=" "><b>He that saith, I know Him - </b>He who professes to be acquainted with the Saviour, or who professes to be a Christian.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And keepeth not his commandments - </b>What he has appointed to be observed by his people; that is, he who does not obey him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is a liar - </b>Makes a false profession; professes to have that which he really has not. Such a profession is a falsehood, because there can be no true religion where one does not obey the law of God.</p>
