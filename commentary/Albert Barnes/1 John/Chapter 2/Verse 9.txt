<p style=" "><b>He that saith he is in the light - </b>That he has true religion, or is a Christian. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And hateth his brother - </b>The word “brother” seems here to refer to those who professed the same religion. The word is indeed sometimes used in a larger sense, but the reference here appears to be to that which is properly brotherly love among Christians. Compare Lucke, in loc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is in darkness even until now - </b>That is, he cannot have true religion unless he has love to the brethren. The command to love one another was one of the most solemn and earnest which Christ ever enjoined, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:17">John 15:17</span>; he made it the special badge of discipleship, or that by which his followers were to be everywhere known, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35">John 13:35</span>; and it is, therefore, impossible to have any true religion without love to those who are sincerely and truly his followers. If a man has not that, he is in deep darkness, whatever else he may have, on the whole subject of religion.
