<p style=" ">This chapter embraces the following subjects:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. The fact that Christians are now the sons of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:1-3">1 John 3:1-3</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)We are the sons of God, and this will explain the reason why the world does not appreciate our character, or understand the reasons of our conduct,<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:1">1 John 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:1">1 John 3:1</span></span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (2)The consequences of sustaining that relation to God, or of being regarded as His sons.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.5em;  "> (a) We shall be like him when he appears, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.5em;  "> (b) We shall purify ourselves under the influence of this hope, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. The fact that he who is an adopted child of God does not commit sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4-10">1 John 3:4-10</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)All sin is the transgression of the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4">1 John 3:4</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (3)He that commits sin is of the devil, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:8">1 John 3:8</span>; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (4)As a matter of fact, he who is of God does not commit sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:7">1 John 3:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9-10">1 John 3:9-10</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. True religion will be manifested by love to the Christian brotherhood, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:10-18">1 John 3:10-18</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)As a man who is not righteous cannot be a true Christian, neither can he who does not love his brother, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:10">1 John 3:10</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (2)It is the solemn command of the Saviour that his followers should love one another, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:11">1 John 3:11</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (3)The importance of this is seen by the opposite conduct of Cain, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:12">1 John 3:12</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (4)Love to the brethren furnishes the most certain evidence that we have passed from death unto life, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14">1 John 3:14</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (5)A man who hates another is in fact a murderer, and, of course, cannot be a true child of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:15">1 John 3:15</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (6)We should be stimulated to the love of the brethren by the example of the Saviour, who laid down his life for us, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (7)If we see a brother in want, and have the means of aiding him, and do not do it, we cannot have the love of God dwelling in us, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:17-18">1 John 3:17-18</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. We may have evidence that we love God by the consciousness of our feelings toward him, as well as by outward acts toward his friends, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:19-21">1 John 3:19-21</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> V. If we keep His commandments our prayers will be answered, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:22-23">1 John 3:22-23</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)There is an assurance that we shall receive what we need if we ask it, and keep his commandments, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:22">1 John 3:22</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (2)The particular commandments on which the efficacy of prayer so much depends, are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.5em;  "> (a) That we believe on the name of the Saviour, and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.5em;  "> (b) That we love the Christian brotherhood, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:23">1 John 3:23</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> VI. We may know that we abide in God by the spirit which he has given us, as well as by keeping his commandments, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">This chapter, therefore, is occupied mainly with stating what are the evidences of true piety; and, in order to determine this question, there is perhaps no part of the Bible that may be studied with more profit than this portion of the writings of John.</p>
