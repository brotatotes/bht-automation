This chapter embraces the following subjects: I. The fact that Christians are now the sons of God, 1 John 3:1-3. (1)We are the sons of God, and this will explain the reason why the world does not appreciate our character, or understand the reasons of our conduct,1 John 3:1; 1 John 3:1. (2)The consequences of sustaining that relation to God, or of being regarded as His sons. (a) We shall be like him when he appears, 1 John 3:2. (b) We shall purify ourselves under the influence of this hope, 1 John 3:3. II. The fact that he who is an adopted child of God does not commit sin, 1 John 3:4-10. (1)All sin is the transgression of the law, 1 John 3:4; (3)He that commits sin is of the devil, 1 John 3:8; and, (4)As a matter of fact, he who is of God does not commit sin, 1 John 3:7, 1 John 3:9-10. III. True religion will be manifested by love to the Christian brotherhood, 1 John 3:10-18. (1)As a man who is not righteous cannot be a true Christian, neither can he who does not love his brother, 1 John 3:10. (2)It is the solemn command of the Saviour that his followers should love one another, 1 John 3:11. (3)The importance of this is seen by the opposite conduct of Cain, 1 John 3:12. (4)Love to the brethren furnishes the most certain evidence that we have passed from death unto life, 1 John 3:14. (5)A man who hates another is in fact a murderer, and, of course, cannot be a true child of God, 1 John 3:15. (6)We should be stimulated to the love of the brethren by the example of the Saviour, who laid down his life for us, 1 John 3:16. (7)If we see a brother in want, and have the means of aiding him, and do not do it, we cannot have the love of God dwelling in us, 1 John 3:17-18. IV. We may have evidence that we love God by the consciousness of our feelings toward him, as well as by outward acts toward his friends, 1 John 3:19-21. V. If we keep His commandments our prayers will be answered, 1 John 3:22-23. (1)There is an assurance that we shall receive what we need if we ask it, and keep his commandments, 1 John 3:22. (2)The particular commandments on which the efficacy of prayer so much depends, are: (a) That we believe on the name of the Saviour, and, (b) That we love the Christian brotherhood, 1 John 3:23. VI. We may know that we abide in God by the spirit which he has given us, as well as by keeping his commandments, 1 John 3:24.This chapter, therefore, is occupied mainly with stating what are the evidences of true piety; and, in order to determine this question, there is perhaps no part of the Bible that may be studied with more profit than this portion of the writings of John.
