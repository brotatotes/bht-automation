<p style=" "><b>Behold, what manner of love - </b>What love, in “kind” and in “degree.” In kind the most tender and the most ennobling, in adopting us into His family, and in permitting us to address Him as our Father; in “degree” the most exalted, since there is no higher love that can be shown than in adopting a poor and friendless orphan, and giving him a parent and a home. Even God could bestow upon us no more valuable token of affection than that we should be adopted into His family, and permitted to regard Him as our Father. When we remember how insignificant we are as creatures, and how ungrateful, rebellious, and vile we have been as sinners, we may well be amazed at the love which would adopt us into the holy family of God, so that we may be regarded and treated as the children of the Most High. A prince could manifest no higher love for a wandering, ragged, vicious orphan boy, found in the streets, than by adopting him into his own family, and admitting him to the same privileges and honors as his own sons; and yet this would be a trifle compared with the honor which God has bestowed on us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Father hath bestowed upon us - </b>God, regarded as a Father, or as at the head of the universe considered as one family.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That we should be called the sons of God - </b>That is, that we should “be” the sons of God - the word “called” being often used in the sense of “to be.” On the nature and privileges of adoption, see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15-17">Romans 8:15-17</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:18">2 Corinthians 6:18</span> note, and practical remarks on that chapter.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Therefore the world knoweth us not - </b>Does not understand our principles; the reasons of our conduct; the sources of our comforts and joys. The people of the world regard us as fanatics or enthusiasts; as foolish in abandoning the pleasures and pursuits which they engage in; as renouncing certain happiness for that which is uncertain; as cherishing false and delusive hopes in regard to the future, and as practicing needless austerities, with nothing to compensate for the pleasures which are abandoned. There is nothing which the frivolous, the ambitious, and the selfish “less” understand than they do the elements which go into the Christian’s character, and the nature and source of the Christian’s joys.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because it knew him not - </b>It did not know the Lord Jesus Christ. That is, the world had no right views of the real character of the Lord Jesus when he was on the earth. They mistook him for an enthusiast or an impostor; and it is no wonder that, having wholly mistaken his character, they should mistake ours. On the fact that the world did not know him, see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:17">Acts 3:17</span> note. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span>. On the fact that Christians may be expected to be regarded and treated as their Saviour was, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18-20">John 15:18-20</span>.
