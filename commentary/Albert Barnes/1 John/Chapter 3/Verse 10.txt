<p style=" "><b>In this the children of God are manifest ... - </b>That is, this furnishes a test of their true character. The test is found in doing righteousness, and in the love of the brethren. The former he had illustrated; the latter he now proceeds to illustrate. The general idea is, that if a person is not truly a righteous person, and does not love the brethren, he cannot be a child of God. Perhaps by the phrase in this, using a pronoun in the singular number, he means to intimate that an important part of righteousness consists in brotherly love.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whosoever doeth not righteousness, is not of God - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:7">1 John 3:7</span>, he had said that “he that doeth righteousness is of God.”</p>
<p style=" ">If that is true, then what he here affirms must be true also, that a man who does not righteousness is not of God. The general idea is the same, that no one can be a true Christian who is not in fact a righteous man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither he that loveth not his brother - </b>The illustration of this point continues to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:18">1 John 3:18</span>. The general sense is, that brotherly love is essential to the Christian character, and that he who does not possess it cannot be a Christian. On the nature and importance of brotherly love as an evidence of piety, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34-35">John 13:34-35</span>.</p>
