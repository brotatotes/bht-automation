<p style=" "><b>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not - </b>If we so live as to have an approving conscience - that is, if we indulge in no secret sin; if we discharge faithfully every known duty; if we submit without complaining to all the allotments of Divine Providence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Then have we confidence toward God - </b>Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:19">1 John 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:16">Acts 24:16</span> note. The apostle evidently does not mean that we have confidence toward God on the ground of what we do, as if it were meritorious, or as if it constituted a claim to his favor; but that we may so live as to have evidence of personal piety, and that we may look forward with a confident hope that we shall be accepted of him in the great day. The word here rendered “confidence” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παῤῥησίαν</span></span> parrēsian - means properly “boldness;” usually boldness or openness in speaking our sentiments. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span>. The confidence or boldness which we have toward our Maker is founded solely on the evidence that he will graciously accept us as pardoned sinners; not in the belief that we deserve his favor.</p>
