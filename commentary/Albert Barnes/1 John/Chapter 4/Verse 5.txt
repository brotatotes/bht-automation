<p style=" "><b>They are of the world - </b>This was one of the marks by which those who had the spirit of antichrist might be known. They belonged not to the church of God, but to the world. They had its spirit; they acted on its principles; they lived for it. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15">1 John 2:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Therefore speak they of the world - </b>Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span>. This may mean either that their conversation pertained to the things of this world, or that they were wholly influenced by the love of the world, and not by the Spirit of God, in the doctrines which they taught. The general sense is, that they had no higher ends and aims than they have who are influenced only by worldly plans and expectations. It is not difficult to distinguish, even among professed Christians and Christian teachers, those who are heavenly in their conversation from those who are influenced solely by the spirit of the world. “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,” and the general turn of a man’s conversation will show what “spirit is within him.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the world heareth them - </b>The people of the world - the frivoulous ones, the rich, the proud, the ambitious, the sensual - receive their instructions, and recognize them as teachers and guides, for their views accord with their own. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:19">John 15:19</span>. A professedly religious teacher may always determine much about himself by knowing what class of people are pleased with him. A professed Christian of any station in life may determine much about his evidences of piety, by asking himself what kind of persons desire his friendship, and wish him for a companion.</p>
