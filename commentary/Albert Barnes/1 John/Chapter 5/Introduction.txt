<p style=" ">This chapter embraces the following subjects:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. A continuance of the discussion about “love,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1-3">1 John 5:1-3</span>. These verses should have been attached to the previous chapter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. The victory which is achieved over the world by those who are born of God. The grand instrumentality by which this is done, is by the belief that Jesus is the Son of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4-5">1 John 5:4-5</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. The evidence that Jesus “is” the Son of God; or the means by which that truth is so believed as to secure a victory over the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:6-12">1 John 5:6-12</span>. In this part of the chapter the apostle goes fully into the nature of this evidence, or the ways in which the Christian becomes so thoroughly convinced of it as to give to faith this power. He refers to these sources of evidence:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. The reason why all this was written by the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:13">1 John 5:13</span>. It was that they might know that they had eternal life, and might believe on the name of the Saviour.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> V. The effect of this in leading us to the throne of grace, with the assurance that God will hear us, and will grant our requests, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:14-15">1 John 5:14-15</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> VI. The power of prayer, and the duty of praying for those who have sinned. The encouragement to this is, that there are many sins which are not unto death, and that we may hope that God will be merciful to those who have not committed the unpardonable offence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:16-17">1 John 5:16-17</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> VII. A summary of all that the apostle had said to them, or of the points of which they were sure in the matter of salvation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18-20">1 John 5:18-20</span>. They knew that those who are born of God do not sin; that the wicked one cannot permanently injure them; that they were of God, while all the world lay in wickedness; that the Son of God had come, and that they were truly united to that Saviour who is the true God, and who is eternal life.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> VIII. An exhortation to keep themselves from all idolatry, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:21">1 John 5:21</span>.</p>
