<p style=" "><b>And everyone that loveth him that begat - </b>That loves that God who has thus begotten those whom he has received as his children, and to whom he sustains the endearing relation of Father.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Loveth him also that is begotten of him - </b>That is, he will love all the true children of God; all Christians. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:20">1 John 4:20</span>. The general idea is, that as all Christians are the children of the same Father; as they constitute one family; as they all bear the same image; as they share his favor alike; as they are under the same obligation of gratitude to him, and are bound to promote the same common cause, and are to dwell together in the same home forever, they should therefore love one another. As all the children in a family love their common father, so it should be in the great family of which God is the Head.</p>
