<p style=" "><b>And if we know that he hear us - </b>That is, if we are assured of this as a true doctrine, then, even though we may not “see” immediately that the prayer is answered, we may have the utmost confidence that it is not disregarded, and that it will be answered in the way best adapted to promote our good. The specific thing that we asked may not indeed be granted, (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:42">Luke 22:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:8-9">2 Corinthians 12:8-9</span>), but the prayer will not be disregarded, and the thing which is most for our good will be bestowed upon us. The “argument” here is derived from the faithfulness of God; from the assurance which we feel that when he has promised to hear us, there will be, sooner or later, a real answer to the prayer.</p>

<p style=" ">We may need further trial, further chastisement, before the affliction, for example, shall be removed; and the answer to the prayer may be delayed for months or years. Yet, in the meantime, we may have the firmest assurance that the prayer is heard, and that it will be answered in the way and at the period when God shall see it to be best.</p>
