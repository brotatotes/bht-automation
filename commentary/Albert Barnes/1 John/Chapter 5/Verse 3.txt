<p style=" "><b>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments - </b>This constitutes true love; this furnishes the evidence of it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his commandments are not grievous - </b>Greek, “heavy” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρεῖαι</span></span> bareiai; that is, difficult to be borne as a burden. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>. The meaning is, that his laws are not unreasonable; the duties which he requires are not beyond our ability; his government is not oppressive. It is easy to obey God when the heart is right; and those who endeavor in sincerity to keep his commandments do not complain that they are hard. All complaints of this kind come from those who are not disposed to keep his commandments. Indeed, they object that his laws are unreasonable; that they impose improper restraints; that they are not easily complied with; and that the divine government is one of severity and injustice. But no such complaints come from true Christians. They find his service easier than the service of sin, and the laws of God more mild and easy to be complied with than were those of fashion and honor, which they once endeavored to obey. The service of God is freedom; the service of the world is bondage. No man ever yet heard a true Christian say that the laws of God, requiring him to lead a holy life, were stern and “grievous.” But who has not felt this in regard to the inexorable laws of sin? What votary of the world would not say this if he spoke his real sentiments? Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:32">John 8:32</span>.</p>
