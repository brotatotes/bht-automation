<p style=" "><b>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world - </b>The world, in its maxims, and precepts, and customs, does not rule him, but he is a freeman. The idea is, that there is a conflict between religion and the world, and that in the heart of every true Christian religion secures the victory, or triumphs. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>, the Saviour says, “Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” See the notes at that verse. He obtained a complete triumph over him “who rules the darkness of the world,” and laid the foundation for a victory by his people over all vice, error, and sin. John makes this affirmation of all who are born of God. “Whatsoever,” or, as the Greek is, “Everything which is begotten of God,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πᾶν τὸ γεγενημένον</span></span> pan to gegenēmenon;) meaning to affirm, undoubtedly, that “in every instance” where one is truly regenerated, there is this victory over the world. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15-16">1 John 2:15-16</span> note. It is one of the settled maxims of religion, that every man who is a true Christian gains a victory over the world; and consequently a maxim as settled, that where the spirit of the world reigns supremely in the heart, there is no true religion. But, if this be a true principle, how many professed Christians are there who are strangers to all claims of piety - for how many are there who are wholly governed by the spirit of this world!</p>
<p style=" "><b>And this is the victory - </b>This is the source or means of the victory which is thus achieved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even our faith - </b>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:5">1 John 5:5</span>. He overcame the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>, and it is by that faith which makes us one with him, and that imbues us with his Spirit, that we are able to do it also.</p>
