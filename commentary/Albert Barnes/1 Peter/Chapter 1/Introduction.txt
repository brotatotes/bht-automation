<p style=" ">This Epistle was evidently addressed to those who were passing through severe trials, and probably to those who were, at that time, enduring persecution, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:6-7">1 Peter 1:6-7</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Pe 3:14</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:1">1 Peter 4:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:12-19">1 Peter 4:12-19</span>. The main object of this chapter is to comfort them in their trials; to suggest such considerations as would enable them to bear them with the right spirit, and to show the sustaining, elevating, and purifying power of the gospel. In doing this, the apostle adverts to the following considerations:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) He reminds them that they were the elect of God; that they had been chosen according to his foreknowledge, by the sanctifying agency of the Holy Spirit, and in order that they might be obedient, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1-2">1 Peter 1:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He reminds them of the lively hope to which they had been begotten, and of the inheritance that was reserved for them in heaven. That inheritance was incorruptible, and undefiled, and glorious; it would be certainly theirs, for they would be kept by the power of God unto it, though now they were subjected to severe trials, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3-6">1 Peter 1:3-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Even now they could rejoice in hope of that inheritance, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:6">1 Peter 1:6</span> their trial was of great importance to themselves in order to test the genuineness of their piety <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>, and in the midst of all their sufferings they could rejoice in the love of their unseen Saviour <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span> and they would certainly obtain the great object for which they had believed - the salvation of their souls <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9">1 Peter 1:9</span>. By these considerations the apostle would reconcile them to their sufferings; for they would thus show the genuineness and value of Christian piety, and would be admitted at last to higher honor.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) The apostle proceeds, in order further to reconcile them to their sufferings, to say that the nature of the salvation which they would receive had been an object of earnest inquiry by the prophets. They had searched diligently to know precisely what the Spirit by which they were inspired meant by the revelations given to them, and they had understood that they ministered to the welfare of those who should come after them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:10-12">1 Peter 1:10-12</span>. Those who thus suffered ought, therefore, to rejoice in a salvation which had been revealed to them in this manner; and in the fact that they had knowledge which had not been vouchsafed even to the prophets; and under these circumstances they ought to be willing to bear the trials which had been brought upon them by a religion so communicated to them.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) In view of these things, the apostle <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13-17">1 Peter 1:13-17</span> exhorts them to be faithful and persevering to the end. In anticipation of what was to be revealed to them at the final day, they should be sober and obedient; and as he who had called them into his kingdom was holy, so it became them to be holy also.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) This consideration is enforced <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18-21">1 Peter 1:18-21</span> by a reference to the price that was paid for their redemption. They should remember that they had been redeemed, not with silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ. He had been appointed from eternity to be their Redeemer; he had been manifested in those times for them; he had been raised from the dead for them, and their faith and hope were through him. For these reasons they ought to be steadfast in their attachment to him.</p>
<p style=" ">(7) The apostle enjoins on them the special duty of brotherly love, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22-23">1 Peter 1:22-23</span>. They had purified their hearts by obeying the truth, and as they were all one family, they should love one another fervently. Thus, they would show to their enemies and persecutors the transforming nature of their religion, and furnish an impressive proof of its reality.</p>
<p style=" ">(8) To confirm all these views, the apostle reminds them that all flesh must soon die. The glory of man would fade away. Nothing would abide but the Word of the Lord. They themselves would soon die, and be released from their troubles, and they should be willing, therefore, to bear trials for a little time. The great and the rich, and those apparently more favored in this life, would soon disappear, and all the splendor of their condition would vanish; and they should not envy them, or repine at their own more tremble and painful lot, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:24-25">1 Peter 1:24-25</span>. The keenest sufferings here are brief, and the highest honors and splendors of life here soon vanish away; and our main solicitude should be for the eternal inheritance. Having the prospect of that, and building on the sure word of God, which abides forever, we need not shrink from the trials appointed to us here below.</p>
