<p style=" "><b>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ - </b>On the word apostle, see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span> ff notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the strangers - </b>In the Greek, the word “elect” (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>) occurs here: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις</span></span> eklektois parepidēmois, “to the elect strangers.” He here addresses them as elect; in the following verse he shows them in what way they were elected. See the notes there: The word rendered “strangers” occurs only in three places in the New Testament; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11">1 Peter 2:11</span>, where it is rendered pilgrims, and in the place before us. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>. The word means, literally, a by-resident, a sojourner among a people not one’s own - Robinson. There has been much diversity of opinion as to the persons here referred to: some supposing that the Epistle was written to those who had been Jews, who were now converted, and who were known by the common appellation among their countrymen as “the scattered abroad,” or the “dispersion;” that is, those who were strangers or sojourners away from their native land; others, that the reference is to those who were called, among the Jews, “proselytes of the gate,” or those who were admitted to certain external privileges among the Jews, (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:15">Matthew 23:15</span>) and others, that the allusion is to Christians as such, without reference to their origin, and who are spoken of as strangers and pilgrims.</p>
<p style=" ">That the apostle did not write merely to those who had been Jews, is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:3-4">1 Peter 4:3-4</span> (compare the introduction), and it seems probable that he means here Christians as such, without reference to their origin, who were scattered through the various provinces of Asia Minor. Yet it seems also probable that he did not use the term as denoting that they were “strangers and pilgrims on the earth,” or with reference to the fact that the earth was not their home, as the word is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>; but that he used the term as a Jew would naturally use it, accustomed, as he was, to employ it as denoting his own countrymen dwelling in distant lands. He would regard them still as the people of God, though dispersed abroad; as those who were away from what was properly the home of their fathers. So Peter addresses these Christians as the people of God, now scattered abroad; as similar in their condition to the Jews who had been dispersed among the Gentiles. Compare the introduction, section 1. It is not necessarily implied that these persons were strangers to Peter, or that he had never seen them; though this was not improbably the fact in regard to most of them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Scattered - </b>Greek, “of the dispersion,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπορᾶς</span></span> diasporas) a term which a Jew would be likely to use who spoke of his countrymen dwelling among the pagan. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:35">John 7:35</span> note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span> note, where the same Greek word is found. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. Here, however, it is applied to Christians as dispersed or scattered abroad.</p>
