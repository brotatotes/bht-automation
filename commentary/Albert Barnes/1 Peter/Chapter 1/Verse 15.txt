The meaning here is, that the model or example in accordance with which they were to frame their lives, should be the character of that God who had called them into his kingdom. They were to be like him. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So be ye holy in all manner of conversation - </b>In all your conduct.
