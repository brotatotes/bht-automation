<p style=" "><b>Elect - </b>That is, “chosen.” The meaning here is, that they were in fact chosen. The word does not refer to the purpose to choose, but to the fact that they were chosen or selected by God as His people. It is a word commonly applied to the people of God as being chosen out of the world, and called to be His. The use of the word does not determine whether God had a previous eternal purpose to choose them or not. That must be determined by something else than the mere use of the term. This word has reference to the act of selecting them, without throwing any light on the question why it was done. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:22">Matthew 24:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:20">Mark 13:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:7">Luke 18:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>. The meaning is, that God had, on some account, a preference for them above others as his people, and had chosen them from the midst of others to be heirs of salvation. The word should be properly understood as applied to the act of choosing them, not to the purpose to choose them; the fact of his selecting them to be his, not the doctrine that he would choose them; and is a word, therefore, which should be freely and gratefully used by all Christians, for it is a word in frequent use in the Bible, and there is nothing for which people should be more grateful than the fact that God has chosen them to salvation. Elsewhere we learn that the purpose to choose them was eternal, and that the reason of it was his own good pleasure. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4-5">Ephesians 1:4-5</span>. We are here also informed that it was in accordance with “the foreknowledge of God the Father.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to the foreknowledge of God the Father - </b>The Father is regarded, in the Scriptures, as the Author of the plan of salvation, and as having chosen His people to life, and given them to His Son to redeem and save, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:65">John 6:65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6">John 17:6</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>. It is affirmed here that the fact that they were elect was in some sense in accordance with the “foreknowledge of God.” On the meaning of the phrase, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>. The passage does not affirm that the thing which God “foreknew,” and which was the reason of their being chosen, was, that they would of themselves be disposed to embrace the offer of salvation. The foreknowledge referred to might have been of many other things as constituting the reason which operated in the case; and it is not proper to assume that it could have been of this alone. It may mean that God foreknew all the events which would ever occur, and that He saw reasons why they should be selected rather than others; or that He foreknew all that could be made to bear on their salvation; or that He foreknew all that He would himself do to secure their salvation; or that He foreknew them as having been designated by his own eternal counsels; or that He foreknew all that could be accomplished by their instrumentality; or that He saw that they would believe; but it should not be assumed that the word means necessarily any one of these things.</p>
<p style=" ">The simple fact here affirmed, which no one can deny, is, that there was foreknowledge in the case on the part of God. It was not the result of Ignorance or of blind chance that they were selected. But if foreknown, must it not be certain? How could a thing which is foreknown be contingent or doubtful? The essential idea here is, that the original choice was on the part of God, and not on their part, and that this choice was founded on what He before knew to be best. He undoubtedly saw good and sufficient reasons why the choice should fall on them. I do not know that the reasons why he did it are revealed, or that they could be fully comprehended by us if they were. I am quite certain that it is not stated that it is because they would be more disposed of themselves to embrace the Saviour than others; for the Scriptures abundantly teach, what every regenerated person feels to be true, that the fact that we are disposed to embrace the Saviour is to be traced to a divine influence on our hearts, and not to ourselves. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:65">John 6:65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:16">Romans 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:2-3">Psalms 110:2-3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through sanctification of the Spirit - </b>The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity. The Greek is, “by (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν</span></span> en) sanctification of the Spirit;” that is, it was by this influence or agency. The election that was purposed by the Father was carried into effect by the agency of the Spirit in making them holy. The word rendered “sanctification” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἁγιασμός</span></span> hagiasmos) is not used here in its usual and technical sense to denote “the progressive holiness of believers,” but in its more primitive and usual sense of “holiness.” Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>. It means here the being made holy; and the idea is, that we become in fact the chosen or elect of God by a work of the Spirit on our hearts making us holy; that is, renewing us in the divine image. We are chosen by the Father, but it is necessary that the heart should be renewed and made holy by a work of grace, in order that we may actually become His chosen people. Though we are sinners, He proposes to save us; but we are not saved in our sins, nor can we regard ourselves as the children of God until we have evidence that we are born again. The purpose of God to save us found us unholy, and we become in fact His friends by being renewed in the temper of our mind. A man has reason to think that he is one of the elect of God, just so far as he has evidence that he has been renewed by the Holy Spirit, and so far as he has holiness of heart and life, and no further.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ - </b>This expresses the design for which they had been chosen by the Father, and renewed by the Spirit. It was that they might obey God, and lead holy lives. On the phrase “unto obedience,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>. The phrase “unto sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ,” means to cleansing from sin, or to holiness, since it was by the sprinkling of that blood that they were to be made holy. See it explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:18-23">Hebrews 9:18-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>. The phrase “be multiplied” means, “may it abound,” or “may it be conferred abundantly on you.” From this verse we may learn that they who are chosen should be holy. Just in proportion as they have evidence that God has chosen them at all, they have evidence that He has chosen them to be holy; and, in fact, all the evidence which any man can have that he is among the elect, is that he is practically a holy man, and desires to become more and more so. No man can penetrate the secret counsels of the Almighty. No one can go up to heaven, and inspect the Book of Life to see if his name be there. No one should presume that his name is there without evidence. No one should depend on dreams, or raptures, or visions, as proof that his name is there. No one should expect a new revelation declaring to him that he is among the elect. All the proof which any man can have that he is among the chosen of God, is to be found in the evidences of personal piety; and any man who is willing to be a true Christian may have all that evidence in his own case. If anyone, then, wishes to settle the question whether he is among the elect or not, the way is plain. Let him become a true Christian, and the whole matter is determined, for that is all the proof which anyone has that he is chosen to salvation. Until a man is willing to do that, he should not complain of the doctrine of election. If he is not willing to become a Christian and to be saved, assuredly he should not complain that those who are think that they have evidence that they are the chosen of God.</p>
