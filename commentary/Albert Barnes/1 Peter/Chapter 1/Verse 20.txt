<p style=" "><b>Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world - </b>That is, it was foreordained, or predetermined, that he should be the great stoning Sacrifice for sin. On the meaning of the word “foreordained,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγινώσκω</span></span> proginōskō,) see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>. The word is rendered which knew, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:5">Acts 26:5</span>; foreknew and foreknow, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2">Romans 11:2</span>; foreordained, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>; and know before, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:17">2 Peter 2:17</span>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The sense is, that the plan was formed, and the arrangements made for the atonement, before the world was created.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before the foundation of the world - </b>That is, from eternity. It was before man was formed; before the earth was made; before any of the material universe was brought into being; before the angels were created.

<p style=" "><b>For you - </b>For your benefit or advantage. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>. It follows from what is said in this verse:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That the atonement was not an afterthought on the part of God. It entered into his plan when he made the world, and was revolved in his purposes from eternity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)It was not a device to supply a defect in the system; that is, it was not adopted because the system did not work well, or because God had been disappointed. It was arranged before man was created, and when none but God could know whether he would stand or fall.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)The creation of the earth must have had some reference to this plan of redemption, and that plan must have been regarded as in itself so glorious, and so desirable, that it was deemed best to bring the world into existence that the plan might be developed, though it would involve the certainty that the race would fall, and that many would perish. It was, on the whole, more wise and benevolent that the race should be created with a certainty that they would apostatize, than it would be that the race should not he created, and the plan of salvation be unknown to distant worlds.
