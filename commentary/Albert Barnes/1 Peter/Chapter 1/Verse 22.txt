<p style=" "><b>Seeing ye have purified your souls - </b>Greek, “Having purified your souls.” The apostles were never afraid of referring to human agency as having an important part in saving the soul Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:15">1 Corinthians 4:15</span>. No one is made pure without personal intention or effort - any more than one becomes accomplished or learned without personal exertion. One of the leading effects of the agency of the Holy Spirit is to excite us to make efforts for our own salvation; and there is no true piety which is not the fair result of culture, as really as the learning of a Person, or the harvest of the farmer. The amount of effort which we make “in purifying our souls” is usually also the measure of our attainments in religion. No one can expect to have any true piety beyond the amount of effort which he makes to be conformed to God, any more than one can expect wealth, or fame, or learning, without exertion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In obeying the truth - </b>That is, your yielding to the requirements of truth, and to its fair influence on your minds, has been the means of your becoming pure. The truth here referred to is, undoubtedly, that which is revealed in the gospel - the great system of truth respecting the redemption of the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the Spirit - </b>By the agency of the Holy Spirit. It is his office to apply truth to the mind; and however precious the truth may be, and however adapted to secure certain results on the soul, it will never produce those effects without the influences of the Holy Spirit. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5-6">Titus 3:5-6</span>; the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto unfeigned love of the brethren - </b>The effect of the influence of the Holy Spirit in applying the truth has been to produce sincere love to all who are true Christians. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:9">1 Thessalonians 4:9</span> note. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14-18">1 John 3:14-18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently - </b>Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:1">Hebrews 13:1</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34-35">John 13:34-35</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span> note. The phrase “with a pure heart fervently,” means:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That it should be genuine love proceeding from a heart in which there is no guile or hypocrisy; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That it should be intense affection, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐκτενῶς</span></span> ektenōs;) not cold and formal, but ardent and strong.</p>
<p style=" ">If there is any reason why we should love true Christians at all, there is the same reason why our attachment to them should be intense. This verse establishes the following points:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) That truth was at the foundation of their piety. They had none of which this was not the proper basis; and in which the foundation was not as broad as the superstructure. There is no religion in the world which is not the fair developement of truth; which the truth is not suited to produce.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) They became Christians as the result of obeying the truth; or by yielding to its fair influence on the soul. Their own minds complied with its claims; their own hearts yielded; there was the exercise of their own volitions. This expresses a doctrine of great importance:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) The agency by which this was accomplished was that of the Holy Spirit. Truth is adapted in itself to a certain end or result, as seed is adapted to produce a harvest. But it will no more of itself produce its appropriate effects on the soul, than seed will produce a harvest without rains, and dews, and suns. In all cases, therefore, the proper effect of truth on the soul is to be traced to the influence of the Holy Spirit, as the germination of the seed in the earth is to the foreign cause that acts on it. No man was ever converted by the mere effect of truth without the agency of the Holy Spirit, any more than seed germinates when laid upon a hard rock.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4) The effect of this influence of the Holy Spirit in applying the truth is to produce love to all who are Christians. Love to Christian brethren springs up in the soul of everyone who is truly converted: and this love is just as certain evidence that the seed of truth has germinated in the soul, as the green and delicate blade that peeps up through the earth is evidence that the seed sown has been quickened into life. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:9">1 Thessalonians 4:9</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14">1 John 3:14</span> note. We may learn hence:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a)That truth is of inestimable value. It is as valuable as religion itself, for all the religion in the world is the result of it.</p>
