<p style=" "><b>Who are kept by the power of God - </b>That is, “kept” or preserved in the faith and hope of the gospel; who are preserved from apostacy, or so kept that you will finally obtain salvation. The word which is used here, and rendered “kept,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρουρέω</span></span> phroureō,) is rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:32">2 Corinthians 11:32</span>, kept with a garrison; in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>, and here, kept; in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>, shall keep. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means to keep, as in a garrison or fortress; or as with a military watch. The idea is, that there was a faithful guardianship exercised over them to save them from danger, as a castle or garrison is watched to guard it against the approach of an enemy. The meaning is, that they were weak in themselves, and were surrounded by temptations; and that the only reason why they were preserved was, that God exerted his power to keep them. The only reason which any Christians have to suppose they will ever reach heaven, is the fact that God keeps them by his own power. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:18">2 Timothy 4:18</span> notes. If it were left to the will of man; to the strength of his own resolutions; to his power to meet temptations, and to any probability that he would of himself continue to walk in the path of life, there would be no certainty that anyone would be saved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through faith - </b>That is, he does not keep us by the mere exertion of power, but he excites faith in our hearts, and makes that the means of keeping us. As long as we have faith in God, and in his promises, we are safe. When that fails, we are weak; and if it should fail altogether, we could not be saved. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto salvation - </b>Not preserved for a little period, and then suffered to fall away, but so kept as to be saved. We may remark here that Peter, as well as Paul, believed in the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. If he did not, how could he have addressed these Christians in this manner, and said that they were “kept by the power of God unto salvation?” What evidence could he have had that they would obtain salvation, unless he believed in the general truth that it was the purpose of God to keep all who were truly converted?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ready to be revealed in the last time - </b>That is, when the world shall close. Then it shall be made manifest to assembled worlds that such an inheritance was “reserved” for you, and that you were “kept” in order to inherit it. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>. This verse, then, teaches that the doctrine that the saints will persevere and be saved, is true. They are “kept by the power of God to salvation;” and as God has all power, and guards them with reference to this end, it cannot be but that they will be saved. It may be added:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)That it is very desirable that the doctrine should be true. Man is so weak and feeble, so liable to fall, and so exposed to temptation, that it is in itself every way a thing to be wished that his salvation should be in some safer hands than his own.</p>
<p style=" ">If it were left entirely to the hands of people, even the best of people, what assurance could there be that anyone could be saved? Did not Adam fall? Did not holy angels fall? Have not some of the best of men fallen into sin? And who has such a strength of holiness that he could certainly confide in it to make his own salvation sure? Any man must know little of himself, and of the human heart, who supposes that he has such a strength of virtue that he would never fall away if left to himself. But if this be so, then his only hope of salvation is in the fact that God intends to “keep his people by his own power through faith unto salvation.”</p>
