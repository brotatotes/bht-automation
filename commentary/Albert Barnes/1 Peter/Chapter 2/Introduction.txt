<p style=" ">This chapter may be divided into three parts:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. An exhortation to those whom the apostle addressed, to lay aside all malice, and all guile, and to receive the simple and plain instructions of the word of God with the earnestness with which babies desire their appropriate food, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1-3">1 Peter 2:1-3</span>. Religion reproduces the traits of character of children in those whom it influences, and they ought to regard themselves as new-born babes, and seek that kind of spiritual nutriment which is adapted to their condition as such.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. The privileges which they had obtained by becoming Christians, while so many others had stumbled at the very truths by which they had been saved, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4-10">1 Peter 2:4-10</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. Various duties growing out of these privileges, and out of the various relations which they sustained in life, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11-25">1 Peter 2:11-25</span>;</p>
