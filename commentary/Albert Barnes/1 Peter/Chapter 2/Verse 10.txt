<p style=" "><b>Which in time past were not a people - </b>That is, who formerly were not regarded as the people of God. There is an allusion here to the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:23">Hosea 2:23</span>, “And I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.” It is, however, a mere allusion, such as one makes who uses the language of another to express his ideas, without meaning to say that both refer to the same subject. In Hosea, the passage refers evidently to the reception of one portion of the Israelites into favor after their rejection; in Peter, it refers mainly to those who had been Gentiles, and who had never been recognized as the people of God. The language of the prophet would exactly express his idea, and he therefore uses it without intending to say that this was its original application. See it explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:25">Romans 9:25</span>. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11-12">Ephesians 2:11-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which had not obtained mercy - </b>That is, who had been living unpardoned, having no knowledge of the way by which sinners might be forgiven, and no evidence that your sins were forgiven. They were then in the condition of the whole pagan world, and they had not then been acquainted with the glorious method by which God forgives iniquity.</p>
