<p style=" "><b>As new-born babes - </b>The phrase used here would properly denote those which were just born, and hence Christians who had just begun the spiritual life. See the word explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>. It is not uncommon, in the Scriptures, to compare Christians with little children. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:3">Matthew 18:3</span>, for the reasons of this comparison. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:2">1 Corinthians 3:2</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span> notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Desire the sincere milk of the word - </b>The pure milk of the word. On the meaning of the word “sincere,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:24">Ephesians 6:24</span>. The Greek word here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄδολον</span></span> adolon) means, properly, that which is without guile or falsehood; then unadulterated, pure, genuine. The Greek adjective rendered “of the word,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογικὸν</span></span> logikon,) means properly rational, pertaining to reason, or mind; and, in the connection here with milk, means that which is adapted to sustain the soul. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>. There is no doubt that there is allusion to the gospel in its purest and most simple form, as adapted to be the nutriment of the new-born soul. Probably there are two ideas here; one, that the proper aliment of piety is simple truth; the other, that the truths which they were to desire were the more elementary truths of the gospel, such as would be adapted to those who were babes in knowledge.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye may grow thereby - </b>As babes grow on their proper nutriment. Piety in the heart is susceptible of growth, and is made to grow by its proper aliment, as a plant or a child is, and will grow in proportion as it has the proper kind of nutriment. From this verse we may see:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The reason of the injunction of the Saviour to Peter, to “feed his lambs,” <span class="_0000ff"><u>Joh 21:15</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1-2">1 Peter 2:1-2</span>. Young Christians strongly resemble children, babies; and they need watchful care, and kind attention, and appropriate aliment, as much as new-born infants do. Piety receives its form much from its commencement and the character of the whole Christian life will be determined in a great degree by the views entertained at first, and the kind of instruction which is given to those who are just entering on their Christian course. We may also see,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That it furnishes evidence of conversion, if we have a love for the simple and pure truths of the gospel. It is evidence that we have spiritual life, as really as the desire of appropriate nourishment is evidence that an infant has natural life. The new-born soul loves the truth. It is nourished by it. It perishes without it. The gospel is just what it wants; and without that it could not live. We may also learn from this verse,</p>
<p style=" ">(3) That the truths of the gospel which are best adapted to that state, are those which are simple and plain. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12-14">Hebrews 5:12-14</span>. It is not philosophy that is needed then; it is not the profound and difficult doctrines of the gospel; it is those elementary truths which lie at the foundation of all religion, and which can be comprehended by children. Religion makes everyone docile and humble as a child; and whatever may be the age at which one is converted, or whatever attainments he may have made in science, he relishes the same truths which are loved by the youngest and most unlettered child that is brought into the kingdom of God.</p>
