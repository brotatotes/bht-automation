<p style=" "><b>For what glory is it - </b>What honor or credit would it be.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If, when ye be buffeted for your faults - </b>That is, if you are punished when you deserve it. The word “buffet” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολαφίζω</span></span> kolaphizō) - means, to strike with the fist; and then to strike in any way; to maltreat, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Mar 14:65</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:11">1 Corinthians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>. Perhaps there may be a reference here to the manner in which servants were commonly treated, or the kind of pun ishment to which they were exposed. They would be likely to be struck in sudden anger, either by the hand, or by anything that was accessible. The word rendered “for your faults,” is sinning, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἁμαρτάνοντες</span></span> hamartanontes.) That is, “if being guilty of an offence, or having done wrong.” The idea is, that if they were justly punished, and should take it patiently, there would be no credit or honor in it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye shall take it patiently - </b>“If, even then, you evince an uncomplaining spirit, and bear it with the utmost calmness and patience, it would be regarded as comparatively no virtue, and as entitling you to no honor. The feeling of all who saw it would be that you deserved it, and there would be nothing to excite their sympathy or compassion. The patience evinced might indeed be as great as in the other case, but there would be the feeling that you deserved all that you received, and the spirit evinced in that case could not be regarded as entitled to any particular praise. If your masters are inflicting on you only what you deserve, it would be in the highest degree shameful for you to rise up against them, and resist them, for it would be only adding to the wrong which you had already done.” The expression here is, doubtless, to be understood comparatively. The meaning is not that absolutely there would be no more credit due to one who should bear his punishment patiently when he had done wrong, than if he had met it with resistance and complaining; but that there is very little credit in that compared with the patience which an innocent person evinces, who, from regard to the will of God, and by control over all the natural feelings of resentment, meekly endures wrong.</p>
<p style=" ">This expresses the common feeling of our nature. We attribute no particular credit to one who submits to a just punishment even with a calm temper. We feel that it would be wrong in the highest degree for him to do otherwise. So it is when calamities are brought on a man on account of his sins. If it is seen to be the fruit of intemperance or crime, we do not feel that there is any great virtue exhibited if he bears it with a calm temper. But if he is overwhelmed with calamity when it seems to have no particular connection with his sins, or to be a punishment for any particular fault; if he suffers at the hand of man, where there is manifest injustice done him, and yet evinces a calm, submissive, and meek temper, we feel that in such cases there is eminent virtue.</p>
<p style=" "><b>This is acceptable with God - </b>Margin, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:19">1 Peter 2:19</span>, “thank.” It is that which is agreeable to him, or with which he is pleased.</p>
