<p style=" ">In the conclusion of this chapter we may remark:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That there is something very beautiful in the expression “Bishop of souls.” It implies that the soul is the special care of the Saviour; that it is the object of his special interest; and that it is of great value - so great that it is that which mainly deserves regard. He is the Bishop of the soul in a sense quite distinct from any care which he manifests for the body. That too, in the proper way, is the object of his care; but that has no importance compared with the soul. Our care is principally employed in respect to the body; the care of the Redeemer has special reference to the soul.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It follows that the welfare of the soul may be committed to him with confidence. It is the object of his special guardianship, and he will not be unfaithful to the trust reposed in him. There is nothing more safe than the human soul is when it is committed in faith to the keeping of the Son of God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) As, therefore, he has shown his regard for us in seeking us when we were wandering and lost; as he came on the kind and benevolent errand to find us and bring us back to himself, let us show our gratitude to him by resolving to wander no more. As we regard our own safety and happiness, let us commit ourselves to him as our great Shepherd, to follow where he leads us, and to be ever under his pastoral inspection. We had all wandered away. We had gone where there was no happiness and no protector. We had no one to provide for us, to care for us, to pity us. We were exposed to certain ruin. In that state he pitied us, sought us out, brought us back. If we had remained where we were, or had gone further in our wanderings, we should have gone certainly to destruction. He has sought us out; be has led us back; he has taken us under his own protection and guidance; and we shall be safe as long as we follow where he leads, and no longer. To him then, a Shepherd who never forsakes his flock, let us at all times commit ourselves, following where he leads, feeling that under him our great interests are secure.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) We may learn from this chapter, indeed, as we may from every other part of the New Testament, that in doing this we may be called to suffer. We may be reproached and reviled as the great Shepherd himself was. We may become the objects of public scorn on account of our devoted attachment to him. We may suffer in name, in feeling, in property, in our business, by our honest attachment to the principles of his gospel. Many who are his followers may be in circumstances of poverty or oppression. They may be held in bondage; they may be deprived of their rights; they may feel that their lot in life is a hard one, and that the world seems to have conspired against them to do them wrong; but let us in all these circumstances look to Him “who made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7-8">Philippians 2:7-8</span>; and let us remember that it is “enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:25">Matthew 10:25</span>. In view of the example of our Master, and of all the promises of support in the Bible, let us bear with patience all the trials of life, whether arising from poverty, an humble condition, or the reproaches of a wicked world. Our trials will soon be ended; and soon, under the direction of the “Shepherd and Bishop of souls,” we shall be brought to a world where trials and sorrows are unknown.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) In our trials here, let it be our main object so to live that our sufferings shall not be on account of our own faults. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:19-22">1 Peter 2:19-22</span>. Our Saviour so lived. He was persecuted, reviled, mocked, condemned to die. But it was for no fault of his. In all his varied and prolonged sufferings, he had the ever-abiding consciousness that he was innocent; he had the firm conviction that it would yet be seen and confessed by all the world that he was “holy, harmless, undefiled,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:23">1 Peter 2:23</span>. His were not the sufferings produced by a guilty conscience, or by the recollection that he had wronged anyone. So, if we must suffer, let our trials come upon us. Be it our first aim to have a conscience void of offence, to wrong no one, to give no occasion for reproaches and revilings, to do our duty faithfully to God and to people. Then, if trials come, we shall feel that we suffer as our Master did; and then we may, as he did, commit our cause “to him that judgeth righteously,” assured that in due time “he will bring forth our righteousness as the light, and our judgment as the noon-day,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:6">Psalms 37:6</span>.</p>
