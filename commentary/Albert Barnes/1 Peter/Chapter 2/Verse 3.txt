<p style=" "><b>If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious - </b>Or rather, as Doddridge renders it, “Since you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.” The apostle did not mean to express any doubt on the subject, but to state that, since they had had an experimental acquaintance with the grace of God, they should desire to increase more and more in the knowledge and love of him. On the use of the word “taste,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span>.</p>
