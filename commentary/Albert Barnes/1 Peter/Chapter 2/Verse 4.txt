<p style=" "><b>To whom coming - </b>To the Lord Jesus, for so the word “Lord” is to be understood in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:3">1 Peter 2:3</span>. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>. The idea here is, that they had come to him for salvation, while the great mass of people rejected him. Others “disallowed” him, and turned away from him, but they had seen that he was the one chosen or appointed of God, and had come to him in order to be saved. Salvation is often represented as corning to Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28">Matthew 11:28</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As unto a living stone - </b>The allusion in this passage is to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.” See the notes at that passage. There may be also possibly an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>, “The stone which the builders disallowed is become the headstone of the corner.” The reference is to Christ as the foundation on which the church is reared. He occupied the same place in regard to the church which a foundation-stone does to the edifice that is reared upon it. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:24-25">Matthew 7:24-25</span>. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span> note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20-22">Ephesians 2:20-22</span> notes. The phrase “living stone” is however unusual, and is not found, I think, except in this place. There seems to be an incongruity in it, in attributing life to a stone, yet the meaning is not difficult to be understood. The purpose was not to speak of a temple, like that at Jerusalem, made up of gold and costly stones; but of a temple made up of living materials - of redeemed people - in which God now resides. In speaking of that, it was natural to refer to the foundation on which the whole rested, and to speak of that as corresponding to the whole edifice. It was all a living temple - a temple composed of living materials - from the foundation to the top. Compare the expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:10">John 4:10</span>, “He would have given thee living water;” that is, water which would have imparted life to the soul. So Christ imparts life to the whole spiritual temple that is reared on him as a foundation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Disallowed indeed of men - </b>Rejected by them, first by the Jews, in causing him to be put to death; and then by all people when he is offered to them as their Saviour. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:3">Isaiah 53:3</span>.<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>; “Which the builders refused.” Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:11">Acts 4:11</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But chosen of God - </b>Selected by him as the suitable foundation on which to rear his church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And precious - </b>Valuable. The universe had nothing more valuable on which to rear the spiritual temple.</p>
