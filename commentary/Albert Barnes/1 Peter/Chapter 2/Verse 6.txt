<p style=" "><b>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>. The quotation is substantially as it is found in the Septuagint.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Behold, I lay in Sion - </b>See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span> note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A chief cornerstone - </b>The principal stone on which the corner of the edifice rests. A stone is selected for this which is large and solid, and, usually, one which is squared, and worked with care; and as such a stone is commonly laid with solemn ceremonies, so, perhaps, in allusion to this, it is here said by God that he would lay this stone at the foundation. The solemnities attending this were those which accompanied the great work of the Redeemer. See the word explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Elect - </b>Chosen of God, or selected for this purpose, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he that believeth on him shall not be confounded - </b>Shall not be ashamed. The Hebrew is, “shall not make haste.” See it explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>.</p>
