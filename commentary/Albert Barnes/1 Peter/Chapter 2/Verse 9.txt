<p style=" "><b>But ye are a chosen generation - </b>In contradistinction from those who, by their disobedience, had rejected the Saviour as the foundation of hope. The people of God are often represented as his chosen or elected people. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A royal priesthood - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>. The meaning of this is, probably, that they “at once bore the dignity of kings, and the sanctity of priests” - Doddridge. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>; “And hath made us kings and priests unto God.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:6">Isaiah 61:6</span>; “But ye shall be named priests of the Lord; men shall call ye ministers of our God.” It may be, however, that the word royal is used only to denote the dignity of the priestly office which they sustained, or that they constituted, as it were, an entire nation or kingdom of priests. They were a kingdom over which he presided, and they were all priests; so that it might be said they were a kingdom of priests - a kingdom in which all the subjects were engaged in offering sacrifice to God. The expression appears to be taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span> - “And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests” - and is such language as one who had been educated as a Jew would be likely to employ to set forth the dignity of those whom he regarded as the people of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>An holy nation - </b>This is also taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>. The Hebrews were regarded as a nation consecrated to God; and now that they were cast off or rejected for their disobedience, the same language was properly applied to the people whom God had chosen in their place - the Christian church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A peculiar people - </b>Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>. The margin here is purchased. The word “peculiar,” in its common acceptation now, would mean that they were distinguished from others, or were singular. The reading in the margin would mean that they had been bought or redeemed. Both these things are so, but neither of them expresses the exact sense of the original. The Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαὸς εἰς περιποίησιν</span></span> laos eis peripoiēsin) means, “a people for a possession;” that is, as pertaining to God. They are a people which he has secured as a possession, or as his own; a people, therefore, which belong to him, and to no other. In this sense they are special as being His; and, being such, it may be inferred that they should be special in the sense of being unlike others (unique) in their manner of life. But that idea is not necessarily in the text. There seems to be here also an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:5">Exodus 19:5</span>; “Ye shall be a peculiar treasure with me (Septuagint <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαὸς περιούσιος</span></span> laos periousios) above all people.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye should show forth the praises of him - </b>Margin, “virtues.” The Greek word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀρετὴ</span></span> aretē) means properly “good quality, excellence” of any kind. It means here the excellences of God - His goodness, His wondrous deeds, or those things which make it proper to praise Him. This shows one great object for which they were redeemed. It was that they might proclaim the glory of God, and keep up the remembrance of His wondrous deeds in the earth. This is to be done:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)By proper ascriptions of praise to him in public, family, and social worship;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)By being always the avowed friends of God, ready ever to vindicate His government and ways;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (c)By endeavoring to make known His excellences to all those who are ignorant of Him; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (d)By such a life as shall constantly proclaim His praise - as the sun, the moon, the stars, the hills, the streams, the flowers do, showing what God does. The consistent life of a devoted Christian is a constant setting forth of the praise of God, showing to all that the God who has made him such is worthy to be loved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light - </b>On the word called, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>. Darkness is the emblem of ignorance, sin, and misery, and refers here to their condition before their conversion; light is the emblem of the opposite, and is a beautiful representation of the state of those who are brought to the knowledge of the gospel. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>. The word marvelous means wonderful; and the idea is, that the light of the gospel was such as was unusual, or not to be found elsewhere, as that excites wonder or surprise which we are not accustomed to see. The primary reference here is, undoubtedly, to those who had been pagans, and to the great change which had been produced by their having been brought to the knowledge of the truth as revealed in the gospel; and, in regard to this, no one can doubt that the one state deserved to be characterized as darkness, and the other as light. The contrast was as great as that between midnight and noonday. But what is here said is substantially correct of all who are converted, and is often as strikingly true of those who have been brought up in Christian lands, as of those who have lived among the pagans. The change in conversion is often so great and so rapid, the views and feelings are so different before and after conversion, that it seems like a sudden transition from midnight to noon. In all cases, also, of true conversion, though the change may not be so striking, or apparently so sudden, there is a change of which this may be regarded as substantially an accurate description. In many cases the convert can adopt this language in all its fulness, as descriptive of his own conversion; in all cases of genuine conversion it is true that each one can say that he has been called from a state in which his mind was dark to one in which it is comparatively clear.</p>
