<p style=" ">This chapter embraces the following subjects:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. The duty of wives, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1-6">1 Peter 3:1-6</span>. Particularly:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a)That their conduct should be such as would be adapted to lead their unbelieving husbands to embrace a religion whose happy influence was seen in the pure conduct of their wives, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1-2">1 Peter 3:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. The duty of husbands, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span>. It was their duty to render all proper honor to their wives, and to live with them as fellow-heirs of salvation, that their prayers might not be hindered; implying:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)That in the most important respects they were on an equality;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (2)That they would pray together, or that there would be family prayer; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (3)That it was the duty of husband and wife so to live together that their prayers might ascend from united hearts, and that it would be consistent for God to answer them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. The general duty of unity and of kindness, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:8-14">1 Peter 3:8-14</span>. They were:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a)To be of one mind; to have compassion; to love as brethren, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:8">1 Peter 3:8</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. The duty of being ready always to give to every man a reason for the hope they entertained; and, if they were called to suffer persecution and trial in the service of God, of being able still to show good reasons why they professed to be Christians, and of so living that those who wronged them should see that their religion was more than a name, and was founded in such truth as to command the assent even of their persecutors, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:15-17">1 Peter 3:15-17</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> V. In their persecutions and trials they were to remember the example of Christ, his trials, his patience, and his triumphs, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18-22">1 Peter 3:18-22</span>. Particularly:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a) the apostle refers them to the fact that he had suffered, though he was innocent, and that he was put to death though he had done no wrong, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (b) He refers them to the patience and an age of great and abounding wickedness, when in the person of his representative and ambassador Noah, he suffered much and long from the opposition of the guilty and perverse people who were finally destroyed, and who are now held in prison, showing us how patient we ought to be when offended by others in our attempts to do them good, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:19-20">1 Peter 3:19-20</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (c) He refers to the fact that notwithstanding all the opposition which Noah met with in bearing a message, as an ambassador of the Lord, to a wicked generation, he and his family were saved, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>. The design of this allusion evidently is to show us, that if we are patient and forbearing in the trials which we meet with in the world, we shall be saved also. Noah, says the apostle, was saved by water. We, too, says he, are saved in a similar manner by water. In his salvation, and in ours, water is employed as the means of salvation: in his case by bearing up the ark, in ours by becoming the emblem of the washing away of sins.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (d) The apostle refers to the fact that Christ has ascended to heaven, and has been exalted over angels, and principalities, and powers; thus showing that having borne all his trials with patience he ultimately triumphed, and that in like manner we, if we are patient, shall triumph also, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>. He came off a conqueror, and was exalted to the highest honors of heaven; and so, if faithful, we may hope to come off conquerors also, and be exalted to the honors of heaven as he was. The whole argument here is drawn from the example of Christ, first, in his patience and forbearance with the whole world, and then when he was personally on the earth; from the fact, that in the case of that messenger whom he sent to the ungodly race before the flood, and in his own case when personally on earth, there was ultimate triumph after all that they met with from ungodly people; and thus, if we endure opposition and trials in the same way, we may hope also to triumph in heaven with our exalted Saviour.</p>
