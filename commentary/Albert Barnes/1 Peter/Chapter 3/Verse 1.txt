<p style=" "><b>Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands - </b>On the duty here enjoined, see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3-9">1 Corinthians 11:3-9</span> notes, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That, if any obey not the word - </b>The word of God; the gospel. That is, if any wives have husbands who are not true Christians. This would be likely to occur when the gospel was first preached, as it does now, by the fact that wives might be converted, though their husbands were not. It cannot be inferred from this, that after they themselves had become Christians they had married unbelieving husbands. The term “word” here refers particularly to the gospel as preached; and the idea is, that if they were regardless of that gospel when preached - if they would not attend on preaching, or if they were unaffected by it, or if they openly rejected it, there might be hope still that they would be converted by the Christian influence of a wife at home. In such cases, a duty of special importance devolves on the wife.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They also may without the word be won - </b>In some other way than by preaching. This I does not mean that they would be converted independently of the influence of truth - for truth is always the instrument of conversion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span>; but that it was to be by another influence than preaching.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the conversation of the wives - </b>By the conduct or deportment of their wives. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>. The word conversation, in the Scriptures, is never confined, as it is now with us, to oral discourse, but denotes conduct in general. It includes indeed “conversation” as the word is now used, but it embraces also much more - including everything that we do. The meaning here is, that the habitual deportment of the wife was to be such as to show the reality and power of religion; to show that it had such influence on her temper, her words, her whole deportment, as to demonstrate that it was from God.</p>
