Let him eschew evil - Let him avoid all evil. Compare Job 1:1.And do good - In any and every way; by endeavoring to promote the happiness of all. Compare the notes at Galatians 6:10.Let him seek peace, and ensue it - Follow it; that is, practice it. See the Matthew 5:9 note; Romans 12:18 note. The meaning is, that a peaceful spirit will contribute to length of days: (2)Such a spirit will preserve us from those contentions and strifes to which so many owe their death. Let anyone reflect on the numbers that are killed in duels, in battles, and in brawls, and he will have no difficulty in seeing how a peace fill spirit will contribute to length of days.
