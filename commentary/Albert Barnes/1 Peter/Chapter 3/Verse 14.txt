<p style=" "><b>But and if ye suffer for righteousness” sake - </b>Implying that though, in general, a holy character would constitute safety, yet that there was a possibility that they might suffer persecution. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12">2 Timothy 3:12</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Happy are ye - </b>Perhaps alluding to what the Saviour says in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span>; “Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness” sake.” On the meaning of the word happy or blessed, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>. The meaning here is, not that they would find positive enjoyment in persecution on account of righteousness, but that they were to regard it as a blessed condition; that is, as a condition that might be favorable to salvation; and they were not therefore, on the whole, to regard it as an evil.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And be not afraid of their terror - </b>Of anything which they can do to cause terror. There is evidently an allusion here to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:12-13">Isaiah 8:12-13</span>; “Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.” See the notes at that passage. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:12">Isaiah 51:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:28">Matthew 10:28</span>. “Neither be troubled.” With apprehension of danger. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>. If we are true Christians, we have really no reason to be alarmed in view of anything that can happen to us. God is our protector, and he is abundantly able to vanquish all our foes; to uphold us in all our trials; to conduct us through the valley of death, and to bring us to heaven. “All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21-22">1 Corinthians 3:21-22</span>.</p>
