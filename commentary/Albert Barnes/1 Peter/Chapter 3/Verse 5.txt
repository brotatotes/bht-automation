<p style=" "><b>For after this manner, in the old time - </b>The allusion here is particularly to the times of the patriarchs, and the object of the apostle is to state another reason why they should seek that kind of ornament which he had been commending. The reason is, that this characterized the pious and honored females of ancient times - those females who had been most commended of God, and who were most worthy to be remembered on earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who trusted in God - </b>Greek, “Who hoped in God;” that is, who were truly pious. They were characterized by simple trust or hope in God, rather than by a fondness for external adorning.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Adorned themselves - </b>To wit, with a meek and quiet spirit, manifested particularly by the respect evinced for their husbands.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being in subjection unto their own husbands - </b>This was evidently a characteristic of the early periods of the world; and piety was understood to consist much in proper respect for others, according to the relations sustained toward them.</p>
