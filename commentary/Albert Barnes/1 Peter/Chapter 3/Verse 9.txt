Not rendering evil for evil - See the Matthew 5:39, Matthew 5:44 notes; Romans 12:17 note.Or railing for railing - See the notes at 1 Timothy 6:4. Compare Mark 15:29; Luke 23:39.But contrariwise blessing - In a spirit contrary to this. See the notes at Matthew 5:44.Knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing - “Knowing that you were called to be Christians in order that you should obtain a blessing infinite and eternal in the heavens. Expecting such a blessing yourselves, you should be ready to scatter blessings on all others. You should be ready to bear all their reproaches, and even to wish them well. The hope of eternal life should make your minds calm; and the prospect that you are to be so exalted in heaven should fill your hearts with benignity and love.” There is nothing which is better suited to cause our hearts to overflow with benignity, to make us ready to forgive all others when they injure us, than the hope of salvation. Cherishing such a hope ourselves, we cannot but wish that all others may share it, and this will lead us to wish for them every blessing, A man who has a hope of heaven should abound in every virtue. and show that he is a sincere well-wisher of the race. Why should one who expects soon to be in heaven harbor malice in his bosom? Why should he wish to injure a fellow-worm? How can he?
