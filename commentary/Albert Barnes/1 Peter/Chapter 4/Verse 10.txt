<p style=" "><b>As every man hath received the gift - </b>The word rendered “the gift” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χάρισμα</span></span> charisma,) in the Greek, without the article, means “endowment” of any kind, but especially that conferred by the Holy Spirit. Here it seems to refer to every kind of endowment by which we can do good to others; especially every kind of qualification furnished by religion by which we can help others. It does not refer here particularly to the ministry of the word - though it is applicable to that, and includes that - but to all the gifts and graces by which we can contribute to the welfare of others. All this is regarded as a gift, or charisma, of God. It is not owing to ourselves, but is to be traced to him. See the word explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even so minister the same one to another - </b>In anything by which you can benefit another. Regard What you have and they have not as a gift bestowed upon you by God for the common good, and be ready to impart it as the needs of ethers require. The word “minister” here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονοῦντες</span></span> diakonountes) would refer to any kind of ministering, whether by counsel, by advice, by the supply of the needs of the poor, or by preaching. It has here no reference to any one of these exclusively; but means, that in whatever God has favored us more than others, we should be ready to minister to their needs. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:18">2 Timothy 1:18</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 3:8</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19-20">2 Corinthians 8:19-20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As good stewards - </b>Regarding yourselves as the mere stewards of God; that is, as appointed by him to do this work for him, and entrusted by him with what is needful to benefit others. He intends to do them good, but he means to do it through your instrumentality, and has entrusted to you as a steward what he designed to confer on them. This is the true idea, in respect to any special endowments of talent, property, or grace, which we may have received from God. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:1-2">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1-2">Luke 16:1-2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span> notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the manifold grace of God - </b>The grace or favor of God evinced in many ways, or by a variety of gifts. His favors are not confined to one single thing; as, for example, to talent for doing good by preaching; but are extended to a great many things by which we may do good to others - influence, property, reputation, wisdom, experience. All these are to be regarded as his gifts; all to be employed in doing good to others as we have opportunity.</p>
