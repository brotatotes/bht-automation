<p style=" "><b>But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christâ€™s sufferings - </b>That is, sufferings of the same kind that he endured, and inflicted for the same reasons. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>; See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:12">Matthew 5:12</span>. The meaning here is, that they were to regard it as a matter of rejoicing that they were identified with Christ, even in suffering. See this sentiment illustrated at length in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That, when his glory shall be revealed - </b>At the day of judgment. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:30">Matthew 26:30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye may be glad also with exceeding joy - </b>Being admitted to the rewards which he will then confer on his people. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>. Every good man will have joy when, immediately at death, he is received into the presence of his Saviour; but his joy will be complete only when, in the presence of assembled worlds, he shall hear the sentence which shall confirm him in happiness forever.</p>
