See the notes at 2 Corinthians 5:15.The rest of his time in the flesh - The remainder of the time that he is to continue in the flesh; that is, that he is to live on the earth.To the lusts of men - Such lusts as people commonly live for and indulge in. Some of these are enumerated in the following verse.But to the will of God - In such a manner as God commands. The object of redemption is to rescue us from being swayed by wicked lusts, and to bring us to be conformed wholly to the will of God.
