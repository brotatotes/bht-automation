But the God of all grace - The God who imparts all needful grace. It was proper in their anticipated trials to direct them to God, and to breathe forth in their behalf an earnest and affectionate prayer that they might be supported. A prayer of this kind by an apostle would also be to them a sort of pledge or assurance that the needed grace would be granted them.Who hath called us unto his eternal glory - And who means, therefore, that we shall be saved. As he has called us to his glory, we need not apprehend that he will leave or forsake us. On the meaning of the word called, see the notes at Ephesians 4:1.After that ye have suffered a while - After you have suffered as long as he shall appoint. The Greek is, “having suffered a little,” and may refer either to time or degree. In both respects the declaration concerning afflictions is true. They are short, compared with eternity; they are light, compared with the exceeding and eternal weight of glory. See the notes at 2 Corinthians 4:16-18.Make you perfect - By means of your trials. The tendency of affliction is to make us perfect.Stablish - The Greek word means “to set fast; to fix firmly; to render immovable,” Luke 16:26; Luke 9:51; Luke 22:32; Romans 1:11; Rom 16:25; 1 Thessalonians 3:2, 1 Thessalonians 3:13, et al.Strengthen - Give you strength to bear all this.Settle you - Literally, found you, or establish you on a firm foundation - θεμελιώσες themeliōses. The allusion is to a house which is so firmly fixed on a foundation that it will not be moved by winds or floods. Compare the notes at Matthew 7:24 ff.
