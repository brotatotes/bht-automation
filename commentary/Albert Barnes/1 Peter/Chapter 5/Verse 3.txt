<p style=" "><b>Neither as being lords - </b>Margin, “overruling.” The word here used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακυριεύω</span></span> katakurieuō) is rendered “exercise dominion over,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:25">Matthew 20:25</span>; exercise lordship over, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:42">Mark 10:42</span>; and overcame, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:16">Acts 19:16</span>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It refers properly to that kind of jurisdiction which civil rulers or magistrates exercise. This is an exercise of authority, as contradistinguished from the influence of reason, persuasion, and example. The latter pertains to the ministers of religion; the former is forbidden to them. Their dominion is not to be that of temporal lordship; it is to be that of love and truth. This command would prohibit all assumption of temporal power by the ministers of religion, and all conferring of titles of nobility on those who are preachers of the gospel. It needs scarcely to be said that it has been very little regarded in the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Over God’s heritage - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των κλήρων</span></span> tōn klērōn. Vulgate: “in cleris” - over the clergy. The Greek word here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλῆρος</span></span> klēros) is that from which the word “clergy” has been derived; and some have interpreted it here as referring to the clergy, that is, to priests and deacons who are under the authority of a bishop. Such an interpretation, I however, would hardly be adopted now. The word means properly:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)A lot, die, anything used in determining chances;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)A part or portion, such as is assigned by lot; hence,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (c)An office to which one is designated or appointed, by lot or otherwise; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (d)In general any possession or heritage, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The meaning here is, “not lording it over the possessions or the heritage of God.” The reference is, undoubtedly, to the church, as that which is especially his property; his own in the world. Whitby and others suppose that it refers to the possessions or property of the church; Doddridge explains it - “not assuming dominion over those who fall to your lot,” supposing it to mean that they were not to domineer over the particular congregations committed by Providence to their care. But the other interpretation is most in accordance with the usual meaning of the word.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But being ensamples to the flock - </b>Examples. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>. Peter has drawn here with great beauty, the appropriate character of the ministers of the gospel, and described the spirit with which they should be actuated in the discharge of the duties of their office. But how different it is from the character of many who have claimed to be ministers of religion; and especially how different from that corrupt communion which professes in a special manner to recognize Peter as the head, and the vicegerent of Christ. It is well remarked by Benson on this passage, that “the church of Rome could not well have acted more directly contrary to this injunction of Peter’s if she had studied to disobey it, and to form herself upon a rule that should be the reverse of this.”</p>
