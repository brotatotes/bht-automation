<p style=" "><b>Casting all your care upon him - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:22">Psalms 55:22</span>, from whence this passage was probably taken. “Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.” Compare, for a similar sentiment, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25-30">Matthew 6:25-30</span>. The meaning is, that we are to commit our whole cause to him. If we suffer heavy trials; if we lose our friends, health, or property; if we have arduous and responsible duties to perform; if we feel that we have no strength, and are in danger of being crushed by what is laid upon us, we may go and cast all upon the Lord; that is, we may look to him for grace and strength, and feel assured that he will enable us to sustain all that is laid upon us. The relief in the case will be as real, and as full of consolation, as if he took the burden and bore it himself. He will enable us to bear with ease what we supposed we could never have done; and the burden which he lays upon us will be light, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>.

<p style=" "><b>For he careth for you - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:29-31">Matthew 10:29-31</span>. He is not like the gods worshipped by many of the pagan, who were supposed to be so exalted, and so distant, that they did not interest themselves in human affairs; but He condescends to regard the needs of the meanest of his creatures. It is one of the glorious attributes of the true God, that he can and will thus notice the needs of the mean as well as the mighty; and one of the richest of all consolations when we are afflicted, and are despised by the world, is the thought that we are not forgotten by our heavenly Father. He who remembers the falling sparrow, and who hears the young ravens when they cry, will not be unmindful of us. “Yet the Lord thinketh on me,” was the consolation of David, when he felt that he was “poor and needy,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:17">Psalms 40:17</span>. “When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+27:10">Psalms 27:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:15">Isaiah 49:15</span>. What more can one wish than to be permitted to feel that the great and merciful Yahweh thinks on him? What are we - what have we done, that should be worthy of such condescension? Remember, poor, despised, afflicted child of God, that you will never be forgotten. Friends on earth, the great, the frivilous, the noble, the rich, may forget you; God never will. Remember that you will never be entirely neglected. Father, mother, neighbor, friend, those whom you have loved, and those to whom you have done good, may neglect you, but God never will. You may become poor, and they may pass by you; you may lose your office, and flatterers may no longer throng your path; your beauty may fade, and your admirers may leave you; you may grow old, and be infirm, and appear to be useless in the world, and no one may seem to care for you; but it is not thus with the God whom you serve. When he loves, he always loves; if he regarded you with favor when you were rich, he will not forget you when you are poor; he who watched over you with a parent’s care in the bloom of youth, will not cast you off when you are “old and grey-headed,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+71:18">Psalms 71:18</span>. If we are what we should be, we shall never be without a friend as long as there is a God.</p>
