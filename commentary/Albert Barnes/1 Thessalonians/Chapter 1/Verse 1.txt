Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus - On the reasons why Paul associated other names with his in his epistles, see the 1 Corinthians 1:1 note, and 2 Corinthians 2:1 note. Silvanus, or Silas, and Timothy were properly united with him on this occasion, because they had been with him when the church was founded there, Acts 17:0, and because Timothy had been sent by the apostle to visit them after he had himself been driven away; 1 Thessalonians 2:1-2. Silas is first mentioned in the New Testament as one who was sent by the church at Jerusalem with Paul to Antioch (notes, Acts 15:22); and he afterward became his traveling companion.Which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ - Who are united to the true God and to the Redeemer; or who sustain an intimate relation to the Father and the Lord Jesus. This is strong language, denoting, that they were a true church; compare 1 John 5:20. “Grace be unto you,” etc.; see the notes, Romans 1:7.
