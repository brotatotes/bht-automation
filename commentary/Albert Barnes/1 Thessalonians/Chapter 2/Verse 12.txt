<p style=" "><b>That ye would walk worthy of God ... - </b>That you would live in such a manner as would honor God, who has chosen you to be his friends; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>. A child “walks worthy of a parent” when he lives in such way as to reflect honor on that parent for the method in which he has trained him; when he so lives as to bring no disgrace on him, so as not to pain his heart by misconduct, or so as to give no occasion to any to speak reproachfully of him. This he does, when:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)He keeps all his commands;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)When he leads a life of purity and virtue;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)When he carries out the principles of the family into his own life;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)When he honors a father by evincing a profound respect for his opinions; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)When he endeavors to provide for his comfort and to promote his welfare.</p>
<p style=" ">In a manner similar to this, a true Christian honors God. He lives so as not to bring a reproach upon him or his cause, and so as to teach the world to honor him who has bestowed such grace upon him.</p>
