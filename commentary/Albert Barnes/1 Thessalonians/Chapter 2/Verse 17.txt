<p style=" "><b>But we, brethren, being taken from you - </b>There is more implied in the Greek word here rendered, “being taken from you “ - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀπορφανισθέντες</span></span> aporphanisthentes - than appears from our translation. It properly has relation to the condition of an orphan (compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span>), or one who is bereaved of parents, or one who is bereaved of parents}. Then it is used in a more general sense, denoting to be bereaved of; and in this place it does not mean merely that he was “taken from them,” but there is included the idea that it was like a painful bereavement. It was such a state as that of one who had lost a parent. No word, perhaps, could have expressed stranger attachment for them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For a short time - </b>Greek, “For the time of an hour;” that is, for a brief period. The meaning is, that when he left them he supposed it would be only for a short time. The fact seems to have been <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:10">Acts 17:10</span>, that it was supposed, when Paul was sent to Berea, that things would soon be in such a state that he could safely return to Thessalonica. He was “sent” there by those who thought it was necessary for the safety of some of his friends at Thessalonica, and he evidently purposed to return as soon as it could properly be done. It had, in fact, however, turned out to be a long and painful absence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In presence, not in heart - </b>My heart was still with you. This is an elegant and touching expression, which we still use to denote affection for an absent friend.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face - </b>Made every endeavor possible. It was from no want of affection that I have not done it, but from causes beyond my control.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With great desire - </b>Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15">Luke 22:15</span>.</p>
