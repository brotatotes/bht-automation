<p style=" "><b>Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul - </b>The phrase “even I Paul,” seems to be used by way of emphasis. He had a special desire to go himself. He had sent Timothy to them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>, and perhaps, some might have been disposed to allege that Paul was afraid to go himself, or that he did not feel interest enough in them to go, though he was willing to send one to visit them. Paul, therefore, is at much pains to assure them that his long separation from them was unavoidable.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But Satan hindered us - </b>Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>. In what way this was done is unknown, and conjecture would be useless. The apostle recognized the hand of Satan in frustrating his attempt to do good, and preventing the accomplishment of his strong desire to see his Christian friends. In the obstacles, therefore, to the performance of our duty, and in the hindrances of our enjoyment, it is not improper to trace the hand of the great enemy of good. The agency of Satan may, for aught we can tell, often be employed in the embarrassments that we meet with in life. The hindrances which we meet with in our efforts to do good, when the providence of God seems to favor us, and his word and Spirit seem to call us to a particular duty, often look very much like the work of Satan. They are just such obstructions as a very wicked being would be glad to throw in our way.</p>
