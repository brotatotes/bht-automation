<p style=" "><b>For our exhortation - </b>That is, the exhortation to embrace the gospel. The word seems to be used here so as to include preaching in general. The sense is, that the means which they used to induce them to become Christians were not such as to delude them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was not of deceit - </b>Was not founded on sophistry. The apostle means to say, that the Thessalonians knew that his manner of preaching was not such as was adopted by the advocates of error.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor of uncleanness - </b>Not such as to lead to an impure life. It was such as to lead to holiness and purity. The apostle appeals to what they knew to be the tendency of his doctrine as an evidence that it was true. Most of the teaching of the pagan philosophers led to a life of licentiousness and corruption. The tendency of the gospel was just the reverse.<b>Nor in guile - </b>Not by the arts of deceit. There was no craftiness or trick, such as could not bear a severe scrutiny. No point was carried by art, cunning, or stratagem. Everything was done on the most honorable and fair principles. It is much when a man can say that he has never endeavored to accomplish anything by mere trick, craft, or cunning. Sagacity and shrewdness are always allowable in ministers as well as others; trick and cunning never. Yet stratagem often takes the place of sagacity, and trick is often miscalled shrewdness. Guile, craft, cunning. imply deception, and can never be reconciled with that entire honesty which a minister of the gospel, and all other Christians, ought to possess; see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:16">2 Corinthians 12:16</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:2">Psalms 32:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+34:13">Psalms 34:13</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Joh 1:47</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:22">1 Peter 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:5">Revelation 14:5</span>.</p>
