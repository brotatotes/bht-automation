<p style=" "><b>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:11-12">1 Timothy 1:11-12</span>. Since there had been committed to us an office so high and holy, and so much demanding sincerity, fidelity, and honesty, we endeavored to act in all respects in conformity to the trust reposed in us. The gospel is a system of truth and sincerity, and we evinced the same. The gospel is concerned with great realities, and we did not resort to trick and illusion. The office of the ministry is most responsible, and we acted in view of the great account which we must render. The meaning is, that Paul had such a sense of the truth, reality, and importance of the gospel, and of his responsibility, as effectually to keep him from anything like craft or cunning in preaching it. An effectual restrainer from mere management and trick will always be found in a deep conviction of the truth and importance of religion. Artifice and cunning are the usual accompaniments of a bad cause - and, when adopted by a minister of the gospel, will usually, when detected, leave the impression that he feels that he is engaged in such a cause. If an object cannot be secured by sincerity and straight-forward dealing, it is not desirable that it should be secured at all.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even so we speak - </b>In accordance with the nature of the gospel; with the truth and sincerity which such a cause demands.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not as pleasing men - </b>Not in the manner of impostors, who make it their object to please people. The meaning of the apostle is, that he did not aim to teach such doctrines as would flatter people; as would win their applause; or as would gratify their passions or their fancy. We are not to suppose that he desired to offend people; or that he regarded their esteem as of no value; or that he was indifferent whether they were pleased or displeased; but that it was not the direct object of his preaching to please them. It was to declare the truth, and to obtain the approbation of God whatever people might think of it; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which trieth our hearts - </b>It is often said to be an attribute of God that he tries or searches the hearts of people; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+28:9">1 Chronicles 28:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+29:17">1 Chronicles 29:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+11:20">Jeremiah 11:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:10">Jeremiah 17:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+11:4">Psalms 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span>. The meaning here is, that the apostle had a deep conviction of the truth that God knew all his motives, and that all would be revealed in the last day.</p>
