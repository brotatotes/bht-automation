<p style=" "><b>Wherefore - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span>. This particle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διὸ</span></span> dio) is designed here to refer to another proof of his affection for them. One evidence had been referred to in his strong desire to visit them, which he had been unable to accomplish <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span>, and he here refers to another - to wit, the fact that he had sent Timothy to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We could no longer forbear - </b>That is, when I could not <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>, for there is every evidence that Paul refers to himself only though he uses the plural form of the word. There was no one with him at Athens after he had sent Timothy away <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:15">Acts 17:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span>, and this shows that when, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span>, he uses the term apostles in the plural number, he refers to himself only, and does not mean to give the name to Timothy and Silas. If this be so, Timothy and Silas are nowhere called “apostles” in the New Testament. The word rendered here “could forbear” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στέγοντες</span></span> stegontes), means, properly, “to cover, to conceal;” and then to hide or conceal anger, impatience, weariness, etc.; that is, to hold out as to anything, to bear with, to endure. It is rendered suffer in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:12">1 Corinthians 9:12</span>; beareth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7">1 Corinthians 13:7</span>; and forbear, <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Th 3:1</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>. It is not elsewhere used in the New Testament. It means that he could no longer bear up under, hide, or suppress his impatience in regard to them - his painful emotions - his wish to know of their state; and he therefore sent Timothy to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We thought it good - </b>I was willing to suffer the inconvenience of parting with him in order to show my concern for you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To be left at Athens alone - </b>Paul had been conducted to Athens from Berea, where he remained until Silas and Timothy could come to him; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:15">Acts 17:15</span>. It appears from the statement here that Timothy had joined him there, but such was his solicitude for the church at Thessalonica, that he very soon after sent him there, and chose to remain himself alone at Athens. Why he did not himself return to Thessalonica, is not stated. It is evidently implied here that it was a great personal inconvenience for him thus to part with Timothy, and to remain alone at Athens, and that he evinced the strong love which he had for the church at Thessalonica by being willing to submit to it. What that inconvenience consisted in, he has not stated, but it is not difficult to understand,</p>
<p style=" ">(1) He was among total strangers, and, when Timothy was gone, without an acquaintance or friend.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The aid of Timothy was needed in order to prosecute the work which he contemplated. He had requested that Timothy should join him as soon as possible when he left Berea <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:15">Acts 17:15</span>, and he evidently felt it desirable that in preaching the gospel in that city he should have all the assistance he could obtain. Yet he was willing to forego those comforts and advantages in order to promote the edification of the church at Thessalonica.</p>
