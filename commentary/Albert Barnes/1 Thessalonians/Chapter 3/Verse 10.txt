<p style=" "><b>Night and day - </b>Constantly.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Praying exceedingly - </b>Greek, abundantly; that is, there was much more than ordinary prayer. He made this a special subject of prayer; he urged it with earnestness, and without intermission; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:17">1 Thessalonians 2:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And might perfect that which is lacking in your faith - </b>Might render it complete, or fill up anything which is missing. The word used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταρτίσαι</span></span> katartisai), means, properly, to make fully ready, to put full in order, to make complete; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:9">2 Corinthians 13:9</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span> note. It is rendered mending, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:21">Matthew 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:19">Mark 1:19</span>; perfect and perfected, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Luk 6:40</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Heb 13:21</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:10">1 Peter 5:10</span>; fitted, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>; perfectly joined together, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>; restore, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>; prepared, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>; and framed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span>. It is not elsewhere used in the New Testament. The meaning here is, that whatever was deficient in their views of religious doctrine the apostle desired to supply. It is to be remembered that he was with them but a comparatively short time before he was compelled to depart to Berea, and it is reasonable to suppose that there were many subjects on which he would be glad to have an opportunity to instruct them more fully.</p>
