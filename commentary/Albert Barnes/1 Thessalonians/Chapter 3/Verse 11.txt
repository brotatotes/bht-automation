<p style=" "><b>Now God himself - </b>This is evidently a prayer. He earnestly sought of God that he might be permitted to visit them, and that he would so prepare the way that he might do it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And our Father - </b>Even our Father. The reference is particularly to the “Father,” the First Person of the Trinity. It does not refer to the divine nature in general, or to God as such, but to God as the Father of the Lord Jesus. It is a distinct prayer offered to him that he would direct his way to them. It is right therefore to offer prayer to God as the First Person of the Trinity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And our Lord Jesus Christ - </b>This also is a prayer, as much as the former was, for it can be understood in no other way. What can be its meaning, unless the apostle believed that the Lord Jesus had power to direct his way to them, and that it was proper for him to express this wish to him; that is, to pray to him? If this be so, then it is right to pray to the Lord Jesus, or to worship him; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span> note. Would Paul have prayed to an angel to direct his way to the church at Thessalonica?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Direct our way unto you - </b>Margin, “guide.” The Greek word - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατευθύνω</span></span> kateuthunō - means, to guide straight toward or upon anything. It is rendered “guide,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79">Luke 1:79</span>, and “direct” here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:5">2 Thessalonians 3:5</span>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The idea is that or conducting one straight to a place, and not by a round-about course. Here the petition is, that God would remove all obstacles so that he could come directly to them.</p>
