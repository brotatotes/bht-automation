<p style=" "><b>To the end he may stablish your hearts - </b>That is, “may the Lord cause you to increase in love <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:12">1 Thessalonians 3:12</span>, in order that you may be established, and be without blame in the day of judgment.” The idea is, that if charity were diffused through their hearts, they would abound in every virtue, and would be at length found blameless.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unblameable - </b>See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:6">Philippians 3:6</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:7">Hebrews 8:7</span> note; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>. The meaning is, so that there could be no “charge” or “accusation” against them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In holiness - </b>Not in outward conduct merely, or the observance of rites and forms of religion, but in purity of heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>At the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ - </b>To judge the world; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>. As we are to appear before him, we should so live that our Judge will find nothing in us to be blamed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With all his saints - </b>With all his “holy ones” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τῶν ἁγίων</span></span> tōn hagiōn. The word includes his “angels,” who will come with him <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span>, and all the redeemed, who will then surround him. The idea is, that before that holy assemblage it is desirable that we should be prepared to appear blameless. We should be fitted to be welcomed to the “goodly fellowship” of the angels, and to be regarded as worthy to be numbered with the redeemed who” have washed their robes and have made them pure in the blood of the Lamb.” When we come to appear amidst that vast assemblage of holy beings, the honors of the world will appear to be small things; the wealth of the earth will appear worthless, and all the pleasures of this life beneath our notice. Happy will they be who are prepared for the solemnities of that day, and who shall have led such a life of holy love - of pure devotion to the Redeemer - of deadness to the world - and of zeal in the cause of pure religion of universal justice, fidelity, honesty, and truth, as to be without reproach, and to meet with the approbation of their Lord.</p>
