<p style=" "><b>And that ye have good remembrance of us always - </b>That is, probably, they showed their remembrance of Paul by obeying his precepts, and by cherishing an affectionate regard for him, notwithstanding all the efforts which had been made to alienate their affections from him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you - </b>There was no disposition to blame him for having left them, or because he did not return to them. They would have welcomed him again as their teacher and friend. The meaning of this is, that there was between him and them a strong mutual attachment.</p>
