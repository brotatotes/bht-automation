<p style=" ">The first part embraces the following topics:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) An exhortation to increase and abound in the Christian virtues which they had already manifested; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1-2">1 Thessalonians 4:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) A particular exhortation on the subject of sanctification <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:3-8">1 Thessalonians 4:3-8</span>, in which two points are specified, probably as illustrations of the general subject, and embracing those in regard to which they were exposed to special danger. The first was fornication, the other was fraud.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) An exhortation to brotherly love; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:9-10">1 Thessalonians 4:9-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) An exhortation to quiet industry, and to honesty in their dealings. particularly with those who were Christians; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:11-12">1 Thessalonians 4:11-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The second part is designed to comfort the Thessalonians who had been bereaved; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13-18">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</span>. Some of their number had died. They appear to have been beloved members of the church, and dear friends of those to whom the apostle wrote. To console them he brings into view the doctrine of the second coming of the Saviour, and the truth that they would be raised up to live with him for ever. He reminds them that those who had died were “asleep” - reposing in a gentle slumber, as if they were to be awakened again <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>; that they should not sorrow as they did who have no hope <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>; that if they believed that Jesus died and rose again, they ought to believe that God would raise up all those who sleep in Jesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:14">1 Thessalonians 4:14</span>; that in the last day they would rise before the living should be changed, and that the living would not be taken up to heaven and leave their departed friends in their graves <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15-16">1 Thessalonians 4:15-16</span>, and that both the living and the dead would be raised up to heaven and would be forever with the Lord <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span>. With this prospect, they had every ground of comfort which they could desire, and they should sustain each other in their trials by this bright hope; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:18">1 Thessalonians 4:18</span>.</p>
