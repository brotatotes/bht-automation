<p style=" "><b>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without - </b>Out of the church; comp notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>. The word rendered honestly, means “becomingly, decorously, in a proper manner;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:40">1 Corinthians 14:40</span>. It does not refer here to mere honesty in the transaction of business, but to their general treatment of those who were not professing Christians. They were to conduct themselves toward them in all respects in a becoming manner - to be honest with them; to be faithful to their engagements; to be kind and courteous in their conversation; to show respect where it was due, and to endeavor in every way to do them good. There are few precepts of religion more important than those which enjoin upon Christians the duty of a proper treatment of those who are not connected with the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And that ye may have lack of nothing - </b>Margin, no man. The Greek will bear either construction, but the translation in the text is probably the correct one. The phrase is to be taken in connection not merely with that which immediately precedes it - as if “their walking honestly toward those who were without” would preserve them from want - but as meaning that their industrious and quiet habits; their patient attention to their own business, and upright dealing with every man, would do it. They would, in this way, have a competence, and would not be beholden to others. Learn hence, that it is the duty of a Christian so to live as not to be dependent on others, unless he is made so by events of divine Providence which he cannot foresee or control. No man should be dependent on others as the result of idle habits; of extravagance and improvidence; of the neglect of his own business, and of intermeddling with that of others. If by age, losses, infirmities, sickness, he is made dependent, he cannot be blamed, and he should not repine at his lot. One of the ways in which a Christian may always do good in society, and honor his religion, is by quiet and patient industry, and by showing that religion prompts to those habits of economy on which the happiness of society so much depends.</p>
