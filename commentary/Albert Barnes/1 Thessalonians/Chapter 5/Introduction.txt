Analysis Of The ChapterThis chapter consists of two parts: I. In the first part, the apostle states: (1)That it was well understood by the Thessalonians that the coming of the Lord would be sudden, and at an unexpected moment,1 Thessalonians 5:1-2; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-2; (2)He refers to the effect of his coming on the wicked and the righteous, and says that it would be attended with the sudden and inevitable destruction of the former, 1 Thessalonians 5:3; but that the result of his coming would be far different on the righteous; 1 Thessalonians 5:4-11.The prospect of his coming was fitted to make them watchful and sober, 1 Thessalonians 5:6-8; and his advent would be attended with their certain salvation; 1 Thessalonians 5:9. II. In the second part of the chapter, he exhorts them to show proper respect for their spiritual teachers and rulers, 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13; to endeavor to restrain the unruly, to support the feeble, and to evince toward all the spirit of patience and forbearance, 1 Thessalonians 5:14; to manifest a meek and benevolent manner of life, 1 Thessalonians 5:15; to rejoice always, 1 Thessalonians 5:16; to pray constantly, 1 Thessalonians 5:17; to render thanks to God in every situation, 1 Thessalonians 5:18; to cherish the influences of the Holy Ghost on their souls, 1 Thessalonians 5:19; to show respect for all the divine prophetic communications, 1 Thessalonians 5:20; to consider and examine carefully everything submitted to them for belief; to adhere steadfastly to all that was good and true, 1 Thessalonians 5:21; and to avoid the very appearance of evil, 1 Thessalonians 5:22. The Epistle closes with a fervent prayer that God would sanctify them entirely; with an earnest entreaty that they would pray for him; with a command that the Epistle should be read to all the churches, and with the benediction; 1 Thessalonians 5:22-28.
