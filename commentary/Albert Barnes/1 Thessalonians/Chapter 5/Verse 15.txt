<p style=" "><b>See that none render evil for evil - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:44">Matthew 5:44</span>. The meaning here is, that we are not to take vengeance; compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:17">Romans 12:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:19">Romans 12:19</span>. This law is positive, and is universally binding. The moment we feel ourselves acting from a desire to “return evil for evil,” that moment we are acting wrong. It may be right to defend our lives and the lives of our friends; to seek the protection of the law for our persons, reputation, or property, against those who would wrong us; to repel the assaults of calumniators and slanderers, but in no case should the motive be to do them wrong for the evil which they have done us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But ever follow that which is good - </b>Which is benevolent, kind, just, generous; see the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:20-21">Romans 12:20-21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Both among yourselves, and to all men - </b>The phrase “to all men,” seems to have been added to avoid the possibility of misconstruction. Some might possibly suppose that this was a good rule to be observed toward those of their own number, but that a greater latitude in avenging injuries might be allowable toward their enemies out of the church. The apostle, therefore, says that the rule is universal. It relates to the pagan, to infidels, sceptics, and persecutors, as well as to the members of the church. To every man we are to do good as we are able - no matter what they do to us. This is the rule which God himself observes toward the evil and unthankful (notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:45">Matthew 5:45</span>), and is one of the original and beautiful laws of our holy religion.</p>
