<p style=" "><b>I charge you by the Lord - </b>Margin, “adjure.” Greek, “I put you under oath by the Lord” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενορκίζω ὑμᾶς τὸν Κύριον</span></span> enorkizō humas ton Kurion. It is equivalent to binding persons by an oath; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:23-24">Genesis 21:23-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:3">Genesis 24:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:37">Genesis 24:37</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren - </b>To all the church; compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>. The meaning is, that the Epistle was to be read to the whole church on some occasion. on which it was assembled together. It was not merely designed for the individual or individuals into whose hands it might happen to fall, but as it contained matters of common interest, and was designed for the whole body of believers at Thessalonica, the apostle gives a solemn charge that it should not be suppressed or kept from them. Injunctions of this kind occurring in the Epistles, look as if the apostles regarded themselves as under the influence of inspiration, and as having authority to give infallible instructions to the churches.</p>
