<p style=" "><b>For them that defile themselves with mankind - </b>Sodomites.

<p style=" "><b>For menstealers - </b>The word here used - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀνδρᾶποδιστής</span></span> andrapodistēs - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means one who steals another for the purpose of making him a slave - a kidnapper. This is the common way in which people are made slaves. Some, indeed, are taken in war and sold as slaves, but the mass of those who have been reduced to servitude have become slaves by being kidnapped. Children are stolen from their parents, or wives from their husbands, or husbands from their wives, or parents from their children, or whole families are stolen together. None become slaves voluntarily, and consequently the whole process of making slaves partakes of the nature of theft of the worst kind. What theft is like that of stealing a man’s children, or his wife, or his father or mother? The guilt of manstealing is incurred essentially by those who purchase those who are thus stolen - as the purchaser of a stolen horse, knowing it to be so, participates in the crime. A measure of that criminality also adheres to all who own slaves, and who thus maintain the system - for it is a system known to have been originated by theft. This crime was expressly forbidden by the law of God, and was made punishable with death; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:16">Exodus 21:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+24:7">Deuteronomy 24:7</span>.</p>
