<p style=" "><b>Who was before a blasphemer - </b>This does not mean that Paul before his conversion was what would now be regarded as an open blasphemer - that he was one who abused and reviled sacred things, or one who was in the habit of profane swearing. His character appears to have been just the reverse of this, for he was remarkable for treating what he regarded as sacred with the utmost respect; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:4-6">Philippians 3:4-6</span>. The meaning is, that he had reviled the name of Christ, and opposed him and his cause - not believing that he was the Messiah; and in thus opposing he had really been guilty of blasphemy. The true Messiah he had in fact treated with contempt and reproaches, and he now looked back upon that fact with the deepest mortification, and with wonder that one who had been so treated by him should have been willing to put him into the ministry. On the meaning of the word blaspheme, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:3">Matthew 9:3</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>. In his conduct here referred to, Paul elsewhere says, that he thought at the time that he was doing what he ought to do <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span>; here he says that he now regarded it as blasphemy. Hence, learn that people may have very different views of their conduct when they come to look at it in subsequent life. What they now regard as harmless, or even as right and proper, may hereafter overwhelm them with shame and remorse. The sinner will yet feel the deepest self-reproaches for that which now gives us no uneasiness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And a persecutor - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:1">Acts 9:1</span> ff; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:13">Galatians 1:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:23">Galatians 1:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And injurious - </b>The word here used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὑβριστής</span></span> hubristēs), occurs only in one other place in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:30">Romans 1:30</span>, where it is rendered “despiteful.” The word injurious does not quite express its force. It does not mean merely doing injury, but refers rather to the manner or spirit in which it is done. It is a word of intenser signification than either the word “blasphemer,” or “persecutor,” and means that what he did was done with a proud, haughty, insolent spirit. There was wicked and malicious violence, an arrogance and spirit of tyranny in what he did, which greatly aggravated the wrong that was done; compare the Greek in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:6">Matthew 22:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:45">Luke 11:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:32">Luke 18:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5">Acts 14:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>, for illustrations of the meaning of the word. Tyndale and Coverdale render it here “tyrant.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief - </b>compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span>. The ignorance and unbelief of Paul were not such excuses for what he did that they would wholly free him from blame, nor did he regard them as such - for what he did was with a violent and wicked spirit - but they were mitigating circumstances. They served to modify his guilt, and were among the reasons why God had mercy on him. What is said here, therefore, accords with what the Saviour said in his prayer for his murderers; “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” It is undoubtedly true that persons who sin ignorantly, and who regard themselves as right in what they do, are much more likely to obtain mercy than those who do wrong designedly.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yet we cannot but regard - </b>Paul’s “ignorance in unbelief” as, in itself, a grievous sin, He had abundant means of knowing the truth had he been disposed to inquire with patience and candor. His great abilities and excellent education are a further aggravation of the crime. It is, therefore, impossible to acquiesce in any solution of this clause which seems to make criminal ignorance a ground of mercy. The author, however, intends nothing of this kind, nor would it be fair to put such construction on his words. Yet, a little more fullness had been desirable on a subject of this nature. It is certain, that, independent of the nature of the ignorance, whether willful or otherwise, the character of crime is affected by it. He who should oppose truth, knowing it to be such, is more guilty than he who opposes it in ignorance, or under the conviction that it is not truth, but falsehood. In a certain sense, too, this ignorance, may be regarded as a reason why mercy is bestowed on such as sin desperately or blasphemously under it. Rather, it is a reason why they are not excluded from mercy. It shows why persons so guilty are not beyond its pale. This is, we think, the true key both to the passage, and that in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span>. The ignorance is not a reason why God should bestow mercy on such persons, rather than on others left to perish, but a reason why they obtain mercy at all, who, by their blasphemies had been supposed to have reached the sin against the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style=" ">Now consider the passage in this view. The apostle had just been showing how great a sinner he had formerly been. His criminality had been so great that it went near to shutting him out from mercy altogether. Had he maliciously persecuted and blasphemed Christ, knowing him to be the Messiah, his had been the unpardonable sin, and his lot that of judicial, final obduracy. But he had not got that length. He was saved from that gulph, and obtained mercy, because, sinning ignorantly and in unbelief, he was not beyond its range.</p>
<p style=" ">That Paul should set himself to excuse his guilt is altogether impossible. He does the very reverse. He has but escaped the unpardonable sin. He is chief of sinners. He owes his salvation to exceeding abundant grace. All long-suffering has been exercised toward him. He affirms, that mercy was extended to him, that, to the end of time, there might be a proof or pattern of mercy to the guiltiest. Had he been assigning a reason why he obtained mercy, rather than others left to perish, doubtless that had been what he has elsewhere assigned and defended, “God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and he will have compassion on whom he will have compassion;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:15">Romans 9:15</span>.</p>
