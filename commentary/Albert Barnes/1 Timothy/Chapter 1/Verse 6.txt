<p style=" "><b>From which some having swerved - </b>Margin, “not aiming at.” The word here used - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀστοχέω</span></span> astocheō - means properly, to miss the mark; to err; and then, to swerve from compare <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ti 6:21</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span>. It does not mean that they had ever had that from which they are said to have swerved - for it does not follow that a man who misses a mark had ever hit it - but merely that they failed of the things referred to, and had turned to vain talk. The word “which” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὧν</span></span> hōn, in the plural, refers not to the law, but to the things enumerated - a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have turned aside unto vain jangling - </b>Vain talk, empty declamation, discourses without sense. The word here used does not mean contention or strife, but that kind of discourse which is not founded in good sense. They were discourses on their pretended distinctions in the law; on their traditions and ceremonies; on their useless genealogies, and on the fabulous statements which they had appended to the law of Moses.</p>
