<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1-15">1 Timothy 2:1-15</span> is occupied mainly in directions about the mode of conducting public worship. Timothy had been left at Ephesus to complete the plans which the apostle had commenced in reference to the church there, but from completing which he had been unexpectedly prevented (see the Intro.), and it was important to state the views which he entertained on this subject to Timothy. It was important also that general directions on these subjects should be given, which would be useful to the church at large. The directions in this chapter relate to the following subjects:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (5)The reasons for this subordination and submission are then stated. They are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (6)Yet, as if to make a kind remark in favor of woman - to show that he did not intend to teach that she was degraded and abandoned of God - the apostle says that she would be under the divine protection, and that in the special sorrow and peril which had been brought upon her for her transgression, God would sustain her if she continued in faith, and evinced the spirit of a Christian in her life; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:15">1 Timothy 2:15</span>.</p>
