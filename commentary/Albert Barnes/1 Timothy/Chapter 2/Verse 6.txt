<p style=" "><b>Who gave himself a ransom for all - </b>This also is stated as a reason why prayer should be offered for all, and a proof that God desires the salvation of all. The argument is, that as Christ died for all, it is proper to pray for all, and that the fact that he died for all is proof that God desired the salvation of all. Whatever proof of his desire for their salvation can be derived from this in relation to any of the race, is proof in relation to all. On the meaning of the phrase “he gave himself a ransom,” see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span> note; on the fact that it was for “all,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span>.</p>

<p style=" "><b>To be testified in due time - </b>Margin, “a testimony.” The Greek is, “the testimony in its own times,” or in proper times - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὸ μαρτύριον καιροῖς ἰδίοις</span></span> to marturion kairois idiois. There have been very different explanations of this phrase. The common interpretation, and that which seems to me to be correct, is, that “the testimony of this will be furnished in the proper time; that is, in the proper time it shall be made known through all the world;” see Rosenmuller. Paul affirms it as a great and important truth that Christ gave himself a ransom for all mankind - for Jews and Gentiles; for all classes and conditions of people alike. This truth had not always been understood. The Jews had supposed that salvation was designed exclusively for their nation, and denied that it could be extended to others, unless they became Jews. According to them, salvation was not provided for, or offered to pagans as such, but only on condition that they became Jews. In opposition to this, Paul says that it was a doctrine of revelation that redemption was to be provided for all people, and that it was intended that the testimony to this should be afforded at the proper time. It was not fully made known under the ancient dispensation, but now the period had come when it should be communicated to all; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span> note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> note.</p>
