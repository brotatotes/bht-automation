<p style=" "><b>Whereunto - </b>Greek, “Unto which;” that is, to the bearing of which testimony I am appointed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am ordained - </b>Greek, “I am placed or constituted” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐτέθην</span></span> etethēn. The word “ordain” has now acquired a technical signification, meaning to set apart solemnly to a sacred office by the imposition of hands; but it has not that meaning here. It does not refer to the manner in which he was set apart, or to any act of others in consecrating him to this work, but merely to the fact that he had been placed in this office, or appointed to it. He refers doubtless to the fact that the Lord Jesus had designated him to this work.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A preacher and an apostle - </b>see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1-6">1 Corinthians 9:1-6</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:11-12">Galatians 1:11-12</span> notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not - </b>That is, by Christ; or I solemnly appeal to Christ - a form of an oath; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span>. Paul makes a solemn declaration similar to this in regard to his call to the apostleship, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:20">Galatians 1:20</span>. For the reasons why he did it, see the notes on that verse. It is probable that there were those in Ephesus who denied that he could be an apostle, and hence his solemn declaration affirming it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A teacher of the Gentiles - </b>Specially appointed to carry the gospel to the Gentiles or the pagan; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7">Galatians 2:7</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In faith and verity - </b>These words mean that he was appointed to instruct the Gentiles in faith and the knowledge of the truth.</p>
