<p style=" "><b>These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly - </b>That is, he hoped to come there to give instructions personally, or to finish, himself, the work which he had commenced in Ephesus, and which had been interrupted by his being driven so unexpectedly away. This verse proves that the apostle Paul did not regard Timothy as the permanent diocesan bishop of Ephesus. Would any Episcopal bishop write this to another bishop? If Timothy were the permanent prelate of Ephesus, would Paul have intimated that he expected soon to come and take the work of completing the arrangements there into his own hands? In regard to his expectation of going soon to Ephesus, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>; compare the Introduction to the Epistle.</p>
