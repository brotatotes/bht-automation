<p style=" "><b>Likewise must the deacons - </b>On the meaning of the word “deacons,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>. On their appointment, see the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>. The word here evidently denotes those who had charge of the temporal affairs of the church, the poor, etc. No qualifications are mentioned, implying that they were to be preachers of the gospel. In most respects, except in regard to preaching, their qualifications were to be the same as those of the “bishops.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be grave - </b>Serious, sober-minded men. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>, it is said that they should be men “of honest report.” On the meaning of the word “grave,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4">1 Timothy 3:4</span>. They should be men who by their serious deportment will inspire respect.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not double-tongued - </b>The word here used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δίλογος</span></span> dilogos - does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means, properly, uttering the same thing twice (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δίς</span></span> dis and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λέγω</span></span> legō), and then deceitful, or speaking one thing and meaning another. They should be men who can be relied on for the exact truth of what they say, and for the exact fulfillment of their promises.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not given to much wine - </b>see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>. The word “much” is added here to what is said <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span> of the qualification of a bishop. It is not affirmed that it would be proper for the deacon, anymore than the bishop, to indulge in the use of wine in small quantities, but it “is” affirmed that a man who is much given to the use of wine ought not, on any consideration, to be a deacon. It may be remarked here, that this qualification was everywhere regarded as necessary for a minister of religion. Even the pagan priests, on entering a temple, did not drink wine. “Bloomfield.” The use of wine, and of strong drinks of all kinds, was absolutely prohibited to the Jewish ministers of every rank when they were about to engage in the service of God; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+10:9">Leviticus 10:9</span>. Why should it then be anymore proper for a Christian minister to drink wine than for a Jewish or a pagan priest? Shall a minister of the gospel be less holy than they? Shall he have a feebler sense of the purity of his vocation? Shall he be less careful lest he expose himself to the possibility of conducting the services of religion in an irreverent and silly manner? Shall he venture to approach the altar of God under the influence of intoxicating drinks, when a sense of propriety restrained the pagan priest, and a solemn statue of Yahweh restrained the Jewish priest from doing it?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not greedy of filthy lucre - </b>notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>. The special reason why this qualification was important in the deacon was, that he would be entrusted with the funds of the church, and might be tempted to appropriate them to his own use instead of the charitable purposes for which they were designed; see this illustrated in the case of Judas, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span>.</p>
