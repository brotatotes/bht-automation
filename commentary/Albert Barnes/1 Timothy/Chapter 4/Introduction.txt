<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">There is, in many respects, a strong resemblance between the first part of this chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:0">1 Timothy 4:0</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:0">2 Thessalonians 2:0</span>; compare notes on that chapter. The leading object of this chapter is to state to Timothy certain things of which he was constantly to remind the church; and having done this, the apostle gives him some directions about his personal deportment. The chapter may be conveniently divided into three parts:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. Timothy was to put the church constantly in remembrance of the great apostasy which was to occur, and to guard them against the doctrines which would be inculcated under that apostasy; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1-6">1 Timothy 4:1-6</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. Timothy was to warn the churches against trifling and superstitious views, such as the apostle calls “old wives’” fables; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7-11">1 Timothy 4:7-11</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. Various admonitions respecting his personal deportment; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12-16">1 Timothy 4:12-16</span>.</p>
