<p style=" "><b>For it is sanctified by the word of God - </b>By the authority or permission of God. It would be profane or unholy if he had forbidden it; it is made holy or proper for our use by his permission, and no command of “man” can make it unholy or improper; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:29">Genesis 1:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:3">Genesis 9:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And prayer - </b>If it is partaken of with prayer. By prayer we are enabled to receive it with gratitude, and everything that we eat or drink may thus be made a means of grace.</p>
