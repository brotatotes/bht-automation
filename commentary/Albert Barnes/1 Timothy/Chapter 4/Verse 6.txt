<p style=" "><b>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things - </b>Of the truths just stated. They are, therefore, proper subjects to preach upon. It is the duty of the ministry to show to the people of their charge what “is” error and where it may be apprehended, and to caution them to avoid it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nourished up in the words of faith - </b>That is, you will be then “a good minister of Jesus Christ, as becomes one who has been nourished up in the words of faith, or trained up in the doctrines of religion.” The apostle evidently designs to remind Timothy of the manner in which he had been trained, and to show him how he might act in accordance with that. From one who had been thus educated, it was reasonable to expect that he would be a faithful and exemplary minister of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whereunto thou hast attained - </b>The word used here means, properly, to accompany side by side; to follow closely; to follow out, trace, or examine. It is rendered “shall follow,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>; “having had understanding,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>; and “hast fully known,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:10">2 Timothy 3:10</span>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The meaning here seems to be, that Timothy had followed out the doctrines in which he had been trained to their legitimate results; he had accurately seen and understood their bearing, as leading him to embrace the Christian religion. His early training in the Scriptures of the Old Testament <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Ti 1:5</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>, he had now fully carried out, by embracing the Lord Jesus as the Messiah, and by evincing the proper results of the early teaching which he had received in connection with that religion. If he now followed the directions of the apostle, he would be a minister of the Lord Jesus, worthy of the attainments in religious knowledge which he had made, and of the expectations which had been formed of him. No young man should, by neglect, indolence, or folly, disappoint the reasonable expectations of his friends. Their cherished hopes are a proper ground of appeal to him, and it may be properly demanded of every one that he shall carry out to their legitimate results all the principles of his early training, and that he shall be in his profession all that his early advantages make it reasonable to “expect” that he will be.</p>
