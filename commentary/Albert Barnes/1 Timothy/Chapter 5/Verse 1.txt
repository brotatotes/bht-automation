<p style=" "><b>Rebuke not an elder - </b>The word “elder” here is not used in the sense in which it often is, to denote an officer of the church, a presbyter, but in its proper and usual sense, to denote an aged man. This is evident, because the apostle immediately mentions in contradistinction from the elder, “the younger men,” where it cannot be supposed that he refers to them as officers. The command to treat the “elder” as a “father,” also shows the same thing. By the direction not to rebuke, it is not to be supposed that the minister of the gospel is not to admonish the aged, or that he is not to show them their sins when they go astray, but that he is to do this as he would to a father. He is not to assume a harsh, dictatorial, and denunciatory manner. The precepts of religion always respect the proprieties of life, and never allow us to transgress them, even when the object is to reclaim a soul from error, and to save one who is wandering. Besides, when this is the aim, it will always be most certainly accomplished by observing the respect due to others on account of office, relation, rank, or age.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But entreat him as a father - </b>As you would a father. That is, do not harshly denounce him. Endeavor to persuade him to lead a more holy life. One of the things for which the ancients were remarkable above most of the moderns, and for which the Orientals are still distinguished, was respect for age. Few things are enjoined with more explicitness and emphasis in the Bible than this; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:32">Leviticus 19:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+29:0">Job 29:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+20:20">Proverbs 20:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:17">Proverbs 30:17</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:9-10">Daniel 7:9-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:14-15">Revelation 1:14-15</span>. The apostle would have Timothy, and, for the same reason, every other minister of the gospel, a model of this virtue.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the younger men as brethren - </b>That is, treat them as you would your own brothers. Do not consider them as aliens, strangers, or enemies, but entertain toward them, even when they go astray, the kindly feelings of a brother. This refers more particularly to his private conversation with them, and to his personal efforts to reclaim them when they had fallen into sin. When these efforts were ineffectual, and they sinned openly, he was to “rebuke them before all” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span>, that others might be deterred from following their example.</p>
