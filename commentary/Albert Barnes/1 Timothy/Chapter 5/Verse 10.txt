<p style=" "><b>Well reported of for good works - </b>Of good character or reputation; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7">1 Timothy 3:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If she have brought up children - </b>Either her own or others. The idea is, if she has done this in a proper manner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If she have lodged strangers - </b>If she has been characterized by hospitality - a virtue greatly commended in the Scriptures; compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If she have washed the saintsâ€™ feet - </b>It is not certain whether this is to be understood literally, or whether it merely denotes that she had performed offices of a humble and self-denying kind - such as would be shown by washing the feet of others. It was one of the rites of hospitality in the East to wash the feet of the guest <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:4">Genesis 18:4</span>, and Paul might have spoken of this as having been literally performed. There is not the slightest evidence that he refers to it as a religious rite, or ordinance, anymore than he does to the act of bringing up children as a religious rite; compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1-10">John 13:1-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If she have relieved the afflicted - </b>If it has been her character that she was ready to furnish relief to those who were in distress.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If she have diligently followed every good work - </b>This is one of the characteristics of true piety. A sincere Christian will, like God, be the friend of all that is good, and will be ready to promote every good object according to his ability. He will not merely be the friend of one good cause, to the neglect of others, but he will endeavor to promote every good object, and though from special circumstances, and special dealings of Providence, he may have been particularly interested in some one object of charity, yet every good object will find a response in his heart, and he will be ready to promote it by his influence, his property, and his prayers.</p>
