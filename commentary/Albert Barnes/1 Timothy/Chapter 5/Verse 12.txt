<p style=" "><b>Having damnation - </b>Or, rather, having “condemnation;” or incurring guilt. This does not mean of necessity that they would lose their souls; see the phrase explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>. The meaning is, that they would contract guilt, if they had been admitted among this class of persons, and then married again. The apostle does not say that that would be wrong in itself (compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:14">1 Timothy 5:14</span>), or that they would be absolutely prohibited from it, but that injury would be done if they were admitted among those who were “widows indeed” - who were supported by the church, and who were entrusted with a certain degree of care over the more youthful females - and then should leave that situation. It might give occasion for scandal it might break in upon the arrangements; it would show that there was a relaxing of the faith, and of the deadness to the world, which they were supposed to have; and it was better that they should be married <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:14">1 Timothy 5:14</span>, without having been thus admitted.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because they have cast off their first faith - </b>This does not mean that they would lose all their religion, or wholly fall away, but that this would show that they had not the strong faith, the deadness to the world, the simple dependence on God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:5">1 Timothy 5:5</span>, and the desire which they had to be weaned from worldly cares and influences, which they once had. When they became widows, all their earthly hopes seemed to be blasted. They were then dead to the world, and felt their sole dependence on God. But if, under the influence of these strong emotions, they were admitted to the “class of widows” in the church, there was no certainty that they would continue in this state of mind. Time would do much to modify their grief. There would be a reviving love of the world, and under the influence of this they would be disposed to enter again into the marriage relation, and thus show that they had not the strong and simple faith which they had when the blow which made them widows fell heavily upon then.</p>
