<p style=" "><b>That the younger women marry - </b>The word “women” is not expressed or necessarily implied in the original - <b>neooteras - </b> - and it is evident that the apostle here had particular reference to “widows,” and that the injunction should be understood as relating to them. We are not to suppose that he gives this as an absolute and universal command, for it might not always be at the option of the widow to marry again, and it cannot be doubted that there may be cases where it would be unadvisable. But he speaks of this as a general rule. It is better for such persons to have domestic concerns that require their attention, than it is to be exposed to the evils of an idle life. We may learn from this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That second marriages are not improper or unlawful, but that in some circumstances they may be preferable to widowhood;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That marriage itself is in a high degree honorable. How different are the views of the inspired apostle Paul about marriage from those of the Papists!</p>
<p style=" "><b>Bear children, guide the house - </b>These words signify, says Bloomfield, to “exercise and occupy themselves in the duties of a wife.” It is better to be employed in the duties growing out of the cares of a family, than to lead a life of celibacy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Give none occasion to the adversary - </b>The enemy of religion - the pagan or the infidel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To speak reproachfully - </b>Margin, “for their railing.” That is, on account of a life which would do no honor to religion. In the performance of domestic duties, when fully employed, they would avoid the evils specified in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:13">1 Timothy 5:13</span>. Every one who professes religion should so live as to give no occasion to an infidel or a man of the world to speak reproachfully of the cause of the Redeemer.</p>
