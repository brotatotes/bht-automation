<p style=" "><b>Them that sin - </b>That have been proved to have committed sin - referring probably to the elders mentioned in the previous verse, but giving the direction so general a form that it might be applicable to others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rebuke before all - </b>Before all the church or congregation. The word “rebuke” properly denotes to reprove or reprehend. It means here that there should be a public statement of the nature of the offence, and such a censure as the case demanded. It extends only to spiritual censures. There is no power given of inflicting any punishment by fine or imprisonment. The power of the church, in such cases, is only to express its strong and decided disapprobation of the wrong done, and, if the case demands it, of disowning the offending member or minister. This direction to “rebuke an offender before all,” may be easily reconciled with the direction in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:1">1 Timothy 5:1</span>, “Rebuke not an elder.” The latter refers to the private and pastoral conversation with an elder, and to the method in which he should be treated in such contact - to wit, with the feelings due to a father; the direction here refers to the manner in which an offender should be treated who has been proved to be guilty, and where the case has become public. Then there is to be a public expression of disapprobation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That others also may fear - </b>That they may be kept from committing the same offence; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:14">1 Peter 2:14</span>. The end of punishment is not the gratification of the private feelings of him who administers it, but the prevention of crime.</p>
