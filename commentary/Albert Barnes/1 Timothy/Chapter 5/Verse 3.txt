<p style=" "><b>Honour widows - </b>The particular attention and respect which are enjoined here, seem to refer to the class of widows who were supported by the church, and who were entrusted with the performance of certain duties toward the other female members, see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span>. It is to be remembered that the contact of the sexes was much more circumscribed in Oriental countries than it is among us; that access to the female members of the church would be much less free than it is now, and that consequently there might have been a special propriety in entrusting the duty of watching over the younger among them to the more aged. This duty would be naturally entrusted to those who had not the care of families. It would also be natural to commit it, if they were qualified, to those who had not the means of support, and who, while they were maintained by the church, might be rendering a valuable service to it. It would seem, therefore, that there was a class of this description, who were entrusted with these duties, and in regard to whose qualifications it was proper that Timothy should be instructed. The change of customs in society has made this class less necessary, and probably the arrangement was never designed to be permanent, but still it may be a question whether such an arrangement would not now be wise and useful in the church. On this subject, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That are widows indeed - </b>Who are truly widows. We associate with the word “widow,” commonly, not only the idea of the loss of a husband, but many other things that are the usual accompaniments of widowhood - a poor and dependent condition; care and solicitude; sadness and sorrow. This idea is implied in the use of the word employed here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χήρα</span></span> chēra - which means properly one who is “bereaved,” (from the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χήρος</span></span> chēros, “bereaved”), and which, as Calvin says, conveys the idea of one in distressed circumstances. What Paul regarded as constituting true widowhood, he specifies in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:4-5">1 Timothy 5:4-5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9-10">1 Timothy 5:9-10</span>. He connects with it the idea that she had no persons dependent on her; that she was desolate, and evinced true trust in God; that she was so aged that she would not marry again; and that by her life she had given evidence of possessing a heart of true benevolence; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>.</p>
