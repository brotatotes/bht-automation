<p style=" "><b>A widow indeed, and desolate - </b>The word rendered “desolate” means “solitary, alone.” It does not necessarily imply the idea of discomfort which we attach to the word desolate. The sense is, that she had no children or other descendants; none on whom she could depend for support.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Trusteth in God - </b>She has no one else to look to but God. She has no earthly reliance, and, destitute of husband, children, and property, she feels her dependence, and steadily looks to God for consolation and support.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And continueth in supplications and prayers night and day - </b>Continually; compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1">1 Timothy 2:1</span>; see also the description of Anna in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:36-37">Luke 2:36-37</span>. The apostle regards this as one of the characteristics of those who were “widows indeed,” whom he would have received into the class to be maintained by the church, and to whom the charge of younger members of the church might be entrusted.</p>
