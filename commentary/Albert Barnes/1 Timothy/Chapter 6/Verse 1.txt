<p style=" "><b>Let as many servants - </b>On the word here rendered “servants” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοῦλοι</span></span> douloi - see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>. The word is that which was commonly applied to a slave, but it is so extensive in its signification as to be applicable to any species of servitude, whether voluntary or involuntary. If slavery existed in Ephesus at the time when this Epistle was written, it would be applicable to slaves; if any other kind of servitude existed, the word would be equally applicable to that. There is nothing in the word itself which essentially limits it to slavery; examine <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:27">Matthew 13:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:27">Matthew 20:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:44">Mark 10:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:29">Luke 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:15">John 15:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:18">Acts 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:17">Acts 16:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:5">2 Corinthians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:1">Jude 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>. The addition of the phrase “under the yoke,” however, shows undoubtedly that it is to be understood here of slavery.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As are under the yoke - </b>On the word yoke, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>. The phrase here properly denotes slavery, as it would not be applied to any other species of servitude; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+26:13">Leviticus 26:13</span>; Dem. 322, 12. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζεῦγος δουλοσύνης</span></span> zeugos doulosunēs. Robinson’s Lexicon. It sometimes denotes the bondage of the Mosaic law as being a severe and oppressive burden; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>. It may be remarked here that the apostle did not regard slavery as a light or desirable thing. He would not have applied this term to the condition of a wife or of a child.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Count their own masters worthy of all honour - </b>Treat them with all proper respect. They were to manifest the right spirit themselves, whatever their masters did; they were not to do anything that would dishonor religion. The injunction here would seem to have particular reference to those whose masters were not Christians. In the following verse, the apostle gives particular instructions to those who had pious masters. The meaning here is, that the slave ought to show the Christian spirit toward his master who was not a Christian; he ought to conduct himself so that religion would not be dishonored; he ought not to give his master occasion to say that the only effect of the Christian religion on the mind of a servant was to make him restless, discontented, dissatisfied, and disobedient. In the humble and trying situation in which he confessedly was - under the yoke of bondage - he ought to evince patience, kindness, and respect for his master, and as long as the relation continued he was to be obedient. This command, however, was by no means inconsistent with his desiring his freedom, and securing it, if the opportunity presented itself; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span>; compare, on the passage before us, the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5-8">Ephesians 6:5-8</span> notes, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed - </b>That religion be not dishonored and reproached, and that there may be no occasion to say that Christianity tends to produce discontent and to lead to insurrection. If the effect of religion had been to teach all who were servants that they should no longer obey their masters, or that they should rise upon them and assert their freedom by violence, or that their masters were to be treated with indignity on account of their usurped rights over others, the effect would have been obvious. There would have been a loud and united outcry against the new religion, and it could have made no progress in the world. Instead of this, Christianity taught the necessity of patience, and meekness, and forbearance in the endurance of all wrong - whether from private individuals <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39-41">Matthew 5:39-41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:7">1 Corinthians 6:7</span>, or under the oppressions and exactions of Nero <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1-7">Romans 13:1-7</span>, or amidst the hardships and cruelties of slavery. These peaceful injunctions, however, did not demonstrate that Christ approved the act of him “that smote on the one cheek,” or that Paul regarded the government of Nero as a good government, - and as little do they prove that Paul or the Saviour approved of slavery.</p>
