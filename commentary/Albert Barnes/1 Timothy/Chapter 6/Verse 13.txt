<p style=" "><b>I give thee charge in the sight God - </b>see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who quickeneth all things - </b>Who gives life to all; notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>. It is not quite clear why the apostle refers to this attribute of God as enforcing the charge which he here makes. Perhaps he means to say that God is the source of life, and that as he had given life to Timothy - natural and spiritual - he had a right to require that it should be employed in his service; and that, if, in obedience to this charge and in the performance of his duties, he should be required to lay down his life, he should bear in remembrance that God had power to raise him up again. This is more distinctly urged in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:8-10">2 Timothy 2:8-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And before Christ Jesus - </b>As in the presence of Christ, and stimulated by his example.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession - </b>Margin, “profession.” The same Greek word is used which in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span> is translated “profession.” The reference is to the fact that the Lord Jesus, when standing at the bar of Pilate who claimed to have power over his life, did not shrink from an open avowal of the truth; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36-37">John 18:36-37</span>. Nothing can be better fitted to preserve our minds steadfast in the faith, and to enable us to maintain our sacred vows in this world when allured by temptation, or when ridiculed for our religion, than to remember the example of the Lord Jesus; Let us place him before us as he stood at the bar of Pilate - threatened with death in its most appalling form, and ridiculed for the principles which he maintained; let us look on him, friendless and alone, and see with what seriousness, and sincerity, and boldness he stated the simple truth about himself, and we shall have one of the best securities that we can have, that we shall not dishonor our profession. A clear view of the example of Christ our Saviour, in those circumstances, and a deep conviction that his eye is upon us to discern whether we are steadfast as he was, will do more than all abstract precepts to make us faithful to our christian calling.</p>
