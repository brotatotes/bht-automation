It is applied here to God as the mighty ruler over the universe.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The King of kings - </b>Who claims dominion over all the kings of the earth. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>, the same appellation is applied to the Lord Jesus, ascribing to him universal dominion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lord of lords - </b>The idea here is, that all the sovereigns of the earth are under his sway; that none of them can prevent the accomplishment of his purposes; and that he can direct the winding up of human affairs when he pleases.</p>
