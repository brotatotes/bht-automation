<p style=" "><b>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded - </b>One of the evils to which they are particularly exposed. The idea is, that they should not value themselves on account of their wealth, or look down with pride and arrogance on their inferiors. They should not suppose that they are any better people or any nearer heaven, because they are wealthy. Property really makes no distinction in the great things that pertain to character and salvation, It does not necessarily make one wise, or learned, or great, or good. In all these things, the man who has not wealth may be vastly the superior of him who has; and for so slight and unimportant a distinction as gold can confer, no man should be proud. Besides, let such a man reflect that his property is the gift of God; that he is made rich because God has chosen to arrange things so that he should be; that it is not primarily owing to any skill or wisdom which he has; that his property only increases his responsibility, and that it must all soon be left, and he be as poor as the “beggar that lies at his gate;” and he will see ample reason why he should not be proud.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor trust in uncertain riches - </b>Margin, “The uncertainty of.” The margin expresses the meaning of the Greek more accurately than the text, but the sense is not materially varied. Riches are uncertain because they may soon be taken away. No dependence can be placed on them in the emergencies of life. He who is rich today, has no security that he will be tomorrow; and if he shall be rich tomorrow, he has no certainty that his riches will meet his necessities then. A man whose house is in flames, or who is shipwrecked, or whose child lies dying, or who is himself in the agonizes of death, can derive no advantage from the fact that he is richer than other people; see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:16-21">Luke 12:16-21</span>. That against which Paul here directs Timothy to caution the rich, is that to which they are most exposed. A man who is rich, is very liable to “trust” in His riches, and to suppose that he needs nothing more; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</span>. He feels that he is not dependent on his fellow-men, and he is very likely to feel that he is not dependent on God. It is for this cause that God has recorded so many solemn declarations in his word respecting the instability of riches (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+23:5">Proverbs 23:5</span>), and that he is furnishing so many instructive lessons in his providence, showing how easily riches may suddenly vanish away.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But in the living God - </b> </p>
<p style=" ">(1) He is able to supply all our needs, and to do for us what riches cannot do; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He never changes, or leaves those who put their trust in him. He is able to meet our needs if in the flames, or in a storm at sea, or when a friend dies, or when we lie down on a bed of death, or wherever we may be in the eternal world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who giveth us richly all things to enjoy - </b>The meaning of this seems to be, that God permits us to enjoy everything. Everything in the works of creation and redemption he has given to man for his happiness, and he should therefore trust in him. He has not merely given wealth for the comfort of people, but he has given everything, and he on whom so many and so great blessings have been bestowed for his comfort, should trust in the great Benefactor himself, and not rely merely on one of his gifts; compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21-23">1 Corinthians 3:21-23</span>.</p>
