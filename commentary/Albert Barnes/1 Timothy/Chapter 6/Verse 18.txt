That they do good - On the duty enjoined in this verse, see Galatians 6:10 note; Hebrews 13:10 note.That they be rich in good works - “That their good works may be as abundant as their riches.”Ready to distribute - To divide with others; compare Acts 4:34. The meaning is, that they should be liberal, or bountiful.Willing to communicate - Margin, or “sociable.” The translation in the text is a more correct rendering of the Greek. The idea is, that they should be willing to share their blessings with others, so as to make others comfortable; see the notes on Hebrews 13:16; compare the argument of Paul in 2 Corinthians 8:13-15, and the notes on that passage.
