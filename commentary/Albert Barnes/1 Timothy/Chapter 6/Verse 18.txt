<p style=" "><b>That they do good - </b>On the duty enjoined in this verse, see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:10">Hebrews 13:10</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That they be rich in good works - </b>“That their good works may be as abundant as their riches.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ready to distribute - </b>To divide with others; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:34">Acts 4:34</span>. The meaning is, that they should be liberal, or bountiful.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Willing to communicate - </b>Margin, or “sociable.” The translation in the text is a more correct rendering of the Greek. The idea is, that they should be willing to share their blessings with others, so as to make others comfortable; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:16">Hebrews 13:16</span>; compare the argument of Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:13-15">2 Corinthians 8:13-15</span>, and the notes on that passage.</p>
