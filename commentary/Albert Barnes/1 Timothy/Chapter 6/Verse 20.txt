<p style=" "><b>Keep that which is committed to thy trust - </b>All that is entrusted to you, and to which reference has been particularly made in this Epistle. The honor of the gospel, and the interests of religion, had been specially committed to him; and he was sacredly to guard this holy trust, and not suffer it to be wrested from him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Avoiding profane and vain babblings - </b>Greek, “Profane, empty words.” The reference is to such controversies and doctrines as tended only to produce strife, and were not adapted to promote the edification of the church; see the notes on <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ti 1:4</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7">1 Timothy 4:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And oppositions of science falsely so called - </b>Religion has nothing to fear from true science, and the minister of the gospel is not exhorted to dread that. Real science, in all its advances, contributes to the support of religion; and just in proportion as that is promoted will it be found to sustain the Bible, and to confirm the claims of religion to the faith of mankind. See this illustrated at length in Wiseman’s Lectures on the connection between science and religion. It is only false or pretended science that religion has to dread, and which the friend of Christianity is to avoid. The meaning here is, that Timothy was to avoid everything which falsely laid claim to being “knowledge” or “science.” There was much of this in the world at the time the apostle wrote; and this, more perhaps than anything else, has tended to corrupt true religion since.</p>
