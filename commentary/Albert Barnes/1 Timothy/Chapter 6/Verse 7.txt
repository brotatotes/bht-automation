<p style=" "><b>For we brought nothing into this world ... - </b>A sentiment very similar to this occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:21">Job 1:21</span> - and it would seem probable that the apostle had that passage in his eye; see the notes on that passage. Numerous expressions of this kind occur in the classic writers; see Wetstein, in loc., and Pricaeus, in loc. in the Critici Sacri. Of the truth of what is here said, there can be nothing more obvious. It is apparent to all. We bring no property with us into the world - no clothing, no jewels, no gold - and it is equally clear that we can take nothing with us when we leave the earth. Our coming into the world introduces no additional property to that which the race before possessed, and our going from the world removes none that we may have helped the race to accumulate. This is said by the apostle as an obvious reason why we should be contented if our actual needs are supplied - for this is really all that we need, and all that the world is toiling for.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We can carry nothing out - </b>compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+49:17">Psalms 49:17</span>. “For when he - the rich man<b> - </b>dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.”</p>
