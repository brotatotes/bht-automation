<p style=" "><b>And Timothy our brother - </b>Paul was accustomed to associate some other person or persons with him in writing his epistles. Thus, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Sosthenes was associated with him. For the reasons of this, see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>. The name of Timothy is associated with his in the Epistles to the Philippians and Colossians. From the former Epistle to the Corinthians <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span>, we learn that Paul had sent Timothy to the church at Corinth, or that he expected that he would visit them. Paul had sent him into Macedonia in company with Erastus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21-22">Acts 19:21-22</span>, intending himself to follow them, and expecting that they would visit Achaia. From the passage before us, it appears that Timothy had returned from this expedition, and was now with Paul. The reason why Paul joined Timothy with him in writing this Epistle may have been the following:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Timothy had been recently with them, and they had become acquainted with him, and it was not only natural that he should express his friendly salutations, but his name and influence among them might serve in some degree to confirm what Paul wished to say to them; compare note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Paul may have wished to give as much influence as possible to Timothy. he designed that he should be his fellow-laborer; and as Timothy was much younger than himself, he doubtless expected that he would survive him, and that he would in some sense succeed him in the care of the churches. He was desirous, therefore, of securing for him all the authority which he could, and of letting it be known that he regarded him as abundantly qualified for the great work with which he was entrusted.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The influence and name of Timothy might be supposed to have weight with the party in the church that had slandered Paul, by accusing him of insincerity or instability in regard to his purposed visit to them. Paul had designed to go to them directly from Ephesus, but he had changed his mind, and the testimony of Timothy might be important to prove that it was done from motives purely conscientious. Timothy was doubtless acquainted with the reasons; and his testimony might meet and rebut a part of the charges against him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:13-16">2 Corinthians 1:13-16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto the church of God ... - </b>see the note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With all the saints which are in all Achaia - </b>Achaia, in the largest sense, included the whole of Greece. Achaia proper, however, was the district or province of which Corinth was the capital. It comprehended the part of Greece lying between Thessaly and the southern part of the Peloponnesus, embracing the whole western part of the Peloponnesus. It is probable that there were not a few Christians scattered in Achaia, and not improbably some small churches that had been established by the labors of Paul or of others. From <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>, we know that there was a church at Cenchrea, the eastern port of Corinth, and it is by no means improbable that there were other churches in that region. Paul doubtless designed that copies of this Epistle should be circulated among them.</p>
