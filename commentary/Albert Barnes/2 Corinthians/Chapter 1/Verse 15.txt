<p style=" "><b>And in his confidence - </b>In this confidence of my integrity, and that you had this favorable opinion of me, and appreciated the principles of my conduct. I did not doubt that you would receive me kindly, and would give me again the tokens of your affection and regard. In this Paul shows that however some of them might regard him, yet that he had no doubt that the majority of the church there would receive him kindly.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I was minded - </b>I willed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐβουλόμην</span></span> eboulomēn); it was my intention.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To come unto you before - </b>Tyndale renders this: “the other time.” Paul refers doubtless to the time when he wrote his former Epistle, and when it was his serious purpose, as it was his earnest wish, to visit them again; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>. In this purpose he had been disappointed, and he now proceeds to state the reasons why he had not visited them as he had purposed, and to show that it did not arise from any fickleness of mind. His purpose had been at first to pass through Corinth on his way to Macedonia, and to remain some time with them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5-6">1 Corinthians 16:5-6</span>. This purpose he had now changed; and instead of passing through Corinth on his way to Macedonia, he had gone to Macedonia by the way of Troas <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>; and the Corinthians having, as it would seem, become acquainted with this fact, had charged him with insincerity in the promise, or fickleness in regard to his plans. Probably it had been said by some of his enemies that he had never intended to visit them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye might have a second benefit - </b>Margin, grace. The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χάρις</span></span> charis is that which is commonly rendered grace, and means probably favor, kindness, good-will, beneficence; and especially favor to the undeserving. Here it is evidently used in the sense of gratification, or pleasure. And the idea is, that they had been formerly gratified and benefitted by his residence among them; he had been the means of conferring important favors on them, and he was desirous of being again with them, in order to gratify them by his presence, and that he might be the means of imparting to them other favors. Paul presumed that his presence with them would be to them a source of pleasure, and that his coming would do them good. It is the language of a man who felt assured that he enjoyed, after all, the confidence of the mass of the church there, and that they would regard his being with them as a favor. He had been with them formerly almost two years. His residence there had been pleasant to them and to him; and had been the occasion of important benefits to them. He did not doubt that it would be so again. Tyndale renders this: “that ye might have had a double pleasure.” It may be remarked here that several mss. instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χάριν</span></span> charin, “grace,” read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαράν</span></span> charan, “joy.”</p>
