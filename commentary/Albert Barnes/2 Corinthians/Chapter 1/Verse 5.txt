<p style=" "><b>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us - </b>As we are called to experience the same sufferings which Christ endured; as we are called to suffer in his cause, and in the promotion of the same object. The sufferings which they endured were in the cause of Christ and his gospel; were endured in endeavoring to advance the same object which Christ sought to promote; and were substantially of the same nature. They arose from opposition, contempt, persecution, trial, and want, and were the same as the Lord Jesus was himself subjected to during the whole of his public life; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>. Thus, Peter says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span> of Christians that they were “partakers of Christ’s sufferings.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>So our consolation also aboundeth by Christ - </b>By means of Christ, or through Christ, consolation is abundantly imparted to us. Paul regarded the Lord Jesus as the source of consolation, and felt that the comfort which he imparted, or which was imparted through him, was more than sufficient to overbalance all the trials which he endured in this cause. The comforts which he derived from Christ were those, doubtless, which arose from his presence, his supporting grace, from his love shed abroad in the heart; from the success which he gave to his gospel, and from the hope of reward which was held out to him by the Redeemer, as the result of all his sufferings. And it may he observed as an universal truth, that if we suffer in the cause of Christ, if we are persecuted, oppressed, and calumniated on his account, he will take care that cur hearts shall be filled with consolation.</p>
