<p style=" ">Paul, having finished the subject of the duty of alms-giving in the previous chapter, enters into this on a vindication of himself from the charges of his enemies. His general design is to vindicate his apostolic authority, and to show that he had a right, as well as others, to regard himself as sent from God. This vindication is continued through 2 Cor. 11–12. In this chapter the stress of the argument is, that he did not depend on anything external to recommend him - on any “carnal weapons;” on anything which commended itself by the outward appearance; or on anything that was so much valued by the admirers of human eloquence and learning. He seems willing to admit all that his enemies could say of him on that head, and to rely on other proofs that he was sent from God. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:0">2 Corinthians 11:0</span> he pursues the subject, and shows by a comparison of himself with others, that he had as good a right certainly as they to regard himself as sent by God. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:0">2 Corinthians 12:0</span> he appeals to another argument, to which none of his accusers were able to appeal, that he had been permitted to see the glories of the heavenly world, and had been favored in a manner unknown to other people.</p>
<p style=" ">It is evident that there was one or more false teachers among the Corinthians who called in question the divine authority of Paul. These teachers were native Jews <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:22">2 Corinthians 11:22</span>, and they boasted much of their own endowments. It is impossible, except from the Epistle itself, to ascertain the nature of their charges and objections against him. From the chapter before us it would seem that one principal ground of their objection was, that though he was bold enough in his letters and had threatened to exercise discipline, yet that he would not dare to do it. They accused him of being, when present with them, timid, weak, mild, pusillanimous, of lacking moral courage to inflict the punishment which he had threatened in his letters. To this he replies in this chapter:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) He appeals to the meekness and gentleness of Christ; thus indirectly and delicately vindicating his own mildness from their objections, and entreats them not to give him occasion to show the boldness and severity which he had purposed to do He had no wish to be bold and severe in the exercise of discipline, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1-2">2 Corinthians 10:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He assures them that the weapons of his warfare were not carnal, but spiritual. He relied on the truth of the gospel and on the power of motives; and these weapons were mighty by the aid of God to cast down all that offend him. Yet he was ready to revenge and punish all disobedience by severe measures if it were necessary, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3-6">2 Corinthians 10:3-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) They looked on the outward appearance. He cautioned them to remember that he had as good claims to be regarded as belonging to Christ at they had, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span>. He had given proofs that he was an apostle, and the false teachers should look at those proofs lest they should be found to be opposing God. He assured them that if he had occasion to exercise his power he would have no reason to be ashamed of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span>. It would be found to be ample to execute punishment on his foes.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) The false teachers had said that Paul was terrible only in his letters. He boasted of his power, but it was, they supposed, only epistolary bravery. He would not dare to execute his threatening. in reply to this, Paul, in a strain of severe irony, says that he would not seem to terrify them by mere letters. It would be by something far more severe. He advised such objectors, therefore, to believe that he would prove himself to be such as he had shown himself to be in his letters; to look at the evidence, since they boasted of their talent for reasoning, that he would show himself in fact to be what he had threatened to be, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:9-12">2 Corinthians 10:9-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) He pursues the strain of severe irony by secretly comparing himself with them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:12-16">2 Corinthians 10:12-16</span>. They boasted much, but it was only by comparing themselves with one another, and not with any elevated standard of excellence. Paul admitted that he had not the courage to do that, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:12">2 Corinthians 10:12</span>. Nor did he dare to boast of things wholly beyond his ability as they had done. He was contented to act only within the proper limits prescribed to him by his talents and by the appointment of God. Not so they. They had boldness and courage to go far beyond that, and to boast of things wholly beyond their ability, and beyond the proper measure, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:13-14">2 Corinthians 10:13-14</span>. Nor had he courage to boast of entering into other people’s labors. It required more courage than he had, to make a boast of what he had done if he had availed himself of things made ready to his hand as if they were the fruit of his own labors, implying that they had done this; that they had come to Corinth, a church founded by his labors, and had quietly set themselves down there, and then, instead of going into other fields of labor, had called in question the authority of him who had founded the church, and who was laboring indefatigably elsewhere, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:15-16">2 Corinthians 10:15-16</span>. Paul adds, that such was not his intention. He aimed to preach the gospel beyond, to carry it to regions where it had not been spread. Such was the nature of his courage; such the kind of boldness which he had, and he was not ambitious to join them in their boasting.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) He concludes this chapter with a very serious admonition. Leaving the strain of irony, he seriously says that if any man were disposed to boast, it should be only in the Lord. He should glory not in self-commendation, but in the fact that he had evidence that the Lord approved him; not in his own talents or powers, but in the excellence and glory of the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:17-18">2 Corinthians 10:17-18</span>.</p>
