<p style=" "><b>And having in a readiness ... - </b>I am ready to punish all disobedience, notwithstanding all that is said to the contrary; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1-2">2 Corinthians 10:1-2</span>. Clothed as I am with this power; aiming to subdue all things to Christ, though the weapons of my warfare are not carnal, and though I am modest or timid <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span> when I am with you, I am prepared to take any measures of severity required by my apostolic office, in order that I may inflict deserved punishment on those who have violated the laws of Christ. The design of this is, to meet the objection of his enemies, that he would not dare to execute his threatenings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When your obedience is fulfilled - </b>Doddridge renders this: “now your obedience is fulfilled, and the sounder part of your church restored to due order and submission.” The idea seems to be, that Paul was ready to inflict discipline when the church had showed a readiness to obey his laws, and to do its own duty - delicately intimating that the reason why it was not done was the lack of entire promptness in the church itself, and that it could not be done on any offender as long as the church itself was not prepared to sustain him. The church was to discountenance the enemies of the Redeemer; to show an entire readiness to sustain the apostle, and to unite with him in the effort to maintain the discipline of Christ’s house.</p>
