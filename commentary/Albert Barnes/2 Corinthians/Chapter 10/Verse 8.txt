For though I should boast ... - If I should make even higher claims than I have done to a divine commission. I could urge higher evidence than I have done that I am sent by the Lord Jesus.Of our authority - Of my authority as an apostle, my power to administer discipline, and to direct the affairs of the church.Which the Lord hath given us for edification - A power primarily conferred to build up his people and save them and not to destroy.I should not be ashamed - It would be founded on good evidence and sustained by the nature of my commission. I should also have no occasion to be ashamed of the manner in which it has been exercised - a power that has in fact been employed in extending religion and edifying the church, and not in originating and sustaining measures suited to destroy the soul.
