<p style=" "><b>Would to God - </b>Greek, “I would” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ὄφελον</span></span> Ophelon). This expresses earnest desire, but in the Greek there is no appeal to God. The sense would be well expressed by “O that,” or “I earnestly wish.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye could bear with me - </b>That you would bear patiently with me; that you would hear me patiently, and suffer me to speak of myself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In my folly - </b>Folly in boasting. The idea seems to be, “I know that boasting is generally foolish, and that it is not to be indulged in. But though it is to be generally regarded as folly, yet circumstances compel me to it, and I ask your indulgence in it.” It is possible also that his opponents accused him of folly in boasting so much of himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And indeed bear with me - </b>Margin, “Ye do bear.” But the text has probably the correct rendering. It is the expression of an earnest wish that they would tolerate him a little in this. He entreats them to bear with him because he was constrained to it.</p>
