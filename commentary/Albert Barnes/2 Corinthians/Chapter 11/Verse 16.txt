<p style=" "><b>I say again - </b>I repeat it. He refers to what he had said in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:1">2 Corinthians 11:1</span>. The sense is, “I have said much respecting myself which may seem to be foolish. I admit that to boast in this manner of one’s own self in general is folly. But circumstances compel me to it. And I entreat you to look at those circumstances and not regard me as a fool for doing it.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>If otherwise - </b>If you think otherwise. If I cannot obtain this of you that you will not regard me as acting prudently and wisely. If you will think me foolish, still I am constrained to make these remarks in vindication of myself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yet as a fool receive me - </b>Margin, “Suffer;” see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:1">2 Corinthians 11:1</span>. Bear with me as you do with others. Consider how much I have been provoked to this; how necessary it is to my character; and do not reject and despise me because I am constrained to say that of myself which is usually regarded as foolish boasting.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That I may boast myself a little - </b>Since others do it and are not rebuked, may I be permitted to do it also; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:18-19">2 Corinthians 11:18-19</span>. There is something sarcastic in the words “a little.” The sense is, “Others are allowed to boast a great deal. Assuredly I may be allowed to boast a little of what I have done.”</p>
