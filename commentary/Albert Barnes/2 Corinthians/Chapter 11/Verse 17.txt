<p style=" "><b>That which I speak - </b>In praise of myself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I speak it not after the Lord - </b>see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:12">1 Corinthians 7:12</span>. The phrase here may mean either, I do not speak this by inspiration or claiming to be inspired by the Lord; or more probably it may mean, I do not speak this imitating the example of the Lord Jesus or strictly as becomes his follower. He was eminently modest, and never vaunted or boasted. And Paul probably means to say, “I do not in this profess to follow him entirely. I admit that it is a departure from his pure example in this respect. But circumstances have compelled me and much as I would prefer another strain at remark, and sensible as I am in general of the folly of boasting, yet a regard to my apostolic office and authority urges me to this course.” Bloomfield supposes that the apostle is not speaking seriously, but that he has an allusion to their view of what he was saying. “Be it so, if you think that what I speak, I speak not as I profess to do according to the Lord, or with a view to subserve the purposes of his religion, but as it were in folly, in the confidence of boasting, yet permit me to do it notwithstanding, since you allow others to do it.” It is not easy to settle which is the true sense of the passage. I see no conclusive evidence against either. But the former seems to me to be most in accordance with the scope of the whole. Paul admitted that what he said was not in exact accordance with the spirit of the Lord Jesus; and in admitting this he designed probably to administer a delicate hint that all their boasting was a wide departure from that spirit.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As it were foolishly - </b>As in folly. It is to be admitted that to boast is in general foolish; and I admit that my language is open to this general charge.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In this confidence of boasting - </b>In confident boasting. I speak confidently and I admit in the spirit of boasting.</p>
