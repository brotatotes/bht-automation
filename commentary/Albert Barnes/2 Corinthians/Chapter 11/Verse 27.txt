The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κόπος</span></span> kopos (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κόπτω</span></span> koptō, “to beat, to cut”) means, properly, “wailing and grief,” accompanied with beating the breast. Hence, the word means “toil, labor, wearisome effort.”</p>
