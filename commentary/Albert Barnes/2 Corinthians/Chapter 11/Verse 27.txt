In weariness - Resulting from traveling, exposure, labor, and want. The word κόπος kopos (from κόπτω koptō, “to beat, to cut”) means, properly, “wailing and grief,” accompanied with beating the breast. Hence, the word means “toil, labor, wearisome effort.”And painfulness - This word (μόχθος mochthos) is a stronger term than the former. It implies painful effort; labor producing sorrow, and in the New Testament is uniformly connected with the word rendered “weariness” (1 Thess, 2 Corinthians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8), rendered in both those places “travail.”In watchings often - In loss of sleep, arising from abundant toils and from danger; see the note on 2 Corinthians 6:5.In hunger and thirst - From traveling among strangers, and being dependent on them and on his own personal labors; see the note, 1 Corinthians 4:11.In fastings often - Either voluntary or involuntary; see the note on 2 Corinthians 6:5.In cold and nakedness - see the note, 1 Corinthians 4:11.
