<p style=" "><b>And when I was present with you - </b>When I was laboring in order to build up the church in Corinth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I was chargeable to no man - </b>I was burdensome to no one; or more liter ally,” I did not lie as a dead weight upon you.” The word used here, which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενάρκησα</span></span> katenarkēsa), means, literally, to become torpid against, that is, to the detriment of anyone; and hence, to be burdensome. According to Jerome, its use here is a Cilicism of Paul. The idea is that he did not lead a torpid, inactive life at the expense of others. He did not expect a support from them when he was doing nothing; nor did he demand support which would in any sense be a burden to them. By his own hands <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span>, and by the aid which he received from abroad, he was supported without deriving aid from the people of Corinth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And in all things ... - </b>In all respects I have carefully kept myself from being a burden on the church. Paul had no idea of living at other people’s expense when he was doing nothing. He did not, as a general thing, mean to receive anything for which he had not rendered a fair equivalent; a just principle for ministers and for all other people; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13">2 Corinthians 12:13</span>.</p>
