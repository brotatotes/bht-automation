<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:0">2 Corinthians 12:0</span> is a continuation of the same general subject which was discussed in the two previous chapters. The general design of the apostle is, to defend himself from the charges brought against him in Corinth, and especially, as it would appear, from the charge that he had no claims to the character of an apostle. In the previous chapters he had met these charges, and had shown that he had just cause to be bold toward them; that he had in his life given evidence that he was called to this work, and especially that by his successes and by his sufferings he had showed that he had evidence that he had been truly engaged in the work of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p style=" ">This chapter contains the following subjects.</p>
<p style=" ">1. Paul appeals to another evidence that he was engaged in the apostolic office - an evidence to which none of his accusers could appeal - that he had been permitted to behold the glories of the heavenly world; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:1-10">2 Corinthians 11:1-10</span>. In the previous chapter he had mentioned his trials. Here he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span>, that as they had compelled him to boast, he would mention the revelation which he had had of the Lord. He details, therefore, the remarkable vision which he had had several years before <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2-4">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</span>, when he was caught up to heaven, and permitted to behold the wonders there, Yet he says, that lest such an extraordinary manifestation should exalt him above measure, he was visited with a sore and special trial - a trial from which he prayed earnestly to be delivered, but that he received answer that the grace of God would be sufficient to support him; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:5-9">2 Corinthians 12:5-9</span>. It was in view of this, he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span> that he had pleasure in infirmities and sufferings in the cause of the Redeemer.</p>
<p style=" ">2. He then <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:11-12">2 Corinthians 12:11-12</span> sums up what he had said; draws the conclusion that he had given every sign or evidence that he was an apostle; that in all that pertained to toil, and patience, and miracles, he had shown that he was commissioned by the Saviour; though with characteristic modesty he said he was nothing.</p>
<p style=" ">3. He then expresses his purpose to come again and see them, and his intention then not to be burdensome to them; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13-15">2 Corinthians 12:13-15</span>. He was willing to labor for them, and to exhaust his strength in endeavoring to promote their welfare without receiving support from them, for he regarded himself in the light of a father to them, and it was not usual for children to support their parents.</p>
<p style=" ">4. In connection with this, he answers another charge against himself. Some accused him of being crafty; that though he did not burden them, yet he knew well how to manage so as to secure what he wanted without burdening them, or seeming to receive anything from them; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:16">2 Corinthians 12:16</span>. To this he answers by an appeal to fact. Particularly he appeals to the conduct of Titus when with them, in fall proof that he had no such design; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:17-19">2 Corinthians 12:17-19</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">5. In the conclusion of the chapter, he expresses his fear that when he should come among them he would find much that would humble them and give him occasion for severity of discipline; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:20-21">2 Corinthians 12:20-21</span>. This apprehension is evidently expressed in order that they might be led to examine themselves, and to put away whatever was wrong.</p>
