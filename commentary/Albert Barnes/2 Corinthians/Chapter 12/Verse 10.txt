<p style=" "><b>Therefore I take pleasure - </b>Since so many benefits result from trials; since my afflictions are the occasion of obtaining the favor of Christ in so eminent a degree, I rejoice in the privilege of suffering. There is often real pleasure in affliction, paradoxical as it may appear. Some of the happiest persons I have known are those who have been deeply afflicted; some of the purest joys which I have witnessed have been manifested on a sick-bed, and in the prospect of death. And I have no doubt that Paul, in the midst of all his infirmities and reproaches, had a joy above that which all the wealth and honor of the world could give. See here the power of religion. It not only supports, it comforts. It not only enables one to bear suffering with resignation, but it enables him to rejoice. Philosophy blunts the feelings: infidelity leaves people to complain and repine in trial; the pleasures of this world have no power even to support or comfort in times of affliction; but Christianity furnishes positive pleasure in trial, and enables the sufferer to smile through his tears.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In infirmities - </b>In my weaknesses; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:30">2 Corinthians 11:30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In reproaches - </b>In the contempt and scorn with which I meet as a follower of Christ, note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:21">2 Corinthians 11:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In necessities - </b>In want: see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4-5">2 Corinthians 6:4-5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In distresses for Christ’s sake - </b>note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>. In the various needs and difficulties to which I am exposed on account of the Saviour, or which I suffer in his cause.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For when I am weak, then am I strong - </b>When I feel weak; when I am subjected to trial, and nature faints and fails, then strength is imparted to me, and I am enabled to bear all. The more I am borne down with trials, the more do I feel my need of divine assistance, and the more do I feel the efficacy of divine grace. Such was the promise in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:25">Deuteronomy 33:25</span>; “As thy days, so shall thy strength be.” So in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:24">Hebrews 11:24</span>; “Who out of weakness were made strong.” What Christian has not experienced this, and been able to say that when he felt himself weak and felt like sinking under the accumulation of many trials, he has found his strength according to his day, and felt an arm of power supporting him? It is then that the Redeemer manifests himself in a special manner; and then that the excellency of the religion of Christ is truly seen and its power appreciated and felt.</p>
