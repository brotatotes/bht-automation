<p style=" "><b>Truly the signs of an apostle - </b>Such miracles as the acknowledged apostles worked. Such “signs” or evidences that they were divinely commissioned; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:17">Mark 16:17</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:19">Romans 15:19</span> note.</p>

<p style=" "><b>In all patience - </b>I performed those works notwithstanding the opposition which I met with. I patiently persevered in furnishing the evidence of my divine commission. There was a succession of miracles demonstrating that I was from God, notwithstanding the unreasonable opposition which I met with, until I convinced you that I was called to the office of an apostle.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In signs and wonders - </b>In working miracles; compare note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>. What these miracles at Corinth were, we are not distinctly informed. They probably, however, were similar to those performed in other places, in healing the sick, etc.; the most benevolent as it was one of the most decisive proofs of the divine power.</p>
