<p style=" "><b>For what is it ... - </b>This verse contains a striking mixture of sarcasm and irony, not exceeded, says Bloomfield, by any example in Demosthenes. the sense is,” I have given among you the most ample proof of my apostolic commission. I have conferred on you the highest favors of the apostolic office. In these respects you are superior to all other churches. In one respect only are you inferior - it is in this, that you have not been burdened with the privilege of supporting me. If you had had this, you would have been inferior to no others. But this was owing to me; and I pray that you will forgive me this I might have urged it; I might have claimed it; I might have given you the privilege of becoming equal to the most favored in all respects. But I have not pressed it, and you have not done it, and I ask your pardon.” There is a delicate insinuation that they had not contributed to his needs (see the note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span>); an intimation that it was a privilege to contribute to the support of the gospel, and that Paul might have been “burdensome to them” (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1-12">1 Corinthians 9:1-12</span>); and an admission that he was in part to blame for this, and had not in this respect given them an opportunity to equal other churches in all respects.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was not burdensome to you - </b>see this explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Forgive me this wrong - </b>“If it be a fault, pardon it. Forgive me that I did not give you this opportunity to be equal to other churches. It is a privilege to contribute to the support of the gospel, and they who are permitted to do it should esteem themselves highly favored. I pray you to pardon me for depriving you of any of your Christian privileges.” What the feelings of the Corinthians were about forgiving Paul for this we know not; but most churches would be as ready to forgive a minister for this as for any other offence.</p>
