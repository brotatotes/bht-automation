<p style=" "><b>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you - </b>That is, this is the third time that I have purposed to come and see you, and have made preparation for it. He does not mean that he had been twice with them and was now coming the third time, but that he had twice before intended to go and had been disappointed; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15-16">2 Corinthians 1:15-16</span>. His purpose had been to visit them on his way to Macedonia and again on his return from Macedonia. He had now formed a third resolution, which he had a prospect of carrying into execution.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I will not be burdensome to you - </b>I resolve still, as I have done before, not to receive a compensation that shall be oppressive to you, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9-10">2 Corinthians 11:9-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For I seek not yours, but you - </b>I desire not to obtain your property, but to save your souls. This was a noble resolution; and it is the resolution which should be formed by every minister of the gospel. While a minister of Christ has a claim to a competent support, his main purpose should not be to obtain such a support. It should be the higher and nobler object of winning souls to the Redeemer. See Paul’s conduct in this respect explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:33">Acts 20:33</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the children ... - </b>There is great delicacy and address in this sentiment. The meaning is, “It is not natural and usual for children to make provisions for their parents. The common course of events and of duty is, for parents to make provision for their offspring. I, therefore, your spiritual father, choose to act in the same way. I make provision for your spiritual needs; I labor and toil for you as a father does for his children. I seek your welfare, as he does, by constant self-denial. In return, I do not ask you to provide for me, any more than a father ordinarily expects his children to provide for him. I am willing to labor as he does, content with doing my duty, and promoting the welfare of those under me.” The words rendered “ought out” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οὐ ὀφείλει</span></span> ou opheilei) are to be understood in a comparative sense. Paul does not mean that a child ought never to provide for his parents, or to lay anything up for a sick, a poor, and an infirm father, but that the duty of doing that was slight and unusual compared with the duty of a parent to provide for his children. The one was of comparatively rare occurrence; the other was constant and was the ordinary course of duty It is a matter of obligation for a child to provide for an aged and helpless parent; but commonly the duty is that of a parent to provide for his children. Paul felt like a father toward the church in Corinth; and he was willing, therefore, to labor for them without compensation.</p>
