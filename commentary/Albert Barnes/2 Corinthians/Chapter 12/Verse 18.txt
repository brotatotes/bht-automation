<p style=" "><b>I desired Titus - </b>To go and complete the collection which you had commenced; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And with him I sent a brother - </b>see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18">2 Corinthians 8:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Did Titus make a gain of you - </b>They knew that he did not. They had received him kindly, treated him with affection, and sent him away with every proof of confidence and respect; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:7">2 Corinthians 7:7</span>. How then could they now pretend that he had defrauded them?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Walked we not in the same spirit? - </b>Did not all his actions resemble mine? Was there not the same proof of honesty, sincerity, and love which I have ever manifested? This is a very delicate turn. Paulâ€™s course of life when with them they admitted was free from guile and from any attempt to get money by improper means. They charged him only with attempting it by means of others. He now boldly appeals to them and asks whether Titus and he had not in fact acted in the same manner; and whether they had not alike evinced a spirit free from covetousness and deceit?</p>
