<p style=" "><b>And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me ... - </b>Lest I should be compelled to inflict punishment on those whom I suppose to have been converted under my ministry. I had rejoiced in them as true converts: I had counted them as among the fruit of my ministry. Now to be compelled to inflict punishment on them as having no religion would mortify me and humble me. The infliction of punishment on members of the church is a sort of punishment to him who inflicts it as well as to him who is punished. Members of the church should walk uprightly, lest they overwhelm the ministry in shame.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And that I shall bewail many ... - </b>If they repented of their sin he could still rejoice in them. If they continued in their sin until he came, it would be to him a source of deep lamentation. It is evident from the word “many” here that the disorders had prevailed very extensively in the church at Corinth. The word rendered “have sinned already” means “who have sinned before,” and the idea is, that they were old offenders, and that they had not yet repented.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The uncleanness - </b>see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And fornication and lasciviousness ... - </b>see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:18">1 Corinthians 6:18</span>. This was the sin to which they were particularly exposed in Corinth, as it was the sin for which that corrupt city was particularly distinguished. See the introduction to the First Epistle. Hence, the frequent cautions in these epistles against it; and hence, it is not to be wondered at that some of those who had become professing Christians had fallen into it. It may be added that it is still the sin to which converts from the corruptions and licentiousness of paganism are particularly exposed.</p>
