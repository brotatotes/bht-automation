<p style=" "><b>Therefore I write these things ... - </b>This is a kind of apology for what he had said, and especially for the apparently harsh language which he had felt himself constrained to use. He had reproved them; he had admonished them of their faults; he had threatened punishment, all of which was designed to prevent the necessity of severe measures when he should be with them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lest being present I should use sharpness - </b>In order that when I come I may not have occasion to employ severity; see the sentiment explained in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:2">2 Corinthians 10:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to the power ... - </b>That I may not use the power with which Christ has invested me for maintaining discipline in his church. The same form of expression is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span>; see the note on that place.</p>
