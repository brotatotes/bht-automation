<p style=" ">In this chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:0">2 Corinthians 2:0</span> Paul continues the discussion of the subject which had been introduced in the previous chapter. At the close of that chapter, he had stated the reasons why he had not visited the church at Corinth; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23-24">2 Corinthians 1:23-24</span>. The main reason was, that instead of coming to them in that disordered, and irregular state, he had preferred to send them an affectionate letter. Had he come to them personally he would have felt himself called on to exercise the severity of discipline. He chose, therefore, to try what the effect would be of a faithful and kind epistle. In this chapter, he prosecutes the same subject. He states, therefore, more at length, the reason why he had not come to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1-5">2 Corinthians 2:1-5</span>. The reason was, that he resolved not to come to them, if he could avoid it, with severity; that his heart was pained even with the necessity of sending such a letter; that he wrote it with much anguish of spirit; yet that he cherished toward them the most tender love.</p>
<p style=" ">In his former Epistle <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1-13">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</span> he had directed them to exercise discipline on the offending person in the church. This had been done according to his direction; and the offender had been suitably punished for his offence. He had been excommunicated; and it would seem that the effect on him had been to induce him to forsake his sin, and probably to put away his fatherâ€™s wife, and he had become a sincere penitent. Paul, therefore, in the next place <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:6-11">2 Corinthians 2:6-11</span>, exhorts them to receive him again into fellowship with the church. The punishment be says had been sufficient <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:6">2 Corinthians 2:6</span>; they ought now to be kind and forgiving to him lest he should be overwhelmed with his sorrow <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:7">2 Corinthians 2:7</span>; he says, that he had forgiven him, so far as he was concerned, and he entreated them to do the same <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span>; and says that they ought, by all means, to pursue such a course that Satan could get no advantage of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:11">2 Corinthians 2:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Paul then states the disappointment which he had had at Troas in not seeing Titus, from whom he had expected to learn what was the state of the church at Corinth, and what was the reception of his letter there; but that not seeing him there, he had gone on to Macedonia, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12-13">2 Corinthians 2:12-13</span>. There, it would seem, he met Titus, and learned that his letter had had all the success which he could have desired. It had been kindly received; and all that he had wished in regard to discipline had been performed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:14">2 Corinthians 2:14</span>. The hearing of this success gives him occasion to thank God for it, as one among many instances in which his efforts to advance His cause had been crowned with success. God had made him successful everywhere; and God had made him triumph in Christ in every place. This fact gives him occasion <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:15-16">2 Corinthians 2:15-16</span> to state the general effect of his preaching and his labors. His efforts, he says, were always acceptable to God - though he could not be ignorant that in some cases the gospel which he preached was the occasion of the aggravated condemnation of those who heard and rejected it. Yet he had the consolation of reflecting that it was by no fault of his, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>. It was not because he had corrupted the Word of God; it was not because he was unfaithful; it was not because he was not sincere. He had a good conscience - a conscience which assured him that he spoke in sincerity and as in the sight of God - though the unhappy effect might be that many would perish from under his ministry.</p>
