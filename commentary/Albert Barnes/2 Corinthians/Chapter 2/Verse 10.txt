<p style=" "><b>To whom ye forgive anything - </b>The sense here is, “I have confidence in you as a Christian society and such confidence, that if you forgive an offence in one of your members, I shall approve the act, and shall also be ready to forgive.” He refers, doubtless, to this particular case; but he makes his remark general. It is implied here, I think, that the Corinthians were disposed to forgive the offending brother; and Paul here assures them that they had his hearty assent to this, and that if they did forgive him, he was ready to join them in the act, and to forgive him also.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For if I forgave anything - </b>If I forgive anything; if I remit any of the punishments which have been inflicted by my authority.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For your sakes - </b>It is not on account of the offender alone; it is in order to promote the happiness and purity of the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the person of Christ - </b>Locke paraphrases this, “By the authority, and in the name of Christ.” Doddridge,” As in the person of Christ, and by the high authority with which he has been pleased to invest me.” Tyndale, “In the room of Christ.” The word rendered “person” (Margin, “sight,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρόσωπον</span></span> prosōpon, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρός</span></span> pros and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὤψ</span></span> ōps), means properly the part toward, at, and around the eye - Robinson. Then it means the face, visage, countenance; then the presence, person, etc. Here it probably means, in the presence of Christ; with his eye upon me, and conscious that I am acting before him, and must give account to him. It implies, undoubtedly, that Paul acted by his authority, and felt that he was doing that which Christ would approve.</p>
