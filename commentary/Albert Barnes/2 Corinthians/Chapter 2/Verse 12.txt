<p style=" "><b>Furthermore - </b>But (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δὲ</span></span> de). This particle is properly adversative; but frequently denotes transition, and serves to introduce something else, whether opposite to what precedes, or simply continuative or explanatory. Here, it is designed to continue or explain the statement before made of his deep affection for the church, and his interest in its affairs. He therefore tells them that when he came to Troas, and was favored there with great success, and was engaged in a manner most likely of all others to interest his feelings and to give him joy, yet he was deeply distressed because he had not heard, as he expected, from them; but so deep was his anxiety that he left Troas and went into Macedonia.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When I came to Troas - </b>This was a city of Phrygia, or Mysia, on the Hellespont, between Troy on the north, and Assos on the south; see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:8">Acts 16:8</span>. It was on the regular route from Ephesus to Macedonia. Paul took that route because on his journey to Macedonia he had resolved, for the reasons above stated, not to go to Corinth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To preach Christ’s gospel - </b>Greek. “For (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis) the gospel of Christ;” that is, on account of his gospel; or to promote it. Why he selected Troas, or the region of the Troad (note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:8">Acts 16:8</span>), as the field of his labors, he does not say. It is probable that he was waiting there to hear from Corinth by Titus, and while there he resolved not to be idle, but to make known as much as possible the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And a door was opened unto me - </b>see the note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>. There was an opportunity of doing good, and the people were disposed to hear the gospel. This was a work in which Paul delighted to engage, and in which he usually found his highest comfort. It was of all things the most adapted to promote his happiness.</p>
