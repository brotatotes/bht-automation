<p style=" "><b>Sufficient to such a man - </b>The incestuous person who had been by Paul’s direction removed from the church. The object of Paul here is to have him again restored. For that purpose he says that the punishment which they had inflicted on him was “sufficient.” It was:</p>
<p style=" ">It had accomplished all that he had desired. It had humbled him, and brought him to repentance; and doubtless led him to put away his “wife”; compare note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>. As that had been done, it was proper now that he should be again restored to the privileges of the church. No evil would result from such a restoration, and their duty to their penitent brother demanded it. Mr. Locke has remarked that Paul conducts this subject here with very great tenderness and delicacy. The entire passage from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:5">2 Corinthians 2:5</span> to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span> relates solely to this offending brother, yet he never once mentions his name, nor does he mention his crime. He speaks of him only in the soft terms of “such a one” and “any one:” nor does he use an epithet which would be calculated to wound his feelings, or to transmit his name to posterity, or to communicate it to other churches. So that though this Epistle should be read, as Paul doubtless intended, by other churches, and be transmitted to future times, yet no one would ever be acquainted with the name of the individual. How different this from the temper of those who would emblazon abroad the names of offenders, or make a permanent record to carry them down with dishonor to posterity?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which was inflicted of many - </b>By the church in its collective capacity; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4">1 Corinthians 5:4</span>. Paul had required the church to administer this act of discipline, and they had promptly done it. It is evident that the whole church was concerned in the administration of the act of discipline; as the words “of many” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀπὸ τῶν πλείονων</span></span> apo tōn pleionōn are not applicable either to a single” bishop, or a single minister, or a presbytery, or a bench of elders: nor can they be so regarded, except by a forced and unnatural construction. Paul had directed it to be done by the assembled church <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4">1 Corinthians 5:4</span>, and this phrase shows that they had followed his instructions. Locke supposes that the phrase means, “by the majority;” Macknight renders it, “by the greater number;” Bloomfield supposes that it means that the “punishment was carried into effect by all.” Doddridge paraphrases it, “by the whole body of your society.” The expression proves beyond a doubt that the whole body of the society was concerned in the act of the excommunication, and that is a proper way of administering discipline. Whether it proves, however, that that is the mode which is to be observed in all instances, may admit of a doubt, as the example of the early churches, in a particular case, does not prove that that mode has the force of a binding rule on all.</p>
<p style=" ">(It cannot fairly be argued from this verse, that the “many” or the whole congregation, were judicially concerned in the act of excommunication; yet as their concurrence was essential, in order to carry the sentence into effect, it was “inflicted of many” in a most emphatic sense. The refusal, on the part of the members of the church, to have any more social contact with the incestuous man, carried into effect what the apostle had judicially pronounced. See the supplementary note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4">1 Corinthians 5:4</span>.)</p>
