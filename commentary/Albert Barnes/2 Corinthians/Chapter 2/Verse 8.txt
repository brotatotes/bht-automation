<p style=" "><b>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him - </b>The word rendered here as “confirm” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυρῶσαι</span></span> kurōsai) occurs in the New Testament only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:15">Galatians 3:15</span>. It means to give authority, to establish as valid, to confirm; and here means that they should give strong expressions and assurances of their love to him; that they should pursue such a course as would leave no room for doubt in regard to it. Tyndale has well rendered it: “Wherefore I exhort you that love may halve strength over him.” Paul referred, doubtless, here to some public act of the church by which the sentence of excommunication might be removed, and by which the offender might have a public assurance of their favor.</p>
