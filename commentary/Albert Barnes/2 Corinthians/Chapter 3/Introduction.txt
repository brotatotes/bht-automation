<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:0">2 Corinthians 3:0</span> is closely connected in its design with the preceding. Paul had said in that chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:14">2 Corinthians 2:14</span>, that he had always occasion to triumph in the success which he had, and that God always blessed his labors; and especially had spoken, in the close of the previous chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>, of his sincerity as contrasted with the conduct of some who corrupted the Word of God. This might appear to some as if he designed to commend himself to them, or that he had said this for the purpose of securing their favor. It is probable also, that the false teachers at Corinth had been introduced there by letters of recommendation, perhaps from Judea. In reply to this, Paul intimates <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span> that this was not his design; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:2">2 Corinthians 3:2</span> that he had no need of letters of recommendation to them, since <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:2-3">2 Corinthians 3:2-3</span> they were his commendatory epistle; they were themselves the best evidence of his zeal, fidelity, and success in his labors. He could appeal to them as the best proof that he was qualified for the apostolic office. His success among them, he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:4">2 Corinthians 3:4</span>, was a ground of his trusting in God, an evidence of his acceptance. Yet, as if he should seem to rely on his own strength, and to boast of what he had done, he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:5">2 Corinthians 3:5</span> that his success was not owing to any strength which he had, or to any skill of his own, but entirely to the aid which he had received from God. It was God. he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>, who had qualified him to preach, and had given him grace to be an able minister of the New Testament.</p>
<p style=" ">It is not improbable that the false teachers, being of Jewish origin, in Corinth, had commended the laws and institutions of Moses as being of superior clearness, and even as excelling the gospel of Christ. Paul takes occasion, therefore <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7-11">2 Corinthians 3:7-11</span>, to show that the laws and institutions of Moses were far inferior in this respect to the gospel. His was a ministration of death <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>; though glorious it was to be done away <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>; the ministration of the Spirit was therefore to be presumed to be far more glorious <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:8">2 Corinthians 3:8</span>; the one was a ministration to condemnation, the other of righteousness <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:9">2 Corinthians 3:9</span>; the one had comparatively no glory, being so much surpassed by the other <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:10">2 Corinthians 3:10</span>; and the former was to be done away, while the latter was to remain, and was therefore far more glorious, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:11">2 Corinthians 3:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">This statement of the important difference between the laws of Moses and the gospel, is further illustrated by showing the effect which the institutions of Moses had had on the Jews themselves, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:12-15">2 Corinthians 3:12-15</span>. That effect was to blind them. Moses had put a veil over his face <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:13">2 Corinthians 3:13</span>; and the effect had been that the nation was blinded in reading the Old Testament, and had no just views of the true meaning of their own Scriptures, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:14-15">2 Corinthians 3:14-15</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Yet, Paul says, that that veil should be taken away, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:16-18">2 Corinthians 3:16-18</span>. It was the intention of God that it should be removed. When that people should turn again to the Lord, it should be taken away, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:16">2 Corinthians 3:16</span>. It was done where the Spirit of the Lord was, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>. It was done in fact in regard to all true Christians, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>. They were permitted to behold the glory of the Lord as in a glass, and they were changed into the same image. The same subject is continued in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:0">2 Corinthians 4:0</span>, where Paul illustrates the effect of this clear revelation of the gospel as compared with the institutions of Moses, on the Christian ministry.</p>
