<p style=" "><b>Do we begin again - </b>This is designed evidently to meet an objection. He had been speaking of his triumph in the ministry <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:14">2 Corinthians 2:14</span>, and of his sincerity and honesty, as contrasted with the conduct of many who corrupted the Word of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>. It might be objected that he was magnifying himself in these statements, and designed to commend himself in this manner to the Corinthians. To this he replies in the following verses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To commend ourselves? - </b>To recommend ourselves; do we speak this in our own praise, in order to obtain your favor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or need we, as some others - </b>Probably some who had brought letters of recommendation to them from Judea. The false teachers at Corinth had been originally introduced there by commendatory letters from abroad. These were letters of introduction, and were common among the Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews, as they are now. They were usually given to persons who were about to travel, as there were no inns. and as travelers were dependent on the hospitality of those among whom they traveled.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of commendation from you - </b>To other congregations. It is implied here by Paul, that he sought no such letter; that he traveled without them; and that he depended on his zeal, and self-denial, and success to make him known, and to give him the affections of those to whom he ministered - a much better recommendation than mere introductory letters. Such letters were, however, sometimes given by Christians, and are by no means improper, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:27">Acts 18:27</span>. Yet, they do not appear to have been sought or used by the apostles generally. They depended on their miraculous endowments, and on the attending grace of God to make them known.</p>
