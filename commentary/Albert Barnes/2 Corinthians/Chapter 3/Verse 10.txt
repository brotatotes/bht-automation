<p style=" "><b>For even that which was made glorious - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὸ δεδοξασμένον</span></span> to dedoxasmenon). That was splendid, excellent, or glorious. This refers doubtless, to the laws and institutions of Moses, especially to the primary giving of the Law. Paul does not deny that it had an honor and majesty such, in some respects, as the Jews claimed for it. It was glorious in the manner in which it was given; it was glorious in the purity of the Law itself; and it was glorious, or splendid in the magnificent and imposing ritual in which the worship of God was celebrated. But all this was surpassed in the brighter glory of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had no glory - </b>Greek: “Was not glorious, or splendid” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οὐδὲ δεδόξασται</span></span> oude deoxastai. It had comparatively no glory or splendor. Its glory was all eclipsed. It was like the splendor of the moon and stars compared with the bright light of the sun.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By reason of the glory that excelleth - </b>In the gospel; in the incarnation, life, sufferings, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus; in the pardon of sin; in the peace and joy of the believer; and in the glories of the heavenly world to which the gospel elevates dying men.</p>
