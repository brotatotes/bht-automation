<p style=" "><b>But their minds were blinded - </b>The word used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωρόω</span></span> pōroō) means rather to harden; to make hard like stone; and then to make dull or stupid. It is applied to the heart, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:52">Mark 6:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:17">Mark 8:17</span>; to persons, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span>; and to the eyes, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+17:7">Job 17:7</span>. Paul refers here to the fact that the understandings of the Jews were stupid, dull, and insensible, so that they did not see clearly the design and end of their own institutions. He states simply the fact; he does not refer to the cause of it. The fact that the Jews were thus stupid and dull is often affirmed in the New Testament.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For until this day ... - </b>The sense of this is, that even to the time when Paul wrote, it was a characteristic of the great mass of the Jewish people, that they did not understand the true sense of their own Scriptures. They did not understand its doctrines in regard to the Messiah. A veil seems to be thrown over the Old Testament when they read it, as there was over the face of Moses, so that the glory of their own Scriptures is concealed from their view, as the glory of the face of Moses was hidden.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the Old Testament - </b>Greek, “of the old covenant.” See this word “testament,” or covenant, explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:25">1 Corinthians 11:25</span>. This, I believe, is the only instance in which the Scriptures of the Jews are called the “Old Testament,” or covenant, in the Bible. It was, of course, not a name which they used, or would use; but it is now with Christians the common appellation. No doubt can be entertained but that Paul uses the terms in the same manner in which we now do, and refers to all the inspired writings of the Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which vail is done away in Christ - </b>In the manifestation, or appearance of Jesus the Messiah, the veil is removed. The obscurity which rested on the prophecies and types of the former dispensation is withdrawn; and as the face of Moses could have been distinctly seen if the veil on his face had been removed, so it is in regard to the true meaning of the Old Testament by the coming of the Messiah. What was obscure is now made clear; and the prophecies are so completely fulfilled in him, that his coming has removed the covering, and shed a clear light over them all. Many of the prophecies, for example, until the Messiah actually appeared, appeared obscure, and almost contradictory. Those which spoke of him, for illustration, as man and as God; as suffering, and yet reigning; as dying, and yet as ever-living; as a mighty Prince, a conqueror, and a king, and yet as a man of sorrows; as humble, and yet glorious: all seemed difficult to be reconciled until they were seen to harmonize in Jesus of Nazareth. Then they were plain, and the veil was taken away. Christ is seen to answer all the previous descriptions of him in the Old Testament; and his coming casts a clear light on all which was before obscure.</p>
