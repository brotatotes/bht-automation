<p style=" "><b>And such trust have we - </b>Such confidence have we that we are appointed by God, and that he accepts our work. Such evidence have we in the success of our labors; such irrefragable proof that God blesses us; that we have trust, or confidence, that we are sent by God, and are owned by him in our ministry. His confidence did not rest on letters of introduction from people, but in the evidence of the divine presence, and the divine acceptance of his work.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through Christ - </b>By the agency of Christ. Paul had no success which he did not trace to him; he had no joy of which he was not the source; he had no confidence, or trust in God of which Christ was not the author; he had no hope of success in his ministry which did not depend on him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To God-ward - </b>Toward God; in regard to God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span></span> pros ton Theon). Our confidence relates to God. It is confidence that he has appointed us, and sent us forth; and confidence that he will still continue to own and to bless us.</p>
