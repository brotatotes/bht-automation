<p style=" "><b>But if the ministration of death - </b>In the previous verses, Paul had referred incidentally to the institutions of Moses, and to the superiority of the gospel. He had said that the former were engraved on stones, but the latter on the heart <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span>; that the letter of the former tended to death, but the latter to life <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>. This sentiment he proceeds further to illustrate, by showing in what the superior glory of the gospel consisted. The design of the whole is, to illustrate the nature, and to show the importance of the ministerial office; and the manner in which the duties of that office were to be performed. That the phrase “ministration of death” refers to the Mosaic institutions, the connection sufficiently indicates, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:13-15">2 Corinthians 3:13-15</span>. The word “ministration” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονία</span></span> diakonia) means, properly, ministry; the office of ministering in divine things. It is usually applied to the officers of the church in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:17">Acts 1:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The word here, however, seems to refer to the whole arrangement under the Mosaic economy, by which his laws were promulgated, and perpetuated. The expression “a ministration - written and engraved on stone,” is somewhat harsh; but the sense evidently is, the ministration of a covenant, or of laws written on stones. The word “ministration “there refers to the arrangement, office, etc. by which the knowledge of these laws was maintained; the ministering under a system like that of the Jewish; or, more strictly, the act and occasion on which Moses himself ministered, or promulgated that system to the Jews, and when the glory of the work was irradiated even from His countenance. And the purpose of the apostle is to show that the ministry of the gospel is more glorious than even the ministry of Moses, when he was admitted near to God on the holy mountain; and when such a glory attended his receiving and promulgating the Law. It is called the “ministration of death,” because it tended to condemnation; it did not speak of pardon; it was suited only to deepen the sense of sin, and to produce alarm and dread; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Written and engraven in stones - </b>The Ten Commandments - the substance of all the Mosaic institutes, and the principal laws of his economy - were written or engraved on tables of stone.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was glorious - </b>Was attended with magnificence and splendor. The glory here referred to, consisted in the circumstance of sublimity and grandeur in which the Law of Moses was given, It was:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)The glory of the attending circumstances, of thunder, fire, etc. in which God appeared. The Law was given in these circumstances. Its giving - called here the “ministration” - was amidst such displays of the glory of God. It was,</p>
<p style=" "><b>So that the children of Israel ... - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:29-30">Exodus 34:29-30</span>, it is said, that “When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone, while He talked with him. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.” The word rendered “steadfastly behold” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀτενίσαι</span></span> atenisai), means to gaze intently upon; to look steadily, or constantly, or fixedly; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:10">Acts 1:10</span>. There was a dazzling splendor, an irradiation; a diffusion of light, such that they could not look intently and steadily upon it - as we cannot look steadily at the sun. How this was produced, is not known. It cannot be accounted for from natural causes, and was doubtless designed to be to the Israelites an attestation that Moses had been with God, and was commissioned by him. They would see:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which glory was to be done away - </b>The splendor of that scene was transitory. It did not last. It was soon destroyed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὴν καταργουμένην</span></span> tēn katargoumenēn. It was not adapted or designed long to continue. This does not mean, as Doddridge supposes, “soon to be abolished in death;” or, as others, “ceasing with youth;” but it means, that the shining or the splendor was transitory; it was soon to cease; it was not designed to be permanent. Neither the wonderful scenes accompanying the giving of the Law on Sinai, nor the shining on the countenance of Moses, was designed to abide. The thunders of Sinai would cease to roll; the lightenings to play; the visible manifestations of the presence of God would all be gone; and the supernatural illumination of the face of Moses also would soon cease - perhaps as Macknight, Bloomfield, and others suppose, as a prefiguration of the abrogation of the glory of the whole system of the Levitical law. Paul certainly means to say, that the glory of Moses, and of his dispensation, was a fading glory; but that the glory of the gospel would be permanent, and increasing forever.</p>
