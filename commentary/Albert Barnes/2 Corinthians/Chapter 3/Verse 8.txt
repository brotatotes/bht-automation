<p style=" "><b>How shall not the ministration of the Spirit - </b>This is an argument from the less to the greater. Several things in it are worthy of notice:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The proper contrast to the “ministration of death” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>, would have been ‘ministration of life.’ But Paul chose rather to call it the ‘ministration of the spirit;’ as the source of life; or as conferring higher dignity on the gospel than to have called it simply the ministration of life.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) By the “Spirit” here is manifestly meant the Holy Spirit; and the whole phrase denotes the gospel, or the preaching of the gospel, by which eminently the Holy Spirit is imparted.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) It is the high honor of the gospel ministry, that it is the means by which the Holy Spirit is imparted to human beings. It is designed to secure the salvation of people by his agency; and it is through the ministry that the Holy Spirit is imparted, the heart renewed, and the soul saved. The work of the ministry is, therefore, the most important and honorable in which man can engage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be rather glorious - </b> </p>
<p style=" ">(1) Because that of Moses tended to death; this to life.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Because that was engraved on stone; this is engraved on the heart.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Because that was the mere giving of a law; this is connected with the renovating influences of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Because that was soon to pass away. All the magnificence of the scene was soon to vanish. But this is to remain. Its influence and effect are to he everlasting. It is to stretch into eternity; and its main glory is to be witnessed in souls renewed and saved; and amidst the splendors of heaven. “The work of the Spirit of God on the heart of a rational being, is much more important than any dead characters which can be engraved on insensible stones” - Doddridge.</p>
