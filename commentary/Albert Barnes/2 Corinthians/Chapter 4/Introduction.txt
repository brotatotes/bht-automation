<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:0">2 Corinthians 4:0</span> is intimately connected with the preceding, and is indeed merely a statement of the consequences or results of the doctrine advanced there. In that chapter, Paul had stated the clearness and plainness of the gospel as contrasted with the institutions of Moses, and particularly that the Christian ministry was a ministration more glorious than that of Moses. It was more clear. It was a ministration of justification <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:9">2 Corinthians 3:9</span>, and of the Spirit <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:8">2 Corinthians 3:8</span>, and was a ministration where they were permitted to look upon the unveiled and unclouded glories of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>. In this chapter he states some of the “consequences,” or “results” of their being called to this ministry; and the design is, to magnify the office of the ministry; to show the sustaining power of the truths which they preached; the interest which the Corinthian Christians and all other Christians had in the ministry, and this to conciliate their favor; and to show what there was to comfort them in the various trials to which as ministers they were exposed. Paul states therefore in this chapter:</p>
<p style=" ">1. That these clear and elevated views of the gospel sustained him; kept him from fainting; preserved him from deceit and all improper acts; made him open and honest; since he had no necessity for craft and guilt, but proclaimed a system of religion which could be commended to every man’s conscience, and be seen to be true, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1-2">2 Corinthians 4:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">2. That if any persons were lost, it was not the fault of the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:3-4">2 Corinthians 4:3-4</span>. That was clear, open, plain, glorious, and might be understood; and if they were lost, it was to be traced to the malign influence of the god of this world, and not to the gospel.</p>
<p style=" ">3. That the great purpose of Paul and his associates was to make known this clear and glorious truth of the gospel, and that, therefore, the apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ Jesus, the revealer and source of all this glory. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:5-6">2 Corinthians 4:5-6</span>. Their sole object was to show forth this pure and glorious light of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" ">4. That it was so arranged by God’s appointment and providence that all the glory of the results of the ministry should be his, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7-11">2 Corinthians 4:7-11</span>. He had taken special care that they should have no cause of self-exultation or glorying in preaching the gospel; and had taken effectual means that they should be humbled, and not lifted up with pride, from the fact that they were commissioned to make known such glorious truths, and had a ministry more honorable than that of Moses. He had, therefore, committed the treasure to earthen vessels; to frail, weak, dying people, and to people in humble life <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>, and he had called them to submit to constant trials of persecution, poverty, peril, and want, in order that they might be humbled, and that God might manifestly have all the glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:8-11">2 Corinthians 4:8-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">5. All this was for the sake of the church, a fact which was adapted to conciliate the favor of Christians and excite their sympathy in the sufferings of the apostles, and to lead them to honor the ministry in a proper manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:12-15">2 Corinthians 4:12-15</span>. It was not for their own welfare, happiness, honor. or emolument that they endured these trials in the ministry; it was that the church might be benefitted, and thus abundant praise redound to God.</p>
<p style=" ">6. These considerations sustained them in their trials, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16-18">2 Corinthians 4:16-18</span>. They had comfort in all their afflictions. They felt that they were doing and suffering these things for the salvation of souls, and the glory of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>; they had inward strength given them every day, though the outward man perished <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>; they knew that the result of this would be an eternal weight of glory <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:17">2 Corinthians 4:17</span>; and they were enabled to look to another and a better world; to keep the eye on heaven, and to contemplate by faith the things which were unseen and eternal, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:18">2 Corinthians 4:18</span>. These things supported them; and thus upheld, they went cheerfully to their great work, and met with calmness and joy all the trials which it involved.</p>
