James the brother of John had been put to death <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>; and it is probable also that some other of the apostles had been also. This verse is merely explanatory of the previous verse.</p>

This shows what is meant in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>, by bearing about in the body the dying the Lord Jesus; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span>.</p>
