<p style=" "><b>Knowing - </b>Being fully confident; having the most entire assurance. It was the assured hope of the resurrection which sustained them in all their trials. This expression denotes the full and unwavering belief, in the minds of the apostles, that the doctrines which they preached were true. They knew that they were revealed from heaven, and that all the promises of God would be fulfilled.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall raise up us also - </b>All Christians. In the hope of the resurrection they were ready to meet trials, and even to die. Sustained by this assurance, the apostles went forth amidst persecutions and opposition, for they knew that their trials would soon end, and that they would be raised up in the morning of the resurrection, to a world of eternal glory.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By Jesus - </b>By the power or the agency of Jesus. Christ will raise up the dead from their graves, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25-29">John 5:25-29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And shall present us with you - </b>Will present us before the throne of glory with exceeding joy and honor. He will present us to God as those who have been redeemed by his blood. He will present us in the courts of heaven, before the throne of the eternal Father, as his ransomed people; as recovered from the ruins of the fall; as saved by the merits of his blood. They shall not only be raised up from the dead; but they shall be publicly and solemnly presented to God as his, as recovered to his service, and as having a title in the covenant of grace to the blessedness of heaven.</p>
