<p style=" ">The first verse of this chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:0">2 Corinthians 7:0</span> properly belongs to the previous chapter, and should have been attached to that. It is an exhortation made in view of the promises there referred to, to make every effort to obtain perfect purity, and to become entirely holy.</p>
<p style=" ">In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:2-3">2 Corinthians 7:2-3</span>, he entreats the Corinthians, in accordance with the wish which he had expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:13">2 Corinthians 6:13</span>, to receive him as a teacher and a spiritual father; as a faithful apostle of the Lord Jesus. To induce them to do this, he assures them that he had given them, at no time, any occasion of offence. He had injured no man; he had wronged no man. Possibly some might suppose that he had injured them by the sternness of his requirements in forbidding them to contract friendships and alliances with infidels; or in the case of discipline in regard to the incestuous person. But he assures them that all his commands had been the fruit of most tender love for them, and that he was ready to live and die with them.</p>
<p style=" ">The remainder of the chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4-15">2 Corinthians 7:4-15</span> is occupied mainly in stating the joy which he had at the evidence which they had given that they were ready to obey his commands. He says, therefore <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span>, that he was full of comfort and joy; and that in all his tribulation, the evidence of their obedience had given him great and unfeigned satisfaction. In order to show them the extent of his joy, he gives a pathetic description of the anxiety of mind which he had on the subject; his troubles in Macedonia, and particularly his distress on not meeting with Titus as he had expected, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:5">2 Corinthians 7:5</span>. But this distress had been relieved by his coming, and by the evidence which was furnished through him that they were ready to yield obedience to his commands, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6-7">2 Corinthians 7:6-7</span>. This joy was greatly increased by his hearing from Titus the effect which his former Epistle to them had produced, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8-13">2 Corinthians 7:8-13</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">He had felt deep anxiety in regard to that. He had even regretted, it would seem <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8">2 Corinthians 7:8</span>, that he had sent it. He had been deeply pained at the necessity of giving them pain, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8">2 Corinthians 7:8</span>. But the effect had been all that he had desired; and when he learned from Titus the effect which it had produced - the deep repentance which they had evinced, and the thorough reformation which had occurred <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:9-11">2 Corinthians 7:9-11</span>, he had great occasion to rejoice that he had sent the Epistle to them. This new and distinguished instance of their obedience had given him great joy, and confirmed him in the proof that they were truly attached to him. The apostle adds, in the conclusion of the chapter, that his joy was greatly increased by the joy which Titus manifested. and his entire satisfaction in the conduct of the Corinthians and the treatment which he had received from them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:13">2 Corinthians 7:13</span>, so that though he, Paul, had often had occasion to speak in the kindest terms of the Corinthians, all that he had ever said in their favor Titus had realized in his own case <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:14">2 Corinthians 7:14</span>, and the affection of Titus for them had been greatly increased by his visit to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:15">2 Corinthians 7:15</span>. The whole chapter, therefore, is eminently adapted to produce good feeling in the minds of the Corinthians toward the apostle, and to strengthen the bonds of their mutual attachment.</p>
