<p style=" "><b>Wherefore, though I wrote unto you ... - </b>In this verse Paul states the main reason why he had written to them on the subject. It was not principally on account of the man who had done the wrong, or of him who had been injured; but it was from tender anxiety for the whole church, and in order to show the deep interest which he had in their welfare.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not for his cause that had done the wrong - </b>Not mainly, or principally on account of the incestuous person; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>. It was not primarily with reference to him as an individual that I wrote, but from a regard to the whole church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor for his cause that suffered wrong - </b>Not merely that the wrong which he had suffered might be rectified, and that his rights might be restored, valuable and desirable as was that object. The offence was that a man had taken his fatherâ€™s wife as his own <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>, and the person injured, therefore, was his father. It is evident from this passage, I think, that the father was living at the time when Paul wrote this Epistle.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But that our care ... - </b>I wrote mainly that I might show the deep interest which I had in the church at large, and my anxiety that it might not suffer by the misconduct of any of its members. It is from a regard to the welfare of the whole earth that discipline should be administered, and not simply with reference to an individual who has done wrong, or an individual who is injured. In church discipline such private interests are absorbed in the general interest of the church at large.</p>
