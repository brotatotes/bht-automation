<p style=" "><b>Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry ... - </b>I have no pleasure in giving pain to anyone, or in witnessing the distress of any. When people are brought to repentance under the preaching of the gospel, the ministers of the gospel do not find pleasure in their grief as such. They are not desirous of making people unhappy by calling them to repentance, and they have no pleasure in the deep distress of mind which is often produced by their preaching, in itself considered. It is only because such sorrow is an indication of their return to God, and will be followed by happiness and by the fruits of good living, that they find any pleasure in it, or that they seek to produce it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But that ye sorrowed to repentance - </b>It was not mere grief; it was not sorrow producing melancholy, gloom, or despair; it was not sorrow which led you to be angry at him who had reproved you for your errors - as is sometimes the case with the sorrow that is produced by reproof; but it was sorrow that led to a change and reformation. It was sorrow that was followed by a putting away of the evil for the existence of which there had been occasion to reprove you. The word rendered here as “repentance” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετάνοιαν</span></span> metanoian) is a different word from that which, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8">2 Corinthians 7:8</span>, is rendered “I did repent,” and indicates a different state of mind. It properly means a change of mind or purpose; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:7">Hebrews 12:7</span>. It denotes a change for the better; a change of mind that is durable and productive in its consequences; a change which amounts to a permanent reformation; see Campbell’s Diss. ut supra. The sense here is, that it produced a change, a reformation. It was such sorrow for their sin as to lead them to reform and to put away the evils which had existed among them. It was this fact, and not that they had been made sorry, that led Paul to rejoice.</p>
<p style=" "><b>After a godly manner - </b>Margin, “according to God;” see the note on the next verse.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye might receive damage by us in nothing - </b>The Greek word rendered “receive damage” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζημιωθῆτε</span></span> zēmiōthēte) means properly to bring loss upon anyone; to receive loss or detriment; see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span>. The sense here seems to be, “So that on the whole no real injury was done you in any respect by me. You were indeed put to pain and grief by my reproof. You sorrowed. But it has done you no injury on the whole. It has been a benefit to you. If you had not reformed, if you had been pained without putting away the sins for which the reproof was administered, if it had been mere grief without any proper fruit, you might have said that you would have suffered a loss of happiness, or you might have given me occasion to inflict severer discipline. But now you are gainers in happiness by all the sorrow which I have caused.” Sinners are gainers in happiness in the end by all the pain of repentance produced by the preaching of the gospel. No man suffers loss by being told of his faults if he repents; and people are under the highest obligations to those faithful ministers and other friends who tell them of their errors, and who are the means of bringing them to true repentance.</p>
