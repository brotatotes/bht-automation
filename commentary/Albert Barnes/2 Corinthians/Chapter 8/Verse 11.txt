<p style=" "><b>As there was a readiness to will - </b>Now accomplish the thing, and be not satisfied with having begun it. Do not suppose that the intention was sufficient, or that you are now released from the obligation. A year indeed has elapsed; but the necessity of the aid for the poor has not ceased. The sentiment here is, that if we have felt it our duty to aid in a cause of benevolence, and have commenced it, and have then been interrupted in executing our purpose, we should seize the first favorable opportunity to accomplish what we had designed. We should not regard ourselves as released from our obligation, but should, from a regard to consistency and our obligation to God, accomplish what we had intended.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Out of that which ye have - </b>According to your ability; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:12">2 Corinthians 8:12</span>. It should be in proportion to your means.</p>
