<p style=" "><b>For I mean not that other men be eased ... - </b>I do not intend that others should be eased in order to relieve you. Literally, “Not that there should be rest (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄνεσις</span></span> anesis, a letting loose; remission, relaxation) to others, but affliction (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλίψις</span></span> thlipsis) to you.” Probably the Corinthians were able to contribute more than many other churches, certainly more than the churches of Macedonia <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>, and Paul therefore presses upon them the duty of giving according to their means, yet he by no means intended that the entire burden should come on them.</p>
