<p style=" "><b>For indeed he accepted the exhortation - </b>He cheerfully complied with the exhortation which I gave him, to wit, to visit you, and excite you to this good work.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But being more forward - </b>More disposed to do this than I had supposed. The idea here is, that he was very ready to engage in this; he was more ready to engage in it than Paul was to exhort him to it; he anticipated his request; he had already resolved to engage in it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of his own accord he went ... - </b>He went voluntarily and without urging. The ground of Paulâ€™s thankfulness here seems to have been this, He apprehended probably some difficulty in obtaining the collection there, He was acquainted with the distracted state of the church, and feared that Titus might have some reluctance to engage in the service. He was therefore very agreeably surprised when he learned that Titus was willing to make another journey to Corinth and to endeavor to complete the collection.</p>
