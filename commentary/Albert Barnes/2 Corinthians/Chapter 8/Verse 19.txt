<p style=" "><b>And not that only - </b>Not only is he esteemed on account of other services which he has rendered by his preaching and writings; but he has had a new mark of the confidence of the churches in being appointed to convey the collection to Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Chosen of the churches - </b>Chosen by the churches. Many concurred in the choice, showing that they had entire confidence in him. Paul had been unwilling to have charge of this contribution alone (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3-4">1 Corinthians 16:3-4</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:20">2 Corinthians 8:20</span>), and he had procured the appointment of some one to undertake it. Probably he expected that the church at Corinth would concur in this appointment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With this grace - </b>Margin, “Gift;” see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span>. The word here refers to the alms, or the collection which had been made.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is administered by us - </b>That is, which is undertaken by us. Paul had been the instrument of procuring it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the glory of the same Lord - </b>The Lord of us all. The design was to promote the glory of the Lord by showing the influence of religion in producing true benevolence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And declaration of your ready mind - </b>That is, to afford you an opportunity of evincing your readiness to do good to others, and to promote their welfare.</p>
