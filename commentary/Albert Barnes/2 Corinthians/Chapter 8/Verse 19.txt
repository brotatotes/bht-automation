Probably he expected that the church at Corinth would concur in this appointment.With this grace - Margin, “Gift;” see 2 Corinthians 8:1. The word here refers to the alms, or the collection which had been made.Which is administered by us - That is, which is undertaken by us. Paul had been the instrument of procuring it.To the glory of the same Lord - The Lord of us all.
