<p style=" "><b>And this they did ... - </b>They did not give what we expected only. We knew their poverty, and we expected only a small sum from them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not as we hoped - </b>Not according to the utmost of our hopes. We were greatly disappointed in the amount which they gave, and in the manner in which it was done.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But first gave their ownselves to the Lord - </b>They first made an entire consecration of themselves and all that they had to the Lord. They kept nothing back. They felt that all they had was his. And where a people honestly and truly devote themselves to God, they will find no difficulty in having the means to contribute to the cause of charity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And unto us by the will of God - </b>That is, they gave themselves to us to be directed in regard to the contribution to be made. They complied with our wishes and followed our directions. The phrase “by the will of God,” means evidently that God moved them to this, or that it was to be traced to his direction and providence. It is one of the instances in which Paul traces everything that is right and good to the agency and direction of God.</p>
