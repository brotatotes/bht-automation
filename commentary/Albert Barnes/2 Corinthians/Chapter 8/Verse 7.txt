Therefore as ye abound in everything - see the note, 1 Corinthians 1:5. Paul never hesitated to commend Christians where it could be done with truth; and the fact that they were eminent in some of the Christian duties and graces, he makes the ground of the exhortation that they would abound in all. From those who had so many eminent characteristics of true religion he had a right to expect much; and he therefore exhorts them to manifest a symmetry of Christian character.In faith - In the full belief of the truth and obligation of the gospel.And utterance - In the ability to instruct others; perhaps referring to their power of speaking foreign languages; 1 Corinthians 14:0.And knowledge - The knowledge of God, and of his truth.And in all diligence - Diligence or readiness in the discharge of every duty. Of this, Paul had full evidence in their readiness to comply with his commands in the case of discipline to which so frequent reference is made in this Epistle.And in your love to us - Manifested by the readiness with which you received our commands; see 2 Corinthians 7:4, 2 Corinthians 7:6-7, 2 Corinthians 7:11, 2 Corinthians 7:16.See that ye abound in this grace also - The idea here is, that eminence in spiritual endowments of any kind, or in any of the traits of the Christian character should lead to great benevolence, and that the character is not complete unless benevolence be manifested toward every good object that may be presented.
