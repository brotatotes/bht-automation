<p style=" "><b>Being enriched in everything ... - </b>In all respects your riches are conferred on you for this purpose. The design of the apostle is to state to them the true reason why wealth was bestowed. It was not for the purposes of luxury and self-gratification; not to be spent in sensual enjoyment, not for parade and display; it was that it might be distributed to others in such a way as to cause thanksgiving to God. At the same time, this implies the expression of an earnest wish on the part of Paul. He did not desire that they should be rich for their own gratification or pleasure; he desired it only as the means of their doing good to others. Right feeling will desire property only as the means of promoting happiness and producing thanksgiving to God. They who truly love their children and friends will wish them to be successful in acquiring wealth only that they may have the means and the disposition to alleviate misery, and promote the happiness of all around them. No one who has true benevolence will desire that anyone in whom he feels an interest should be enriched for the purpose of living amidst luxury, and encompassing himself with the indulgences which wealth can furnish. If a man has not a disposition to do good with money, it is not true benevolence to desire that he may not possess it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To all bountifulness - </b>Margin, Simplicity, or liberality. The word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἁπλότης</span></span> haplotēs) means properly sincerity, candor, probity; then also simplicity, frankness, fidelity, and especially as manifesting itself in liberality; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>. Here it evidently means “liberality,” and the idea is, that property is given for this purpose, in order that there may be liberality evinced in doing good to others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which causeth through us ... - </b>That is, we shall so distribute your alms as to cause thanksgiving to God. The result will be that by our instrumentality, thanks will be given to the great Source and Giver of all wealth. Property should always be so employed as to produce thanksgiving. If it is made to contribute to our own support and the support of our families, it should excite thanksgiving. If it is given to others, it should be so given, if it is possible, that the recipient should be more grateful to God than to us; should feel that though we may be the honored instrument in distributing it, yet the true benefactor is God.</p>
