<p style=" "><b>And by their prayer for you - </b>On the grammatical construction of this difficult verse, Doddridge and Bloomfield may be consulted. It is probably to be taken in connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:13">2 Corinthians 9:13</span> is a parenthesis. Thus interpreted, the sense will be, “The administration of this service <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span> will produce abundant thanks to God. It will also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:14">2 Corinthians 9:14</span> produce another effect. It will tend to excite the prayers of the saints for you, and thus produce important benefits to yourselves. They will earnestly desire your welfare, they will anxiously pray to be united in Christian friendship with those who have been so signally endowed with the grace of God.” The sentiment is, that charity should be shown to poor and afflicted Christians because it will lead them to pray for us and to desire our welfare. The prayers of the poorest Christian for us are worth more than all we usually bestow on them in charity; and he who has secured the pleadings of a child of God, however humble, in his behalf, has made a good use of his money.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which long after you - </b>Who earnestly desire to see and know you. Who will sincerely desire your welfare, and who will thus be led to pray for you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the exceeding grace of God in you - </b>On account of the favor which God has shown to you: the strength and power of the Christian principle, manifesting itself in doing good to those whom you have never seen. The apostle supposes that the exercise of a charitable disposition is to be traced entirely to God. God is the author of all grace; he alone excites in us a disposition to do good to others.</p>
