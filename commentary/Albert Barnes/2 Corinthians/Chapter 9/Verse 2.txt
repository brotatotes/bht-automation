<p style=" "><b>For I know the forwardness of your mind - </b>I know your promptitude, or your readiness to do it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:10">2 Corinthians 8:10</span>. Probably Paul here means that he had had opportunity before of witnessing their readiness to do good, and that he had learned in particular of Titus that they had formed the plan to aid in this contribution.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For which I boast of you to them of Macedonia - </b>To the church in Macedonia; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span>. So well assured was he that the church at Corinth would make the collection as it had proposed, that he boasted of it to the churches of Macedonia as if it were already done, and made use of this as an argument to stimulate them to make an effort.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That Achaia was ready a year ago - </b>Achaia was that part of Greece of which Corinth was the capital; see the note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span>. It is probable that there were Christians in other parts of Achaia besides Corinth, and indeed it is known that there was a church in Cenchrea (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>). which was one of the ports of Corinth. Though the contribution would be chiefly derived from Corinth, yet it is probable that the others also would participate in it. The phrase “was ready” means that they had been preparing themselves for this collection, and doubtless Paul had stated that the collection was already made and was waiting. He had directed them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1">1 Corinthians 16:1</span> to make it on the first day of the week, and to lay it by in store, and he did not doubt that they had complied with his request.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And your zeal - </b>Your ardor and promptitude. The readiness with which you entered into this subject, and your desire to relieve the needs of others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath provoked - </b>Has roused, excited, impelled to give. We use the word “provoke” commonly now in the sense of to irritate, but in the Scriptures it is confined to the signification of exciting, or rousing. The ardor of the Corinthians would excite others not only by their promptitude, but because Corinth was a splendid city, and their example would be looked up to by Christians at a distance. This is one instance of the effect which will be produced by the example of a church in a city.</p>
