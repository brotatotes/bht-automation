<p style=" "><b>Therefore I thought it necessary ... - </b>In order to secure the collection, and to avoid all unpleasant feeling on all hands.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That they would go before unto you - </b>Before I should come.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And make up beforehand your bounty - </b>Prepare it before I come. The word “bounty” is in the margin, rendered “blessing.” The Greek (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εὐλογία</span></span> eulogia) means properly commendation, eulogy. Then it means blessing, praise applied to God. Then that which blesses - a gift, donation, favor, bounty - whether of God to human beings, or of one man to another. Here it refers to their contribution as that which would be adapted to confer a blessing on others, or suited to produce happiness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That the same might be ready as a matter of bounty - </b>That it may truly appear as a liberal and voluntary offering; as an act of generosity and not as wrung or extorted from you. That it may be truly a blessing - a thank-offering to God and adapted to do good to people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And not as of covetousness - </b>“And not like a sort of extortion, wrung from you by mere dint of importunity” - Doddridge. The word used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεονεξία</span></span> pleonexia) means usually covetousness, greediness of gain, which leads a person to defraud others. The idea here is, that Paul would have them give this as an act of bounty, or liberality on their part, and not as an act of covetousness on his part, not as extorted by him from them.</p>
