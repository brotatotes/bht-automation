<p style=" "><b>If there come any unto you - </b>Any professed teacher of religion. There can be no doubt that she to whom this Epistle was written was accustomed to entertain such teachers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And bring not this doctrine - </b>This doctrine which Christ taught, or the true doctrine respecting him and his religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Receive him not into your house - </b>This cannot mean that no acts of kindness, in any circumstances, were to be shown to such persons; but that there was to be nothing done which could be fairly construed as encouraging or countenancing them as “religious teachers.” The true rule would seem to be, in regard to such persons, that, so far as we have contact with them as neighbors, or strangers, we are to be honest, true, kind, and just, but we are to do nothing that will countenance them as religious teachers, We are not to aid their instruction, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+19:27">Proverbs 19:27</span>; we are not to receive them into our houses, or to entertain them as religious teachers; we are not to commend them to others, or to give them any reason to use our names or influence in propagating error. It would not be difficult to practice this rule, and yet to show to others all the kindness, and all the attention in circumstances of need, which religion demands. A person who is truly consistent is never suspected of countenancing error, even when he is distinguished for liberality, and is ready, like the good Samaritan, to pour in oil and wine in the wounds of any waylaid traveler. The command not to “receive such an one into the house,” in such circumstances as those referred to by John, would be probably understood literally, as he doubtless designed that it should be. To do that, to meet such persons with a friendly greeting, would be construed as countenancing their doctrine, and as commending them to others; and hence it was forbidden that they should be entertained as such. This treatment would not be demanded where no such interpretation could be put on receiving a friend or relative who held different and even erroneous views, or in showing kindness to a stranger who differed from us, but it would apply to the receiving and entertaining “a professed teacher of religion, as such;” and the rule is as applicable now as it was then.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither bid him God speed - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καὶ χαίρειν αὐτῷ μὴ λέγετε</span></span> Kai chairein autō mē legete - “and do not say to him, hail, or joy.” Do not wish him joy; do not hail, or salute him. The word used expresses the common form of salutation, as when we wish one health, success, prosperity, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:49">Matthew 26:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>. It would be understood as expressing a wish for success in the enterprise in which they were embarked; and, though we should love all people, and desire their welfare, and sincerely seek their happiness, yet we can properly wish no one success in career of sin and error.</p>
