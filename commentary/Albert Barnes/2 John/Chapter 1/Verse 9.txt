<p style=" "><b>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God - </b>In the doctrine which Christ taught, or the true doctrine respecting him. The language is somewhat ambiguous, like the phrase “the love of Christ,” which may mean either his love to us, or our love to him. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:9">John 15:9</span>. It is difficult to determine here which is the true sense - whether it means the doctrine or precepts which he taught, or the true doctrine respecting him. Macknight understands by it the doctrine taught by Christ and his apostles. It would seem most probable that this is the sense of the passage, but then it would include, of course, all that Christ taught respecting himself, as well as his other instructions. The essential idea is, that the truth must be held respecting the precepts, the character, and the work of the Saviour. Probably the immediate allusion here is to those to whom John so frequently referred as “antichrist,” who denied that Jesus had come in the flesh, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>. At the same time, however, he makes the remark general, that if anyone did not hold the true doctrine respecting the Saviour, he had no real knowledge of God.

<p style=" "><b>Hath not God - </b>Has no true knowledge of God. The truth taught here is, that it is essential for piety to hold the true doctrine respecting Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ - </b>In the true doctrine respecting Christ, or in the doctrine which he taught.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He hath both the Father and the Son - </b>There is such an intimate union between the Father and the Son, that he who has just views of the one has also of the other.
