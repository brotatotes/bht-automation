<p style=" ">This chapter comprises the following subjects:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. The usual salutations,<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1-2">2 Peter 1:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1-2">2 Peter 1:1-2</span></span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. A statement that all the mercies which they enjoyed pertaining to life and godliness, had been conferred by the power of God, and that he had given them exceeding great and precious promises, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3-4">2 Peter 1:3-4</span>. It was mainly with reference to these “promises” that the epistle was written, for they had been assailed by the advocates of error, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:0">2 Peter 2:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:0">2 Peter 3:0</span> and it was important that Christians should see that they had the promise of a future life. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:5-14">2 Peter 3:5-14</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. An exhortation to abound in Christian virtues; to go on making constant attainments in knowledge, and temperance, and patience, and godliness, I and brotherly kindness, and charity, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5-9">2 Peter 1:5-9</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. An exhortation to endeavor to make their calling and election sure, that so an entrance might be ministered unto them abundantly into the kingdom of the Redeemer, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10-11">2 Peter 1:10-11</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> V. The apostle says that he will endeavor to keep these things before their minds, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:12-15">2 Peter 1:12-15</span>. He knew well that they were then established in the truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:12">2 Peter 1:12</span> but he evidently felt that they were in danger of being shaken in the faith by the seductive influence of error, and he says therefore, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:13">2 Peter 1:13</span> that it was proper, as long as he remained on earth, to endeavor to excite in their minds a lively remembrance of the truths which they had believed; that the opportunity for his doing this must soon cease, as the period was approaching when he must be removed to eternity, in accordance with the prediction of the Saviour <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:14">2 Peter 1:14</span>, but that he would endeavor to make so permanent a record of his views on these important subjects that they might always have them in remembrance, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:15">2 Peter 1:15</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> VI. A solemn statement that the doctrines which had been taught them, and which they had embraced, were not cunningly-devised fables, but were true, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16-21">2 Peter 1:16-21</span>. In support of this the apostle appeals to the following things:</p>
<p style=" ">The general object, therefore, of this chapter is to affirm the truth of the great facts of religion, on which their hopes were based, and thus to prepare the way to combat the errors by which these truths were assailed. He first assures them that the doctrines which they held were true, and then, in 2 Pet. 2–3, meets the errors by which they were assailed.</p>
