<p style=" "><b>Simon Peter - </b>Margin, “Symeon.” The name is written either “Simon” or “Simeon” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σίμων</span></span> Simōn or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συμεών</span></span> Sumeōn. Either word properly means “hearing;” and perhaps, like other names, was at first significant. The first epistle <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> begins simply, “Peter, an apostle,” etc. The name Simon, however, was, his proper name - “Peter,” or “Cephas,” having been added to it by the Saviour, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ - </b>In the first epistle the word “apostle” only is used. Paul, however, uses the word “servant” as applicable to himself in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>, and to himself and Timothy in the commencement of the epistle to the Philippians, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To them that have obtained like precious faith with us - </b>With us who are of Jewish origin. This epistle was evidently written to the same persons as the former (Introduction, Section 3), and that was intended to embrace many who were of Gentile origin. Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>. The apostle addresses them all now, whatever was their origin, as heirs of the common faith, and as in all respects brethren.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the righteousness of God - </b>Through the method of justification which God has adopted. See this fully explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(The original is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν δικαιοσυνη</span></span> en dikaiosunē, in the righteousness, etc., which makes the righteousness the object of faith. We cannot but regard the author’s rendering of the famous phrase here used by Peter, and by Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span>, as singularly unhappy. That Newcome used it and the Socinian version adopted it, would not make us reject it; but when the apostles state specially the ground of justification, why should they be made to speak indefinitely of its general “plan,” or method. The rendering of Stuart, namely, “justification of God,” is not more successful; it confounds the “thing itself” with the “ground” of it. Why not prefer the apostle’s own words to any change or periphrasis? See the supplementary note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>).</p>
<p style=" "><b>God and our Saviour Jesus Christ - </b>Margin, “our God and Saviour.” The Greek will undoubtedly bear the construction given in the margin; and if this be the true rendering, it furnishes an argument for the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ. Middleton, Slade, Valpy, Bloomfield, and others, contend that this is the true and proper rendering. It is doubted, however, by Wetstein, Grotius, and others. Erasmus supposes that it may be taken in either sense. The construction, though certainly not a violation of the laws of the Greek language, is not so free from all doubt as to make it proper to use the passage as a proof-text in an argument for the divinity of the Saviour. It is easier to prove the doctrine from other texts that are plain, than to show that this must be the meaning here.</p>
