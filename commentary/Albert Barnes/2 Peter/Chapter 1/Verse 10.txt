<p style=" "><b>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>. “In view of these things, give the greater diligence to secure your salvation.” The considerations on which Peter based this appeal seem to have been the fact that such promises are made to us, and such hopes held out before us; the degree of uncertainty thrown over the whole matter of our personal salvation by low attainments in the divine life, and the dreadful condemnation which will ensue if in the end it shall be found that we are destitute of all real piety. The general thought is, that religion is of sufficient importance to claim our highest diligence, and to arouse us to the most earnest efforts to obtain the assurance of salvation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To make your calling and election sure - </b>On the meaning of the word “calling,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>. On the meaning of the word “election,” see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:4">1 Thessalonians 1:4</span> note. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>. The word rendered “election” here, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐκλογήν</span></span> eklogēn,) occurs only in this place and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:5">Romans 11:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span>,<span class="_0000ff"><u>Rom 11:28</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:4">1 Thessalonians 1:4</span>; though corresponding words from the same root denoting “the elect, to elect, to choose,” frequently occur. The word here used means “election,” referring to the act of God, by which those who are saved are “chosen” to eternal life. As the word “calling” must refer to the act of God, so the word “election” must; for it is God who both “calls” and “chooses” those who shall be saved. The word in the Scriptures usually refers to the actual choosing of those who shall be saved; that is, referring to the time when they, in fact, become the children of God, rather than to the purpose of God that it shall be done; but still there must have been an eternal purpose, for God makes no choice which he did not always intend to make.</p>
<p style=" ">The word “sure,” means firm, steadfast, secure, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαίαν</span></span> bebaian.) Here the reference must be to “themselves;” that is, they were so to act as to make it certain to themselves that they had been chosen, and were truly called into the kingdom of God. It cannot refer to God, for no act of theirs could make it more certain on his part, if they had been actually chosen to eternal life. Still, God everywhere treats men as moral agents; and what may be absolutely certain in his mind from the mere purpose that it “shall” be so, is to be made certain to us only by evidence, and in the free exercise of our own powers. The meaning here is, that they were to obtain such evidences of personal piety as to put the question whether they were “called” and “chosen,” so far as their own minds were concerned, to rest; or so as to have undoubted evidence on this point. The Syriac, the Vulgate, and some Greek manuscripts, insert here the expression “by your good works;” that is, they were to make their calling sure “by” their good works, or by holy living.</p>
<p style=" ">This clause, as Calvin remarks, is not authorized by the best authority, but it does not materially affect the sense. It was undoubtedly by their “good works” in the sense of holy living, or of lives consecrated to the service of God, that they were to obtain the evidence that they were true Christians; that is, that they had been really called into the kingdom of God, for there is nothing else on which we can depend for such evidence. God has given no assurance to us by name that he intends to save us. We can rely on no voice, or vision, or new revelation, to prove that it is so. No internal feeling of itself, no raptures, no animal excitement, no confident persuasion in our own minds that we are elected, can be proof in the case; and the only certain evidence on which we can rely is that which is found in a life of sincere piety. In view of the important statement of Peter in this verse, then, we may remark:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That he believed in the doctrine of election, for he uses language which obviously implies this, or such as they are accustomed to use who believe the doctrine.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The fact that God has chosen those who shall be saved, does not make our own efforts unnecessary to make that salvation sure to us. It can be made sure to our own minds only by our own exertions; by obtaining evidence that we are in fact the children of God. There can be no evidence that salvation will be ours, unless there is a holy life; that is, unless there is true religion. Whatever may be the secret purpose of God in regard to us, the only evidence that we have that we shall be saved is to be found in the fact that we are sincere Christians, and are honestly endeavoring to do his will.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) It is possible to make our calling and election sure; that is, to have such evidence on the subject that the mind shall be calm, and that there will be no danger of deception. If we can determine the point that we are in fact true Christians, that settles the matter - for then the unfailing promise of God meets us that we shall be saved. In making our salvation sure to our own minds, if we are in fact true Christians, we have not to go into an argument to prove that we have sufficient strength to resist temptation, of that we shall be able in any way to keep ourselves. All that matter is settled by the promise of God, that if we are Christians we shall be kept by Him to salvation. The only question that is to be settled is, whether we are in fact true Christians, and all beyond that may be regarded as determined immutably. But assuredly it is possible for a man to determine the question whether he is or is not a true Christian.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) If it can be done, it should be. Nothing is more important for us to do than this; and to this great inquiry we should apply our minds with unfaltering diligence, until by the grace of God we can say that there are no lingering doubts n regard to our final salvation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For if ye do these things - </b>The things referred to in the previous verses. If you use all diligence to make as high attainments as possible in piety, and it you practice the virtues demanded by religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5-7">2 Peter 1:5-7</span>.</p>
