<p style=" "><b>For so an entrance - </b>In this manner you shall be admitted into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be ministered unto you - </b>The same Greek word is here used which occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>, and which is there rendered “add.” See the notes at that verse. There was not improbably in the mind of the apostle a recollection of that word; and the sense may be, that “if they would lead on the virtues and graces referred to in their beautiful order, those graces would attend them in a radiant train to the mansions of immortal glory and blessedness.” See Doddridge in loc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Abundantly - </b>Greek, “richly.” That is, the most ample entrance would be furnished; there would be no doubt about their admission there. The gates of glory would be thrown wide open, and they, adorned with all the bright train of graces, would be admitted there.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into the everlasting kingdom ... - </b>Heaven. It is here called “everlasting,” not because the Lord Jesus shall preside over it as the Mediator (compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>), but because, in the form which shall be established when “he shall have given it up to the Father,” it will endure forever, The empire of God which the Redeemer shall set up over the souls of his people shall endure to all eternity. The object of the plan of redemption was to secure their allegiance to God, and that will never terminate.</p>
