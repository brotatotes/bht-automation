<p style=" "><b>Yea, I think it meet - </b>I think it becomes me as an apostle. It is my appropriate duty; a duty which is felt the more as the close of life draws near.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As long as I am in this tabernacle - </b>As long as I live; as long as I am in the body. The body is called a tabernacle, or tent, as that in which the soul resides for a little time. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To stir you up, by putting you in remembrance - </b>To excite or arouse you to a diligent performance of your duties; to keep up in your minds a lively sense of Divine things. Religion becomes more important to a manâ€™s mind always as he draws near the close of life, and feels that he is soon to enter the eternal world.</p>
