<p style=" "><b>Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle - </b>That I must die. This he knew, probably, because he was growing old, and was reaching the outer period of human life. It does not appear that he had any express revelation on the point.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18-19">John 21:18-19</span>. This does not mean that he had any new revelation on the subject, showing him that he was soon to die, as many of the ancients supposed; but the idea is, that the time drew near when he was to die “in the manner” in which the Saviour had told him that he would. He had said <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span> that this would occur when he should be “old,” and as he was now becoming old, he felt that the predicted event was drawing near. Many years had now elapsed since this remarkable prophecy was uttered. It would seem that Peter had never doubted the truth of it, and during all that time he had had before him the distinct assurance that he must die by violence; by having “his hands stretched forth;” and by being conveyed by force to some place of death to which he would not of himself go <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span>, but, though the prospect of such a death must have been painful, he never turned away from it; never sought to abandon his Master’s cause; and never doubted that it would be so.</p>
<p style=" ">This is one of the few instances that have occurred in the world, where a man knew distinctly, long beforehand, what would be the manner of his own death, and where he could have it constantly in his eye. we cannot foresee this in regard to ourselves, but we may learn to feel that death is not far distant, and may accustom ourselves to think upon it in whatever manner it may come upon us, as Peter did, and endeavor to prepare for it. Peter would naturally seek to prepare himself for death in the particular form in which he knew it would occur to him; we should prepare for it in whatever way it may occur to us. The subject of crucifixion would be one of special interest to him; to us death itself should be the subject of unusual interest - the manner is to be left to God. Whatever may be the signs of its approach, whether sickness or grey hairs, we should meditate much upon an event so solemn to us; and as these indications thicken we should be more diligent, as Peter was, in doing the work that God has given us to do. Our days, like the fabled Sybil’s leaves, become more valuable as they are diminished in number; and as the inevitable hour draws nearer to us, we should labor more diligently in our Master’s cause, gird our loins more closely, and trim our lamps. Peter thought of the cross, for it was such a death that he was led to anticipate. Let us think of the bed of languishing on which we may die, or of the blow that may strike us suddenly down in the midst of our way, calling us without a moment’s warning into the presence of our Judge.</p>
