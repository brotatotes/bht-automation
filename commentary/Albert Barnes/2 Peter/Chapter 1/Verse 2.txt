<p style=" "><b>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord - </b>That is, grace and peace abound to us, or may be expected to be conferred on us abundantly, if we have a true knowledge of God and of the Saviour. Such a knowledge constitutes true religion: for in that we find “grace” - the grace that pardons and sanctifies; and “peace” - peace of conscience, reconciliation with God, and calmness in the trials of life.
