<p style=" "><b>According as his divine power hath given unto us - </b>All the effects of the gospel on the human heart are, in the Scriptures, traced to the power of God. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>. There are no moral means which have ever been used that have such power as the gospel; none through which God has done so much in changing the character and affecting the destiny of man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All things that pertain unto life and godliness - </b>The reference here in the word “life” is undoubtedly to the life of religion; the life of the soul imparted by the gospel. The word “godliness” is synonymous with piety. The phrase “according as” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὡς</span></span> hōs) seems to be connected with the sentence in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>, “Forasmuch as he has conferred on us these privileges and promises connected with life and godliness, we are bound, in order to obtain all that is implied in these things, to give all diligence to add to our faith, knowledge,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the knowledge of him - </b>By a proper acquaintance with him, or by the right kind of knowledge of him. Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That hath called us to glory and virtue - </b>Margin: “by.” Greek, “through glory,” etc. Doddridge supposes that it means that he has done this “by the strengthening virtue and energy of his spirit.” Rosenmuller renders it, “by glorious benignity.” Dr. Robinson (Lexicon) renders it, “through a glorious display of his efficiency.” The objection which anyone feels to this rendering arises solely from the word “virtue,” from the fact that we are not accustomed to apply that word to God. But the original word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀρετή</span></span> aretē) is not as limited in its signification as the English word is, but is rather a word which denotes a good quality or excellence of any kind. In the ancient classics it is used to denote manliness, vigor, courage, valor, fortitude; and the word would rather denote “energy” or “power” of some kind, than what we commonly understand by virtue, and would be, therefore, properly applied to the “energy” or “efficiency” which God has displayed in the work of our salvation. Indeed, when applied to moral excellence at all, as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>, of this chapter, and often elsewhere, it is perhaps with a reference to the “energy, boldness, vigor,” or “courage” which is evinced in overcoming our evil propensities, and resisting allurements and temptations. According to this interpretation, the passage teaches that it is “by a glorious Divine efficiency” that we are called into the kingdom of God.</p>
