<p style=" "><b>But chiefly - </b>That is, it may be presumed that the principles just laid down would be applicable in an eminent degree to such persons as he proceeds to designate.</p>

<p style=" "><b>And despise government - </b>Margin: “dominion.” That is, they regard all government in the state, the church, and the family, as an evil. Advocates for unbridled freedom of all sorts; declaimers on liberty and on the evils of oppression; defenders of what they regard as the rights of injured man, and yet secretly themselves lusting for the exercise of the very power which they would deny to others - they make no just distinctions about what constitutes true freedom, and in their zeal array themselves against government in all forms. No topic of declamation would be more popular than this, and from none would they hope to secure more followers; for if they could succeed in removing all respect for the just restraints of law, the way would be open for the accomplishment of their own purposes, in setting up a dominion ever the minds of others. It is a common result of such views, that men of this description become impatient of the government of God himself, and seek to throw off all authority, and to live in the unrestrained indulgence of their vicious propensities.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Presumptuous are they - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τολμηταὶ</span></span> Tolmētai - daring, bold, audacious, presumptuous men.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Self-willed - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αὐθάδεις</span></span> authadeis. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They are not afraid to speak evil of dignities - </b>The word rendered “dignities” here, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δόξας</span></span> doxas,) means properly honor, glory, splendor; then that which is fitted to inspire respect; that which is dignified or exalted. It is applied here to men of exalted rank; and the meaning is, that they did not regard rank, or station, or office - thus violating the plainest rules of propriety and of religion. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:4-5">Acts 23:4-5</span>. Jude, between whose language and that of Peter in this chapter there is a remarkable resemblance, has expressed this more fully. He says, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:8">2 Peter 2:8</span>, “These filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.” It is one of the effects of religion to produce respect for superiors; but when men are self-willed, and when they purpose to give indulgence to corrupt propensities, it is natural for them to dislike all government. Accordingly, it is by no means an unfrequent effect of certain forms of error to lead men to speak disrespectfully of those in authority, and to attempt to throw off all the restraints of law. It is a very certain indication that men hold wrong opinions when they show disrespect to those in authority, and despise the restraints of law.</p>
