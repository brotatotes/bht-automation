<p style=" "><b>Which have forsaken the right way - </b>The straight path of honesty and integrity. Religion is often represented as a straight path, and to do wrong is to go out of that path in a crooked way.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:5">Numbers 22:5</span>, following. In the Book of Numbers, Balaam is called the son of “Beor.” Perhaps the name Beor was corrupted into Bosor; or, as Rosenmuller suggests, the father of Balaam may have had two names. Schleusner (Lexicon) supposes that it was changed by the Greeks because it was more easily pronounced. The Septuagint, however, reads it as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βεὼρ</span></span> <i>Beōr</i> - “Beor.” The meaning here is, that they IMitAted Balaam. The particular point to which Peter refers in which they imitated him, seems to have been the love of gain, or covetousness. Possibly, however, he might have designed to refer to a more general resemblance, for in fact they imitated him in the following things:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)In being professed religious teachers, or the servants of God;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)In their covetousness;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)In inducing others to sin, referring to the same kind of sins in both cases.</p>
<p style=" ">Balaam counselled the Moabites to entice the children of Israel to illicit connection with their women, thus introducing licentiousness into the camp of the Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:16">Numbers 31:16</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:1-9">Numbers 25:1-9</span>); and in like manner these teachers led others into licentiousness, thus corrupting the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who loved the wages of unrighteousness - </b>Who was supremely influenced by the love of gain, and was capable of being employed, for a price, in a wicked design; thus prostituting his high office, as a professed prophet of the Most High, to base and ignoble ends. That Balaam, though he professed to be influenced by a supreme regard to the will of God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:18">Numbers 22:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:38">Numbers 22:38</span>, was really influenced by the desire of reward, and was willing to prostitute his great office to secure such a reward, there can be no doubt.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) The elders of Moab and of Midian came to Balaam with “the rewards of divination in their hand” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:7">Numbers 22:7</span>, and with promises from Balak of promoting him to great honor, if he would curse the children of Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:17">Numbers 22:17</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) Balaam was disposed to go with them, and was restrained from going at once only by a direct and solemn prohibition from the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:11">Numbers 22:11</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) Notwithstanding this solemn prohibition, and not with standing he said to the ambassadors from Balak that he would do only as God directed, though Balak should give him his house full of silver and gold, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:18">Numbers 22:18</span>, yet he did not regard the matter as settled, but proposed to them that they should wait another night, with the hope that the Lord would give a more favourable direction in reference to their request, thus showing that his heart was in the service which they required, and that his inclination was to avail himself of their offer, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:19">Numbers 22:19</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4) When he did obtain permission to go, it was only to say that which the Lord should direct him to say, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:20">Numbers 22:20</span>; but he went with a perverse heart, with a secret wish to comply with the desire of Balak, and with a knowledge that he was doing wrong, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:34">Numbers 22:34</span>, and was restrained from uttering the curse which Balak desired only by an influence from above which he could not control. Balaam was undoubtedly a wicked man, and was constrained by a power from on high to utter sentiments which God meant should be uttered, but which Balaam would never have expressed of his own accord.</p>
