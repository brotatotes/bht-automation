<p style=" "><b>These are wells without water - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:12-13">Jude 1:12-13</span> employs several other epithets to describe the same class of persons. The language employed both by Peter and Jude is singularly terse, pointed, and emphatic. Nothing to an oriental mind would be more expressive than to say of professed religious teachers, that they were “wells without water.” It was always a sad disappointment to a traveler in the hot sands of the desert to come to a well where it was expected that water might be found, and to find it dry. It only aggravated the trials of the thirsty and weary traveler. Such were these religious teachers. In a world, not unaptly compared, in regard to its real comforts, to the wastes and sands of the desert, they would only grievously disappoint the expectations of all those who were seeking for the refreshing influences of the truths of the gospel. There are many such teachers in the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Clouds that are carried with a tempest - </b>Clouds that are driven about by the wind, and that send down no rain upon the earth. They promise rain, only to be followed by disappointment. Substantially the same idea is conveyed by this as by the previous phrase. “The Arabs compare persons who put on the appearance of virtue, when yet they are destitute of all goodness, to a light cloud which makes a show of rain, and afterward vanishes” - Benson. The sense is this: The cloud, as it rises, promises rain. The expectation of the farmer is excited that the thirsty earth is to be refreshed with needful showers. Instead of this, however, the wind “gets into” the cloud; it is driven about, and no rain falls, or it ends in a destructive tornado which sweeps everything before it. So of these religious teachers. Instruction in regard to the way of salvation was expected from them; but, instead of that, they disappointed the expectations of those who were desirous of knowing the way of life, and their doctrines only tended to destroy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever - </b>The word rendered “mist” here, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζόφος</span></span> zophos,) means properly muskiness, thick gloom, darkness, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>); and the phrase “mist of darkness” is designed to denote “intense” darkness, or the thickest darkness. It refers undoubtedly to the place of future punishment, which is often represented as a place of intense darkness. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:12">Matthew 8:12</span>. When it is said that this is “reserved” for them, it means that it is prepared for them, or is kept in a state of readiness to receive them. It is like a jail or penitentiary which is built in anticipation that there will be criminals, and with the expectation that there will be a need for it. So God has constructed the great prison-house of the universe, the world where the wicked are to dwell, with the knowledge that there would be occasion for it; and so he keeps it from age to age that it may be ready to receive the wicked when the sentence of condemnation shall be passed upon them. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>. The word “forever” is a word which denotes properly eternity, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς αἰώνα</span></span> eis aiōna,) and is such a word as could not have been used if it had been meant that they would not suffer forever.
