This will agree well with the account elsewhere given of these teachers, that their doctrines tended to licentiousness, 2 Peter 2:10, 2 Peter 2:14, 2 Peter 2:18-19. It is a very remarkable circumstance, that those who have denied the essential doctrines of the gospel have been so frequently licentious in their own conduct, and have inculcated opinions which tended to licentiousness. Many of the forms of religious error have somehow had a connection with this vice. People who are corrupt at heart often seek to obtain the sanction of religion for their corruptions.By reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of -   (1)Because they were professors of religion, and religion would seem to be held responsible for their conduct; and, (2)Because they were professed teachers of religion, and, by many, would be understood as expounding the true doctrines of the gospel.
