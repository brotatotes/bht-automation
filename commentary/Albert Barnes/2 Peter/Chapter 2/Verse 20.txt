<p style=" "><b>For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world - </b>This does not necessarily mean that they had been true Christians, and had fallen from grace. People may outwardly reform, and escape from the open corruptions which prevail around them, or which they had themselves practiced, and still have no true grace at heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesses Christ - </b>Neither does This imply that they were true Christians, or that they had ever had any saving knowledge of the Redeemer. There is a knowledge of the doctrines and duties of religion which may lead sinners to abandon their outward vices, which has no connection with saving grace. They may profess religion, and may Know enough of religion to understand that it requires them to abandon their vicious habits, and still never be true Christians.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They are again entangled therein and overcome - </b>The word rendered “entangled,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐμπλέκω</span></span> emplekō,) from which is derived our word “implicate,” means to braid in, to interweave; then to involve in, to entangle. It means here that they become implicated in those vices like an animal that is entangled in a net.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The latter end is worse with them than the beginning - </b>This is usually the case. Apostates become worse than they were before their professed conversion. “Reformed” drunkards, if they go back to their “cups” again, become more abandoned than ever. Thus, it is with those who have been addicted to any habits of vice, and who profess to become religious, and then fall away. The “reasons” for this may be:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That God gives them up to indulgence with fewer restraints than formerly; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Their old companions in sin may be at special pains to court their society, and to lead them into temptation, in order to obtain a triumph over virtue and religion.</p>
