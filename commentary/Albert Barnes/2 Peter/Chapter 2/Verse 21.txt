For it had been better for them ... - Compare the notes at Matthew 26:24. It would have been better for them, for: (1)Then they would not have dishonored the cause of religion as they have now done; (2)They would not have sunk so deep in profligacy as they now have; and, (3)They would not have incurred so aggravated a condemnation in the world of woe. If people are resolved on being wicked, they had better never pretend to be good. If they are to be cast off at last, it had better not be as apostates from the cause of virtue and religion.
