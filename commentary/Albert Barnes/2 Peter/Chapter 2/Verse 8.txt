<p style=" "><b>For that righteous man dwelling among them - </b>The Latin Vulgate renders this, “For in seeing and hearing he was just;” meaning that he maintained his uprightness, or that he did not become contaminated by the vices of Sodom. Many expositors have supposed that this is the correct rendering; but the most natural and the most common explanation is that which is found in our version. According to that, the meaning is, that compelled as he was, while living among them, to see and to hear what was going on, his soul was constantly troubled.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In seeing and hearing - </b>Seeing their open acts of depravity, and hearing their vile conversation. The effect which this had on the mind of Lot is not mentioned in Genesis, but nothing is more probable than the statement here made by Peter. Whether this statement was founded on tradition, or whether it is a suggestion of inspiration to the mind of Peter, cannot be determined. The words rendered “seeing” and “hearing” may refer to the ACT of seeing, or to the object seen. Wetstein and Robinson suppose that they refer here to the latter, and that the sense is, that he was troubled by what he saw and heard. The meaning is not materially different. Those who live among the wicked are compelled to see and hear much that pains their hearts, and it is well if they do not become indifferent to it, or contaminated by it. “Vexed” his “righteous soul from day to day with” their “unlawful deeds.”</p>
<p style=" ">Tortured or tormented his soul - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐβασάνιζεν</span></span> ebasanizen Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:6">Matthew 8:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:28">Luke 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:5">Revelation 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:10">Revelation 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:10">Revelation 14:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>, where the same word is rendered “tormented.” The use of this word would seem to imply that there was something active on the part of Lot which produced this distress on account of their conduct. He was not merely troubled as if his soul were passively acted on, but there were strong mental exercises of a positive kind, arising perhaps from anxious solicitude how he might prevent their evil conduct, or from painful reflections on the consequences of their deeds to themselves, or from earnest pleadings in their behalf before God, or from reproofs and warnings of the wicked. At all events, the language is such as would seem to indicate that he was not a mere passive observer of their conduct. This, it would seem, was “from day to day,” that is, it was constant. There were doubtless reasons why Lot should remain among such a people, and why, when he might so easily have done it, he did not remove to another place.</p>
<p style=" ">Perhaps it was one purpose of his remaining to endeavor to do them good, as it is often the duty of good men now to reside among the wicked for the same purpose. Lot is supposed to have resided in Sodom - then probably the most corrupt place on the earth - for 16 years; and we have in that fact an instructive demonstration that a good man may maintain the life of religion in his soul when surrounded by the wicked, and an illustration of the effects which the conduct of the wicked will have on a man of true piety when he is compelled to witness it constantly. We may learn from the record made of Lot what those effect will be, and what is evidence that one is truly pious who lives among the wicked.</p>
<p style=" ">(1) He will not be contaminated with their wickedness, or will not conform to their evil customs.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He will not become indifferent to it, but his heart will be more and more affected by their depravity. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:136">Psalms 119:136</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:16">Acts 17:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) He will have not only constant, but growing solicitude in regard to it - solicitude that will be felt every day: “He vexed his soul from day to day.” It will not only be at intervals that his mind will be affected by their conduct, but it will be an habitual and constant thing. True piety is not fitful, periodical, and spasmodic; it is constant and steady. It is not a “jet” that occasionally bursts out; it is a fountain always flowing.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) He will seek to do them good. We may suppose that this was the case with Lot; we are certain that it is a characteristic of true religion to seek to do good to all, however wicked they may be.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) He will secure their confidence. He will practice no improper arts to do this, but it will be one of the usual results of a life of integrity, that a good man will secure the confidence of even the wicked. It does not appear that Lot lost that confidence, and the whole narrative in Genesis leads us to suppose that even the inhabitants of Sodom regarded him as a good man. The wicked may hate a good man because he is good; but if a man lives as he should, they will regard him as upright, and they will give him the credit of it when he dies, if they should withhold it while he lives.</p>
