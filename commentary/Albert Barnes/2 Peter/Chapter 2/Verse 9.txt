<p style=" "><b>The Lord knoweth ... - </b>That is, the cases referred to show that God is able to deliver his people when tempted, and understands the best way in which it should be done. He sees a way to do it when we cannot, though it is often a way which we should not have thought of. He can send an angel to take his tempted people by the hand; he can interpose and destroy the power of the tempter; he can raise up earthly friends; he can deliver his people completely and forever from temptation, by their removal to heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to reserve the unjust - </b>As he does the rebel angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>. The case of the angels shows that God can keep wicked men, as if under bonds, reserved for their final trial at his bar. Though they seem to go at large, yet they are under his control, and are kept by him with reference to their ultimate arraignment.</p>
