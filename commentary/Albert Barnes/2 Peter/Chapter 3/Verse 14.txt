<p style=" "><b>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent - </b>That is, in securing your salvation. The effect of such hopes and prospects should be to lead us to an earnest inquiry whether we are prepared to dwell in a holy world, and to make us diligent in performing the duties, and patient in bearing the trials of life. He who has such hopes set before him, should seek earnestly that he may be enabled truly to avail himself of them, and should make their attainment the great object of his life. He who is so soon to come to an end of all weary toil, should be willing to labor diligently and faithfully while life lasts. He who is so soon to be relieved from all temptation and trial, should he willing to bear a little longer the sorrows of the present world. What are all these compared with the glory that awaits us? Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:58">1 Corinthians 15:58</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span> note, following; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16-18">2 Corinthians 4:16-18</span> notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye may be found of him in peace - </b>Found by him when he returns in such a state as to secure your eternal peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Without spot, and blameless - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>. It should be an object of earnest effort with us to have the last stain of sin and pollution removed from our souls. A deep feeling that we are soon to stand in the presence of a holy God, our final Judge, cannot but have a happy influence in making us pure.</p>
