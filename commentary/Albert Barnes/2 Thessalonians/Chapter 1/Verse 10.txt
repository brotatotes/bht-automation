<p style=" "><b>When he shall come to be glorified in his saints - </b>That is, the redeemed in that day will be the means of promoting his glory, or the universe will see his glory manifested in their redemption. His chief glory as seen in that day will be connected with the fact that he has redeemed his people; and he will come in order that all the appropriate honor of such a work may then be manifested. He will be “glorified” then by the numbers that shall have been redeemed; by their patience in the trials through which they have passed; by the triumphs which religion shall have made on the earth; by their praises and songs, and by their ascent with him to the realms of blessedness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to be admired in all them that believe - </b>This may either mean that he will be admired among or by them that believe; or that the ground of the admiration which he will receive in that day will be what will be seen in them; that is, their graces, their numbers, their joys, their triumphs will be the occasion of producing admiration of him - for he will be regarded as the source of it all. Tyndale renders it: “and to be made marvelous in all them that believe.” The latter interpretation seems to me to be the correct one. The general idea is, that Christ in that day will be manifested in a glorious manner, and that the source of his highest triumphs will be what is seen in the saints. His main honor when he returns to the world will not be the outward splendors which will attend his coming, nor the angels that will accompany him, nor the manifestation of his power over the elements, but the church which he has redeemed. It will then be seen that he is worthy of universal admiration, for having redeemed that church. He shall then be admired or glorified in his people:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)For having conceived the plan of redeeming them;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)For being willing to become incarnate and to die to save them;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)For the defense of his church in all its persecutions and trials;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)For raising his people from the dead;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)For the virtues and graces which they will exhibit in that day.</p>
<p style=" ">This appropriate honor of Christ in the church has never yet been fully seen. His people on earth have, in general, most imperfectly reflected his image. They have in general been comparatively few in number, and scattered upon the earth. They have been poor and despised. Often they have been persecuted and regarded as the “filth of the world and the offscouring of all things.” The honors of this world have been withheld from them. The great have regarded it as no honor to be identified with the church, and the proud have been ashamed to be enrolled among the followers of the Lamb. In the last day all this will be changed, and the assembled church will show to admiring worlds how great and glorious is it, Redeemer, and how glorious was the work of redemption.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because our testimony among you was believed. - </b>The meaning of this seems to be, that they would be among the number of those who would in that day honor the Saviour, because they had embraced what the apostle had preached to them respecting these future scenes. Thus interpreted, this clause should be regarded as connected with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>. “And to you it is a righteous thing that he should give rest with us, because our testimony among you was believed,” That is, you have shown that you are true Christians, and it is proper that you should partake of the triumphs and hopes of that day.</p>
