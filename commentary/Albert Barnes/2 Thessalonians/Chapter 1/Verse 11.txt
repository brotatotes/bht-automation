<p style=" "><b>Wherefore also we pray always for you - </b>See the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That our God would count you worthy of this calling. - </b>Margin, “or, vouchsafe.” The meaning is, “that he would regard you as worthy of this calling;” see the notes on ver. 5. Of this calling; see the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>. The “calling” here, is that which had brought them into the kingdom, and led them to become Christians.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness. - </b>That is, make the work of salvation complete and effectual. Oldshausen has well expressed the sense: “May God fill you with all that good which is pleasing to him.” The thoughts in the passage are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That the purpose toward them on the part of God was one of “goodness” or benevolence;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That there was a state of mind which would be regarded by him as pleasing, or as his “good pleasure;” and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)That Paul wished that this might be accomplished in them. He desired that there might be in them everything which would be pleasing to God, and which his benevolence was fitted to secure.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the work of faith - </b>The work which faith is adapted to produce on the soul; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4-5">1 John 5:4-5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With power - </b>Effectually, completely. The apostle prays that so much power may be exerted as will be sufficient to secure the object. The work of religion on the soul is always represented in the Bible as one of power.</p>
