So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God - That is, we mention your example to other churches, and glory in it, as an evidence of what the gospel is suited to do; see the notes on 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20; compare the notes on 2 Corinthians 9:2.For your patience - Your patient endurance of trials.And faith - Fidelity, or constancy. You have shown unwavering confidence in God in your afflictions.In all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure - See the notes on 1 Thessalonians 2:14; 1 Thessalonians 4:13. It would seem from this that the persecutions and trials to which the apostle referred in his First Epistle were still continued.
