<p style=" "><b>So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God - </b>That is, we mention your example to other churches, and glory in it, as an evidence of what the gospel is suited to do; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19-20">1 Thessalonians 2:19-20</span>; compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For your patience - </b>Your patient endurance of trials.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And faith - </b>Fidelity, or constancy. You have shown unwavering confidence in God in your afflictions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14">1 Thessalonians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>. It would seem from this that the persecutions and trials to which the apostle referred in his First Epistle were still continued.</p>
