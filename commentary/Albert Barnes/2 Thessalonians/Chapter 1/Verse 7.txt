<p style=" "><b>And to you who are troubled - </b>That is, “it will be a righteous thing for God to give to you who are persecuted rest in the last day.” As it will be right and proper to punish the wicked, so it will he right to reward the good. It will not, however, be in precisely the same sense. The wicked will deserve all that they will suffer, but it cannot be said that the righteous will deserve the reward which they will receive. It will be right and proper, because:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) There is a fitness that they who are the friends of God should be treated as such, or it is proper that he should show himself to be their friend; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Because in this life this is not always clearly done. They are often less prospered, and less happy in their outward circumstances, than the wicked. There is, therefore, a propriety that in the future state God should manifest himself as their friend, and show to assembled worlds that he is not indifferent to character, or that wickedness does not deserve his smiles, and piety incur his frown. At the same time, however, it will be owing wholly to his grace that any are ever admitted to heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rest - </b>The future happiness of believers is often represented under the image of rest. It is rest like that of the weary laborer after his day of toil; rest, like that of the soldier after the hardships of a long and perilous march; rest, like the calm repose of one who has been racked with pain; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9">Hebrews 4:9</span>. The word “rest” here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄνεσις</span></span> anesis) means a letting loose, a remission, a relaxation; and hence composure, quiet; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 2:12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:5">2 Corinthians 7:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With us - </b>That is, with Paul, Silas, and Timothy; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:1">2 Thessalonians 1:1</span>. It would increase the comfort of the Thessalonians derived from the anticipation of the future world, to reflect that they would meet their religious teachers and friends there. It always augments the anticipated joy of heaven to reflect that we are to share its blessedness with them. There is no envy among those who anticipate heaven; there will be none there. They who desire heaven at all, desire that it may be shared in the highest degree by all who are dear to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven - </b>Shall appear; shall come from heaven; see the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:6">1 Thessalonians 4:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With his mighty angels - </b>Margin, “angels of his power.” So the Greek. The sense is, that angels of exalted rank and glory will accompany him; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span> notes.</p>
