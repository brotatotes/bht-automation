<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">The main object of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:0">2 Thessalonians 2:0</span> is to correct an erroneous impression which had been made on the minds of the Thessalonians respecting the second coming of the Saviour, either by his own former letter, or by one forged in his name. They had received the impression that that event was about to take place. This belief had produced an unhappy effect on their minds; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>. It became, therefore, necessary to state the truth on the subject, in order to free their minds from alarm; and this purpose of the apostle leads to one of the most important prophecies in the New Testament. The chapter comprises the following points:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. An exhortation that they would not be alarmed or distressed by the expectation of the speedy coming of the Saviour; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1-2">2 Thessalonians 2:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. A statement of the truth that he would not soon appear, and of the characteristics of a great apostasy which must intervene before his advent; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3-12">2 Thessalonians 2:3-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">In this part of the chapter, the apostle shows that he did not mean to teach that that event would soon happen, by stating that before that there would occur a most melancholy apostasy, which would require a considerable time before it was matured.</p>
<p style=" ">His coming would be after the working of Satan, with power and signs and lying wonders, and under him there would be strong delusion, and the belief of a lie; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8-12">2 Thessalonians 2:8-12</span>. This great foe of God was to be destroyed by the coming of the Saviour, and one object of his appearing would be to put an end to his dominion; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. The apostle then says, that there was occasion for thankfulness to God, that he had chosen them to salvation, and not left them to be destroyed; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13-14">2 Thessalonians 2:13-14</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. An exhortation to stand fast, and to maintain what they had been taught <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span>, and a prayer that God, who had given them a good hope, would comfort their hearts, closes the chapter; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:16-17">2 Thessalonians 2:16-17</span>.</p>
