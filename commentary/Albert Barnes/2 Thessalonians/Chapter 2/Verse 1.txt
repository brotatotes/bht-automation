<p style=" "><b>Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ - </b>The phrase “by the coming,” is not here, as our translators seem to have supposed, a form of solemn adjuration. It is not common, if it ever occurs, in the Scriptures, to make a solemn adjuration in view of an event, and the connection here demands that we give to the phrase a different sense. It means, respecting his coming; and the idea of Paul is: “In regard to that great event of which I spoke to you in my former epistle - the coming of the Saviour - I beseech you not to be troubled, as if it were soon to happen. As his views had been misunderstood or misrepresented, he now proposes to show them that there was nothing in the true doctrine which should create alarm, as if he were about to appear.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And by our gathering together unto him - </b>There is manifest allusion here to what is said in the First Epistle <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span>, “then we shall be caught up together with them in the clouds;” and the meaning is: “in reference to our being gathered unto him, I beseech you not to be shaken in mind, as if that event were near.”</p>
