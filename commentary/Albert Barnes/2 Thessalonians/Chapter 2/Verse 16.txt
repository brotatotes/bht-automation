<p style=" "><b>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself - </b>This expression is equivalent to this: “I pray our Lord Jesus, and our Father, to comfort you.” It is really a prayer offered to the Saviour - a recognition of Christ as the source of consolation as well as the Father, and a union of his name with that of the Father in invoking important blessings. It is such language as could be used only by one who regarded the Lord Jesus as divine.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And God even our Father - </b>Greek: “And God, <i>and</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και</span></span> kai) our Father;” though not incorrectly rendered “even our Father.” If it should be contended that the use of the word “and” - “our Lord Jesus Christ, and God,” proves that the Lord Jesus is a different being from God - the use of the same word “and” would prove that the “Father” is a different being from God. But the truth is, the apostle meant to speak of the Father and the Son as the common Source of the blessing for which he prayed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which hath loved us - </b>Referring particularly to the Father. The love which is referred to is that manifested in redemption, or which is shown us through Christ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And hath given us everlasting consolation. - </b>Not temporary comfort, but that which will endure forever. The joys of religion are not like other joys. They soon fade away - they always terminate at death - they cease when trouble comes, when sickness invades the frame, when wealth or friends depart, when disappointment lowers, when the senses by age refuse to minister as they once did to our pleasures. The comforts of religion depend upon no such contingencies. They live through all these changes - attend us in sickness, poverty, bereavement, losses, and age; they are with us in death, and they are perpetual and unchanging beyond the grave.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And good hope through grace - </b>see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19">Hebrews 6:19</span> note.</p>
