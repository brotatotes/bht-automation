<p style=" "><b>And if any man obey not our word by this epistle - </b>Margin, “or signify that man by an epistle.” According to the marginal reading this would mean “signify, mark out, or designate that man to me by an epistle.” The difference is merely whether we unite the words “by the epistle” with what goes before, or what follows. The Greek would admit of either construction (Winer, p. 93), but it seems to me that the construction in the text is the correct one, because:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)The requirement was to proceed to discipline such a man by withdrawing from him;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)In order to do this it was not necessary that the case should be made known to Paul, for there was no supposable difficulty in it, and the effect would be only needless delay;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)Though the Greek will admit of either construction, yet it rather favors this; see Oldhhausen, in loc. Note that man. The word here used, means to mark; to sign; to note with marks; and the idea is, set such a mark upon him that he shall be shunned; that is, withdraw all Christian fellowship from him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And have no company with him - </b>The Greek word here means, to mix up together; then to mingle together with; to have contact with. The idea is that they were not to mingle with him as a Christian brother, or as one of their own number. They were not to show that they regarded him as a worthy member of the church, or as having a claim to its privileges. The extent of their discipline was, that they were to withdraw from him; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span> note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span> note; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:10-11">2 John 1:10-11</span>.</p>
