<p style=" ">From the subscription to this Epistle, it purports to have been “written from Athens.” This is probably incorrect, as there is reason to think that it was written from Corinth. See the introduction. At all events, this subscription is of no authority. See the notes at the end of the Epistles to the Romans and 1 Corinthians.</p>
