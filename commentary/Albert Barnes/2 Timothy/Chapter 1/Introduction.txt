The principal design of 2 Timothy 1:0 is to exhort Timothy to steadfastness and fidelity as a Christian and a minister; and to entreat him to adhere to the truth, and live as became a Christian, in the midst of all the temptations by which he was surrounded, and while so many were turning away from the Christian faith. Timothy was young; he was exposed, like others, to trials; he could not be unaware that not a few had apostatized; he knew that his father in Christ was in bonds, and he was liable to become disheartened, or to be led astray. In these circumstances, the apostle seems to have resolved to place before him strong reasons to induce him to devote himself steadfastly to the cause of religion, and not to allow those things which might tend to alienate him from Christianity to have any effect on his mind. After the usual salutations, therefore 2 Timothy 1:1-2, he proceeds to present these considerations to the mind of Timothy: (1) He commences the chapter with “delicate praise” of his young friend - one of the most happy methods of inducing him to persevere in the course of life on which he had entered; 2 Timothy 1:3-5. We naturally desire to perfect that in which we already excel; we feel encouraged for future efforts in a cause in which we have already been successful. The apostle, therefore, reminds Timothy of the manner in which he had been trained; of the piety of his mother and grandmother, and assures him of his belief that their efforts to train him up in the ways of religion had not been in vain. (2) He urges various considerations to induce him not to turn away from that holy purpose to which he had devoted himself. The considerations which he urges, are these: (a)He had been solemnly consecrated to the work of preaching the gospel, 2 Timothy 1:6; (c)The grace of God had called him to his great work, and he possessed that gospel by which life and immortality are brought to light, 2 Timothy 1:8-11; (e)He reminds Timothy that all his other friends in Asia had turned away from him, specifying two of them, and urges him, therefore, to maintain a steadfast attachment to the principles which he had professed, 2 Timothy 1:15. (3) The chapter closes with the expression of an earnest prayer that the Lord would bless the family of Onesiphorus, and with a grateful mention of his kindness to him, 2 Timothy 1:16-18.
