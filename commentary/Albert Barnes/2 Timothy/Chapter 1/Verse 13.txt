<p style=" "><b>Hold fast the form of sound words; - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>. On the Greek word here rendered “form,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span>, where it is rendered pattern. The word means a form, sketch, or imperfect delineation - an outline. Grotius says that it here means “an exemplar, but an exemplar fixed in the mind - an idea.” Calvin says that the command is that he should adhere to the doctrine which he had learned, not only in its substance, but in its form. Dr. Tillotson explains this as meaning the profession of faith which was made by Christians at baptism. There seems to be an allusion to some summary or outline of truth which Paul had given to Timothy, though there is no evidence that it was written. Indeed, there is every presumption that, if it refers to such a summary, it was not committed to writing. If it had been, it would have been regarded as inspired, and would have taken its place in the canon of Scripture. It may be presumed that almost none of the sacred writings would have been more sacredly preserved than such a condensed summary of Christian truth. But there is no improbability in supposing that Paul, either at his ordination, or on some other occasion, may have stated the outlines of the Christian religion to Timothy, that he might have a clear and connected view of the subject. The passage, therefore, may be used as an argument for the propriety of some brief summary of doctrine as a matter of convenience, though not as having binding authority on the consciences of others. “Of sound words;” compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3">1 Timothy 6:3</span>. The Greek is the same in both places.</p>
