<p style=" "><b>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me - </b>That is, in that part of Asia Minor of which Ephesus was the capital. The name Asia was often given particularly to that part of Asia Minor; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>. This passage proves that Timothy was somewhere in that region when this Epistle was written to him, for otherwise he could not be supposed to Know what is here said. When Paul says that “all” were turned away from him, he must use the word in a general sense, for he immediately specifies one who had been faithful and kind to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes - </b>We know nothing of these individuals but what is here mentioned. It would seem that they were prominent persons, and those from whom the apostle had a right to expect other treatment. “The ecclesiastical traditions allege that they were of the seventy disciples, and in the end became followers of Simon Magus. We imagine that this is little more than conjecture.” It is a sad thing when the only record made of a man - the only evidence which we have that he ever lived at all - is, that he turned away from a friend, or forsook the paths of true religion. And yet there are many men of whom the only thing to be remembered of them is, that they lived to do wrong.</p>
