<p style=" "><b>Greatly desiring to see thee; - </b>see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:9">2 Timothy 4:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:21">2 Timothy 4:21</span>. It was probably on, account of this earnest desire that this Epistle was written. He wished to see him, not only on account of the warm friendship which he had for him, but because he would be useful to him in his present circumstances; see the introduction, Section 3.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being mindful of thy tears - </b>Alluding probably to the tears which he shed at parting from him. The occasion to which he refers is not mentioned; but nothing is more probable than that Timothy would weep when separated from such a father and friend. It is not wrong thus to weep, for religion is not intended to make us stoics or savages.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That I may be filled with joy - </b>By seeing you again. It is easy to imagine what joy it would give Paul, then a prisoner, and forsaken by nearly all his friends, and about to die, to see a friend whom he loved as he did this young man. Learn hence, that there may be very pure and warm friendship between an old and young man, and that the warmth of true friendship is not diminished by the near prospect of death.</p>
