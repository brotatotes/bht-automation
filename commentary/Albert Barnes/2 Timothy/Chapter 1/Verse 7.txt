<p style=" "><b>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear - </b>A timorous and servile spirit. This is said in order to encourage Timothy, who was not improbably modest and diffident.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But of power - </b>Power to encounter foes and dangers; power to bear up under trials; power to triumph in persecutions. That is, it is the nature of the gospel to inspire the mind with holy courage; compare, however, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of love - </b>Love to God and to the souls of men. The tendency of This, also, is to “cast out fear” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:18">1 John 4:18</span>, and to make the mind bold and constant. Nothing will do more to inspire courage, to make a man fearless of danger, or ready to endure privation and persecution, than “love.” The love of country, and wife, and children, and home, makes the most timid bold when they are assailed; and the love of Christ and of a dying world nerves the soul to great enterprises, and sustains it in the deepest sorrows.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of a sound mind - </b>The Greek word denotes one of sober mind; a man of prudence and discretion. The state referred to here is that in which the mind is well balanced, and under right influences; in which it sees things in their just proportions and relations; in which it is not feverish and excited, but when everything is in its proper place. It was this state of mind which Timothy was exhorted to cultivate; this which Paul regarded as so necessary to the performance of the duties of his office. It is as needful now for the minister of religion as it was then.</p>
