<p style=" "><b>Who hath saved us; - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>. He has brought us into a state in which salvation is so certain, that Paul could speak of it as if it were already done.</p>

<p style=" "><b>With an holy calling - </b>A calling which is in its own nature holy, and which leads to holiness; compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span> note.</p>

The idea is, that our own works have nothing to do in inducing God to call us. As, when we become Christians, he does not choose us because of our works, so the eternal purpose in regard to our salvation could not have been formed because he foresaw that we would perform such works as would be a reason why he should choose us. The whole arrangement was irrespective of our deserts.</p>

<p style=" "><b>Which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began - </b>That is, which he intended to give us, for it was not then actually given. The thing was so certain in the divine purposes, that it might be said to be already done; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span>.</p>
