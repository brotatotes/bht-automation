<p style=" "><b>Therefore I endure all things for the electâ€™s sakes; - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span>. The sense is, What I suffer is in the cause of the church, spoken of here, as it is often, as chosen, or elected; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That they may also obtain the salvation, ... - </b>Their salvation, though they, were elected, could not be secured without proper efforts. The meaning of the apostle here is, that he was willing to suffer if he might save others; and any one ought to be willing to suffer in order to secure the salvation of the elect - for it was an object for which the Redeemer was willing to lay down his life.</p>
