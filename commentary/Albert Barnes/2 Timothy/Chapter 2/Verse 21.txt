<p style=" "><b>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour - </b>If a man “cleanse” or “purify” himself; compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:2">John 15:2</span>. The word “these” refers, here, to the persons represented by the vessels of wood and of earth - the vessels made to dishonor, as mentioned in the previous verse <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:20">2 Timothy 2:20</span>. The idea is, that if one would preserve himself from the corrupting influence of such men, he would be fitted to be a vessel of honor, or to be employed in the most useful and honorable service in the cause of his Master. On the word “vessel,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And meet for the master’s use - </b>Suitable to be employed by the Lord Jesus in promoting his work on earth.</p>
