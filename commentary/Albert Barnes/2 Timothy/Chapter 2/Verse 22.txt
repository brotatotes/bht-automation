<p style=" "><b>Flee also youthful lusts - </b>Such passions as youth are subject to. On the word “flee,” and the pertinency of its use in such a connection, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:18">1 Corinthians 6:18</span>. Paul felt that Timothy, then a young man, was subject to the same passions as other young men; and hence, his repeated cautions to him to avoid all those things, arising from his youth, which might be the occasion of scandal; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:2">1 Timothy 5:2</span>. It is to be remembered that this Epistle is applicable to other ministers, as well as to Timothy; and, to a young man in the ministry, no counsel could be more appropriate than to “flee from youthful lusts;” not to indulge for a moment in those corrupt passions to which youth are subject, but to cultivate the pure and sober virtues which become the ministerial office.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But follow righteousness, ... - </b>compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>. The general meaning here is, that he was to practice all that is good and virtuous. He was to practice righteousness, or justice and equity, in all his dealings with men; faith, or fidelity in his duties; charity, or love to all men (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:0">1 Corinthians 13:0</span>); peace, or harmony and concord with all others. What virtues could be more appropriate for a minister of the gospel?</p>
<p style=" "><b>With them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart - </b>That is, with all Christians, who are often characterized as those who call on the Lord; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11">Acts 9:11</span>. In all his social contact with them, Timothy was to manifest the virtues above recommended. But not with them alone. It would be incumbent on him to exhibit the same virtues in his intercourse with all.</p>
