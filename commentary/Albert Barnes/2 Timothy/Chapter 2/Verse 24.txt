<p style=" "><b>And the servant of the Lord - </b>Referring here primarily to the Christian minister, but applicable to all Christians; for all profess to be the servants of the Lord.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Must not strive - </b>He may calmly inquire after truth; he may discuss points of morals, or theology, if he will do it with a proper spirit; he may “contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:3">Jude 1:3</span>; but he may not do that which is here mentioned as strife. The Greek word - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μάχεσθαι</span></span> machesthai - commonly denotes, “to fight, to make war, to contend.” In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:52">John 6:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:26">Acts 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:24">2 Timothy 2:24</span>;, it is rendered “strove,” and “strive;” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:2">James 4:2</span>, “fight.” It is not elsewhere used in the New Testament. The meaning is, that the servant of Christ should be a man of peace. He should not indulge in the feelings which commonly give rise to contention, and which commonly characterize it. He should not struggle for mere victory, even when endeavoring to maintain truth; but should do this, in all cases, with a kind spirit, and a mild temper; with entire candor; with nothing designed to provoke and irritate an adversary; and so that, whatever may be the result of the discussion, “the bond of peace” may, if possible, be preserved; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:18">Romans 12:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But be gentle unto all men; - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7">1 Thessalonians 2:7</span>. The word rendered “gentle,” does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means that the Christian minister is to be meek and mild toward all, not disputatious and quarrelsome.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Apt to teach; - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Patient - </b>Margin, “forbearing.” The Greek word here used does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, patient under evils and injuries. Robinson, Lexicon.
