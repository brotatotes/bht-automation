<p style=" "><b>And if a man also strive for masteries - </b>As in the Grecian games. See this favorite illustration of Paul explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span> ff.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully - </b>In conformity with the rules of the games. See Grotius, in loc. No one could obtain the prize unless he had complied with all the laws of the games, and had thus given to those with whom he contended, a fair opportunity to succeed. “In those contests, he who transgressed the rules in the least matter, not only failed of the prize, even though the apparent victor, but was sometimes disgraced and punished.” Pictorial Bible. So the apostle here represents the Christian minister as engaged in a struggle or conflict for the crown. He says that he could not hope to win it unless he should comply with all the laws by which it is conferred; unless he should subdue every improper propensity, and make an effort like that evinced by the combatants at the Olympic games; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:26-27">1 Corinthians 9:26-27</span>.</p>
