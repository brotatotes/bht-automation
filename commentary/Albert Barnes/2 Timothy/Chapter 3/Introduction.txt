<p style=" ">In the first part of this chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:1-8">2 Timothy 3:1-8</span>, Paul reminds Timothy of the great apostasy which was to be expected in the church, and states some of the characteristics of it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:9">2 Timothy 3:9</span>, he says that that apostasy would not always continue; but would be at some time arrested, and so arrested as to show to all men the folly of those who were concerned in it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:11-12">2 Timothy 3:11-12</span>, he refers Timothy to his own manner of life in the midst of persecutions, as an encouragement to him to bear the trials which might be expected to occur to him in a similar manner. “Perilous times” were to come, and Timothy might be expected to be called to pass through trials similar to those which Paul himself had experienced. in those times the remembrance of his example would be invaluable. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12-13">2 Timothy 3:12-13</span>, he assures Timothy that persecutions and trials were to be expected by all who aimed to lead holy lives, and that it was as certainly to be expected that evil men would become worse and worse. And in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:14-17">2 Timothy 3:14-17</span>, he exhorts him to be steadfast in maintaining the truth; and, to encourage him to do this, reminds him of his early training in the Holy Scriptures, and of the value of those Scriptures. To the Scriptures he might repair in all times of trial, and find support in the divine promises. What he had learned there was the inspired truth of God, and was able to make him wise, and to furnish him abundantly for all that he was to do or to suffer.</p>
