<p style=" "><b>This know also - </b>The “object” of this reference to the perilous times which were to occur, was evidently to show the necessity of using every precaution to preserve the purity of the church, from the fact that such sad scenes were to open upon it. The apostle had dwelt upon this subject in his First Epistle to Timothy <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:0">2 Timothy 4:0</span>, but its importance leads him to advert to it again.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the last days - </b>Under the gospel dispensation; some time in that period during which the affairs of the world will be closed up; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span> note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Perilous times shall come - </b>Times of danger, of persecution, and of trial. On the general meaning of this passage, and the general characteristics of those times, the reader may consult the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1-12">2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</span> notes, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1-3">1 Timothy 4:1-3</span> notes. There can be no doubt that in all these passages the apostle refers to the same events.</p>
