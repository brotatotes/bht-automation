<p style=" "><b>Persecutions - </b>On the meaning of this word, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Afflictions - </b>Trials of other kinds than those which arose from persecutions. The apostle met them everywhere; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which came unto me at Antioch - </b>The Antioch here referred to is not the place of that name in Syria (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>); but a city of the same name in Pisidia, in Asia Minor; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:14">Acts 13:14</span>. Paul there suffered persecution from the Jews; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>At Iconium; - </b>notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:50">Acts 13:50</span>. On the persecution there, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:3-6">Acts 14:3-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>At Lystra; - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span>. At this place, Paul was stoned; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>. Timothy was a native of either Derbe or Lystra, cities near to each other, and was doubtless there at the time of this occurrence; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>.</p>
