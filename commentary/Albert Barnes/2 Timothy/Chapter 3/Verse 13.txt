<p style=" "><b>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse - </b>That is, it is the character of such men to do this; they may be expected to do it. This is the general law of depravity - that if men are not converted, they are always growing worse, and sinking deeper into iniquity. Their progress will be certain, though it may be gradual, since “nemo repente turpissimus.” The connection here is this: that Timothy was not to expect that he would be exempt from persecution <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12">2 Timothy 3:12</span>, by any change for the better in the wicked men referred to. He was to anticipate in them the operation of the general law in regard to bad men and seducers - that they would grow worse and worse. From this fact, he was to regard it as certain that he, as well as others, would be liable to be persecuted. The word rendered “seducers” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γόης</span></span> goēs - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, a “juggler, or diviner;” and then, a “deceiver, or impostor.” Here it refers to those who by seductive arts, lead persons into error.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Deceiving - </b>Making others believe that to be true and right, which is false and wrong. This was, of course, done by seductive arts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And being deceived - </b>Under delusion themselves. The advocates of error are often themselves as really under deception, as those whom they impose upon. They are often sincere in the belief of error, and then they are under a delusion; or, if they are insincere, they are equally deluded in supposing that they can make error pass for truth before God, or can deceive the Searcher of hearts. The worst victims of delusion are those who attempt to delude others.</p>
