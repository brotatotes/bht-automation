<p style=" "><b>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of - </b>To wit, the truths of religion. Timothy had been taught those truths when a child, and he had been confirmed in them by the instructions of Paul. Amidst the errors and seductions of false teachers, Paul now exhorts him to hold fast those doctrines, whoever might oppose them, or whatever might be the consequence; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Knowing of whom thou hast learned them - </b>To wit, of his mother <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>, and of Paul; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>. The reference seems to be particularly to the fact that he had learned these truths first from the lips of a mother (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>); and the doctrine taught here is, “that the fact that we have received the views of truth from a parent’s lips, is a strong motive for adhering to them.” It is not to be supposed, indeed, that this is the highest motive, or that we are always to adhere to the doctrines which have been taught us, if, on maturer examination, we are convinced they are erroneous; but that this is a strong reason for adhering to what we have been taught in early life. It is so, because:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)A parent has no motive for deceiving a child, and it cannot be supposed that he would teach him what he knew to be false;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)A parent usually has had much more experience, and much better opportunities of examining what is true, than his child has;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)There is a degree of respect which nature teaches us to be due to the sentiments of a parent.</p>
<p style=" ">A child should depart very slowly from the opinions held by a father or mother; and, when it is done, it should be only as the result of prolonged examination and prayer. These considerations should have the greater weight, if a parent has been eminent for piety, and especially if that parent has been removed to heaven. A child, standing by the grave of a pious father or mother, should reflect and pray much, before he deliberately adopts opinions which he knows that father or mother would regard as wrong.</p>
