<p style=" "><b>All Scripture - </b>This properly refers to the Old Testament, and should not be applied to any part of the New Testament, unless it can be shown that that part was then written, and was included under the general name of “the Scriptures;” compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:15-16">2 Peter 3:15-16</span>. But it includes the whole of the Old Testament, and is the solemn testimony of Paul that it was all inspired. If now it can be proved that Paul himself was an inspired man, this settles the question as to the inspiration of the Old Testament.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is given by inspiration of God - </b>All this is expressed in the original by one word - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεόπνευστος</span></span> Theopneustos. This word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means, God-inspired - from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεός</span></span> Theos, “God,” and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνέω</span></span> pneō, “to breathe, to breathe out.” The idea of “breathing upon, or breathing into the soul,” is that which the word naturally conveys. Thus, God breathed into the nostrils of Adam the breath of life <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:7">Genesis 2:7</span>, and thus the Saviour breathed on his disciples, and said, “receive ye the Holy Ghost;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:22">John 20:22</span>. The idea seems to have been, that the life was in the breath, and that an intelligent spirit was communicated with the breath. The expression was used among the Greeks, and a similar one was employed by the Romans. Plutarch ed. R. 9:p. 583. 9. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοὺς ὀνείρους τοὺς θεοπνεύστους</span></span> tous oneirous tous theopneustous. Phocylid. 121. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τῆς δὲ θεοπνεύστου σοφίης λόγος ἐστὶν ἄριστος</span></span> tēs de theopnoustou sophiēs logos estin aristos.</p>
<p style=" ">Perhaps, however, this is not an expression of Phocylides, but of the pseudo Phocylides. So it is understood by Bloomfield. Cicero, pro Arch. 8. “poetam - quasi divino quodam spiritu inflari.” The word does not occur in the Septuagint, but is found in Josephus, Contra Apion, i. 7. “The Scripture of the prophets who were taught according to the inspiration of God - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατὰ τὴν ἐπίπνοιαν τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span></span> kata tēn epipnoian tēn apo tou Theou. In regard to the manner of inspiration, and to the various questions which have been started as to its nature, nothing can be learned from the use of this word. It asserts a fact - that the Old Testament was composed under a divine influence, which might be represented by “breathing on one,” and so imparting life. But the language must be figurative; for God does not breathe, though the fair inference is, that those Scriptures are as much the production of God, or are as much to be traced to him, as life is; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:43">Matthew 22:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:21">2 Peter 1:21</span>. The question as to the degree of inspiration, and whether it extends to the words of Scripture, and how far the sacred writers were left to the exercise of their own faculties, is foreign to the design of these notes. All that is necessary to be held is, that the sacred writers were kept from error on those subjects which were matters of their own observation, or which pertained to memory; and that there were truths imparted to them directly by the Spirit of God, which they could never have arrived at by the unaided exercise of their own minds. Compare the introduction to Isaiah and Job.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And is profitable. - </b>It is useful; it is adapted to give instruction, to administer reproof, etc. If “all” Scripture is thus valuable, then we are to esteem no part of the Old Testament as worthless. There is no portion of it, even now, which may not be fitted, in certain circumstances, to furnish us valuable lessons, and, consequently, no part of it which could be spared from the sacred canon. There is no part of the human body which is not useful in its place, and no part of it which can be spared without sensible loss.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For doctrine - </b>For teaching or communicating instruction; compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:16">1 Timothy 4:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For reproof - </b>On the meaning of the word here rendered “reproof” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐλέγγμος</span></span> elengmos - see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>. It here means, probably, for “convincing;” that is, convincing a man of his sins, of the truth and claims of religion, etc.; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8">John 16:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For correction - </b>The word here used - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπανόρθωσις</span></span> epanorthōsis - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, “a setting to rights, reparation, restoration,” (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπανορθόω</span></span> epanorthoō, to right up again, to restore); and here means, the leading to a correction or amendment of life - “a reformation.” The meaning is, that the Scriptures are a powerful means of reformation, or of putting men into the proper condition in regard to morals. After all the means which have been employed to reform mankind; all the appeals which are made to them on the score of health, happiness, respectability, property, and long life, the word of God is still the most powerful and the most effectual means of recovering those who have fallen into vice. No reformation can be permanent which is not based on the principles of the word of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For instruction in righteousness - </b>Instruction in regard to the principles of justice, or what is right. Man needs not only to be made acquainted with truth, to be convinced of his error, and to be reformed; but he needs to be taught what is right, or what is required of him, in order that he may lead a holy life. Every reformed and regenerated man needs instruction, and should not be left merely with the evidence that he is “reformed, or converted.” He should be followed with the principles of the word of God, to show him how he may lead an upright life. The Scriptures furnish the rules of holy living in abundance, and thus they are adapted to the whole work of recovering man, and of guiding him to heaven.</p>
