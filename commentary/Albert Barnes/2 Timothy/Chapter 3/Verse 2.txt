<p style=" "><b>For men shall be lovers of their own selves - </b>It shall be one of the characteristics of those times that men shall be eminently selfish - evidently under the garb of religion; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:5">2 Timothy 3:5</span>. The word here used - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φίλαυτος</span></span> philautos - does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means a lover of oneself, “selfish.” Such a love of self as to lead us to secure our salvation, is proper. But this interferes with the rights and happiness of no other persons. The selfishness which is condemned, is that regard to our own interests which interferes with the rights and comforts of others; which makes self the central and leading object of living; and which tramples on all that would interfere with that. As such, it is a base, and hateful, and narrow passion; but it has been so common in the world that no one can doubt the correctness of the prophecy of the apostle that it would exist “in the last times.”</p>

<p style=" "><b>Unthankful - </b>see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:35">Luke 6:35</span>. The word here used occurs in the New Testament only in these two places. Ingratitude has always been regarded as one of the worst of crimes. It is said here that it would characterize that wicked age of which the apostle speaks, and its prevalence would, as it always does, indicate a decline of religion. Religion makes us grateful to every benefactor - to God, and to man.</p>
