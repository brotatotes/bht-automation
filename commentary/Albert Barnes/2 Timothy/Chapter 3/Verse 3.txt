Without natural affection - see the notes at Romans 1:31.Trucebreakers - The same word in Romans 1:31, is rendered “implacable;” see the notes at that verse. It properly means “without treaty;” that is, those who are averse to any treaty or compact. It may thus refer to those who are unwilling to enter into any agreement; that is, either those who are unwilling to be reconciled to others when there is a variance - implacable; or those who disregard treaties or agreements. In either case, this marks a very corrupt condition of society. Nothing would be more indicative of the lowest state of degradation, than that in which all compacts and agreements were utterly disregarded.False accusers - Margin, “makebates.” The word “makebate” means one who excites contentions and quarrels. Webster. The Greek here is διάβολοι diaboloi - “devils” - the primitive meaning of which is, “calumniator, slanderer, accuser;” compare the notes at 1 Timothy 3:11, where the word is rendered “slanderers.”Incontinent - 1 Corinthians 7:5. Literally, “without strength;” that is, without strength to resist the solicitations of passion, or who readily yield to it.Fierce - The Greek word used here - ἀνήμερος anēmeros - does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means “ungentle, harsh, severe,” and is the opposite of gentleness and mildness. Religion produces gentleness; the want of it makes men rough, harsh, cruel; compare the notes at 2 Timothy 2:24.Despisers of those that are good - In Titus 1:8, it is said of a bishop that he must be “a lover of good men.” This, in every condition of life, is a virtue, and hence, the opposite of it is here set down as one of the characteristics of that evil age of which the apostle speaks.
