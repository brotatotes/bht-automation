<p style=" "><b>Without natural affection - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:31">Romans 1:31</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Trucebreakers - </b>The same word in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:31">Romans 1:31</span>, is rendered “implacable;” see the notes at that verse. It properly means “without treaty;” that is, those who are averse to any treaty or compact. It may thus refer to those who are unwilling to enter into any agreement; that is, either those who are unwilling to be reconciled to others when there is a variance - implacable; or those who disregard treaties or agreements. In either case, this marks a very corrupt condition of society. Nothing would be more indicative of the lowest state of degradation, than that in which all compacts and agreements were utterly disregarded.</p>
<p style=" "><b>False accusers - </b>Margin, “makebates.” The word “makebate” means one who excites contentions and quarrels. Webster. The Greek here is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διάβολοι</span></span> diaboloi - “devils” - the primitive meaning of which is, “calumniator, slanderer, accuser;” compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span>, where the word is rendered “slanderers.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Incontinent - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span>. Literally, “without strength;” that is, without strength to resist the solicitations of passion, or who readily yield to it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fierce - </b>The Greek word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀνήμερος</span></span> anēmeros - does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means “ungentle, harsh, severe,” and is the opposite of gentleness and mildness. Religion produces gentleness; the want of it makes men rough, harsh, cruel; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:24">2 Timothy 2:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Despisers of those that are good - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:8">Titus 1:8</span>, it is said of a bishop that he must be “a lover of good men.” This, in every condition of life, is a virtue, and hence, the opposite of it is here set down as one of the characteristics of that evil age of which the apostle speaks.</p>
