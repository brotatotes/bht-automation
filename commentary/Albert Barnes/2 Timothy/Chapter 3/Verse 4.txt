<p style=" "><b>Traitors - </b>This word is used in the New Testament only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16">Luke 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:52">Acts 7:52</span>. It means any one who betrays - whether it be a friend or his country. Treason has been in all ages regarded as one of the worst crimes that man can commit.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Heady - </b>The same word in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:36">Acts 19:36</span>, is rendered rashly. It occurs only there and in this place in the New Testament. It properly means “falling forwards; prone, inclined, ready to do anything; then precipitate, headlong, rash.” It is opposed to that which is deliberate and calm, and here means that men would be ready to do anything without deliberation, or concern for the consequences. They would engage in enterprises which would only disturb society, or prove their own ruin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>High-minded - </b>Literally, “puffed up;” compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:6">1 Timothy 3:6</span>, where the same word is rendered “lifted up with pride.” The meaning is, that they would be inflated with pride or self-conceit.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God - </b>That is, of sensual pleasures, or vain amusements. This has been, and is, the characteristic of a great part of the world, and has often distinguished even many who profess religion. Of a large portion of mankind it may be said that this is their characteristic, that they live for pleasure; they have no serious pursuits; they brook no restraints which interfere with their amusements, and they greatly prefer the pleasures to be found in the gay assembly, in the ball-room, or in the place of low dissipation, to the friendship of their Creator.</p>
