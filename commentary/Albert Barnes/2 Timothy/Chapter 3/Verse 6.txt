<p style=" "><b>For of this sort are they which creep into houses - </b>Who go slyly and insidiously into families. They are not open and manly in endeavoring to propagate their views, but they endeavor by their address to ingratiate themselves first with weak women, and through them to influence men; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>. The word translated “creep into,” is rendered by Doddridge, “insinuate themselves;” by Bloomfield, “wind their way into,” in the manner of serpents; by Bretschneider, “deceitfully enter;” by Robinson and Passow,” go in, enter in.” It is not certain that the idea of deceit or cunning is contained in this “word,” yet the whole complexion of the passage implies that they made their way by art and deceitful tricks.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And lead captive silly women - </b>One of the tricks always played by the advocates of error, and one of the ways by which they seek to promote their purposes. Satan began his work of temptation with Eve rather than with Adam, and the advocates of error usually follow his example. There are always weak-minded women enough in any community to give an opportunity of practicing these arts, and often the aims of the impostor and deceiver can be best secured by appealing to them. Such women are easily flattered; they are charmed by the graceful manners of religious instructors; they lend a willing ear to anything that has the appearance of religion, and their hearts are open to anything that promises to advance the welfare of the world. At the same time, they are just such persons as the propagators of error can rely upon. They have leisure; they have wealth; they are busy; they move about in society, and by their activity they obtain an influence to which they are by no means entitled by their piety or talents. There are, indeed, very many women in the world who cannot be so easily led away as men; but it cannot be denied also that there are those who are just adapted to the purposes of such as seek to spread plausible error. The word rendered “silly women,” means properly “little women,” and then “weak women.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Laden with sins - </b>With so many sins that they seem to be “burdened” with them. The idea is, that they are under the influence of sinful desires and propensities, and hence, are better adapted to the purposes of deceivers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Led away with divers lusts - </b>With various kinds of passions or desires - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπιθυμίας</span></span> epithumias - such as pride, vanity, the love of novelty, or a susceptibility to flattery, so as to make them an easy prey to deceivers.</p>
