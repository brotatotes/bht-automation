<p style=" ">This chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:0">2 Timothy 4:0</span>, comprises the following subjects:</p>
<p style=" ">1. A solemn charge to Timothy, to be faithful in preaching the gospel, and in the whole work of the ministry, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1-5">2 Timothy 4:1-5</span>. The particular reason given for this charge was, that the time was approaching when men would not endure sound doctrine, but would turn away from the truth. Hence, Timothy is exhorted to be faithful in his work, and to be prepared to endure the trials which, in such circumstances, a faithful minister must be expected to meet.</p>
<p style=" ">2. A statement of Paul that his own work was nearly done, and that the hour of his departure drew near; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6-8">2 Timothy 4:6-8</span>. This statement, also, seems to be made in order to excite Timothy to increased fidelity in the ministry. His teacher, guide, father, and friend, was about to be withdrawn, and the great work of preaching was to be committed to other hands. Hence, in view of his own departure, Paul exhorts Timothy to fidelity when he himself should be removed.</p>
<p style=" ">3. An exhortation to Timothy to come to him as soon as practicable; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:9-15">2 Timothy 4:9-15</span>. Paul was then in bonds, and was expecting soon to die. He was alone. For various reasons, those who had been with him had left him, and he needed some companion and friend. He, therefore, exhorts Timothy to come to him as soon as possible.</p>
<p style=" ">4. Paul refers now to his first trial before the emperor, and to the fact that then no one stood by him; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16-19">2 Timothy 4:16-19</span>. The reason of his referring to this seems to be, to induce Timothy to come to him in view of his anticipated second trial. The Lord, he says, then stood by him, and he had confidence that he would continue to do it; yet who is there that does not feel it desirable to have some dear earthly friend to be with him when he dies?</p>
<p style=" ">5. The Epistle is closed, in the usual manner, with various salutations, and with the benediction; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:19-22">2 Timothy 4:19-22</span>.</p>
