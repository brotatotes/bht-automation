<p style=" "><b>For Demas hath forsaken me - </b>Demas is honorably mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span>; but nothing more is known of him than what can be gathered from that place and this - that he was at first a friend and fellow-laborer of Paul, but that, under the influence of a desire to live, he afterward forsook him, even in circumstances where he greatly needed the presence of a friend.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having loved this present world - </b>This does not mean, necessarily, that he was an avaricious man, or that, in itself, he loved the honors or wealth of this world; but it means that he desired to live. He was not willing to stay with Paul, and subject himself to the probabilities of martyrdom; and, in order to secure his life, he departed to a place of safety. The Greek is, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀγαπὴσας τὸν νὺν αἰῶνα</span></span> agapēsas ton nun aiōna - having loved the world that now is; that is, this world as it is, with all its cares, and troubles, and comforts; having desired to remain in this world, rather than to go to the other. There is, perhaps, a slight censure here in the language of Paul - “the censure of grief;” but there is no reason why Demas should be held up as an example of a worldly man. That he desired to live longer; that he was unwilling to remain and risk the loss of life, is indeed clear. That Paul was pained by his departure, and that he felt lonely and sad, is quite apparent; but I see no evidence that Demas was influenced by what are commonly called worldly feelings, or that he was led to this course by the desire of wealth, or fame, or pleasure.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And is departed unto Thessalonica - </b>Perhaps his native place. “Calmet.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Crescens - </b>Nothing more is known of Crescens than is here mentioned. “He is thought by Eusebius and others to have preached in Gaul, and to have founded the church in Vienne, in Dauphiny” - Calmet.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To Galatia - </b>See Intro. to the Epistle to the Galatians, Section 1. It is not known to what part of Galatia he had gone, or why he went there.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Titus into Dalmatia - </b>Dalmatia was a part of Illyricum, on the gulf of Venice, or the Adriatic sea. On the situation of Illyricum, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:19">Romans 15:19</span>. Paul does not mention the reason why Titus had gone there; but it is not improbable that he had gone to preach the gospel, or to visit the churches which Paul had planted in that region. The apostle does not suggest that he was deserving of blame for having gone, and it can hardly be supposed that “Titus” would have left him at this time without his concurrence. Perhaps, when he permitted him to go, he did not know how soon events would come to a crisis with him; and as a letter would more readily reach Timothy at Ephesus, than Titus in Dalmatia, he requested him to come to him, instead of directing Titus to return.</p>
