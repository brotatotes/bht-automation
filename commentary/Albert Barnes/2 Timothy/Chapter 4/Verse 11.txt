<p style=" "><b>Only Luke is with me - </b>Luke, the author of the gospel which bears his name, and of the Acts of the Apostles. For a considerable part of the ministry of Paul, he was his traveling companion (compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>), and we know that he went with him to Rome; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:1">Acts 27:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Take Mark - </b>John Mark, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:37">Acts 15:37</span>. He was the son of a sister of Barnabas, and had been the traveling companion of Barnabas and Paul. There had been a temporary alienation between Paul and him <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span>; but this passage proves that that had been removed, and that Paul was reconciled to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For he is profitable to me for the ministry - </b>In what way he would be profitable, he does not say; nor is it known why Mark was at that time with Timothy. It may be observed, however, that this is such language as Paul might be expected to use of Mark, after what had occurred, as recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span>. He felt that he was now about to die. If he suspected that there was on the part of Mark any lingering apprehension that the great apostle was not entirely reconciled to him, or retained a recollection of what had formerly occurred, nothing would be more natural than that, at this trying time of his life, Paul should summon him to his side, and express toward him the kindest emotions. It would soothe any lingering irritation in the mind of Mark, to receive such a message.</p>
