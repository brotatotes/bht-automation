<p style=" "><b>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work - </b>He does not say from “death,” for he expected now to die; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>. But he was assured that God would keep him from shrinking from death when the hour approached; from apostasy, and from the manifestation of an improper spirit when he came to die.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom - </b>So keep me from evil that I shall reach his heavenly kingdom; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To whom be glory forever and ever - </b>Paul was accustomed to introduce a doxology in his writings when his heart was full (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>), and in no place could it be more appropriate than here, when he had the fullest confidence that he was soon to be brought to heaven. If man is ever disposed to ascribe glory to God, it is on such an occasion.</p>
