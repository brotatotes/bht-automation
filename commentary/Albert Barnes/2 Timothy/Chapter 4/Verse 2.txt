<p style=" "><b>Preach the word - </b>The Word of God; the gospel. This was to be the main business of the life of Timothy, and Paul solemnly charges him in view of the certain coming of the Redeemer to judgment, to be faithful in the performance of it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be instant - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:12">Romans 12:12</span>. The meaning here is, that he should be constant in this duty. Literally, “to stand by, or to stand fast by;” that is, he was to be pressing or urgent in the performance of this work. He was always to be at his post, and was to embrace every opportunity of making known the gospel. What Paul seems to have contemplated was not merely, that he should perform the duty at stated and regular times; but that he should press the matter as one who had the subject much at heart, and never lose an opportunity of making the gospel known.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In season - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εὐκαίρως</span></span> eukairōs. In good time; opportunely; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:16">Matthew 26:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:6">Luke 22:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:11">Mark 14:11</span>. The sense is, when it could be conveniently done; when all things were favorable, and when there were no obstructions or hindrances. It may include the “stated and regular” seasons for public worship, but is not confined to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Out of season - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀκαίρως</span></span> akairōs. This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It is the opposite of the former, and means that a minister is to seek opportunities to preach the gospel even at such periods as might be inconvenient to himself, or when there might be hindrances and embarrassments, or when there was no stated appointment for preaching. He is not to confine himself to the appointed times of worship, or to preach only when it will be perfectly convenient for himself, but he is to have such an interest and earnestness in the work, that it will lead him to do it in the face of embarrassments and discouragements, and whenever he can find an opportunity. A man who is greatly intent on an object will seek every opportunity to promote it. He will not confine himself to stated times and places, but will present it everywhere, and at all times. A man, therefore, who merely confines himself to the stated seasons of preaching the gospel, or who merely preaches when it is convenient to himself, should not consider that he has come up to the requirement of the rule laid down by the apostle. He should preach in his private conversation, and in the intervals of his public labors, at the side of the sick bed, and wherever there is a prospect of doing good to any one. If his heart is full of love to the Saviour and to souls, he cannot help doing this.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Reprove - </b>Or “convince;” See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</span>. The meaning is that he was to use such arguments as would “convince” men of the truth of religion, and of their own need of it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rebuke - </b>Rebuke offenders; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:15">Titus 2:15</span>; see the use of the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:26">Matthew 8:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:16">Matthew 12:16</span>, (rendered “charged”); <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:22">Matthew 16:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:18">Matthew 17:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13">Matthew 19:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:31">Matthew 20:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:35">Luke 4:35</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:39">Luke 4:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:13">Luke 17:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:15">Luke 18:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>. In the New Testament the word is used to express a judgment of what is wrong or contrary to one’s will, and hence, to admonish or reprove. It implies our conviction that there is something evil, or some fault in him who is rebuked. The word in this verse rendered “reprove,” does not imply this, but merely that one may be in error, and needs to have arguments presented to convince him of the truth. That word also implies no superior authority in him who does it. He presents “reasons, or argues” the case, for the purpose of convincing. The word here rendered rebuke, implies authority or superiority, and means merely that we may say that a thing is wrong, and administer a rebuke for it, as if there were no doubt that it was wrong. The propriety of the rebuke rests on our authority for doing it, not on the arguments which we present. This is based on the presumption that men often Know that they are doing wrong, and need no arguments to convince them of it. The idea is, that the minister is not merely to reason about sin, and convince men that it is wrong, but he may solemnly admonish them not to do it, and warn them of the consequences.</p>
