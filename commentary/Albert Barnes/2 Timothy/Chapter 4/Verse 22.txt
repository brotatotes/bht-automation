The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit; - see Galatians 6:18; Romans 15:20. The subscription to this Epistle was not added by Paul himself, nor is there any evidence that it was by an inspired man, and it is of no authority. There is not the slightest evidence that Timothy was “ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians,” or that he was a “bishop” there at all. There is no reason to believe that he was even a “pastor” there, in the technical sense; see the notes on 1 Timothy 1:3. Compare the remarks on the subscriptions to the Epistle to the Romans, 1 Corinthians, and especially Titus.
