But watch thou in all things - Be vigilant against error and against sin, and faithful in the performance of duty; See the Matthew 25:13 note; 1 Corinthians 16:13 note.Endure afflictions - See the notes at 2 Timothy 2:3. The Greek word here is the same which is there rendered “endure hardness.”Do the work of an evangelist - On the word “evangelist,” see the notes on Acts 21:8. The phrase here means, “do the work of preaching the gospel,” or of one appointed to proclaim the glad tidings of salvation. This is the proper business of all ministers, whatever other rank they may maintain. Whether it was ever regarded as the proper duty of a separate class of men to do this, see the notes on Ephesians 4:11.Make full proof of thy ministry - Margin, “fulfill;” compare the notes at Romans 14:5. The word here used denotes, properly, to bear or bring fully; then to persuade fully; and then to make fully assured of, to give full proof of. The meaning here seems to be, “to furnish full evidence of what is the design of the Christian ministry, and of what it is adapted to accomplish,” by the faithful performance of all its duties. Timothy was so to discharge the duties of his office as to furnish “a fair illustration” of what the ministry could do, and thus to show the wisdom of the Saviour in its institution. This should be the aim of all the ministers of the gospel. Each one should resolve, by the blessing of God, that the ministry, in his hands, shall be allowed, “by a fair trial,” to show to the utmost what it is adapted to do for the welfare of mankind.
