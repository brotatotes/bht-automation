<p style=" "><b>I have fought a good fight - </b>The Christian life is often represented as a conflict, or warfare; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>. That noble conflict with sin, the world, the flesh, and the devil, Paul now says he had been able to maintain.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I have finished my course - </b>The Christian life, too, is often represented as a “race” to be run; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24-26">1 Corinthians 9:24-26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I have kept the faith - </b>I have steadfastly maintained the faith of the gospel; or, have lived a life of fidelity to my Master. Probably the expression means that he had kept his plighted faith to the Redeemer, or had spent a life in faithfully endeavoring to serve his Lord.</p>
