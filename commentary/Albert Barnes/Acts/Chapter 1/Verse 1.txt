<p style=" "><b>The former treatise - </b>The former book. The Gospel of Luke is here evidently intended. Greek: the former <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λόγος</span></span> logos, meaning “a discourse,” or “a narrative.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>O Theophilus - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>. Since this book was written to the same individual as the former, it was evidently written with the same design to furnish an authentic and full narrative of events concerning which there would be many imperfect and exaggerated accounts. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1-4">Luke 1:1-4</span>. Since these events pertained to the descent of the Spirit, to the spread of the gospel, to the organization of the church, to the kind of preaching by which the church was to be collected and organized, and as the facts in the case constituted a full proof of the truth of the Christian religion, and the conduct of the apostles would be a model for ministers and the church in all future times, it was of great importance that a fair and full narrative of these things should be preserved. Luke was the companion of Paul in his travels, and was an eye-witness of no small part of the transactions recorded in this book. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:17">Acts 16:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:1-6">Acts 20:1-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:0">Acts 27:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:0">Acts 28:0</span>. As an eye-witness, he was well qualified to make a record of the leading events of the primitive church. And as he was the companion of Paul, he had every opportunity of obtaining information about the great events of the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of all - </b>That is, of the principal, or most important parts of the life and doctrines of Christ. It cannot mean that he recorded all that Jesus did, as he had omitted many things that have been preserved by the other evangelists. The word “all” is frequently thus used to denote the most important or material facts. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:10">Acts 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:3">Matthew 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:5">Matthew 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:5">Acts 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>. In each of these places the word here translated “all” occurs in the original, and means “many, a large part, the principal portion.” It has the same use in all languages. “This word often signifies, indefinitely, a large portion or number, or a great part” (Webster).</p>
<p style=" "><b>That Jesus - </b>The Syriac Version adds, “Jesus our Messiah.” This version was probably made in the second century.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Began to do ... - </b>This is a Hebrew form of expression; meaning the same thing as that Jesus did and taught. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:20">Genesis 9:20</span>, “Noah began to be a farmer,” that is, was a farmer. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:3">Genesis 2:3</span>, in the Septuagint: “Which God began to create and make”; in the Hebrew, “which God created and made.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:7">Mark 4:7</span>, “began to send them forth by two and two,” that is, sent them forth. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:65">Mark 14:65</span>, “And some began to spit on him”; in the parallel place in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span>, “they did spit in his face.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>To do - </b>This refers to his miracles and his acts of benevolence, including all that he did for man’s salvation. It probably includes, therefore, his sufferings, death, and resurrection, as a part of what he has done to save people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To teach - </b>His doctrines. As the writer had given an account of what the Lord Jesus did, so he was now about to give a narrative of what his apostles did in the same cause, that thus the world might be in possession of an inspired record respecting the establishment of the Christian church. The record of these events preserved in the sacred narrative is one of the greatest blessings that God has conferred on mankind; and one of the highest privileges which people can enjoy is that which has been conferred so abundantly on this age in the possession of the Word of God.</p>
