<p style=" "><b>Looked stedfastly - </b>They fixed their eyes, or gazed intently toward heaven. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span>, “and the eyes of all them in the synagogue were fastened (Greek: the same word as here) on him.” It denotes the intense gaze when we are deeply interested, and wish to see clearly and distinctly. They were amazed and confounded; what had occurred was unlocked for; for they had just been inquiring whether he would not, at that time, restore the kingdom to Israel. With this mingled amazement, disappointment, and curiosity, and with an earnest desire to catch the last glimpse of their beloved master, they naturally continued to gaze on the distant clouds where he had mysteriously disappeared from their view. Never was a scene more impressive, grand, and solemn than this.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Toward heaven - </b>Toward the distant clouds or sky which had received him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As he went up - </b>Literally, upon him going up; that is, they gazed on him as he ascended, and doubtless they continued to gaze after he had disappeared from their view.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Two men - </b>From the raiment of these “men,” and the nature of their message, it seems clear that they were angelic beings, who were sent to meet and comfort the disciples on this occasion. They appeared in human form, and Luke describes them as they appeared. Angels are not infrequently called people. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span>, “two men stood by them in shining garments,” etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:12">John 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:5">Matthew 28:5</span>. As two angels are mentioned only as addressing the apostles after the resurrection of Jesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:12">John 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span>, it is no unnatural supposition that these were the same who had been designated to the honorable office of bearing witness to his resurrection, and of giving them all the information about that resurrection, and of his ascension, which their circumstances needed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In white apparel - </b>Angels are commonly represented as clothed in white. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:12">John 20:12</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:3">Matthew 28:3</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:5">Mark 16:5</span> note. It is an emblem of purity; and the worshippers of heaven are represented as clothed in this manner. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:4">Revelation 3:4</span>, “they shall walk with me in white”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>, “He that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:13-14">Revelation 7:13-14</span>.</p>
