<p style=" "><b>Then returned they unto Jerusalem - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:52">Luke 24:52</span>, we are told that they worshipped Jesus before they returned, and it is probable that the act of worship to which he refers was what is mentioned in this chapter their gazing intently on their departing Lord.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From the mount called Olivet - </b>From the Mount of Olives. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:1">Matthew 21:1</span>. The part of the mountain from which he ascended was the eastern declivity, where stood the little village of Bethany, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A sabbath-dayâ€™s journey - </b>As far as might be lawfully traveled by a Jew on the Sabbath. This was 2,000 paces or cubits, or seven furlongs and a half - not quite one mile. See the notes On <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:20">Matthew 24:20</span>. The distance of a lawful journey on the Sabbath was not fixed by the laws of Moses, but the Jewish teachers had fixed it at 2,000 paces. This measure was determined on because it was a tradition that in the camp of the Israelites, when coming from Egypt, no part of the camp was more than 2000 paces from the tabernacle, and over this space, therefore, they were permitted to travel for worship. Perhaps, also, some countenance was given to this from the fact that this was the extent of the suburbs of the Levitical cities, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+35:5">Numbers 35:5</span>. Mount Olivet was only 5 furlongs from Jerusalem, and Bethany was 15 furlongs. But on the eastern declivity of the mountain the tract of country was called, for a considerable space, the region of Bethany; and it was from this place that the Lord Jesus ascended.</p>
