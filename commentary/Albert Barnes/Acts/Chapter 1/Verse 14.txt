<p style=" "><b>These all continued ... - </b>The word “continued” denotes “persevering and constant attention.” The main business was devotion. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>, “we will give ourselves continually to the ministry of the word.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:12">Romans 12:12</span>, “continuing instant in prayer”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:6">Romans 13:6</span>, “Attending continually upon this very thing.” It is their main and constant employment. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:2">Colossians 4:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With one accord - </b>Greek: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὁμοθυμαδόν</span></span> homothumadon - “with one mind.” The word denotes the entire harmony of their views and feelings. There were no schisms, no divided interests, no discordant purposes. This is a beautiful picture of devotion, and a specimen of what social worship ought now to be, and a beautiful illustration of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+133:1-3">Psalms 133:1-3</span>. The apostles felt that they had one great object; and their deep grief at the loss of their master, and their doubts and perplexities, led them, as all afflictions ought to lead us, to the throne of grace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In prayer and supplication - </b>These words are nearly synonymous, and are often interchanged. They express here petitions to God for blessings, and prayer to avert impending evils.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With the women - </b>The women that had followed the Lord Jesus from Galilee, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:2-3">Luke 8:2-3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:23">Luke 8:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:49">Luke 8:49</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:55">Luke 8:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:10">Luke 24:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:55">Matthew 27:55</span>. The women particularly mentioned are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, the mother of Zebedee’s children, Joanna the wife of Chuza, and Susanna. Besides these, there were others whose names are not mentioned. Most of them were relatives of the apostles or of the Saviour; and it is not improbable that some of them were wives of the apostles. Peter is known to have been married <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span>, and had his wife in attendance with him in his travels <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>; and the same was doubtless true of some of the other apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>.- Mary, the mother of Jesus, is here particularly mentioned, showing that she now cast in her lot with the apostles. She had, besides, been specially entrusted to the care of John <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:26-27">John 19:26-27</span>, and had no other home. This is the last time that she is mentioned in the New Testament.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And with his brethren - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46">Matthew 12:46</span>. At first they had been unbelieving about the claims of Jesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:5">John 7:5</span>; but it seems that they had been subsequently converted.</p>
