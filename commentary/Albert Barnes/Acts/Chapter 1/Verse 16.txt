<p style=" "><b>Men and brethren - </b>This is a customary mode of address, implying affection and respect, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:26">Acts 13:26</span>. The Syriac renders it more appropriately than by the introduction of the conjunction “and” - “Men, our brethren.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>This scripture - </b>This prediction contained in the writings of the Old Testament. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>. The passage to which Peter refers is commonly supposed to be that recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9">Psalms 41:9</span>, “Yea, mine own familiar friend ...hath lifted up his heel against me.” This is expressly applied to Judas by our Saviour, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:18">John 13:18</span>. But it seems clear that the reference is not to the 41st Psalm, but to the passage in the 69th Psalm which Peter proceeds to quote in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:20">Acts 1:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Must needs have been fulfilled - </b>It would certainly be fulfilled. Not that there was any physical necessity or any compulsion; but it could not but occur that a prediction of God would be fulfilled. This makes no affirmation about the freedom of Judas in doing it. A man will be just as free in wickedness if it be foretold that he will be wicked, as if it had never been known to any other being but himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Holy Ghost ... - </b>This is a strong attestation to the inspiration of David, and accords with the uniform testimony of the New Testament, that the sacred writers spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:21">2 Peter 1:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Concerning Judas - </b>In what respect this was concerning Judas, see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:20">Acts 1:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which was guide ... - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:47">Matthew 26:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:3">John 18:3</span>.</p>
