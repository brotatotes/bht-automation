<p style=" "><b>Now this man ... - </b>The money which was given for betraying the Lord Jesus was thrown down in the temple, and the field was purchased with it by the Jewish priests. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:10">Matthew 27:10</span>, and the notes on that place. A man is said often to do a thing when he furnishes means for doing it. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:60">Matthew 27:60</span>, “And laid it (the body of Jesus) in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock.” That is, had caused to be hewn out. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span>, “when, therefore, the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus “made and baptized” more disciples than John.” Through his disciples, for Jesus himself baptized not, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:2">John 4:2</span>. The same principle is recognized in law in the well-known maxim, “Qui facit per alium, facit per se.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>The reward of iniquity - </b>The price which he had for that deed of stupendous wickedness - the betraying of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And falling headlong - </b>The word here rendered “headlong” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρηνής</span></span> prēnēs (Latin “pronus,” whence our English word “prone”) - means properly “bent forward, head-foremost”; and the idea is, that his position in hanging himself was such that when the cord broke he fell headlong, or fell forward on his face. This can easily be supposed if he threw himself from a rock or elevated place. He first hanged himself, and then fell and was burst asunder. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span>.</p>
