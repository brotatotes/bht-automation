<p style=" "><b>Until the day - </b>The 40th day after the resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:51">Luke 24:51</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In which he was taken up - </b>In which he ascended to heaven. He was taken up into a cloud, and is represented as having been borne or carried to heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>After that ... - </b>This passage has been variously rendered. The Syriac translates it, “After he had given commandment unto the apostles whom he had chosen by the Holy Spirit.” So also the Ethiopic version. Others have joined the words “through the Holy Spirit” to the phrase “was taken up,” making it mean that he was taken up by the Holy Spirit. But the most natural and correct translation seems to be what is in our King James Version.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the Holy Ghost - </b>To understand this, it is necessary to call to mind the promise that Jesus made before his death, that after his departure, the Holy Spirit would descend to be a guide to his apostles. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7-11">John 16:7-11</span>, and the notes on that place. It was to be his office to carry forward the work of redemption in applying it to the hearts of people. Whatever was done, therefore, after the death and resurrection of Jesus, was to be regarded as under the unique influence and direction of the Holy Spirit. Even the instructions of Jesus and his commission to the apostles, were to be regarded as coming within the department of the sacred Spirit, or within the province of his unique work. The instructions were given by divine authority, by infallible guidance, and as a part of the work which the Holy Spirit was sent down to accomplish. Under the direction and guidance of that Spirit the apostles were to go forth; by his aid they were to preach the gospel, to organize the church, to establish its order and its doctrines; and hence, the entire work was declared to be by his direction. Though in his larger and more mighty influences the Spirit did not descend until the day of Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span>), yet, in some measure, his influence was imparted to the apostles before the ascension of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:22">John 20:22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had given commandments - </b>Particularly the command to preach the gospel to all nations, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15-19">Mark 16:15-19</span>. It may be worthy of remark, that the word “commandments,” as a noun in the plural number, does not occur in the original. The single word which is translated, “had given commandments” is a participle, and means simply “having commanded.” There is no need, therefore, of supposing that there is reference here to any other command than to that great and glorious injunction to preach the gospel to every creature. That was a command of so much importance as to be worthy of a distinct record, as constituting the sum of all that the Saviour taught them after his resurrection.</p>
