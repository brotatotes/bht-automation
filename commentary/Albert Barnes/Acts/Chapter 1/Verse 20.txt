<p style=" "><b>For it is written ... - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:25">Psalms 69:25</span>. This is the prediction doubtless to which Peter refers in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:16">Acts 1:16</span>. The intermediate passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18-19">Acts 1:18-19</span>, is probably a parenthesis; the words of Luke, not of Peter. So Calvin, Kuinoel, Olshausen, DeWette, and Hackett understand it. It is not probable that Peter would introduce a narrative like this, with which they were all familiar, in an address to the disciples. The Hebrew in the Psalm is, “Let their habitation (Hebrew: fold, enclosure for cattle; tower, or palace) be desolate, and let none dwell in their tents.” This quotation is not made literally from the Hebrew, nor from the Septuagint. The plural is changed to the singular, and there are some other slight variations. The Hebrew is, “Let there be no one dwelling in their tents.” The reference to the tents is omitted in the quotation. The term “habitation,” in the Psalm, means evidently the dwelling-place of the enemies of the writer of the Psalm. It is an image expressive of their overthrow and defeat by a just God: “Let their families be scattered, and the places where they have dwelt be without an inhabitant, as a reward for their crimes.”</p>
<p style=" ">If the Psalm was originally composed with reference to the Messiah and his sufferings, the expression here was not intended to denote Judas in particular, but one of his foes who was to meet the just punishment of rejecting, betraying, and murdering him. The change, therefore, which Peter made from the plural to the singular, and the application to Judas especially “as one of those enemies,” accords with the design of the Psalm, and is such a change as the circumstances of the case justified and required. It is an image, therefore, expressive of judgment and desolation coming upon his betrayer - an image to be literally fulfilled in relation to his habitation, drawn from the desolation when a man is driven from his home, and when his dwelling-place becomes tenantless. It is not a little remarkable that this Psalm is repeatedly quoted as referring to the Messiah: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:9">Psalms 69:9</span>, “The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up,” expressly applied to Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:17">John 2:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:21">John 2:21</span>, “They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink” - the thing which was done to Jesus on the cross, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The whole Psalm is expressive of deep sorrow of persecution, contempt, weeping, being forsaken, and is throughout applicable to the Messiah; with what is remarkable, not a single expression necessarily limited to David. It is not easy to ascertain whether the ancient Jews referred this Psalm to the Messiah. A part of the title to the Psalm in the Syriac version is, “It is called a prophecy concerning those things which Christ suffered, and concerning the casting away of the Jews.” The prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span> is not to be understood of Judas alone, but of the enemies of the Messiah in general, of which Judas was one. On this principle the application to Judas of the passage by Peter is to be defended.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his bishopric let another take - </b>This is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:8">Psalms 109:8</span>, “Let his days be few, and let another take his office.” This is called “a Psalm of David,” and is of the same class as <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+6:1-10">Psalms 6:1-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:0">Psalms 22:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+25:0">Psalms 25:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+38:0">Psalms 38:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+42:1-11">Psalms 42:1-11</span>; This class of Psalms is commonly supposed to have expressed David’s feelings in the calamitous times of the persecution by Saul, the rebellion of Absalom, etc. They are all also expressive of the condition of a suffering and persecuted Messiah, and many of them are applied to him in the New Testament. The general principle on which most of them are applicable is, not that David personated or typified the Messiah which is nowhere affirmed, and which can be true in no intelligible sense - but that he was placed in circumstances similar to the Messiah; was encompassed with like enemies; was persecuted in the same manner. They are expressive of high rank, office, dignity, and piety, cast down, waylaid, and encompassed with enemies.</p>
<p style=" ">In this way they express “general sentiments” as really applicable to the case of the Messiah as to David. They were placed in similar circumstances. The same help was needed. The same expressions would convey their feelings. The same treatment was proper for their enemies. On this principle it was that David deemed his enemy, whoever he was, unworthy of his office, and desired that it should be given to another. In like manner, Judas had rendered himself unworthy of his office, and there was the same propriety that it should be given to another. And as the office had now become vacant by the death of Judas, and according to one declaration in the Psalms, so, according to another, it was proper that it should be conferred on some other person. The word rendered “office” in the Psalm means the care, charge, business, oversight of anything. It is a word applicable to magistrates, whose care it is to see that the laws are executed; and to military men who have charge of an army, or a part of an army.</p>
<p style=" ">In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+10:12">Job 10:12</span> it is rendered “thy visitation.” In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+4:16">Numbers 4:16</span>, “and to the office of Eleazar,” etc. In the case of David it refers to those who were entrusted with military or other offices who had treacherously perverted them to persecute and oppose him, and who had thus shown themselves unworthy of the office. The Greek word which is used here, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπισκοπὴν</span></span> episkopēn, is taken from the Septuagint, and means the same thing as the Hebrew. It is well rendered in the margin “office, or charge.” It means charge or office in general, without in itself specifying of what kind. It is the concrete of the noun <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπισκόπους</span></span> episkopous, commonly translated “bishop,” and means his office, charge, or duty. That word means simply having the oversight of anything, and as applied to the officers of the New Testament, it denotes merely “their having charge of the affairs of the church,” without specifying the nature or the extent of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p style=" ">Hence, it is often interchanged with presbyter or elder, and denotes the discharge of the duties of the same office: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>, “Take heed (presbyters or elders, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>) to yourselves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR"> ἐπισκόπους</span></span> episkopous - bishops; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span>, “Looking diligently,” etc. - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπισκοποῦντες</span></span> episkopountes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>, “with the bishops and deacons”; “Paul called presbyters bishops, for they had at that time the same name” (Theodoret, as quoted by Sehleusner); <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>, “Feed the flock of God (that is, you who are elders, or presbyters, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>), taking the oversight thereof” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπισκοποῦντες</span></span> episkopountes. These passages show that the term in the New Testament designates the supervision or care which was exercised over the church, by whomsoever performed, without specifying the nature or extent of the jurisdiction. It is scarcely necessary to add that Peter here did not intend to affirm that Judas sustained any office corresponding to what is now commonly understood by the term “bishop.”</p>
