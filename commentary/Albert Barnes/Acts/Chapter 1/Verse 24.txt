<p style=" "><b>And they prayed - </b>As they could not agree on the individual, they invoked the direction of God in their choice - an example which should be followed in every selection of an individual to exercise the duties of the sacred office of the ministry.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which knowest the hearts of all men - </b>This is often declared to be the special prerogative of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:10">Jeremiah 17:10</span>, “I, Yahweh, search the heart,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:1">Psalms 139:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:23">Psalms 139:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+28:9">1 Chronicles 28:9</span>. Yet this attribute is also expressly ascribed to Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:18">Revelation 2:18</span>; compare 23, “These things saith the Son of God - I am he which searcheth the reins and the hearts”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25">John 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:19">John 16:19</span>. There are strong reasons for supposing that the apostles on this occasion addressed this prayer to the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)We are told that they worshipped him, or rendered him divine honors after his ascension, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:52">Luke 24:52</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)The disciples were accustomed to address him after his crucifixion by the names Lord or God indifferently, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)This was a matter pertaining especially to the church which the Lord Jesus had redeemed, and “to his own arrangement” in regard to it. He had chosen the apostles; he had given them their commission; he had fixed their number; and, what is worthy of special remark here, he had been the companion of the very men here designated as candidates for the office, and knew their qualifications for this work. If the apostles ever called on the Lord Jesus after his ascension, this was a case in which they would be likely to do it. That it was done is clear from the account of the death of Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59-60">Acts 7:59-60</span>. And in this important matter of ordaining a new apostle to be a witness for Jesus Christ, nothing was more natural than that they should address him, though bodily absent, as they would assuredly have done if he were present. But if on this occasion they did actually address Christ, then two things clearly follow. First, that it is proper to render him divine homage, agreeably to the uniform declarations of the Scripture: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>, “That all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span>, “And let all the angels of God worship him”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10-11">Philippians 2:10-11</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Rev 5:8-14</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:11-12">1 Thessalonians 3:11-12</span>. Secondly, he must be divine. To none other but God can religious homage be rendered; and none other can be described as knowing the hearts of all people. The reason why they appealed to him on this occasion as the searcher of the heart was doubtless the great importance of the work to which the successor of Judas was to be called. One apostle of fair external character had proved a traitor; and, with this fact before them, they appealed to the Saviour himself to select one who would be true to him, and not bring dishonor upon his cause.</p>
