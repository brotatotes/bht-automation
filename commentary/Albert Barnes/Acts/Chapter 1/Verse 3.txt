<p style=" "><b>He showed himself - </b>The resurrection of Jesus was the great fact on which the truth of the gospel was to be established. Hence, the sacred writers so often refer to it, and establish it by so many arguments. As the fact of his resurrection lay at the foundation of all that Luke was about to record in his history, it was of importance that he should state clearly the sum of the evidence of it in the beginning of his work.</p>
<p style=" "><b>After his passion - </b>After he suffered, referring particularly to his death as the consummation of his sufferings. The word “passion” with us means commonly excitement or agitation of mind, as love, hope, fear, anger, etc. The original means “after he suffered.” The word “passion,” applied to the Saviour, denotes his last sufferings. Thus, in the Litany of the Episcopal Church, it is beautifully said, “By thine agony and bloody sweat; by thy cross and passion, good Lord, deliver us.” The Greek word of the same derivation is rendered sufferings in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:11">1 Peter 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By many infallible proofs - </b>The word rendered here “infallible proofs” does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. In Greek authors it denotes an infallible sign or argument by which anything can be certainly known (Schleusner). Here it means the same - evidence that he was alive which could not deceive, or in which they could not be mistaken. That evidence consisted in his eating with them, conversing with them, meeting them at various times and places, working miracles <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:6-7">John 21:6-7</span>, and uniformly showing himself to be the same friend with whom they had been familiar for more than three years. This evidence was infallible:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Because it was to them unexpected. They had manifestly not believed that he would rise again, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:25">John 20:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:19-24">Luke 24:19-24</span>. There was, therefore, no delusion resulting from any expectation of seeing him, or from a design to impose on people.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It was impossible that they could have been deceived in relation to one with whom they had been familiar for more than three years. No people in the possession of reason could be made to believe that they really saw, talked with, and ate with, a friend whom they had known so long and familiarly, unless it was real.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) There were enough of them to avoid the possibility of deception. Though it might be pretended that one man could be imposed on, yet it could not be that an imposition could be practiced for forty days on eleven men, who were all at first incredulous.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) He was with them sufficient time to give evidence of his personal identity. It might be pretended, if they had seen him but once, that they were deceived. But they saw him often, and for the space of more than a month.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) They saw him in various places and at times in which there could be no deception. If they had pretended that they saw him rise, or saw him at twilight in the morning when he rose, it might have been said that they were deluded by something that was merely the result of imagination. It might have been said that, expecting to see him rise, their hopes, in the agitated state of their minds, deceived them, and that they only fancied that they saw him. But it is not pretended by the sacred writers that they saw him rise. An impostor “would have affirmed this, and would not have omitted it.” But the sacred writers affirmed that they saw him after he was risen; when they were free from agitation; when they could judge coolly; in Jerusalem; in their own company when at worship; when journeying to Emmaus; when in Galilee; when he went with them to Mount Olivet; and when he ascended to heaven: and how could they have been deceived in this?</p>
<p style=" ">(6) He appeared to them as he had always done, as a friend, companion, and benefactor; he ate with them, performed a miracle before them, was engaged in the same work as he was before he suffered, renewed the same promise of the Holy Spirit, and gave them his commands respecting the work which he had died to establish, and the work which he required them to do - carrying out the same purposes and plans which he had before he died. In all these circumstances it was impossible that they should be deceived.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being seen of them forty days - </b>There are no less than thirteen different appearances of Jesus to his disciples recorded. For an account of them, see the notes at the end of the gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Speaking to them ... - </b>He was not only seen by them, but he continued the same topics of discourse as before his sufferings; thus showing that he was the same person that had suffered, and that his heart was still intent on the same great work. And as his heart was occupied with the same purposes which endued his attention before he suffered, we are taught by this that we should aim at the same great work in all the circumstances of our being. Afflictions, persecutions, and the prospect of death never turned him from his great plan; nor should they be allowed to divert our minds from the great work which God has given us to do.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The things pertaining to the kingdom of God - </b>For an explanation of this phrase, the kingdom of God, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. The meaning is, Jesus gave them instructions about the organization, spread, and edification of his church.</p>
