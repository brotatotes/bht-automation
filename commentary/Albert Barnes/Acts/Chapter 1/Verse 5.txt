<p style=" "><b>For John truly baptized ... - </b>These are the words of Jesus to his apostles, and he evidently has reference to what was said of Johnâ€™s baptism compared with his own in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:33">John 1:33</span>. In those verses John is represented as baptizing with water, but the Messiah who was to come, as baptizing with the Holy Spirit and with fire. This promise was now about to be fulfilled in a remarkable manner. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not many days hence - </b>This was probably spoken not long before his ascension, and of course not many days before the day of Pentecost.</p>
