<p style=" "><b>While they beheld - </b>While they saw him. It was of importance to state that circumstance, and to state it distinctly. It is not affirmed in the New Testament that they “saw him rise” from the dead, because the evidence of that fact could be better established by their seeing him after he was risen. But the truth of his “ascension to heaven” could not be confirmed in that manner. Hence, it was so arranged that he should ascend in open day, and in the presence of his apostles; and that not when they were asleep, or were inattentive to what was occurring, but when they were engaged in a conversation that’ would fix the attention, and even when they were looking upon him. Had Jesus vanished secretly, or had he disappeared in the night, the apostles would have been amazed and confounded; perhaps they would even have doubted whether they had not been deceived. But when they saw him leave them in this manner, they could not doubt that he had ascended to heaven, and that God approved his work, and would carry it forward. This event was exceedingly important:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It was a confirmation of the truth of the Christian religion.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It enabled the apostles to state distinctly where the Lord Jesus was, and at once directed their affections and their thoughts away from the earth, and opened their eyes on the glory of the scheme of religion they were to establish. If their Saviour was in heaven, it settled the question about the nature of his kingdom. It was clear that it was not designed to be a temporal kingdom. The reasons why it was proper that the Lord Jesus should ascend to heaven rather than remain on earth were:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That he had “finished” the work which God gave him to do “on the earth” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4">John 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span>, and it was proper that he should be received back to the glory which he had with the Father before the world was, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4-5">John 17:4-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9-10">Philippians 2:9-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It was proper that he should ascend in order that the Holy Spirit might come down and perform his part of the work of redemption. Jesus, by his personal ministry, as a man, could be but in one place; the Holy Spirit could be in all places, and could apply the work to all people. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) A part of the work of Christ was yet to be performed in heaven. That was the work of intercession. The high priest of the Jews not only made an atonement, but also presented the blood of sacrifice before the mercy-seat, as the priest of the people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:11-14">Leviticus 16:11-14</span>. This was done to typify the entrance of the great high priest of our profession into the heavens, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7-8">Hebrews 9:7-8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11-12">Hebrews 9:11-12</span>. The work which he performs there is the work of intercession, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>. This is properly the work which an advocate performs in a court for his client. As applicable to Christ, the meaning is, that he, as our great high priest, still manages our cause in heaven; secures our interests; obtains for us grace and mercy. His work, in this respect, consists in his appearing in the presence of God for us <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>; in his presenting the merits of his blood <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>; and in securing the continuance of the mercy which has been bestowed on us, and which is still needful for our welfare. The Lord Jesus also ascended that he might assume and exercise the office of King in the immediate seat of power. All worlds were made subject to him for the welfare of the church; and it was needful that he should be solemnly invested with that power in the presence of God as the reward of his earthly toils. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:25">1 Corinthians 15:25</span>, “he must reign until he hath put all enemies under his feet.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-22">Ephesians 1:20-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6-11">Philippians 2:6-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A cloud received him - </b>He entered into the region of the clouds, and was hid from their view. But two others of our race have been taken bodily from earth to heaven. Enoch was transported (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:24">Genesis 5:24</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>); and Elijah was taken up by a whirlwind, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:11">2 Kings 2:11</span>. It is remarkable that when the return of the Saviour is mentioned, it is uniformly said that he will return in the clouds, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:26">Mark 13:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>.
