<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:0">Acts 10:0</span> commences a very important part of the history of the transactions of the apostles. Before this, they had preached the gospel to the Jews only. They seemed to have retained the feelings of their countrymen on this subject, that the Jews were to be regarded as the especially favored people, and that salvation was not to be offered beyond the limits of their nation. It was important, indeed, that the gospel should be offered to them first; but the whole tendency of the Christian religion was to enlarge and liberalize the mind; to overcome the narrow policy and prejudices of the Jewish people; and to disuse itself over all the nations of the earth. In various ways, and by various parables, the Saviour had taught the apostles, indeed, that his gospel should he spread among the Gentiles. He had commanded them to go and preach it to every creature, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>. But he had told them to tarry in Jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">It was natural, therefore, that they should receive special instructions and divine revelation on a point so important as this; and God selected the case of Cornelius as the instance by which he would fully establish his purpose of conveying the gospel to the Gentile world. It is worthy of observation, also, that he selected Peter for the purpose of conveying the gospel first to the Gentiles. The Saviour had told him that on him he would build his church; that he would give to him first the keys of the kingdom of heaven; that is, that he should be the agent in opening the doors of the church to both Jews and Gentiles. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18-19">Matthew 16:18-19</span>. Peter had, in accordance with these predictions, been the agent in first presenting the gospel to the Jews <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span>; and the prediction was now to be completely fulfilled in extending the same gospel to the Gentile world. The transaction recorded in this chapter is one, therefore, that is exceedingly important in the history of the church, and we are not to be surprised that it is recorded at length. It should be remembered, also, that this point became afterward the source of incessant controversy in the early church. The converts from Judaism insisted on the observance of the whole of the rites of their religion; the converts from among the Gentiles claimed exemption from them all. To settle these disputes; to secure the reception of the gospel among the Gentiles, and to introduce them to the church with all the privileges of the Jews, required all the wisdom, talent, and address of the apostles.
