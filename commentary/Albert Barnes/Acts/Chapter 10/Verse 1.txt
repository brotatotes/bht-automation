<p style=" "><b>Cornelius - </b>This is a Latin name, and shows that the man was doubtless a Roman. It has been supposed by many interpreters that he was “a proselyte of the gate”; that is, one who had renounced idolatry, and who observed some of the Jewish rites, though not circumcised, and not called a Jew. But there is no sufficient evidence of this. The reception of the narrative of I Peter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1-3">Acts 11:1-3</span> shows that the other apostles regarded him as a Gentile. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>, Peter evidently regards him as a foreigner - one who did not in any sense esteem himself to be a Jew. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>, it is expressly said that “the Gentiles” had received the Word of God, evidently alluding to Cornelius and to those who were with him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A centurion - </b>One who was the commander of a division in the Roman army, consisting of 100 men. A captain of 100. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5">Matthew 8:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the band - </b>A division of the Roman army, consisting of from 400 to 600 men. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27">Matthew 27:27</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Italian band - </b>Probably a band or regiment that was composed of soldiers from Italy, in distinction from those which were composed of soldiers born in provinces. It is evident that many of the soldiers in the Roman army would be those who were born in other parts of the world; and it is altogether probable that those who were born in Rome or Italy would claim pre-eminence over those enlisted in other places.</p>
