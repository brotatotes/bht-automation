<p style=" "><b>And saw heaven opened - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>. This language is derived from a common mode of speaking in the Hebrew Scriptures, as if the sky above us was a solid, vast expanse, and as if it were opened to present an opportunity for anything to descend. It is language that is highly figurative.</p>

<p style=" "><b>As it had been - </b>It is important to mark this expression. The sacred writer does not say that Peter literally saw such an object descending; but he uses this as an imperfect description of the vision. It was not a literal descent of a vessel, but it was such a kind of representation to him, producing the same impression, and the same effect, as if such a vessel had descended.</p>
