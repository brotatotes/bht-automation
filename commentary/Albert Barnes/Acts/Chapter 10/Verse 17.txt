<p style=" "><b>Doubted in himself - </b>Doubted in his own mind. He was perplexed, and did not know how to understand it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Behold, the men ... - </b>We see here an admirable arrangement of the events of Providence to fit each other. Every part of this transaction is made to harmonize with every other part; and it was so arranged that just in the moment when the mind of Peter was filled with perplexity, the very event should occur which would relieve him of his embarrassment. Such a coincidence is not uncommon. An event of divine Providence may be as clear an expression of his will, and may as certainly serve to indicate our duty, as the most manifest revelation would do, and a state of mind may, by an arrangement of circumstances, be produced that will be extremely perplexing until some event shall occur, or some field of usefulness shall open, that will exactly correspond to it, and indicate to us the will of God. We should then carefully mark the events of God’s providence. We should observe and record the train of our own thoughts, and should watch with interest any event that occurs, when we are perplexed and embarrassed, to obtain, if possible, an expression of the will of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before the gate - </b>The word here rendered “gate,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυλῶνα</span></span> pulōna refers properly to the porch or principal entrance to an Eastern house. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2">Matthew 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:71">Matthew 26:71</span>. It does not mean, as with us, a gate, but rather a door. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:13">Acts 12:13</span>.</p>
