<p style=" "><b>And lodged them - </b>They remained with him through the night. Four days were occupied before Peter met Cornelius at Caesarea. On the first the angel appeared to Cornelius. On the second the messengers arrived at Joppa, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:9">Acts 10:9</span>. On the third, Peter returned with them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:23">Acts 10:23</span>; and on the fourth they arrived at Caesarea, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:24">Acts 10:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:30">Acts 10:30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And certain brethren - </b>Some Christians. They were six in number, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:12">Acts 11:12</span>. It was usual for the early Christians to accompany the apostles in their journeys. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:24">Romans 15:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:3">Acts 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:6">3 John 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:6">1 Corinthians 16:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:11">1 Corinthians 16:11</span>. As this was an important event in the history of the church - the bearing of the gospel to a Gentile - it was more natural and proper that Peter should be attended with others.</p>
