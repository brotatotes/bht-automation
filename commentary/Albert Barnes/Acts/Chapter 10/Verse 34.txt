<p style=" "><b>Then Peter opened his mouth - </b>Began to speak, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:2">Matthew 5:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of a truth - </b>Truly, evidently. That is, I have evidence here that God is no respecter of persons.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is no respecter of persons - </b>The word used here denotes “the act of showing favor to one on account of rank, family, wealth, or partiality arising from any cause.” It is explained in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1-4">James 2:1-4</span>. A judge is a respecter of persons when he favors one of the parties on account of private friendship, or because he is a man of rank, influence, or power, or because he belongs to the same political party, etc. The Jews supposed that they were especially favored by God. and that salvation was not extended to other nations, and that the fact of being a Jew entitled them to this favor. Peter here says that he had learned the error of this doctrine, and that a man is not to be accepted because he is a Jew, nor to be excluded because he is a Gentile. The barrier is broken down; the offer is made to all; God will save all on the same principle; not by external privileges or rank, but according to their character.</p>
<p style=" ">The same doctrine is elsewhere explicitly stated in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:11">Romans 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:25">Colossians 3:25</span>. It may be observed here that this does not refer to the doctrine of divine sovereignty or election. It simply affirms that God will not save a man because he is a Jew, or because he is rich, or learned, or of elevated rank, or on account of external privileges; nor will he exclude a man because he is destitute of these privileges. But this does not affirm that he will not make a difference in their character, and then treat them according to their character, nor that he will not pardon whom he pleases. That is a different question. The interpretation of this passage should be limited strictly to the case in hand - to mean that God will not accept and save a man on account of external national rank and privileges. That he will not make a difference on other grounds is not affirmed here, nor anywhere in the Bible. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:7">1 Corinthians 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span>. It is worthy of remark further, that the most strenuous advocate for the doctrines of sovereignty and election - the apostle Paul - is also the one that labored most to establish the doctrine that God is no respecter of persons - that is, that there is no difference between the Jews and Gentiles in regard to the way of salvation; that God would not save a man because he was a Jew, nor destroy a man because he was a Gentile. Yet in regard to “the whole race viewed as lying on a level,” he maintained that God has a right to exercise the prerogatives of a sovereign, and to have mercy on whom he will have mercy. The doctrine may be thus stated:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The barrier between the Jews and Gentiles was broken down.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) All people thus were placed on a level none to be saved by external privileges, none to be lost by the lack of them.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) All were guilty Rom. 1–3, and none had a claim on God.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) If any were saved, it would be by God showing mercy on such of this common mass as he chose.
