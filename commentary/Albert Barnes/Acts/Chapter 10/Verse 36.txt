<p style=" "><b>The word - </b>That is, this is the Word, or “the doctrine.” Few passages in the New Testament have perplexed critics more than this. It has been difficult to ascertain to what the term “word” in the accusative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὸν λόγον</span></span> ton logon here refers. Our translation would lead us to suppose that it is synonymous with what is said in the following verse. But it should be remarked that the term used there, and translated “word,” as if it were a repetition of what is said here, is a different term. It is not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λόγον</span></span> logon, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ῥῆμα</span></span> rēma - a word, a thing; not a doctrine. I understand the first term “word” to be an introduction of the doctrine which Peter set forth, and to be governed by a preposition understood. The whole passage may be thus expressed: Peter had been asked to teach Cornelius and his assembled friends. It was expected, of course, that he would instruct him in regard to the true doctrines of religion - the doctrine which had been communicated to the Jews. He commences, therefore, with a statement respecting the true doctrine of the Messiah, or the way of salvation which was now made known to the Jews. “In regard to the Word, or the doctrine which God sent to the children of Israel, proclaiming peace through Jesus Christ (who is Lord of all), you know already what was done, or the transactions which occurred throughout all Judea, from Galilee, where he commenced his ministry after John had preached, that this was by Jesus Christ, since God had anointed him,” etc. Peter here assumes that Cornelius had some knowledge of the principal events of the life of the Saviour, though it was obscure and imperfect; and his discourse professes only to state this more fully and clearly.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto the children of Israel - </b>To the Jews. The Messiah was promised to them, and spent his life among them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Preaching - </b>That is, proclaiming, or announcing. God did this by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Peace - </b>This word sometimes refers to the peace or union which was made between Jews and Gentiles, by breaking down the wall of division between them. But it is used here in a wider sense, to denote “peace or reconciliation with God.” He announced the way by which man might be reconciled to God, and might find peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He is Lord of all - </b>That is, Jesus Christ. He is sovereign, or ruler of both Jews and Gentiles, and hence, Peter saw the propriety of preaching the gospel to one as to the other. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-22">Ephesians 1:20-22</span>. The word “Lord” used here does not necessarily imply divinity, but only that the Lord Jesus, as Mediator, had been constituted or appointed Lord or Ruler over all nations. It is true, however, that this is a power which we cannot conceive to have been delegated to one that was not divine. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>.</p>
