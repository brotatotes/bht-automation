<p style=" "><b>That word - </b>Greek: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ῥῆμα</span></span> rēma - a different word from that in the previous verse. It may be translated “thing” as well as “word.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which was published - </b>Greek: which was done. “You know, though it may be imperfectly, what was done or accomplished in Judea,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Throughout all Judea - </b>The miracles of Christ were not confined to any place, but were performed in every part of the land. For an account of the divisions of Palestine, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:22">Matthew 2:22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And began ... - </b>Greek: having been begun in Galilee. Galilee was not far from Caesarea. There was, therefore, the more probability that Cornelius had heard of what had occurred there. Indeed, the gospels themselves furnish the highest evidence that the fame of the miracles of Christ spread into all the surrounding regions.</p>
