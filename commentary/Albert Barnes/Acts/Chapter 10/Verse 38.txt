<p style=" "><b>How God anointed ... - </b>That is, set him apart to this work, and was with him, acknowledging him as the Messiah. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With the Holy Ghost - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:19">Luke 4:19</span>. The act of anointing kings and priests seems to have been emblematic of the influences of the Holy Spirit. Here it means that God impaled to him the influences of the Holy Spirit, thus consecrating him for the work of the Messiah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16-17">Matthew 3:16-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span>, “God giveth not the Holy Spirit by measure unto him.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And with power - </b>The power of healing the sick, raising the dead, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who went about doing good - </b>Whose main business it was to travel from place to place to do good. He did not go for applause, or wealth, or comfort, or ease, but to diffuse happiness as far as possible. This is the simple but sublime record of his life. It gives us a distinct portrait of his character, as he is distinguished from conquerors and kings, from false prophets and from the mass of people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And healing ... - </b>Restoring to health.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All that were oppressed of the devil - </b>All that were possessed by him. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23-24">Matthew 4:23-24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God was with him - </b>God appointed him, and furnished by his miracles the highest evidence that he had sent him. His miracles were such that they could be performed only by God.</p>
