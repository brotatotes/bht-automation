<p style=" "><b>Of quick - </b>The living. The doctrine of the New Testament is, that those who are alive when the Lord Jesus shall return to judge the world, will be caught up in vast numbers like clouds, to meet him in the air, without seeing death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16-17">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</span>. Yet before this they will experience such a change in their bodies as shall fit them for the judgment and for their eternal residence - a change which will liken them to those who have died, and have risen from the dead.
