<p style=" "><b>Were men of Cyprus and Cyrene - </b>Were natives of Cyprus and Cyrene. Cyrene was a province and city of Libya in Africa. It is at present called Cairoan, and is situated in the kingdom of Barca. In Cyprus the Greek language was spoken; and from the vicinity of Cyrene to Alexandria, it is probable that the Greek language was spoken there also. From this circumstance it might have happened that they were led more particularly to address the Grecians who were in Antioch. It is possible, however, that they might have heard of the vision which Peter saw, and felt themselves called on to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Spake unto the Grecians - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρὸς τοὺς Ἑλληνιστὰς</span></span> pros tous Hellēnistas. To the Hellenists. This word usually denotes in the New Testament “those Jews residing in foreign lands, who spoke the Greek language.” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>. But to them the gospel had been already preached; and yet in this place it is evidently the intention of Luke to affirm that the people of Cyprus and Cyrene preached to those who were not Jews, and that thus their conduct was distinguished from those (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>) who preached to the Jews only. It is thus manifest that we are here required to understand the Gentiles as those who were addressed by the people of Cyprus and Cyrene. In many mss. the word used here is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ἕλληνας</span></span> Hellēnas, “Greeks,” instead of “Hellenists.” This reading has been adopted by Griesbach, and is found in the Syriac, the Arabic, the Vulgate, and in many of the early fathers. The Aethiopic version reads “to the Gentiles.” There is no doubt that this is the true reading; and that the sacred writer means to say that the gospel was here preached to. Those who were not Jews, for all were called “Greeks” by them who were not Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>. The connection would lead us to suppose that they had heard of what had been done by Peter, and that, imitating his example, they preached the gospel now to the Gentiles also.</p>
