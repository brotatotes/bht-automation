<p style=" "><b>Then tidings ... - </b>The church at Jerusalem heard of this. It was natural that so remarkable an occurrence as the conversion of the Gentiles, and the extraordinary success of the gospel in a splendid and mighty city, should be reported at Jerusalem, and excite deep interest there.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they sent forth - </b>To aid the disciples there, and to give them their sanction. They had done a similar thing in the revival which occurred in Samaria. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:14">Acts 8:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Barnabas - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36-37">Acts 4:36-37</span>. He was a native of Cyprus, and was probably well acquainted with Antioch. He was, therefore, especially qualified for the work on which they sent him.</p>
