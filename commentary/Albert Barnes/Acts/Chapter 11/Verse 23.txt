<p style=" "><b>Had seen the grace of God - </b>The favor, or mercy of God, in converting sinners to himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was glad - </b>Approved of what had been done in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, and rejoiced that God had poured down his Spirit on them. The effect of a revival is to produce joy in the hearts of all those who love the Saviour.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And exhorted them all - </b>Entreated them. They would be exposed to many trials and temptations, and he sought to secure their firm adherence to the cause of religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That with purpose of heart - </b>With a firm mind; with a fixed, settled resolution that they would make this their settled plan of life, their main object. A purpose, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρόθεσις</span></span> prothesis, is a resolution of the mind, a plan, or intention, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Ti 1:9</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:10">2 Timothy 3:10</span>. It is especially a resolution of the mind in regard to future conduct, and the doctrine of Barnabas here was, undoubtedly, that it should be a regular, fixed, determined plan or design in their minds that they would henceforward adhere to God. Such a plan should be formed by all Christians in the beginning of their Christian life, and without such a plan there can be no evidence of piety. We may also remark that such a plan is one of the heart. It is not simply of the understanding, but is of the entire mind, including the will and affections. It is the leading principle; the strongest affection; the guiding purpose of the will to adhere to God, and, unless this is the prevalent, governing desire of the heart, there can be no evidence of conversion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They would cleave - </b>Greek: that they would remain; that is, that they would adhere constantly and faithfully attached to the Lord.</p>
