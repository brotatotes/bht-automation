<p style=" "><b>For he was a good man - </b>This is given as a reason why he was so eminently successful. It is not said that he was a man of distinguished talents or learning; that he was a splendid or an imposing preacher; but simply that he was a man of an amiable, kind, and benevolent disposition - a pious, humble man of God. We should not undervalue talent, eloquence, or learning in the ministry, but we may remark that humble piety will often do more in the conversion of souls than the most splendid talents. No endowments can be a substitute for this. The real power of a minister is concentrated in this, and without this his ministry will be barrenness and a curse. There is nothing on the earth so mighty as goodness. If a man wished to make the most of his powers, the true secret would be found in employing them for a good object, and suffering them to be wholly under the direction of benevolence. John Howard’s purpose “to do good” has made a more permanent impression on the interests of the world than the talents of Alexander or Caesar.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Full of the Holy Ghost - </b>Was entirely under the influence of the Holy Spirit. This is the second qualification mentioned here of a good minister. He was not merely exemplary for mildness and kindness of temper, but he was eminently a man of God. He was filled with the influences of the sacred Spirit, producing zeal, love, peace, joy, etc. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22-23">Galatians 5:22-23</span>. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of faith - </b>Confidence in the truth and promises of God. This is the third qualification mentioned; and this was another cause of his success. He confided in God. He depended, not on his own strength, but on the strength of the arm of God. With these qualifications he engaged in his work, and he was successful. These qualifications should be sought by the ministry of the gospel. Others should not indeed be neglected, but a man’s ministry will usually be successful only as he seeks to possess those endowments which distinguished Barnabas - a kind, tender, benevolent heart; devoted piety; the fulness of the Spirit’s influence; and strong, unwavering confidence in the promises and power of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And much people - </b>Many people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was added unto the Lord - </b>Became Christians.</p>
