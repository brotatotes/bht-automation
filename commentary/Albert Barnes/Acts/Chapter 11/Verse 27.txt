<p style=" "><b>And in these days - </b>While Barnabas and Saul were at Antioch.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Came prophets - </b>The word “prophet” denotes properly “one who foretells future events.” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>. It is sometimes used in the New Testament to denote simply “religious teachers, instructors sent from God, without particular reference to future events.” To teach the people in the doctrines of religion was a part of the prophetic office, and this idea was only sometimes denoted by the use of the word. See <span class="_0000ff"><u>Rom 12:6</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 13:2</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>. These prophets seem to have been endowed in a remarkable manner with the knowledge of future events; with the power of explaining mysteries; and in some cases with the power of speaking foreign languages. In this case, it seems that one of them at least had the power of foretelling future events.</p>
