<p style=" "><b>And Herod was highly displeased ... - </b>Greek: “bore a hostile mind,” intending war. See the margin. The Greek word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμομαχῶν</span></span> thumomachōn does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means to meditate war; to purpose war in the mind; or here, probably, to be enraged or angry at them. What was the cause of this hostility to the people of Tyre and Sidon is not mentioned, and conjecture is useless. It is not at all inconsistent, however, with the well known character of Herod. It was probably from some cause relating to commerce. Tyre and Sidon were under the Roman power, and had some shadow of liberty (Grotius), and it is probable that they might have embarrassed Herod in some of his regulations respecting commerce.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Tyre and Sidon - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span>. They were north of Caesarea.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They came with one accord - </b>Fearing the effects of his anger, they united in sending an embassage to him to make peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Blastus, the king’s chamberlain - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>. The word “chamberlain” denotes an officer who is charged with the direction and management of a chamber or chambers, particularly a bed-chamber. It denotes here a man who had charge of the bed chamber of Herod.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because their country was nourished ... - </b>Was supplied by the territories of Herod. The country of Tyre and Sidon included a narrow strip of land on the coast of the Mediterranean. Of course they were dependent for provisions, and for articles of commerce, on the interior country; but this belonged to the kingdom of Herod; and as they were entirely dependent on his country, as he had power to dry up the sources of their support and commerce, they were the more urgent to secure his favor.</p>
