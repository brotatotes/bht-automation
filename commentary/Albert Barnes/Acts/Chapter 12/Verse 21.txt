<p style=" "><b>And upon a set day - </b>An appointed, public day. This was the second day of the sports and games which Herod celebrated in Caesarea in honor of Claudius Caesar. Josephus has given an account of this occurrence, which coincides remarkably with the narrative here. The account is contained in his “Antiquities of the Jews,” book 19, chapter 8, section 2, and is as follows: “Now when Agrippa had reigned three years over all Judea, he came to the city Caesarea, which was formerly called Strato’s Tower; and there he exhibited shows in honor of Caesar, upon his being informed that there was a certain festival celebrated to make vows for his safety. At which festival a great multitude was gotten together of the principal persons, and such as were of dignity throughout his province. On the second day of which shows he put on a garment made wholly of silver,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Arrayed in royal apparel - </b>In the apparel of a king. Josephus thus describes the dress which Herod wore on that occasion. “He put on a garment made wholly of silver, and of wonderful contexture, and early in the morning came into the theater place of the shows and games, at which time the silver of his garment, being illuminated by the first reflection of the sun’s rays upon it, shone after a surprising manner, and was so resplendent as to spread a horror over those that looked intently on him.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sat upon his throne - </b>This does not denote a throne in the usual sense of that word, but “a high seat” in the theater, where he sat, and from whence he could have a full view of the games and sports. From this place he made his speech.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Made an oration - </b>Addressed the people.’ What was the subject of this speech is not intimated by Luke or Josephus.</p>
