<p style=" "><b>And immediately the angel of the Lord - </b>Diseases and death axe in the Scriptures often attributed to an angel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+24:16">2 Samuel 24:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+21:12">1 Chronicles 21:12</span>, <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ch 21:15</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+21:20">1 Chronicles 21:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+21:27">1 Chronicles 21:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+32:21">2 Chronicles 32:21</span>. It is not intended that there was a miracle in this case, but it certainly is intended by the sacred writer that his death was a divine judgment on him for his receiving homage as a god. Josephus says of him that he “did neither rebuke them the people nor reject their impious flattery. A severe pain arose in his belly, and began in a most violent manner. And when he was quite worn out by the pain in his belly for five days, he departed this life, in the 54th year of his age, and the 7th year of his reign.” Josephus does not mention that it was done by an angel, but says that when he looked up, he saw an owl sitting on a rope over his head, and judging it to be an evil omen, he immediately became melancholy, and was seized with the pain.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because he gave not God the glory - </b>Because he was willing to receive the worship due to God. It was the more sinful in him as he was a Jew, and was acquainted with the true God, and with the evils of idolatry. He was proud, and willing to be flattered, and even adored. He had sought their applause; he had arrayed himself in this splendid manner to excite admiration; and when they carried it even so far as to offer divine homage, he did not reject the impious flattery, but listened stir to their praises. Hence, he was judged; and God vindicated his own insulted honor by inflicting severe pains on him, and by a most awful death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he was eaten of worms - </b>The word used here is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. A similar disease is recorded of Antiochus Epiphanes, in the Apocrypha, 2 Macc. 9:5, “But the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, smote him with an invisible and incurable plague; for a pain in the bowels that was remediless came upon him, and sore torments of the inner parts <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:9">Acts 12:9</span>, so that worms rose up out of the body of this wicked man,” etc. Probably this was the disease known as morbus pedicularis. It is loathsome, offensive, and most painful. See the death of Antiochus Epiphanes described in 2 Macc. 9. With this disease also Herod the Great, grandfather of Herod Agrippa, died (Josephus, <i>Antiq.</i>, book 17, chapter 6, section 5). Such a death, so painful, so sudden, and so loathsome, was an appropriate judgment on the pride of Herod. We may here learn:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That sudden and violent deaths are often acts of direct divine judgment on wicked people.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That people, when they seek praise and flattery, expose themselves to the displeasure of God. His glory he will not give to another, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:8">Isaiah 42:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) That the most proud, and mighty, and magnificent princes have no security of their lives. God can in a moment - even when they are surrounded by their worshippers and flatterers - touch the seat of life, and turn them to loathsomeness and putrefaction. What a pitiable being is a man of pride receiving from his fellow-men that homage which is due to God alone! See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:0">Isaiah 14:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Pride and vanity, in any station of life, are hateful in the sight of God. Nothing is more inappropriate to our situation as lost, dying sinners, and nothing will more certainly meet the wrath of heaven.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) We have here a strong confirmation of the truth of the sacred narrative. In all essential particulars Luke coincides in his account of the death of Herod with Josephus. This is one of the many circumstances which show that the sacred Scriptures were written at the time when they professed to be, and that they accord with the truth. See Lardner’s Credibility, part 1, chapter 1, section 6.</p>
