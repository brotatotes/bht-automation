<p style=" "><b>Returned from Jerusalem - </b>They had gone to Jerusalem to carry alms, and they now returned to Antioch, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When they had fulfilled their ministry - </b>When they had accomplished the purpose for which they had been sent there; that is, to deposit the alms of the church at Antioch in the hands of the eiders of the churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>John, whose surname was Mark - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>. From this period the sacred historian records chiefly the labors of Paul. The labors of the other apostles are, after this, seldom referred to in this book, and the attention is fixed almost entirely on the trials and travels of the great apostle of the Gentiles. His important services, his unwearied efforts, his eminent success, and the fact that Luke was his companion, may be the reasons why his labors are made so prominent in the history. Through the previous chapters we have seen the church rise from small beginnings, until it was even now spreading into surrounding regions. We have seen it survive two persecutions, commenced and conducted with all the power and malice of Jewish rulers. We have seen the most zealous of the persecutors converted to the faith which he once destroyed, and the royal persecutor put to death by the divine judgment. And we have thus seen that God was the protector of the church; that no weapon formed against it could prosper; that, according to the promise of the Redeemer, the gates of hell could not prevail against it. In that God and Saviour who then defended the church, we may still confide, and may be assured that he who was then its friend has it still “engraved on the palms of his hands,” and designs that it shall extend until it fills the earth with light and salvation.</p>
