In scenes of danger there is no other refuge; and the result shows that even in most discouraging circumstances God can hear prayer. Nothing scarcely could appear more hopeless than the idea of rescuing Peter out of the hands of Herod, and out of the prison, and out of the custody of sixteen men, by prayer. But the prayer of faith Was prevalent with God.</p>

The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐκτενής</span></span> ektenēs is found in only one other place in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:8">1 Peter 4:8</span>, “Have fervent charity among yourselves.” The word has rather the idea that their prayer was earnest and fervent than that it was constant.</p>
