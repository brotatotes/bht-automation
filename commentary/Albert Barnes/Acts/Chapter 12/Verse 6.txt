<p style=" "><b>And when Herod would have brought him forth - </b>When he was about to bring him to be put to death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The same night - </b>That is, the night preceding. The intention of Herod was to bring him out as soon as the Passover was over; but during the night which immediately preceded the day in which he intended to bring him to punishment, Peter was rescued.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Peter was sleeping - </b>Here is an instance of remarkable composure, and an illustration of the effects of peace of conscience and of confidence in God. It was doubtless known to Peter what the intention of Herod was. James had just been put to death, and Peter had no reason to expect a better fate. And yet in this state he slept as quietly as if there had been no danger, and it was necessary that he should be roused even by an angel to contemplate his condition and to make his escape. There is nothing that will give quiet rest and gentle sleep so certainly as a conscience void of offence; and in the midst of imminent dangers, he who confides in God may rest securely and calmly. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+3:5">Psalms 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+4:8">Psalms 4:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Between two soldiers - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:4">Acts 12:4</span>. Peter was bound to the two. His left hand was chained to the right hand of one of the soldiers, and his right hand to the left hand of the other. This was a common mode of securing prisoners among the Romans. See abundant authorities for this quoted in Lardnerâ€™s Credibility, part 1, chapter 10: section 9, London edition, 1829, vol. i. p. 242, 243, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the keepers ... - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:4">Acts 12:4</span>. Two soldiers were stationed at the door. We may see now that every possible precaution was used to ensure the safe custody of Peter:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) He was in prison.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He was under the charge of sixteen men, who could relieve each other when weary, and thus every security was given that he could not escape by inattention on their part.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) He was bound fast between two men. And,</p>
<p style=" ">(4) He was further guarded by two others, whose business it was to watch the door of the prison. It is to be remembered, also, that it was death for a Roman soldier to be found sleeping at his post. But God can deliver in spite of all the precautions of people; and it is easy for him to overcome the most cunning devices of his enemies.</p>
