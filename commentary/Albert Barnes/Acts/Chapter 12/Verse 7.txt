<p style=" "><b>And, behold, the angel of the Lord - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:19">Acts 5:19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Came upon him - </b>Greek: was present with him; stood near him <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπέστη</span></span> epestē.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And a light shined in the prison - </b>Many have supposed that this was lightning. But light, and splendor, and shining apparel are commonly represented as the accompaniments of the heavenly beings when they visit the earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:3">Mark 9:3</span>. It is highly probable that this light was discerned only by Peter; and it would be to him an undoubted proof of the divine interposition in his behalf.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he smote Peter on the side - </b>This was, doubtless, a gentle blow or stroke to arouse him from sleep.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his chains ... - </b>This could have been only by divine power. No natural means were used, or could have been used without arousing the guard. It is a sublime expression of the ease with which God can deliver from danger, and rescue his friends. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:26">Acts 16:26</span>.</p>
