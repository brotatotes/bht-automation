<p style=" "><b>O full of all subtilty and all mischief - </b>The word “subtilty” denotes “deceit and fraud,” and implies that he was practicing an imposition, and that he knew it. The word rendered “mischief” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ῥᾳδιουργίας</span></span> radiourgias denotes properly “facility of acting,” and then “sleight of hand; sly;, cunning arts, by which one imposes on another, and deceives him with a fraudulent intention.” It is not used elsewhere in the New Testament. The art of Elymas consisted probably in sleight of hand, legerdemain, or trick, aided by skill in the abstruse sciences, by which the ignorant might be easily imposed on. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Child of the devil - </b>Under his influence; practicing his arts; promoting his designs by deceit and imposture, so that he may be called your father. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>. Satan is represented here as the author of deceit and the father of lies.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Enemy of all righteousness - </b>Practicing deceit and iniquity, and thus opposed to righteousness and honesty. A man who lives by wickedness will, of course, be the foe of every form of integrity. A man who lives by fraud will be opposed to the truth; a panderer to the vices of people will hate the rules of chastity and purity; a manufacturer or vendor of ardent spirits will be the enemy of temperance societies.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Wilt thou not cease to pervert - </b>In what way he had opposed Paul and Barnabas is not known. It may have been either by misrepresenting their doctrines, or by representing them as apostate Jews thus retarding or hindering the progress of the gospel. The expression “wilt thou not cease.” implies that he had been engaged sedulously in doing this, probably from the commencement of their work in the city.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The right ways of the Lord - </b>The straight paths or doctrines of the Christian religion, in opposition to the crooked and perverse arts of deceivers and impostors. Straight paths denote “integrity, sincerity, truth,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:9">Jeremiah 31:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13">Hebrews 12:13</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:3-4">Isaiah 40:3-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:16">Isaiah 42:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:5">Luke 3:5</span>.
