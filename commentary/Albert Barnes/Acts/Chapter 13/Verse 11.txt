<p style=" "><b>The hand of the Lord is upon thee - </b>God shall punish thee. By this sudden and miraculous punishment he would be awed and humbled, and the proconsul and others would be convinced that he was an impostor, and that the gospel was true. His wickedness deserved such punishment; and at the same time that due punishment was inflicted, it was designed that the gospel should be extended by this means. In all this there was the highest evidence that Paul was under the inspiration of God. He was full of the Holy Spirit; he detected the secret feelings and desires of the heart of Elymas; and he inflicted on him a punishment that could have proceeded from none but God. That the apostles had the power of inflicting punishment is apparent from various places in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>. The punishment inflicted on Elymas, also, would be highly emblematic of the darkness and perverseness of his conduct.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not seeing the sun for a season - </b>For how long a time this blindness was to continue is nowhere specified. It was, however, in mercy ordained that the blindness should not be permanent and final; and though it was a punishment, it was at the same time benevolent, for nothing would be more likely to lead him to reflection and repentance than such a state of blindness. It was such a manifest proof that God was opposed to him it was such a sudden divine judgment; it so completely cut him off from all possibility of practicing his arts of deception, that it was adapted to bring him to repentance. Accordingly there is a tradition in the early church that he became a Christian. Origen says that “Paul, by a word striking him blind, by anguish converted him to godliness” (Clark).</p>
<p style=" "><b>A mist - </b>The word used here properly denotes “a darkness or obscurity of the air; a cloud,” etc. But it also denotes “an extinction of sight by the drying up or disturbance of the tumors of the eye” (Hippocrates, as quoted by Schleusner).</p>
<p style=" "><b>And a darkness - </b>Blindness, night. What was the precise cause or character of this miracle is not specified.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he went about ... - </b>This is a striking account of the effect of the miracle. The change was so sudden that he knew not where to go. He sought someone to guide him in the paths with which he had before been familiar. How soon can God bring down the pride of man, and make him as helpless as an infant! How easily can He touch our senses, the organs of our most exquisite pleasures, and wither away all our enjoyments! How dependent are we upon Him for the inestimable blessing of sight! And how easily can He annihilate all the sinner’s pleasures, break up all his plans, and humble him in the dust! Sight is his gift; and it is a mercy unspeakably great that He does not overwhelm us in thick darkness, and destroy forever all the pleasure that through this organ is conveyed to the soul.</p>
