<p style=" "><b>Paul and his company - </b>Those with him - Barnabas and John - and perhaps others who had been converted at Paphos; for it was common for many of the converts to Christianity to attend on the apostles in their travels. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:3">Acts 9:3</span> O.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Loosed from Paphos - </b>Departed from Paphos. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:6">Acts 13:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They came to Perga in Pamphylia - </b>Pamphylia was a province of Asia Minor, lying over against Cyprus, having Cilicia east, Lycia west, Pisidia north, and the Mediterranean south. Perga was the metropolis of Pamphylia, and was situated, not on the seacoast, but on the river Cestus, at some distance from its mouth. There was on a mountain near it a celebrated temple of Diana.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And John departing from them ... - </b>Why he departed from them is unknown. It might have been from fear of danger; or from alarm in traveling so far into unknown regions. But it is plain from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span>, that it was from some cause which was deemed blameworthy, and that his conduct now was such as to make Paul unwilling again to have him as a companion.</p>
