<p style=" "><b>The God of this people - </b>Who has manifested himself as the special friend and protector of this nation. This implied a belief that he had been particularly their God; a favorite doctrine of the Jews, and one that would conciliate their favor toward Paul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of Israel - </b>The Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Chose our fathers - </b>Selected the nation to be a chosen and special people to himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:6-7">Deuteronomy 7:6-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And exalted the people - </b>Raised them up from a low and depressed state of bondage, to freedom, and to special privileges as a nation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν τῇ παροικίᾳ</span></span> en tē paroikia. This properly refers to their dwelling there as foreigners. They were always strangers there in a strange land. It was not their home. They never mingled with the people; never became constituent parts of the government; never used their language; never united with their usages and laws. They were a strange, separate, depressed people there; not less so than Africans are strangers and foreigners a depressed and degraded people in this land (America), <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+36:7">Genesis 36:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:4">Exodus 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:21">Exodus 22:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:9">Exodus 23:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:34">Leviticus 19:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:19">Deuteronomy 10:19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And with an high arm - </b>This expression denotes “great power.” The arm denotes “strength,” as that by which we perform anything. A high arm, an arm lifted up, or stretched out, denotes that “strength exerted to the utmost.” The children of Israel are represented as having been delivered with an “outstretched arm,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+26:8">Deuteronomy 26:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:6">Exodus 6:6</span>. “With a strong hand,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:1">Exodus 6:1</span>. Reference is made in these places to the plagues inflicted on Egypt, by which the Israelites were delivered; to their passage through the Red Sea; to their victories over their enemies, etc.</p>
