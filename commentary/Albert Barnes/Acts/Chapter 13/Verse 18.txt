<p style=" "><b>And about the time of forty years - </b>They were this time going from Egypt to the land of Canaan. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:35">Exodus 16:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+33:38">Numbers 33:38</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Suffered he their manners - </b>This passage has been very variously rendered. See the margin. Syriac, “He nourished them,” etc. Arabic, “He blessed them, and nourished them,” etc. The Greek word is not elsewhere used in the New Testament. It properly means to tolerate, or endure the conduct of anyone, implying that that conduct is evil, and tends to provoke to punishment. This is doubtless its meaning here. Probably Paul referred to the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+1:31">Deuteronomy 1:31</span>, “The Lord thy God bare thee.” But instead of this word, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐτροποφόρησεν</span></span> etropophorēsen to bear with, many mss. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐτροφοφόρησεν</span></span> etrofoforēsen), “he sustained or nourished.” This reading was followed by the Syriac, Arabic, and has been admitted by Griesbach into the text. This is also found in the Septuagint, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+1:31">Deuteronomy 1:31</span>, which place Paul doubtless referred to. This would well suit the connection of the passage; and a change of a single letter might easily have occurred in a ms. It adds to the probability that this is the true reading, that it accords with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+1:31">Deuteronomy 1:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:12">Numbers 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:10">Deuteronomy 32:10</span>. It is furthermore not probable that Paul would have commenced a discourse by reminding them of the obstinacy and wickedness of the nation. Such a course would rather tend to exasperate than to conciliate; but by reminding them of the mercies of God to them, and showing them that He had been their protector, he was better fitting them for his main purpose - that of showing them the kindness of the God of their fathers in sending to them a Saviour.</p>
