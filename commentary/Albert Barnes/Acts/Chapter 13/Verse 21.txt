<p style=" "><b>Saul, the son of Cis - </b>is the Greek mode of writing the Hebrew name Kish. In the Old Testament it is uniformly written as “Kish,” and it is to be regretted that this has not been retained in the New Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:1">1 Samuel 9:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the space of forty years - </b>During forty years. The Old Testament has not mentioned the time during which Saul reigned. Josephus says (<i>Antiq.</i>, book 6, chapter 14, section 9) that he reigned for 18 years while Samuel was alive, and 22 years after his death. But Dr. Doddridge (note in loco) has shown that this cannot be correct, and that he probably reigned, as some copies of Josephus have it, but two years after the death of Samuel. Many critics suppose that the term of 40 years mentioned here includes also the time in which Samuel judged the people. This supposition does not violate the text in this place, and may be probable. See Doddridge and Grotius on the place.</p>
