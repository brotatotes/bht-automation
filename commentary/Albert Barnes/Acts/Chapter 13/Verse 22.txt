<p style=" "><b>And when he had removed him - </b>This was done because he rebelled against God in sparing the sheep and oxen and valuable property of Amalek, together with Agag the king, when he was commanded to destroy all, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:8-23">1 Samuel 15:8-23</span>. He was put to death in a battle with the Philistines, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+31:1-6">1 Samuel 31:1-6</span>. The phrase “when he removed him” refers probably to his rejection as a king, and not to his death; for David was anointed king before the death of Saul, and almost immediately after the rejection of Saul on account of his rebellion in the business of Amalek. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:12-13">1 Samuel 16:12-13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He gave testimony - </b>He bore witness, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:14">1 Samuel 13:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I have found David ... - </b>This is not quoted literally, but contains the substance of what is expressed in various places. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:14">1 Samuel 13:14</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:20">Psalms 89:20</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:1">1 Samuel 16:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:12">1 Samuel 16:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A man after mine own heart - </b>This expression is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:14">1 Samuel 13:14</span>. The connection shows that it means simply a man who would not be rebellious and disobedient as Saul was, but would do the will of God and keep his commandments. This refers, doubtless, rather to the public than to the private character of David; to his character as a king. It means that he would make the will of God the great rule and law of his reign, in contradistinction from Saul, who, as a king, had disobeyed God. At the same time it is true that the prevailing character of David, as a pious, humble, devoted man, was that he was a man after God’s own heart, and was beloved by him as a holy man. He had faults; he committed sin; but who is free from it? He was guilty of great offences; but he also evinced, in a degree equally eminent, repentance (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:0">Psalms 51:0</span>); and not less in his private than his public character did he evince those traits which were prevailingly such as accorded with the heart, that is, the earnest desires, of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which shall fulfill all my will - </b>Saul had not done it. He had disobeyed God in a case where he had received an express command. The characteristic of David would be that he would obey the commands of God. That David did this - that he maintained the worship of God, opposed idolatry, and sought to promote universal obedience to God among the people is expressly recorded of him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+14:8-9">1 Kings 14:8-9</span>, “And thou Jeroboam<b> </b>hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes,” etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+15:3">1 Kings 15:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+15:5">1 Kings 15:5</span>.</p>
