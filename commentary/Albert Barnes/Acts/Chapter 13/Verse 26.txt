<p style=" "><b>Children of the stock of Abraham - </b>Descendants of Abraham; you who regard Abraham as your ancestor. He means here to address particularly the native-born Jews; and this appellation is used because they valued themselves highly on account of their descent from Abraham (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>); and because the promise of the Messiah had been specially given to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And whosoever ... - </b>Proselytes. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16">Acts 13:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is the word of this salvation sent - </b>This message of salvation. It was sent particularly to the Jewish people. The Saviour was sent to that nation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:24">Matthew 15:24</span>; and the design was to offer to them first the message of life. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>.</p>
