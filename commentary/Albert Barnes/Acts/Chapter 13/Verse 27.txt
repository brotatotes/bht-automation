<p style=" "><b>Because they knew him not - </b>The statement in this verse is designed, not to reproach the Jews at Jerusalem, but to introduce the fact that Jesus had died, and had risen again. With great wisdom and tenderness, Paul speaks of the murderers of the Saviour in such a manner as not to exasperate, but, as far as possible, to mitigate their crime. There was sufficient guilt in the murder of the Son of God to fill the nation with alarm, even after all that could be said to mitigate the deed. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36-37">Acts 2:36-37</span>. When Paul says, “They knew him not,” he means that they did not know him to be the Messiah (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>); they were ignorant of the true meaning of the prophecies of the Old Testament; they regarded him as an impostor. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:17">Acts 3:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor yet the voices of the prophets - </b>The meaning of the predictions of the Old Testament respecting the Messiah. They expected a prince and a conqueror, but did not expect a Messiah that was poor and despised; that was a man of sorrows and that was to die on a cross.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which are read every sabbath-day - </b>In the synagogues. Though the Scriptures were read so constantly, yet they were ignorant of their true meaning. They were blinded by pride, and prejudice, and preconceived opinions. People may often in this way read the Bible a good part of their lives and never understand it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They have fulfilled them ... - </b>By putting him to death they have accomplished what was foretold.</p>
