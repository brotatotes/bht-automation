For David ... - This verse is designed to show that the passage in Psalms 16:1-11; could not refer to David, and must therefore relate to some other person. In Acts 13:37 it is affirmed that this could refer to no one, in fact, but to the Lord Jesus.After he had served his own generation - See the margin. Syriac, “David in his own generation having served the will of God, and slept,” etc. Arabic, “David served in his own age, and saw God.” The margin probably most correctly expresses the sense of the passage. To serve a generation, or an age, is an unusual and almost unintelligible expression.Fell on sleep - Greek: “slept,” that is, “died.” This is the usual word to denote “the death of saints.” It is used of David in 1 Kings 2:10. See notes on Matthew 27:52.And was laid unto ... - And was buried with his fathers, etc., 1 Kings 2:10.And saw corruption - Remained in the grave, and returned to his native dust. See this point argued more at length by Peter in Acts 2:29-31, and explained in the notes on that place.
