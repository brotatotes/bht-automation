<p style=" "><b>Behold, ye despisers - </b>Hebrew, “Behold, ye among the pagan.” The change from this expression to “ye despisers” was made by the Septuagint translators by a very slight alteration in the Hebrew word - probably from a variation in the copy which they used. It arose from reading <span class="_800000">בּוגדים</span> bowg<sup>a</sup>diym instead of <span class="_800000">בגּוים</span> bagowyim. The Syriac, the Arabic, as well as the Septuagint, follow this reading.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And wonder - </b>Hebrew, “And regard, and wonder marvelously.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And perish - </b>Thin is not in the Hebrew, but is in the Septuagint and the Arabic. The word means literally “to be removed from the sight; to disappear; and then to corrupt, defile, destroy,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:16">Matthew 6:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>. The word, however, may mean “to be suffused with shame; to be overwhelmed and confounded” (Schleusner); and it may perhaps have this meaning here, corresponding to the Hebrew. The word used here is not what is commonly employed to denote “eternal perdition,” though Paul seems to use it with reference to their destruction for rejecting the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For I work a work - </b>I do a thing. The thing to which the prophet Habakkuk referred was, that God would bring upon them the Chaldeans, that would destroy the temple and nation. In like manner Paul says that God in that time might bring upon the nation similar calamities. By rejecting the Messiah and his gospel, and by persevering in wickedness, they would bring upon themselves the destruction of the temple, the city, and the nation. It was this threatened destruction doubtless to which the apostle referred.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which ye shall in no wise believe - </b>Which you will not believe. So remarkable, so unusual, so surpassing anything which had occurred. The original reference in Habakkuk is to the destruction of the temple by the Chaldeans; a thing which the Jews would not suppose could happen. The temple was so splendid; it had been so manifestly built by the direction of God; it had been so long under his protection, that they would suppose that it could not be given into the hands of their enemies to be demolished; and even though it were predicted by a prophet of God, still they would not believe it. The same feelings the Jews would have respecting the temple and city in the time of Paul. Though it was foretold by the Messiah, yet they were so confident that it was protected by God, that they would not believe that it could possibly be destroyed. The same infatuation seems to have possessed them during the siege of the city by the Romans.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Though a man ... - </b>Though it be plainly predicted. We may learn:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That people may be greatly amazed and impressed by the doings or works of God, and yet be destroyed.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) There may be a prejudice so obstinate that even a divine revelation will not remove it.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The fancied security of sinners will not save them.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) There are people who will not believe in the possibility of their being lost, though it be declared by prophets, by apostles, by the Saviour, and by God. They will still remain in fancied security, and suffer nothing to alarm or rouse them. But,</p>
<p style=" ">(5) As the fancied security of the Jew furnished no safety against the Babylonians or the Romans, so it is true that the indifference and unconcern of sinners will not furnish any security against the dreadful wrath of God. Yet there are multitudes who live amidst the displays of God’s power and mercy in the redemption of sinners, and who witness the effects of his goodness and truth in revivals of religion, who live to despise it all; who are amazed and confounded by it; and who perish.</p>
