<p style=" "><b>They were filled with envy - </b>Greek: “zeal.” The word here denotes “wrath in dignation,” that such multitudes should be disposed to hear a message which they rejected, and which threatened to overthrow their religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Spake against - </b>Opposed the doctrine that Jesus was the Messiah; that the Messiah would be humble, lowly, despised, and put to death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Contradicting - </b>Contradicting the apostles. This was evidently done in their presence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>, and would cause great tumult and disorder.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And blaspheming - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:3">Matthew 9:3</span>. The sense evidently is, that they reproached and vilified Jesus of Nazareth; they spake of him with contempt and scorn. To speak thus of him is denominated blasphemy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:65">Luke 22:65</span>. When people are enraged, they have little regard for the words which they utter, and care little how they may be regarded by God. When people attached themselves to a sect or a party, in religion or politics, and they have no good arguments to employ, they attempt to overwhelm their adversaries by bitter and reproachful words. People in the heat of strife, and in professed zeal for special doctrines, more frequently utter blasphemy than they are aware. Precious and pure doctrines are often thus vilified fled because we do not believe them; and the heart of the Saviour is pierced anew, and his cause bleeds, by the wrath and wickedness of his professed friends. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>.</p>
