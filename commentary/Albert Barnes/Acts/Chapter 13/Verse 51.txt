But they shook off the dust ... - See the notes on Matthew 10:14.And came unto Iconium - This was the capital of Lycaonia. It is now called Konieh, and is the capital of Caramania. “Konieh extends to the east and south over the plain far beyond the walls, which are about two miles in circumference ... Mountains covered with snow rise on every side, excepting toward the east, where a plain, as flat as the desert of Arabia, extends far beyond the reach of the eye” (Capt. Kinnear). “Little, if anything, remains of Greek or Roman Iconium, if we except the ancient inscriptions and the fragments of sculptures which are built into the Turkish walls.” “The city wall is said to have been erected by the Seljukian sultans: it seems to have been built from the ruins of more ancient buildings, as broken columns, capitals, pedestals, bas-reliefs, and other pieces of sculpture contribute toward its construction. It has 80 gates, of a square form, each known by a separate name, and, as well as most of the towers, embellished with Arabic inscriptions ... I observed a few Greek characters on the walls, but they were in so elevated a situation that I could not decipher them” (Capt. Kinneir). See Colonel Leake’s description; and also the work of Col. Chesney (1850) on the Euphrates Expedition, vol. i, p. 348, 349.
