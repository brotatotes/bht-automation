Then the priest of Jupiter - He whose office it was to conduct the worship of Jupiter by offering sacrifices, etc.Which was before their city - The word “which” here refers not to the priest, but to Jupiter. The temple or image of Jupiter was in front of their city, or near the gates. Ancient cities were supposed to be under the protection of particular gods; and their image, or a temple for their worship, was placed commonly in a conspicuous place at the entrance of the city.Brought oxen - Probably brought two one to be sacrificed to each. It was common to sacrifice bullocks to Jupiter.And garlands - The victims of sacrifice were usually decorated with ribbons and chaplets of flowers. See Kuinoel.Unto the gates - The gates of the city, where were the images or temple of the gods.Would have done sacrifice - Would have offered sacrifice to Barnabas and Paul. This the priest deemed a part of his office. And here we have a remarkable and most affecting instance of the folly and stupidity of idolatry.
