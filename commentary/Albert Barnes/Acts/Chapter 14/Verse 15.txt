<p style=" "><b>And saying, Sirs - </b>Greek: Men.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Why do ye these things? - </b>This is an expression of solemn remonstrance at the folly of their conduct in worshipping those who were human. The abhorrence which they evinced at this may throw strong light on the rank and character of the Lord Jesus Christ. When an offer was made to worship Paul and Barnabas, they shrank from it with strong expressions of aversion and indignation. Yet when similar worship was offered to the Lord Jesus; when he was addressed by Thomas in the language of worship, “My Lord and my God” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>, he uttered not the slightest reproof. Nay, he approved it, and expressed his approbation of others who should also do it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:29">John 20:29</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>. How can this difference be accounted for except on the supposition that the Lord Jesus was divine? Would he, if a mere man, receive homage as God, when his disciples rejected it with horror?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of like passions with you - </b>We are human beings like yourselves. We have no claim, no pretensions to anything more. The word “passions” here means simply that they had the common feelings and propensities of people - the nature of people; the affections of people. It does not mean that they were subject to any improper passions, to ill temper, etc., as some have supposed; but that they did not pretend to be gods. “We need food and drink; we are exposed to pain, and sickness, and death.” The Latin Vulgate renders it, “We are mortal like yourselves.” The expression stands opposed to the proper conception of God, who is not subject to these affections, who is most blessed and immortal. Such a Being only is to be worshipped; and the apostles remonstrated strongly with them on the folly of paying religious homage to beings like themselves. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:17">James 5:17</span>, “Elias (Elijah) was a man subject to like passions as we are, etc.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye should turn from these vanities - </b>That you should cease to worship idols. Idols are often called vanities, or vain things, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:21">Deuteronomy 32:21</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Ki 17:15</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+16:13">1 Kings 16:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+16:26">1 Kings 16:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:5">Jeremiah 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+8:19">Jeremiah 8:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+10:8">Jeremiah 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jon+2:8">Jonah 2:8</span>. They are called vanities, a lie, or lying vanities, as opposed to the living and true God, because they are unreal; because they have no power to help: because confidence in them is vain.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto the living God - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:9">1 Thessalonians 1:9</span>. He is called the living God to distinguish him from idols. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which made heaven ... - </b>Who thus showed that he was the only proper object of worship. This doctrine, that there is one God who has made all things, was new to them. They worshipped multitudes of divinities; and though they regarded Jupiter as the father of gods and human beings, yet they had no conception that all things had been created by the will of one Infinite Being.</p>
