<p style=" "><b>Nevertheless - </b>Though he gave them no revelation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He left not himself without witness - </b>He gave demonstration of his existence and of his moral character.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In that he did good - </b>By doing good. The manner in which he did it, Paul immediately specifies. Idols did not do good; they conferred no favors, and were, therefore, unworthy of confidence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And gave us rain from heaven - </b>Rain from above - from the clouds, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:11">Mark 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:54">Luke 9:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:29">Luke 17:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:11">Luke 21:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:31-32">John 6:31-32</span>. Rain is one of the evidences of the goodness of God. Man could not cause it; and without it, regulated at proper intervals of time and in proper quantities, the earth would soon be one wide scene of desolation. There is scarcely anything which more certainly indicates unceasing care and wisdom than the needful and refreshing showers of rain. The sun and stars move by fixed laws, whose operation we can see and anticipate. The falling of rain is regulated by laws which We cannot trace, and it seems, therefore, to be poured, as it were, directly from God’s hollow hand, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+147:8">Psalms 147:8</span>, “Who covereth the heaven with clouds; who prepareth rain for the earth.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And fruitful seasons - </b>Seasons when the earth produces abundance. It is remarkable, and a striking proof of the divine goodness, that so few seasons are unfruitful. The earth yields her increase; the labors of the farmer are crowned with success; and the goodness of God demands the expressions of praise. God does not forget his ancient covenant <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:22">Genesis 8:22</span>, though man forgets it, and disregards his great Benefactor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Filling our hearts with food - </b>The word “hearts” is used here as a Hebraism, to denote “persons” themselves; filling us with food, etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:40">Matthew 12:40</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Gladness - </b>Joy; comfort the comfort arising from the supply of our constantly returning needs. This is proof of everwatchful goodness. It is a demonstration at once that there is a God, and that he is good. It would be easy for God to withdraw these blessings, and leave us to want. A single word, or a single deviation from the fullness of benevolence, would blast all these comforts, and leave us to lamentation, woe, and death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:27-29">Psalms 104:27-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+145:15-16">Psalms 145:15-16</span>.</p>
