<p style=" "><b>And widen they had ordained - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροτονήσαντες</span></span> cheirotonēsantes. The word “ordain” we now use in an ecclesiastical sense, to denote “a setting apart to an office by the imposition of hands.” But it is evident that the word here is not employed in that sense. That imposition of hands might have occurred in setting apart afterward to this office is certainly possible, but it is not implied in the word employed here, and did not take place in the transaction to which this word refers. The word occurs in only one other place in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>, where it is applied to Luke, and translated, “who was also chosen of the church (that is, appointed or elected by suffrage by the churches) to travel with us, etc.” The verb properly denotes “to stretch out the hand”; and as it was customary to elect to office, or to vote, by stretching out or elevating the hand, so the word simply means “to elect, appoint, or designate to any office.” The word here refers simply to an “election” or “appointment” of the elders. It is said, indeed, that Paul and Barnabas did this. But probably all that is meant by it is that they presided in the assembly when the choice was made. It does not mean that they appointed them without consulting the church; but it evidently means that they appointed them in the usual way of appointing officers, by the suffrages of the people. See Schleusner, and the notes of Doddridge and Calvin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ordained them - </b>Appointed for the disciples, or for the church. It is not meant that the elders were ordained for the apostles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Elders - </b>Greek: presbyters. Literally, this word refers to the aged. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>. But it may also be a word relating to office, denoting those who were more experienced than others, and who were chosen to preside over and to instruct the rest. What was the nature of this office, and what was the design of the appointment, is not intimated in this word. All that seems to be implied is, that they were to take the charge of the churches during the absence of the apostles. The apostles were about to leave them. They were just organized into churches: they were inexperienced; they needed counsel and direction; they were exposed to dangers; and it was necessary, therefore, that persons should be designated to watch over the spiritual interests of the brethren. The probability is, that they performed all the functions that were required in the infant and feeble churches; in exhorting, instructing; governing, etc. The more experienced and able would be most likely to be active in exhorting and instructing the brethren; and all would be useful in counseling and guiding the flock. The same thing occurred in the church at Ephesus. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17-28">Acts 20:17-28</span>. It is not improbable that the business of instructing, or teaching, would be gradually confined to the more talented and able of the elders, and that the others would be concerned mainly in governing and directing the general affairs of the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In every church - </b>It is implied here that there were elders in each church; that is, that in each church there was more than one. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:21">Acts 15:21</span>, where a similar phraseology occurs, and where it is evident that there was more than one reader of the Law of Moses in each city. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>, “I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldst ...ordain elders in every city”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>, “And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.” It could not mean, therefore, that they appointed a single minister or pastor to each church, but they committed the whole affairs of the church to a bench of elders.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And had prayed with fasting - </b>With the church. They were about to leave them. They had entrusted the interests of the church to a body of men chosen for this purpose; and they now commended the church and its elders together to God. Probably they had no prospect of seeing them again, and they parted as ministers and people should part, and as Christian friends should part, with humble prayer, commending themselves to the protecting care of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They commended them ... - </b>They committed the infant church to the guardianship of the Lord. They were feeble, inexperienced, and exposed to dangers; but in his hands they were safe.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the Lord ... - </b>The Lord Jesus. The connection shows that he is particularly referred to. In his hands the redeemed are secure. When we part with Christian friends, we may, with confidence, leave them in his holy care and keeping.</p>
