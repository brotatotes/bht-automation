<p style=" "><b>And certain men - </b>These were undoubtedly men who had been Jews, but who were now converted to Christianity. The fact that they were willing to refer the matter in dispute to the apostles and elders <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span> shows that they had professedly embraced the Christian religion. The account which follows is a record of the first internal dissension which occurred in the Christian church. Hitherto the church had been struggling against external foes. Violent persecutions had raged, and had fully occupied the attention of Christians. But now the churches were at peace. They enjoyed great external prosperity in Antioch, and the great enemy of souls took occasion then, as he has often done in similar circumstances since, to excite contentions in the church itself, so that when external violence could not destroy it, an effort was made to secure the same object by internal dissension and strife. This history, therefore, is particularly important, as it is the record of the first unhappy debate which arose in the bosom of the church. It is further important, as it shows the manner in which such controversies were settled in apostolic times, and as it established some very important principles respecting the perpetuity of the religious rites of the Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Came down from Judea - </b>To Antioch, and to the regions adjacent, which had been visited by the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>. Judea was a high and hilly region, and going from that toward the level countries adjacent to the sea was represented to be descending, or going down.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Taught the brethren - </b>That is, Christians. They endeavored to convince them of the necessity of keeping the laws of Moses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Except ye be circumcised - </b>This was the leading or principal rite of the Jewish religion. It was indispensable to the name and privileges of a Jew. Proselytes to their religion were circumcised as well as native-born Jews, and they held it to be indispensable to salvation. It is evident from this that Paul and Barnabas had dispensed with this rite in regard to the Gentile converts, and that they intended to found the Christian church on the principle that the Jewish ceremonies were to cease. When, however, it was necessary to conciliate the minds of the Jews and to prevent contention, Paul did not hesitate to practice circumcision, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>After the manner of Moses - </b>According to the custom which Moses commanded; according to the Mosaic ritual.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye cannot be saved - </b>The Jews regarded this as indispensable to salvation. The grounds on which they would press it on the attention of Gentile converts would be very plausible, and such as would produce much embarrassment. For:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It would be maintained that the laws of Moses were the laws of God, and were therefore unchangeable; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It would doubtless be maintained that the religion of the Messiah was only a completing and perfecting of the Jewish religion that it was designed simply to carry out its principles according to the promises, and not to subvert and destroy anything that had been established by divine authority. It is usually not difficult to perplex and embarrass young converts with questions of modes, and rites, and forms of religion; and it is not uncommon that a revival is followed by some contention just like this. Opposing sects urge the claims of their special rites, and seek to make proselytes, and introduce contention and strife into an otherwise peaceful and happy Christian community.</p>
