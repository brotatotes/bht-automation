<p style=" "><b>Why tempt ye God? - </b>Why provoke him to displeasure? Why, since he has shown his determination to accept them without such rites, do you provoke him by attempting to impose on his own people rites without his authority, and a against his manifest will? The argument is, that God had already accepted them. To attempt to impose these rites would be to provoke him to anger; to introduce observances which he had shown it was his purpose should now be abolished.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To put a yoke - </b>That which would be burdensome and oppressive, or which would infringe on their just freedom as the children of God. It is called in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>, “a yoke of bondage.” Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>. A “yoke” is an emblem of slavery or bondage <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>; or of affliction <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="la+3:27">Lamentations 3:27</span>; or of punishment <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="la+1:14">Lamentations 1:14</span>; or of oppressive and burdensome ceremonies, as in this place, or of the restraints of Christianity, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29-30">Matthew 11:29-30</span>. In this place those rites are called a yoke, because:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) They were burdensome and oppressive; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Because they would be an infringement of Christian freedom. One design of the gospel was to set people free from such rites and ceremonies.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which neither our fathers ... - </b>Which have been found burdensome at all times. They were expensive, and painful, and oppressive; and as they had been found to be so, it was not proper to impose them on the Gentile converts, but should rather rejoice at any evidence that the people of God might be delivered from them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Were able to bear - </b>Which are found to be oppressive and burdensome. They were attended with great inconvenience and many transgressions, as the consequence.</p>
