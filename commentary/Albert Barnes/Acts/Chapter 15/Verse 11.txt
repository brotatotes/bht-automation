<p style=" "><b>But we believe - </b>We apostles, who have been with them, and have seen the evidences of their acceptance with God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the grace ... - </b>By the grace or mercy of Christ alone, without any of the rites and ceremonies of the Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We shall be saved, even as they - </b>In the same manner, by the mere grace of Christ. So far from being necessary to their salvation, they are really of no use in ours. We are to be saved, not by these ceremonies, but by the mere mercy of God in the Redeemer. They should not, therefore, be imposed on others.</p>
