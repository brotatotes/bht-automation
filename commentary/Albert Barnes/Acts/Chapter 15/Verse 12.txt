<p style=" "><b>Then all the multitude - </b>Evidently the multitude of private Christians who were assembled on this occasion. That it does not refer to a synod of ministers and elders merely is apparent:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Because the church, the brethren, are represented as having been present, and as concurring in the final opinion <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22-23">Acts 15:22-23</span>; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Because the word “multitude” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὸ πλῆθος</span></span> to plēthos would not have been used in describing the collection of apostles and elders merely.
