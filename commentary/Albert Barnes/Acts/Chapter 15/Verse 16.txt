<p style=" "><b>After this - </b>This quotation is not made literally either from the Hebrew or the Septuagint, which differs also from the Hebrew. The 17th verse is quoted literally from the Septuagint, but in the 16th the general sense only of the passage is retained. The main point of the quotation, as made by James, was to show that, according to the prophets, it was contemplated that the Gentiles should be introduced to the privileges of the children of God; and on this point the passage has a direct bearing. The prophet Amos <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:8-10">Amos 9:8-10</span> had described the calamities which would come upon the nation of the Jews by their being scattered and driven away. This implied that the city of Jerusalem, the temple, and the walls of the city would be destroyed. But after that (Heb: “on that day,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:11">Amos 9:11</span>, that is, the day when he should revisit them and recover them) he would restore them to their former privileges - would rebuild their temple, their city, and their walls, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:11">Amos 9:11</span>. And not only so, not only would the blessing descend on the Jews, but it would also be extended to others. The “remnant of Edom,” “the pagan upon whom” his “name would be called” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:12">Amos 9:12</span>, would also partake of the mercy of God, and be subject to the Jewish people, and a time of general prosperity and of permanent blessings would follow, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:13-15">Amos 9:13-15</span>. James understands this as referring to the times of the Messiah, and to the introduction of the gospel to the Gentiles. And so the passage <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:12">Amos 9:12</span> is rendered in the Septuagint. See ver. 17.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I will return - </b>When the people of God are subjected to calamities and trials, it is often represented as if God had departed from them. His returning, therefore, is an image of their restoration to his favor and to prosperity. This is not, however, in the Hebrew, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:11">Amos 9:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I will build again - </b>In the calamities that would come upon the nation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:8">Amos 9:8</span>, it is implied that the temple and the city would be destroyed. To build them again would be a proof of his returning favor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The tabernacle of David - </b>The tent of David. Here it means the house or royal residence of David and the kings of Israel. That is, he would restore them to their former glory and splendor as his people. The reference here is not to the temple, which was the work of Solomon, but to the magnificence and splendor of the dwelling-place of David; that is, to the full enjoyment of their former high privileges and blessings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is fallen down - </b>Which would be destroyed by the King of Babylon, and by the long neglect and decay resulting from their being carried to a distant land,</p>
<p style=" "><b>The ruins thereof - </b>Heb. “close up the breaches thereof.” That is, it would be restored to its former prosperity and magnificence; an emblem of the favor of God, and of the spiritual blessings that would in future times descend on the Jewish people.</p>
