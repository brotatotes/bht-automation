<p style=" "><b>That the residue of men - </b>This verse is quoted literally from the Septuagint, and differs in some respects from the Hebrew. The phrase, “the residue of men,” here is evidently understood, both by the Septuagint and by James, as referring to others than Jews, to the Gentiles the rest of the world - implying that many of them would be admitted to the friendship and favor of God. The Hebrew is, “that they may possess the remnant of Edom.” This change is made in the Septuagint by a slight difference in the reading of two Hebrew words. The Septuagint, instead of the Hebrew <span class="_800000">וירשׁו</span> w-y-r-sh-w, shall inherit, read <span class="_800000">ודרשׁו</span> w-d-r-sh-w, shall seek of thee; and instead of <span class="_800000">אדום</span> 'd-w-m, Edom, they read <span class="_800000">אדם</span> '̇̀̇d-m, man, or mankind; that is, people. Why this variation occurred cannot be explained; but the sense is not materially different. In the Hebrew the word “Edom” has undoubted reference to another nation than the Jewish nation; and the expression means that, in the great prosperity of the Jews after their return, they would extend the influence of their religion to other nations; that is, as James applies it, the Gentiles might be brought to the privileges of the children of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And all the Gentiles - </b>Heb. all the pagan; that is, all who were not Jews. This was a clear prediction that other nations were to be favored with the true religion, and that without any mention of their conforming to the rites of the Jewish people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Upon whom my name is called - </b>Who are called by my name, or who are regarded as my people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who doeth all these things - </b>That is, who will certainly accomplish this in its time.</p>
