<p style=" "><b>Known unto God ... - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>. The meaning of this verse, in this connection, is this. God sees everything future; he knows what he will accomplish; he has a plan; all his works are so arranged in his mind that he sees everything distinctly and clearly. As he foretold these, it was a part of his plan; and as it was a part of his plan long since foretold, it should not be opposed and resisted by us.</p>
