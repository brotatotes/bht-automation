<p style=" "><b>And being brought on their way by the church - </b>Being attended and conducted by the Christian brethren. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:24">Romans 15:24</span>. It was customary for the Christians to attend the apostles in their travels.

<p style=" "><b>And Samaria - </b>These places were directly on their route to Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Declaring the conversion ... - </b>Of the Gentiles in Antioch, and in the regions in Asia Minor through which they had traveled. These remarkable events they would naturally communicate with joy to the Christians with whom they would have contact in their journey.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Caused great joy - </b>At the news of the extensive spread of the gospel. It was an indication of their deep feeling in the interests of religion that they thus rejoiced. Where Christians are themselves awake, and engaged in the service of Christ, they rejoice at the news of the conversion of sinners. Where they are cold, they hear such news with indifference, or with the utmost unconcern. One way of testing our feelings on the subject of religion is by the emotions which we have when we hear of extensive and glorious revivals of religion.
