<p style=" "><b>And the apostles and elders ... - </b>They came together in accordance with the authority in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:19-20">Matthew 18:19-20</span>. It would seem, also, that the whole church was convened on this occasion, and that the church concurred, at least, in the judgment expressed in this case. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:12">Acts 15:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22-23">Acts 15:22-23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For to consider of this matter - </b>Not to decide it arbitrarily, or even by authority, without deliberation; but to compare their views, and to express the result of the whole to the church at Antioch. It was a grave and difficult question, deeply affecting the entire constitution of the Christian church, and they therefore solemnly engaged in deliberation on the subject.</p>
