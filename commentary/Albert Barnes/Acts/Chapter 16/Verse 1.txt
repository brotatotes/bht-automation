<p style=" "><b>Then came he - </b>That is, Paul in company with Silas. Luke does not give us the history of Barnabas, but confines his narrative to the journey of Paul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To Derbe and Lystra - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And behold, a certain disciple named Timotheus - </b>It was to this disciple that Paul afterward addressed the two epistles which bear his name. It is evident that he was a native of one of these places, but whether of Derbe or Lystra it is impossible to determine.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The son of a certain woman ... - </b>Her name was Eunice, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And believed - </b>And was a Christian. It is stated also that her mother was a woman of distinguished Christian piety, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>. It was not lawful for a Jew to marry a woman of another nation, or to give his daughter in marriage to a Gentile, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+9:12">Ezra 9:12</span>. But it is probable that this law was not regarded very strictly by the Jews who lived in the midst of pagan nations. It is evident that Timothy, at this time, was very young; for when Paul besought him to abide at Ephesus, to take charge of the church there <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>, he addressed him then as a young man, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>, “Let no man despise thy youth.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>But his father was a Greek - </b>Evidently, a man who had not been circumcised, for had he been Timothy would have been also.</p>
