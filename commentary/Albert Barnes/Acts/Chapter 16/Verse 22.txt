<p style=" "><b>And the multitude ... - </b>It is evident that this was done in a popular tumult, and without even the form of law. Of this Paul afterward justly complained, as it was a violation of the privileges of a Roman citizen, and contrary to the laws. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:37">Acts 16:37</span>. It was one instance in which people affect great zeal for the honor of the Law, and yet are among the first to disregard it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the magistrates - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:20">Acts 16:20</span>. They who should have been their protectors until they had had a fair trial according to law.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rent off their clothes - </b>This was always done when one was to be scourged or whipped. The criminal was usually stripped entirely naked. Livy says (ii. 5), “The lictors, being sent to inflict punishment, beat them with rods, being naked.” Cicero, against Verres, says, “He commanded the man to be seized, and to be stripped naked in the midst of the forum, and to be bound, and rods to be brought.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And commanded to beat them - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ῥαβδίζειν</span></span> rabdizein. To beat them with rods. This was done by lictors, whose office it was, and was a common mode of punishment among the Romans. Probably Paul alludes to this as one of the instances which occurred in his life of his being publicly scourged, when he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:25">2 Corinthians 11:25</span>, “Thrice was I beaten with rods.”</p>
