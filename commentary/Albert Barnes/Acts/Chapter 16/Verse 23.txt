But there was no such law among the Romans. They were unrestricted in regard to the number of lashes, and probably inflicted many more. Perhaps Paul refers to this when he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>, “In stripes above measure.” that is, beyond the usual measure among the Jews, or beyond moderation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They cast them into prison - </b>The magistrates did this partly as a punishment, and partly with a view hereafter of taking vengeance on them more according to the forms of law.</p>
