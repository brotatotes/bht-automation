<p style=" "><b>They comforted them - </b>They exhorted them, and encouraged them to persevere, notwithstanding the opposition and persecution which they might meet with.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And departed - </b>That is, Paul and Silas departed. It would appear probable that Luke and Timothy remained in Philippi, or, at least, did not attend Paul and Silas. For Luke, who, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>, uses the first person, and speaks of himself as with Paul and Silas, speaks of them now in the third person, implying that he was not with them until Paul had arrived at Troas, where Luke joined him from Philippi, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:5-6">Acts 20:5-6</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>, also, Timothy is mentioned as being at Berea in company with Silas, from which it appears that he did not accompany Paul and Silas to Thessalonica. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:1">Acts 17:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>. Paul and Silas, when they departed from Philippi, went to Thessalonica, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:1">Acts 17:1</span>.</p>
