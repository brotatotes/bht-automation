<p style=" "><b>And hath made of one blood - </b>All the families of mankind are descended from one origin or stock. However different their complexion, features, or language, yet they are derived from a common parent. The word blood is often used to denote “race, stock, kindred.” This passage affirms that all the human family are descended from the same ancestor; and that, consequently, all the variety of complexion, etc., is to be traced to some other cause than that they were originally different races created. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:0">Genesis 1:0</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mal+2:10">Malachi 2:10</span>. The design of the apostle in this affirmation was probably to convince the Greeks that he regarded them all as brethren; that, although he was a Jew, yet he was not enslaved to any narrow notions or prejudices in reference to other people. It follows from the truth here stated that no one nation, and no individual, can claim any pre-eminence over others in virtue of birth or blood. All are in this respect equal; and the whole human family, however they may differ in complexion, customs, and laws, are to be regarded and treated as brethren. It follows, also, that no one part of the race has a right to enslave or oppress any other part, on account of difference of complexion. No one has a right because:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Not colored like his own; and having power</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> T’ enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause to</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Doom and devote him as his lawful prey.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For to dwell ... - </b>To cultivate and until the earth. This was the original command <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:28">Genesis 1:28</span>; and God, by his providence, has so ordered it that the descendants of one family have found their way to all lands, and have become adapted to the climate where he has placed them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And hath determined - </b>Greek: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὁρίσας</span></span> horisas. Having fixed, or marked out a boundary. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>. The word is usually applied to a field. It means here that God “marked out,” or “designated in his purpose,” their future abodes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The times before appointed - </b>This evidently refers to the dispersion and migration of nations. And it means that God had, in his plan, fixed the times when each country should be settled, and the rise, the prosperity, and the fall of each nation. The different continents and islands have not, therefore, been settled by chance, but by a wise rule, and in accordance with God’s arrangement and design.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the bounds of their habitation - </b>Their limits and boundaries as a people. By customs, laws, inclinations, and habits he has fixed the boundaries of their habitations, and disposed them to dwell there. We may learn:</p>
<p style=" ">God has given to people their places of abode, and we have no right to disturb those abodes, or to attempt to displace them in a violent manner. This strain of remark by the apostle was also opposed to all the notions of the Epicurean philosophers, and yet so obviously true and just that they could not gainsay or resist it.</p>
