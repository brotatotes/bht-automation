<p style=" "><b>Opening - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοίγων</span></span> dianoigōn. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:32">Luke 24:32</span>. The word means to explain or to unfold. It is usually applied to what is shut, as the eye, etc. Then it means to explain what is concealed or obscure. It means here that he explained the Scriptures in their true sense.</p>

The sense of this will be better seen by retaining the word “Messiah.” “That there was a fitness or necessity that the Messiah expected by the Jews, and predicted in their Scriptures, should suffer.” This point the Jews were unwilling to admit; but it was essential to his argument in proving that Jesus was the Messiah to show that it was foretold that he should die for the sins of people. On the necessity of this, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:26-27">Luke 24:26-27</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have suffered - </b>That he should die.</p>

<p style=" ">The arguments by which Paul probably proved that Jesus was the Messiah were:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) That he corresponded with the prophecies respecting him in the following particulars:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) For the same reason, his resurrection from the dead proved that he was the Messiah.</p>
