<p style=" "><b>Whom he hath ordained - </b>Or whom he has constituted or appointed as judge. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:42">Acts 10:42</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span> notes.</p>

<p style=" ">(2) God confirmed the truth of his declarations by raising him from the dead, or gave his sanction to what the Lord Jesus had said, for God would nor work a miracle in favor of an impostor.</p>
