<p style=" "><b>Some mocked - </b>Some of the philosophers derided him. The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead was believed by none of the Greeks; it seemed incredible; and they regarded it as so absurd as not to admit of an argument, It has nor been uncommon for even professed philosophers to mock at the doctrines of religion, and to meet the arguments of Christianity with a sneer. The Epicureans particularly would be likely to deride this, as they denied altogether any future state. It is not improbable that this derision by the Epicureans produced such a disturbance as to break off Paulâ€™s discourse, as that of Stephen had been by the clamor of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:54">Acts 7:54</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And others said - </b>Probably some of the Stoics. The doctrine of a future state was not denied by them; and the fact, affirmed by Paul, that one had been raised up from the dead, would appear more plausible to them, and it might be a matter worth inquiry to ascertain whether the alleged fact did not furnish a new argument for their views. They therefore proposed to examine this further at some future time. That the inquiry was prosecuted any further does not appear probable, for:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) No church was organized at Athens.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) There is no account of any future interview with Paul.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) He departed almost immediately from them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1">Acts 18:1</span>. People who defer inquiry on the subject of religion seldom find the favorable period arrive. Those who propose to examine its doctrines at a future time often do it to avoid the inconvenience of becoming Christians now, and as a plausible and easy way of rejecting the gospel altogether, without appearing to be rude, or to give offence.</p>
