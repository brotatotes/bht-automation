<p style=" "><b>Moved with envy - </b>That they made so many converts, and met with such success.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Certain lewd fellows of the baser sort - </b>This is an unhappy translation. The word “lewd” is not in the original. The Greek is, “And having taken certain wicked people of those who were about the forum,” or market-place. The forum, or market-place, was the place where the idle assembled, and where those were gathered together that wished to be employed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:3">Matthew 20:3</span>. Many of these would be of abandoned character, the idle, the dissipated, and the worthless, and, therefore, just the materials for a mob. It does not appear that they felt any particular interest in the subject; but they were, like other mobs, easily excited, and urged on to any acts of violence. The pretence on which the mob was excited was, that they had everywhere produced disturbance, and that they violated the laws of the Roman emperor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6-7">Acts 17:6-7</span>. It may be observed, however, that a mob usually regards very little the cause in which they are engaged. They may be roused either for or against religion, and become as full of zeal for the insulted honor of religion as against it. The profane, the worthless, and the abandoned thus often become violently enraged for the honor of religion, and full of indignation and tumult against those who are accused of violating public peace and order.</p>
