<p style=" "><b>And Crispus - </b>He is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span> as having been one of the few whom Paul baptized with his own hands. The conversion of such a man must have tended greatly to exasperate the other Jews, and to further the progress of the Christian faith among the Corinthians.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With all his house - </b>With all his family, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:2">Acts 10:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And many of the Corinthians - </b>Many even in this voluptuous and wicked city. Perhaps the power of the gospel was never more signal than in converting sinners in Corinth, and rearing a Christian church in a place so dissolute and abandoned. If it was adapted to such a place as Corinth; if a church, under the power of Christian truth, could be organized there, it is adapted to any city, and there is none so corrupt that the gospel cannot change and purify it.</p>
