<p style=" "><b>So that from his body - </b>That is, those handkerchiefs which had been applied to his body, which he had used, or which he had touched. An instance somewhat similar to this occurs in the case of the woman who was healed by touching the hem of the Saviour’s garment, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:20-22">Matthew 9:20-22</span>.<b>Unto the sick - </b>The sick who were at a distance, and who were unable to go where he was. If it be asked why this was done, it may be observed:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That the working of miracles in that region would greatly contribute to the spread of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) We are not to suppose that there was any efficacy in the aprons thus brought, or in the mere fact that they had touched the body of Paul, anymore than there was in the hem of the Saviour’s garment which the woman touched, or in the clay which he made use of to open the eyes of the blind man, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:6">John 8:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) In this instance, the fact that the miracles were performed in this manner by garments which had touched his body, was a mere sign, or an evidence to the persons concerned, that it was done by the instrumentality of Paul, as the fact that the Saviour put his fingers into the ears of a deaf man, and spit and touched his tongue <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:33">Mark 7:33</span>, was an evidence to those who saw it that the power of healing came from him. The bearing of these aprons to the sick was, therefore, merely evidence to all concerned that miraculous power was given to Paul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Handkerchiefs - </b>The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σουδάρια</span></span> soudaria is of Latin origin, and properly denotes “a piece of linen” with which sweat was wiped from the face; and then “any piece of linen used for tying up or containing anything.” In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:20">Luke 19:20</span>, it denotes the “napkin” in which the talent of the unprofitable servant was concealed; in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:44">John 11:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:7">John 20:7</span>, the “napkin” which was used to bind up the face of the dead applied to Lazarus and to our Saviour.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or aprons - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιμικίνθια</span></span> simikinthia. This is also Latin word, and means literally a half girdle, or covering half the person a piece of cloth which was girded round the waist to preserve the clothes of those who were engaged in any kind of work. The word “aprons” expresses the idea.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the diseases departed - </b>The sick were healed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the evil spirits - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>. It is evident that this power of working miracles would contribute greatly to Paul’s success among the people.</p>
