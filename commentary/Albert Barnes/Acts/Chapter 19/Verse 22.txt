<p style=" "><b>Timotheus - </b>Timothy. He was a proper person to send there to visit the churches, as he had been there before with Paul, when they were established, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And Erastus - </b>Erastus was chamberlain of Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>), or, more properly, the treasurer of the city (see the notes on that place), and he was, therefore, a very proper person to be sent with Timothy for the purpose of making the collection for the poor at Jerusalem. Paul had wisdom enough to employ a man accustomed to monied transactions in making a collection. On this collection his heart was intent, and he afterward went up with it to Jerusalem. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>, and notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:25-26">Romans 15:25-26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Stayed in Asia - </b>At Ephesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For a season - </b>How long is uncertain. He waited for a convenient opportunity to follow them, probably intending to do it as soon as they had fully prepared the way for the collection. See Paleyâ€™s Horae Paulinae, p. 1, chapter 2.</p>
