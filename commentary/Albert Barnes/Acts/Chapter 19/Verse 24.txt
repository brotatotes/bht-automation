<p style=" "><b>A silversmith - </b>The word used here denotes “one who works in silver” in any way, either in making money, in stamping silver, or in forming utensils from it. It is probable that the employment of this man was confined to the business here specified, that of making shrines, as his complaint Acts . <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:26-27">Acts 19:26-27</span> implied that destroying this would be sufficient to throw them out of all employment. Silver shrines <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναοὺς</span></span> naous. Temples. The word “shrine” properly means “a case, small chest, or box”; particularly applied to a box in which sacred things are deposited. Hence, we hear of the shrines for relics (Webster). The word “shrines” here denotes “small portable temples, or edifices,” made of silver, so as to represent the temple of Diana, and probably containing a silver image of the goddess. Such shrines would be purchased by devotees and by worshippers of the goddess, and by strangers, who would be desirous of possessing a representation of one of the seven wonders of the world. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:27">Acts 19:27</span>. The great number of persons that came to Ephesus for her worship would constitute an ample sale for productions of this kind, and make the manufacture a profitable employment. It is well known that pagans everywhere are accustomed to carry with them small images, or representations of their gods, as an amulet or charm. The Romans had such images in all their houses, called penates, or household gods. A similar thing is mentioned as early as the time of Laban <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:19">Genesis 31:19</span>, whose images Rachel had stolen and taken with her. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+17:5">Judges 17:5</span>, “The man Micah had an house of gods”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+19:13">1 Samuel 19:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+3:4">Hosea 3:4</span>. These images were usually enclosed in a box, case, or chest, made of wood, iron, or silver; and probably, as here, usually made to resemble the temple where the idol was worshipped.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Diana - </b>This was a celebrated goddess of the pagan, and one of the twelve superior deities. In the heavens she was Luna, or Meui (the moon); on earth, Diana; and in hell, Hecate. She was sometimes represented with a crescent on her head, a bow in her hand, and dressed in a hunting habit; at other times with a triple face, and with instruments of torture. She was commonly regarded as the goddess of hunting. She was also worshipped under the various names of Lucina, Proserpine, Trivia, etc. She was also represented with a great number of breasts, to denote her as being the fountain of blessings, or as distributing her benefits to each in their proper station. She was worshipped in Egypt, Athens, Cilicia, and among pagan nations generally; but the most celebrated place of her worship was Ephesus, a city especially dedicated to her.</p>
