<p style=" "><b>And there are deputies - </b>Roman proconsuls. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:7">Acts 13:7</span>. The cause might be brought before them with the certainty that it would be heard and decided. The Syriac reads this in the singular number “Lo, the proconsul is in the city.”</p>
