But if we inquire - If you seek to determine any other matters than that pertaining to the alleged wrong which Demetrius has suffered in his business.Other matters - Anything respecting public affairs; anything pertaining to the government and the worship of Diana.In a lawful assembly - In an assembly convened, not by tumult and riot, but in conformity to law. This was a tumultuous assemblage, and it was proper in the public officer to demand that they should disperse; and that, if there were any public grievances to be remedied, it should be done in an assembly properly convened. It may be remarked here that the original word rendered assembly is what is usually in the New Testament rendered church - ἐκκλησία ekklēsia. It is properly rendered by the word “assembly” - not denoting here “a mixed or tumultuous assemblage, but one called out, or convened in the legal manner.” The proper meaning of the word is “what is called out.” “The church, the Christian assembly ἐκκλησία ekklēsia of the faithful,” is made up of those who are called out from the world.
