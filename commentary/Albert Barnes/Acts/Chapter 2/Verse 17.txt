<p style=" "><b>It shall come to pass - </b>It shall happen, or shall occur.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the last days - </b>Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, after these things, or afterward. The expression the last days, however, occurs frequently in the Old Testament: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:1">Genesis 49:1</span>, Jacob called his sons, that he might tell them what should happen to them in the last days, that is, in future times - Heb. in after times; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mic+4:1">Micah 4:1</span>, “In the last days (Hebrew: in later times) the mountain of the Lord’s house,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:2">Isaiah 2:2</span>, “in the last days the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the tops of the mountains,” etc. The expression then properly denoted “the future times” in general. But, as the coming of the Messiah was to the eye of a Jew the most important event in the coming ages - the great, glorious, and crowning scene in all the vast futurity, the phrase came to be regarded as properly expressive of that. It stood in opposition to the usual denomination of earlier times.</p>
<p style=" ">It was a phrase in contrast with the days of the patriarchs, the kings, the prophets, etc. The last days, or the closing period of the world, were the days of the Messiah. It does not appear from this, and it certainly is not implied in the expression, that they supposed the world would then come to an end. Their views were just the contrary. They anticipated a long and glorious time under the dominion of the Messiah, and to this expectation they were led by the promise that his kingdom should be forever; that of the increase of his government there should be no end, etc. This expression was understood by the writers of the New Testament as referring undoubtedly to the times of the gospel. And hence they often used it as denoting that the time of the expected Messiah had come, but not to imply that the world was drawing near to an end: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>, “God hath spoken in these last days by his Son”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>, “Was manifested in these last times for you”; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Pe 3:3</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5">1 Peter 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>, “Little children, it is the last time,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:18">Jude 1:18</span>. The expression the last day is applied by our Saviour to the resurrection and the day of judgment, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39-40">John 6:39-40</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44-45">John 6:44-45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:24">John 11:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:48">John 12:48</span>. Here the expression means simply “in those future times, when the Messiah shall have come.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>I will pour out of my Spirit - </b>The expression in Hebrew is, “I will pour out my Spirit.” The word “pour” is commonly applied to water or to blood, “to pour it out,” or “to shed it,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:6">Isaiah 57:6</span>; to tears, “to pour them out,” that is,” to weep, etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+42:4">Psalms 42:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:15">1 Samuel 1:15</span>. It is applied to water, to wine, or to blood, in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:17">Matthew 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:1">Revelation 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:20">Acts 22:20</span>, “The blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed.” It conveys also the idea of “communicating largely or freely,” as water is poured freely from a fountain, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5-6">Titus 3:5-6</span>, “The renewing of the Holy Spirit, which he shed on us abundantly.” Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+36:27">Job 36:27</span>, “They (the clouds) pour down rain according to the vapor thereof”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:3">Isaiah 44:3</span>, “I will pour water on him that is thirsty”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:8">Isaiah 45:8</span>, “Let the skies pour down righteousness”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:10">Malachi 3:10</span>, “I will pour you out a blessing.” It is also applied to fury and anger, when God intends to say that he will not spare, but will signally punish, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:24">Psalms 69:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+10:25">Jeremiah 10:25</span>. It is not infrequently applied to the Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+1:23">Proverbs 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:3">Isaiah 44:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span>. As thus used it means that he will bestow large measures of spiritual influences. As the Spirit renews and sanctifies people, so to pour out the Spirit is to grant freely his influences to renew and sanctify the soul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My Spirit - </b>The Spirit here denotes the Third Person of the Trinity, promised by the Saviour, and sent to finish his work, and apply it to people. The Holy Spirit is regarded as the source or conveyer of all the blessings which Christians experience. Hence, he renews the heart, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5-6">John 3:5-6</span>. He is the source of all proper feelings and principles in Christians, or he produces the Christian graces, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22-25">Galatians 5:22-25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5-7">Titus 3:5-7</span>. The spread and success of the gospel is attributed to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+32:15-16">Isaiah 32:15-16</span>. Miraculous gifts are traced to him, especially the various gifts with which the early Christians were endowed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4-10">1 Corinthians 12:4-10</span>. The promise that he would pour out his Spirit means that he would, in the time of the Messiah, impart a large measure of those influences which it was his special province to communicate to people. A part of them were communicated on the day of Pentecost, in the miraculous endowment of the power of speaking foreign languages, in the wisdom of the apostles, and in the conversion of the three thousand,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Upon all flesh - </b>The word “flesh” here means “persons,” or “people.” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>. The word “all” here does not mean every individual, but every class or rank of individuals. It is to be limited to the cases specified immediately. The influences were not to be confined to any one class, but were to be communicated to all kinds of persons - old men, youth, servants, etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1-4">1 Timothy 2:1-4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And your sons and your daughters - </b>Your children. It would seem that females shared in the remarkable influences of the Holy Spirit. Philip the Evangelist had four daughters which did prophesy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:9">Acts 21:9</span>. It is probable also that the females of the church of Corinth partook of this gift, though they were forbidden to exercise it in public, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:34">1 Corinthians 14:34</span>. The office of prophesying, whatever was meant by that, was not confined to the people among the Jews: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:20">Exodus 15:20</span>, “Miriam, the prophetess, took a timbrel,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+4:4">Judges 4:4</span>, “Deborah, a prophetess, judged Israel”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+22:14">2 Kings 22:14</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:36">Luke 2:36</span>, “There was one Anna, a prophetess,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall prophesy - </b>The word “prophesy” is used in a great variety of senses:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It means to predict or foretell future events, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:13">Matthew 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:7">Matthew 15:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) To divine, to conjecture, to declare as a prophet might, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:68">Matthew 26:68</span>, “Prophesy who smote thee.”</p>
<p style=" ">(3) To celebrate the praises of God, being under a divine influence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:67">Luke 1:67</span>. This seems to have been a considerable part of the employment in the ancient schools of the prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+10:5">1 Samuel 10:5</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Sa 19:20</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+30:15">1 Samuel 30:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) To teach - as no small part of the office of the prophets was to teach the doctrines of religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22">Matthew 7:22</span>, “Have we not prophesied in thy name?”</p>
<p style=" ">(5) It denotes, then, in general, “to speak under a divine influence,” whether in foretelling future events, in celebrating the praises of God, in instructing others in the duties of religion, or “in speaking foreign languages under that influence.” In this last sense the word is used in the New Testament, to denote those who were miraculously endowed with the power of speaking foreign languages, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:6">Acts 19:6</span>. The word is also used to denote “teaching, or speaking in intelligible language, in opposition to speaking a foreign tongue,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1-5">1 Corinthians 14:1-5</span>. In this place it means that they would speak under a divine influence, and is specially applied to the power of speaking in a foreign tongue.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Your young men shall see visions - </b>The will of God in former times was communicated to the prophets in various ways. One was by visions, and hence one of the most usual names of the prophets was seers. The name seer was first given to that class of men, and was superseded by the name prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:9">1 Samuel 9:9</span>, “He that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:11">1 Samuel 9:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:18-19">1 Samuel 9:18-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+24:11">2 Samuel 24:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+29:29">1 Chronicles 29:29</span>, etc. This name was given from the manner in which the divine will was communicated, which seems to have been by throwing the prophet into an ecstasy, and then by causing the vision, or the appearance of the objects or events to pass before the mind. The prophet looked upon the passing scene, the often splendid diorama as it actually occurred, and recorded it as it appeared to his mind. Hence, he recorded rather the succession of images than the times in which they would occur. These visions occurred sometimes when they were asleep, and sometimes during a prophetic ecstasy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:28">Daniel 2:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:1-2">Daniel 7:1-2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:15">Daniel 7:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:2">Daniel 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:24">Ezekiel 11:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:1">Genesis 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:6">Numbers 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+4:13">Job 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+7:14">Job 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:1">Ezekiel 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+8:3">Ezekiel 8:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Often the prophet seemed to be transferred or transported to another place from where he was, and the scene in a distant land or age passed before the mind, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+8:3">Ezekiel 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:2">Ezekiel 40:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:24">Ezekiel 11:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:2">Daniel 8:2</span>. In this case the distant scene or time passed before the prophet, and he recorded it as it appeared to him. That this did not cease before the times of the gospel is evident: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:10">Acts 9:10</span>, “To Ananias said the Lord in a vision,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:12">Acts 9:12</span>, “and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias,” etc.; that is, Paul hath seen Ananias represented to him, though absent; he has had an image of him coming in to him; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>, Cornelius “saw in a vision evidently an angel of God coming to him,” etc. This was one of the modes by which in former times God made known his will; and the language of the Jews came to express a revelation in this manner. Though there were strictly no visions on the day of Pentecost, yet that was one scene under the great economy of the Messiah under which God would make known his will in a manner as clear as he did to the ancient Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Your old men shall dream dreams - </b>The will of God in former times was made known often in this manner; and there are several instances recorded in which it was done under the gospel. God informed Abimelech in a dream that Sarah was the wife of Abraham, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:3">Genesis 20:3</span>. He spoke to Jacob in a dream, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:11">Genesis 31:11</span>; to Laban, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:24">Genesis 31:24</span>; to Joseph, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:5">Genesis 37:5</span>; to the butler and baker, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+40:5">Genesis 40:5</span>; to Pharaoh, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:1-7">Genesis 41:1-7</span>; to Solomon, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+3:5">1 Kings 3:5</span>; to Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:3">Daniel 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:1">Daniel 7:1</span>. It was prophesied by Moses that in this way God would make known his will, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:6">Numbers 12:6</span>. It occurred even in the times of the gospel. Joseph was warned in a dream, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:12-13">Matthew 2:12-13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:19">Matthew 2:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:22">Matthew 2:22</span>. Pilate’s wife was also troubled in this manner about the conduct of the Jews to Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:19">Matthew 27:19</span>. As this was one way in which the will of God was made known formerly to people, so the expression here denotes simply that His will would be made known; that it would be one characteristic of the times of the gospel that God would reveal Himself to mankind. The ancients probably had some mode of determining whether their dreams were divine communications, or whether they were, as they are now, the mere erratic wanderings of the mind when unrestrained and unchecked by the will. At present no confidence is to be put in dreams. Compare the introduction to Isaiah, section 7, 12.</p>
