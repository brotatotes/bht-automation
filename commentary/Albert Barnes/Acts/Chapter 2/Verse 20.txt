<p style=" "><b>The sun shall be turned into darkness - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>. The same images used here with reference to the sun and moon are used also there: They occur not infrequently, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:24">Mark 13:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:7-10">2 Peter 3:7-10</span>. The shining of the sun is an emblem of prosperity; the withdrawing, the eclipse, or the setting of the sun is an emblem of calamity, and is often thus need in the Scriptures, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:20">Isaiah 60:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+15:9">Jeremiah 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:7">Ezekiel 32:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+8:9">Amos 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:12">Revelation 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:12">Revelation 8:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:2">Revelation 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:8">Revelation 16:8</span>. To say that the sun is darkened, or turned into darkness, is an image of calamity, and especially of the calamities of war, when the smoke of burning cities rises to heaven and obscures his light. This is not, therefore, to be taken literally, nor does it afford any indication of what will be at the end of the world in regard to the sun.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The moon into blood - </b>The word “blood” here means that obscure, sanguinary color which the moon has when the atmosphere is filled with smoke and vapor, and especially the lurid and alarming appearance which it assumes when smoke and flames are thrown up by earthquakes and fiery eruptions, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:12">Revelation 6:12</span>, “And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:8">Revelation 8:8</span>. In this place it denotes great calamities. The figures used are indicative of wars, and conflagrations, and earthquakes. As these things are <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span> applied to the destruction of Jerusalem; as they actually occurred previous to that event (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>), it may be supposed that the prophecy in Joel had an immediate reference to that. The meaning of the quotation by Peter in this place therefore is, that what occurred on the day of Pentecost was the beginning of the serges of wonders that was to take place during the times of the Messiah. It is not intimated that those scenes were to close or to be exhausted in that age. They may precede that great day of the Lord which is yet to come in view of the whole earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That great and notable day of the Lord - </b>This is called the great day of the Lord, because on that day he will be signally manifested, more impressively and strikingly than on other times. The word “notable,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπιφανῆ</span></span> epiphanē, means “signal, illustrious, distinguished.” In Joel the word is “terrible or fearful”; a word applicable to days of calamity, and trial, and judgment. The Greek word here rendered notable is also in the Septuagint frequently used to denote “calamity” or “times of judgment,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:21">Deuteronomy 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:23">2 Samuel 7:23</span>. This will apply to any day in which God signally manifests himself, but particularly to a day when he shall come forth to punish people, as at the destruction of Jerusalem, or at the day of judgment. The meaning is, that those wonders would take place before that distinguished day should arrive when God would come forth in judgment.</p>
