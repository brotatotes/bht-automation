<p style=" "><b>Ye men of Israel - </b>Descendants of Israel or Jacob, that is, Jews. Peter proceeds now to the third part of his argument, to show that Jesus Christ had been raised up; that the scene which had occurred was in accordance with his promise, was proof of his resurrection, and of his exaltation to be the Messiah; and that, therefore, they should repent for their great sin in having put their own Messiah to death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A man approved of God - </b>A man who was shown or demonstrated to have the approbation of God, or to have been sent by him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By miracles, and wonders, and signs - </b>The first of these words properly means the displays of power which Jesus made; the second, the unusual or remarkable events which attended him, as suited to excite wonder or amazement; the third, the sights or proofs that he was from God. Together, they denote the array or series of remarkable works - raising the dead, healing the sick, etc., which showed that Jesus was sent from God. The proof which they furnished that he was from God was this, that He would not confer such power on an impostor, and that therefore Jesus was what he pretended to be.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which God did, by him - </b>The Lord Jesus himself often traced his power to do these things to his commission from the Father, but he did it in such a way as to show that he was closely united to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>. Peter here says that God did these works by Jesus Christ, to show that Jesus was truly sent by him, and that therefore he had the seal and attestation of God. The same thing Jesus himself said, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>, “The work which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.” The great works which God has made in creation, as well as in redemption, he is represented as having done by his Son, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>, “By whom also he made the worlds,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15-19">Colossians 1:15-19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the midst of you - </b>In your own land. It is also probable that many of the persons present had been witnesses of his miracles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As ye yourselves also know - </b>They knew it either by having witnessed them, or by the evidence which everywhere abounded of the truth that he had performed them. The Jews, even in the time of Christ, did not dare to call his miracles in question, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span>. While they admitted the miracle, they attempted to trace it to the influence of Beelzebub, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:34">Matthew 9:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22">Mark 3:22</span>. So decided and numerous were the miracles of Jesus, that Peter here appeals to them as having been known by the Jews themselves to have been performed, and with a confidence that even riley could not deny it. On this he proceeds to rear his argument for the truth of his Messiahship.</p>
