<p style=" "><b>Whom God hath raised up - </b>This was the main point, in this part of his argument, which Peter wished to establish. He could not but admit that the Messiah had been in an ignominious manner put to death. But he now shows them that God had also raised him up; had thus given his attestation to his doctrine; and had sent down his Spirit according to the promise which the Lord Jesus made before his death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having loosed the pains of death - </b>The word “loosed,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λύσας</span></span> lusas, is opposed to bind, and is properly applied to a cord, or to anything which is bound. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:2">Matthew 21:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>. Hence, it means to free or to liberate, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:27">1 Corinthians 7:27</span>. It is used in this sense here; though the idea of untying or loosing a band is retained, because the word translated “pains” often means “a cord or band.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>The pains of death - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὠδῖνας τοῦ θάνατου</span></span> ōdinas tou thanatou. The word translated “pains” denotes properly “the extreme sufferings of parturition, and then any severe or excruciating pangs.” Hence, it is applied also to death, as being a state of extreme suffering. A very frequent meaning of the Hebrew word of which this is the translation is cord or band. This, perhaps, was the original idea of the word; and the Hebrews expressed any extreme agony under the idea of bands or cords closely drawn, binding and constricting the limbs, and producing severe pain. Thus, death was represented under this image of a band that confined people, that pressed closely on them, that prevented escape, and produced severe suffering. For this use of the word <span class="_800000">חבל</span> chebel, see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:61">Psalms 119:61</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:7">Isaiah 66:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+22:23">Jeremiah 22:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:13">Hosea 13:13</span>. It is applied to death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:5">Psalms 18:5</span>, “The snares of death prevented me”; corresponding to the word “sorrows” in the previous part of the verse; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:3">Psalms 116:3</span>, “The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell (Hades or Sheol, the cords or pains that were binding me down to the grave) gat held on me.”</p>
<p style=" ">We are not to infer from this that our Lord suffered anything after death. It means simply that he could not be held by the grave, but that God loosed the bonds which had held him there; that he now set him free who had been encompassed by these pains or bonds until they had brought him down to the grave. Pain, mighty pain, will encompass us all like the constrictions and bindings of a cord which we cannot loose, and will fasten our limbs and bodies in the grave. Those bands begin to be thrown around us in early life, and they are drawn closer and closer, until we lie panting under the stricture on a bed of pain, and then are still and immovable in the grave - subdued in a manner not a little resembling the mortal agonies of the tiger in the convolutions of the boa constrictor, or like Laocoon and his sons in the folds of the serpents from the Island of Tenedos.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It was not possible - </b>This does not refer to any natural impossibility, or to any inherent efficacy or power in the body of Jesus itself, but simply means that “in the circumstances of the case such an event could not be.” Why it could not be he proceeds at once to show. It could not be consistently with the promises of the Scriptures. Jesus was the “Prince of life” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>; he had life in himself <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>; he had power to lay down his life and to take it again <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+10:18">Judges 10:18</span>; and it was indispensable that he should rise. He came, also, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is, the devil <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>; and as it was his purpose to gain this victory, he could not be defeated in it by being confined to the grave.</p>
