<p style=" "><b>For Daniel speaketh ... - </b>This doctrine that the Messiah must rise from the dead Peter proceeds to prove by a quotation from the Old Testament. This passage is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:8-11">Psalms 16:8-11</span>. It is made from the Greek version of the Septuagint, with only one slight and unimportant change. Nor is there any material change, as will be seen, from the Hebrew. In what sense this Psalm can be applied to Christ will be seen after we have examined the expressions which Peter alleges.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I foresaw the Lord - </b>This is an unhappy translation. To foresee the Lord always before us conveys no idea, though it may be a literal translation of the passage. The word means “to foresee,” and then “to see before us,” that is, “as present with us, to regard as being near.” It thus implies “to put confidence in one; to rely on him, or expect assistance from him.” This is its meaning here. The Hebrew is, “I expected, or waited for.” It thus expresses the petition of one who is helpless and dependent, who waits for help from God. It is often thus used in the Old Testament.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Always before my face - </b>As being always present to help me, and to deliver me out of all my troubles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He is on my right hand - </b>To be at hand is to be near to afford help. The right hand is mentioned because that was the place of dignity and honor. David did not design simply to say that he was near to help him, but that he had the place of honor, the highest place in his affections, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:31">Psalms 109:31</span>. In our dependence on God we should exalt him. We should not merely regard him as our help, but should at the same time give him the highest place in our affections.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That I should not be moved - </b>That is, that no great evil or calamity should happen to me; that I may stand firm. The phrase denotes “to sink into calamities, or to fall into the power of enemies,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+62:2">Psalms 62:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+62:6">Psalms 62:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+46:6">Psalms 46:6</span>. This expresses the confidence of one who is in danger of great calamities, and who puts his trust in the help of God alone.</p>
