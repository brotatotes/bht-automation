<p style=" "><b>Therefore - </b>Peter ascribes these expressions to the Messiah. The reason why he would exult or rejoice was, that he would be preserved amidst the sorrows that were coming on him, and could look forward to the triumph that awaited him. Thus, Paul says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span> that “Jesus ...“for the joy that was set before him,” endured the cross, despising the shame,” etc. Throughout the New Testament, the shame and sorrow of his sufferings were regarded as connected with his glory and his triumph, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:26">Luke 24:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6-9">Philippians 2:6-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-21">Ephesians 1:20-21</span>. In this our Saviour has left us an example that we should walk in his steps. The prospect of future glory and triumph should sustain us amidst all afflictions, and make us ready, like him, to lie down in even the corruptions of the grave.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Did my heart rejoice - </b>In the Hebrew this is in the prescott tense, “my heart rejoices.” The word “heart” here expresses “the person,” and is the same as saying “I rejoice.” The Hebrews used the different members to express the person. And thus we say, “every soul perished; the vessel had 40 hands; wise heads do not think so; hearts of steel will not flinch,” etc. (Prof. Stuart on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:1-11">Psalms 16:1-11</span>). The meaning is, because God is near me in time of calamity, and will support and deliver me, I will not be agitated or fear, but will exult in the prospect of the future, in view of the “joy that is set before me.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>My tongue was glad - </b>Hebrew, My glory or my honor exults. The word is used to denote “majesty, splendor, dignity, honor.” It is also used to express the heart or soul, either because that is the chief source of man’s dignity, or because the word is also expressive of the liver, regarded by the Hebrews as the seat of the affections, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:6">Genesis 49:6</span>, “Unto their assembly, mine honor,” that is, my soul, or myself, “be not thou united”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+57:8">Psalms 57:8</span>, “Awake up, my glory,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+108:1">Psalms 108:1</span>, “I will sing ...even with my glory.” This word the Septuagint translated “tongue.” The Arabic and Latin Vulgate have also done the same. Why they thus use the word is not clear. It may be because the tongue, or the gift of speech, was what chiefly contributes to the honor of man, or distinguishes him from the brutal creation. The word “glory” is used expressly for “tongue” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+30:12">Psalms 30:12</span>; “To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Moreover also - </b>Truly; in addition to this.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My flesh - </b>My body. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>. It means here properly the body separate from the soul; the dead body.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall rest - </b>Shall rest or repose in the grave, free from corruption.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In hope - </b>In confident expectation of a resurrection. The Hebrew word rather expresses confidence than hope. The passage means, “My body will I commit to the grave, with a confident expectation of the future, that is, with a firm belief that it will not see corruption, but will be raised up.” It thus expresses the feelings of the dying Messiah; the assured confidence which he had that his repose in the grave would not be long, and would certainly come to an end. The death of Christians is also in the New Testament represented as a sleep, and as repose <span class="_0000ff"><u>Act 7:60</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:18">1 Corinthians 15:18</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Th 4:13</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:4">2 Peter 3:4</span>; and they may also, after the example of their Lord, commit their bodies to the dust, in hope. They will lie in the grave under the assurance of a happy resurrection; and though their bodies, unlike his, will moulder to their native dust, yet this corruptible will put on incorruption, and this mortal will put on immorality, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:53">1 Corinthians 15:53</span>.</p>
