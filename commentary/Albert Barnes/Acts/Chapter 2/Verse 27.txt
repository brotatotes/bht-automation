<p style=" "><b>Thou wilt not leave my soul - </b>The word “soul,” with us, means “the thinking, the immortal part of man,” and is applied to it whether existing in connection with the body or separate from it. The Hebrew word translated “soul” here, <span class="_800000">נפשׁ</span> nephesh, however, may mean “spirit, mind, life,” and may denote here nothing more than “me” or “myself.” It means, properly, “breath”; then “life,” or “the vital principle, a living being”; then “the soul, the spirit, the thinking part.” Instances where it is put for the individual himself, meaning “me” or “myself” may be seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+11:1">Psalms 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+35:3">Psalms 35:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+35:7">Psalms 35:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+9:21">Job 9:21</span>. There is no clear instance in which it is applied to the soul in its separate state, or disjoined from the body. In this place it must be explained in part by the meaning of the word hell. If that means grave, then this word probably means “me”; thou wilt not leave me in the grave. The meaning probably is, “Thou wilt not leave me in Sheol, neither,” etc. The word “leave” here means, “Thou wilt not resign me to, or wilt not give me over to it, to be held under its power.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>In hell - </b> - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς ᾅδου</span></span> eis Hadou. The word “hell,” in English, now commonly denotes “the place of the future eternal punishment of the wicked.” This sense it has acquired by long usage. It is a Saxon word, derived from helan, “to cover,” and denotes literally “a covered or deep place” (Webster); then “the dark and dismal abode of departed spirits”; and then “the place of torment.” As the word is used now by us, it by no means expresses the force of the original; and if with this idea we read a passage like the one before us, it would convey an erroneous meaning altogether, although formerly the English word perhaps expressed no more than the original. The Greek word “Hades” means literally “a place devoid of light; a dark, obscure abode”; and in Greek writers was applied to the dark and obscure regions where disembodied spirits were supposed to dwell. It occurs only eleven times in the New Testament. In this place it is the translation of the Hebrew <span class="_800000">שׁאול</span> Sh<sup>e</sup>owl.</p>
<p style=" ">In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13-14">Revelation 20:13-14</span>, it is connected with death: “And death and hell (Hades) delivered up the dead which were in them”; “And death and hell (Hades) were cast into the lake of fire.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>, “I have the keys of hell and death.” In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:55">1 Corinthians 15:55</span> it means the grave: “O grave (Hades), where is thy victory?” In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span> it means a deep, profound place, opposed to an exalted one; a condition of calamity and degradation, opposed to former great prosperity: “Thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell” (Hades). In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:23">Luke 16:23</span> it is applied to the place where the rich man was after death, in a state of punishment: “In hell (Hades) he lifted up his eyes, being in torments.” In this place it is connected with the idea of suffering, and undoubtedly denotes a place of punishment. The Septuagint has used this word commonly to translate the word <span class="_800000">שׁאול</span> Sh<sup>e</sup>̀owl.</p>
<p style=" ">Once it is used as a translation of the phrase “the stones of the pit” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:19">Isaiah 14:19</span>; twice to express silence, particularly the silence of the grave <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+94:17">Psalms 94:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+115:17">Psalms 115:17</span>; once to express the Hebrew for “the shadow of death” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:17">Job 38:17</span>; and sixty times to translate the word Sheol. It is remarkable that it is never used in the Old Testament to denote the word <span class="_800000">קבר</span> qeber, which properly denotes “a grave or sepulchre.” The idea which was conveyed by the word Sheol, or Hades, was not properly a grave or sepulchre, but that dark, unknown state, including the grave, which constituted the dominions of the dead. What idea the Hebrews had of the future world it is now difficult to explain, and is not necessary in the case before us. The word originally denoting simply “the state of the dead, the insatiable demands of the grave,” came at last to be extended in its meaning, in proportion as they received new revelations or formed new opinions about the future world. Perhaps the following may be the process of thought by which the word came to have the special meanings which it is found to have in the Old Testament:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The word “death” and the grave <span class="_800000">קבר</span> qeber would express the abode of a deceased body in the earth.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Man has a soul, a thinking principle, and the inquiry must arise, What will be its state? Will it die also? The Hebrews never appear to have believed that. Will it ascend to heaven at once? On that subject they had at first no knowledge. Will it go at once to a place of happiness or of torment? Of that, also, they had no information at first Yet they supposed it would live; and the word <span class="_800000">שׁאול</span> Sh<sup>e</sup>owl expressed just this state - the dark, unknown regions of the dead; the abode of spirits, whether good or bad; the residence of departed people, whether fixed in a permanent habitation, or whether wandering about. As they were ignorant of the size and spherical structure of the earth, they seem to have supposed this region to be situated in the earth, far below us, and hence, it is put in opposition to heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:8">Psalms 139:8</span>, “If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell (Sheol), behold, thou art there”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+9:2">Amos 9:2</span>. The most common use of the word is, therefore, to express those dark regions, the lower world, the region of ghosts, etc. Instances of this, almost without number, might be given. See a most striking and sublime instance of this in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:9">Isaiah 14:9</span>; “Hell from beneath is moved to meet thee,” etc.; where the assembled dead are represented as being agitated in all their vast regions at the death of the King of Babylon.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The inquiry could not but arise whether all these beings were happy. This point revelation decided; and it was decided in the O d Testament. Yet this word would better express the state of the wicked dead than the righteous. It conveyed the idea of darkness, gloom, wandering; the idea of a sad and unfixed abode, unlike heaven. Hence, the word sometimes expresses the idea of a place of punishment: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:17">Psalms 9:17</span>, “The wicked shall be turned into hell,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+15:11">Proverbs 15:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+23:14">Proverbs 23:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+27:20">Proverbs 27:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+26:6">Job 26:6</span>. While, therefore, the word does not mean properly a grave or a sepulchre, it does mean often “the state of the dead,” without designating whether in happiness or woe, but implying the continued existence of the soul. In this sense it is often used in the Old Testament, where the Hebrew word is Sheol, and the Greek Hades: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:35">Genesis 37:35</span>, “I will go down into the grave, unto my son, mourning” I will go down to the dead, to death, to my son, still there existing; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+42:38">Genesis 42:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+44:29">Genesis 44:29</span>, “He shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:30">Numbers 16:30</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:33">Numbers 16:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:6">1 Kings 2:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:9">1 Kings 2:9</span>; etc. etc. in the place before us, therefore, the meaning is simply, thou wilt not leave me among the dead. This conveys all the idea. It does not mean literally the grave or the sepulchre; that relates only to the body. This expression refers to the deceased Messiah. Thou wilt not leave him among the dead; thou wilt raise him up. It is from this passage, perhaps, aided by two others (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:7">Romans 10:7</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:19">1 Peter 3:19</span>), that the doctrine originated that Christ “descended,” as it is expressed in the Creed, “into hell”; and many have invented strange opinions about his going among lost spirits. The doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church has been that he went to purgatory, to deliver the spirits confined there. But if the interpretation now given be correct, then it will follow:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thine Holy One - </b>The word in the Hebrew which is translated here “Holy One” properly denotes “One who is tenderly and piously devoted to another,” and corresponds to the expression used in the New Testament, “my beloved Son.” It is also used, as it is here by the Septuagint and by Peter, to denote “One that is holy, that is set apart to God.” In this sense it is applied to Christ, either as being set apart to this office, or as so pure as to make it proper to designate him by way of eminence the Holy One, or the Holy One of God. It is several times used as the wellknown designation of the Messiah: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:24">Mark 1:24</span>, “I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:34">Luke 4:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span>, “But ye denied the Holy One, and the just,” etc. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>, “That holy thing that is born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>To see corruption - </b>To see corruption is to experience it, to be made partakers of it. The Hebrews often expressed the idea of experiencing anything by the use of words pertaining to the senses, as, to taste of death, to see death, etc. Corruption here means putrefaction in the grave. The word which is used in the Psalm, <span class="_800000">שׁחת</span> shachath, is thus used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+17:14">Job 17:14</span>, “I have said to corruption, thou art my father,” etc. The Greek word used here properly denotes this. Thus, it is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:34-37">Acts 13:34-37</span>. This meaning would be properly suggested by the Hebrew word, and thus the ancient versions understood it. The meaning implied in the expression is, that he of whom the Psalm was written should be restored to life again; and this meaning Peter proceeds to show that the words must have.</p>
