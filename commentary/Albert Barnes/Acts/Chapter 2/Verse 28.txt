<p style=" "><b>Thou hast made known ... - </b>The Hebrew is, “Thou wilt make known to me,” etc. In relation to the Messiah, it means, Thou wilt restore me to life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The ways of life - </b>This properly means the path to life; as we say, the road to preferment or honor; the path to happiness; the highway to ruin, etc. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+7:26-27">Proverbs 7:26-27</span>. It means, thou wilt make known to me life itself, that is, thou wilt restore me to life. The expressions in the Psalm are capable of this interpretation without doing any violence to the text; and if the preceding verses refer to the death and burial of the Messiah, then the natural and proper meaning of this is, that he would be restored to life again.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou shalt make me full of joy - </b>This expresses the feelings of the Messiah in view of the favor that would thus be showed him; the resurrection from the dead, and the elevation to the right hand of God. It was this which is represented as sustaining him the prospect of the joy that was before him, in heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-22">Ephesians 1:20-22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With thy countenance - </b>Literally, “with thy face,” that is, in thy presence. The words “countenance” and “presence” mean the same thing, and denote “favor,” or the “honor and happiness” provided by being admitted to the presence of God. The prospect of the honor that would be bestowed on the Messiah was what sustained him. And this proves that the person contemplated in the Psalm expected to be raised from the dead, and exalted to the presence of God. That expectation is now fulfilled, and the Messiah is now filled with joy in his exaltation to the throne of the universe. He has “ascended to his Father and our Father”; he is “seated at the right hand of God”; he has entered on that “joy which was set before him”; he is “crowned with glory and honor”; and “all things are put under his feet.” In view of this, we may remark:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)If the Saviour rejoiced in view of the glories before him, we should also. We should anticipate with joy an everlasting dwelling in the presence of God, and the high honor of sitting “with him on his throne, as he overcame, and is set down with the Father on his throne.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)The prospect of this should sustain us, as it did him, in the midst of persecution, calamity, and trials. Thy will soon be ended; and if we are his friends, we shall “overcome,” as he did, and be admitted to “the fulness of joy” above, and to the “right hand” of God, “where are pleasures forevermore.”</p>
