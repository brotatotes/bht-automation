<p style=" "><b>Therefore, being by the right hand - </b>The right hand among the Hebrews was often used to denote “power”; and the expression here means, not that he was exalted to the right hand of God. but by his power. He was raised from the dead by his power, and borne to heaven, triumphant over all his enemies. The use of the word “right hand” to denote “power” is common in the Scriptures: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+40:14">Job 40:14</span>, “Thine own right hand can save thee”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+17:7">Psalms 17:7</span>, “Thou savest by thy right hand them that trust in thee”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:35">Psalms 18:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+20:6">Psalms 20:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:8">Psalms 21:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+44:3">Psalms 44:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+60:5">Psalms 60:5</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Exalted - </b>Constituted King and Messiah in heaven. Raised up from his condition of humiliation to the glory which he had with the Father before the world was, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And having received ... - </b>The Holy Spirit was promised to the disciples before his death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13-15">John 16:13-15</span>. It was expressly declared:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath shed forth this ... - </b>This power of speaking different languages and declaring the truth of the gospel. In this way Peter accounts for the remarkable events before them. What had occurred could not be produced by new wine, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>. It was expressly foretold, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:16-21">Acts 2:16-21</span>. It was predicted that Jesus would rise, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22-31">Acts 2:22-31</span>. The apostles were witnesses that he had risen, and that he had promised that the Holy Spirit would descend; and the fulfillment of this promise was a rational way of accounting for the scene before them. It was unanswerable; and the effect on those who witnessed it was such as might be expected.</p>
