<p style=" "><b>For the promise - </b>That is, the promise respecting the particular thing of which he was speaking - the influences of the Holy Spirit. This promise he had adduced in the beginning of his discourse <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>, and he now applies it to them. As the Spirit was promised to descend on Jews and their sons and daughters, it was applicable to them in the circumstances in which they then were. The only hope of lost sinners is in the promises of God, and the only thing that can give comfort to a soul that is convicted of sin is the hope that God will pardon and save.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto you - </b>To you Jews, even though you have crucified the Messiah. The promise had special reference to the Jewish people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To your children - </b>In Joel, to their sons and daughters, who would, nevertheless, be old enough to prophesy. Similar promises occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:3">Isaiah 44:3</span>, “I will pour my Spirit on thy seed, and my blessing on thine offspring”; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:21">Isaiah 59:21</span>, “My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and forever.” In these and similar places their descendants or posterity are denoted. It does not refer merely to children as children, and should not be adduced as applicable exclusively to infants. It is a promise I to parents that the blessings of salvation shall not be confined to parents, but shall be extended also to their posterity. Under this promise parents may be encouraged to train up their children for God; they are authorized to devote them to him in the ordinance of Christian baptism, and they may trust in his gracious purpose thus to perpetuate the blessings of salvation from age to age.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To all - </b>To the whole race; not limited to Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Afar off - </b>To those in other lands. It is probable that Peter here referred to the Jews who were scattered in other nations; for he does not seem yet to have understood that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:0">Acts 10:0</span>: Yet the promise was equally applicable to the Gentiles as the Jews, and the apostles were afterward brought so to understand it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:0">Acts 10:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14-20">Romans 10:14-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:0">Romans 11:0</span>. The Gentiles are sometimes clearly indicated by the expression “afar off <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:13">Ephesians 2:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>; and they are represented as having been brought nigh by the blood of Christ. The phrase is equally applicable to those who have been far off from God by their sins and their evil affections. To them also the promise is extended if they will return.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even as many ... - </b>The promise is not to those who do not hear the gospel, nor to those who do not obey it; but it is to those to whom God in his gracious providence shall send it. He has the power and right to pardon. The meaning of Peter is, that the promise is ample, full, free; that it is suited to all, and may be applied to all; that there is no defect or lack in the provisions or promises, but that God may extend it to whomsoever he pleases. We see here how ample and full are the offers of mercy. God is hot limited in the provisions of his grace; but the plan is applicable to all mankind. It is also the purpose of God to send it to all people, and he has given a solemn charge to his church to do it. We cannot reflect but with deep pain on the fact that, although these provisions have been made - fully made; that they are adapted to all people; but that yet they have been extended by his people to so small a portion of the human family. If the promise of life is to all, it is the duty of the church to send to all the message of mercy.</p>
