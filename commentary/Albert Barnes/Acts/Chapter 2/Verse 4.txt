<p style=" "><b>Were all filled with the Holy Ghost - </b>Were entirely under his sacred influence and power. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:41">Luke 1:41</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:67">Luke 1:67</span>. To be filled with anything is a phrase denoting that all the faculties are pervaded by it, engaged in it, or under its influence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:10">Acts 3:10</span>, “Were filled with wonder and amazement”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>, “Filled with indignation”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>, “Filled with envy”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span>, “Filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Began to speak with other tongues - </b>In other languages than their native tongue. The languages which they spoke are specified in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9-11">Acts 2:9-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As the Spirit gave them utterance - </b>As the Holy Spirit gave them power to speak. This language implies plainly that they were now endued with a faculty of speaking languages which they had not before learned. Their native tongue was that of Galilee, a somewhat barbarous dialect of the common language used in Judea - the Syro-Chaldaic. It is possible that some of them might have been partially acquainted with the Greek and Latin, as each of those languages was spoken among the Jews to some extent; but there is not the slightest evidence that they were acquainted with the languages of the different nations afterward specified. Various attempts have been made to account for this remarkable phenomenon without supposing it to be a miracle. But the natural and obvious meaning of the passage is, that they were endowed by the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit with ability to speak foreign languages, and languages to them before unknown. It does not appear that each one had the power of speaking all the languages which are specified <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9-11">Acts 2:9-11</span>, but that this ability was among them, and that together they could speak these languages, probably some one and some another. The following remarks may perhaps throw some light on this remarkable occurrence:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It was predicted in the Old Testament that what is here stated would occur in the times of the Messiah. Thus, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:11">Isaiah 28:11</span>, “With ...another tongue will he speak unto this people.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:21">1 Corinthians 14:21</span> where this passage is expressly applied to the power of speaking foreign languages under the gospel.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It was promised by the Lord Jesus that they should have this power, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:17">Mark 16:17</span>, “These signs shall follow them that believe ...they shall speak with new tongues.”</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The ability to do it existed extensively and long in the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10-11">1 Corinthians 12:10-11</span>, “To another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:28">Acts 2:28</span>, “God hath set in the church ...diversities of tongues.” Compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:30">Acts 2:30</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:2">Acts 14:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:4-6">Acts 14:4-6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:9">Acts 14:9</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:13-14">Acts 14:13-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:18-19">Acts 14:18-19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22-23">Acts 14:22-23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:27">Acts 14:27</span>, <span class="_0000ff"><u>Act 14:39</u></span>. From this it appears that the power was well known in the church, and was not confined to the apostles. This also may show that in the case in the Acts , the ability to do this was conferred on other members of the church as well as the apostles.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) It was very important that they should be endowed with this power in their great work. They were going forth to preach to all nation; and though the Greek and Roman tongues were extensively spoken, yet their use was not universal, nor is it known that the apostles were skilled in those languages. To preach to all nations, it was indispensable that they should be able to understand their language. And in order that the gospel might be rapidly propagated through the earth, it was necessary that they should be endowed with ability to do this without the slow process of being compelled to learn them. It will contribute to illustrate this to remark that one of the principal hindrances in the spread of the gospel now arises from the inability to speak the languages of the nations of the earth, and that among missionaries of modern times a long time is necessarily spent in acquiring the language of a people before they are prepared to preach to them.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) One design was to establish the gospel by means of miracles. Yet no miracle could be more impressive than the power of conveying their sentiments at once in all the languages of the earth. When it is remembered what a slow and toilsome process it is to learn a foreign tongue, this would I be regarded by the pagan as one of the most striking miracles which could be performed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:22">1 Corinthians 14:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24-25">1 Corinthians 14:24-25</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) The reality and certainty of this miracle is strongly attested by the early triumphs of the gospel. That the gospel was early spread over all the world, and that, too, by the apostles of Jesus Christ, is the clear testimony of all history. They preached it in Arabia, Greece, Syria, Asia, Persia, Africa, and Rome. Yet how could this have been effected without a miraculous power of speaking the languages used in all those places? Now, it requires the toil of many years to speak in foreign languages; and the recorded success of the gospel is one of the most striking attestations to the fact of the miracle that could be conceived.</p>
<p style=" ">(7) The corruption of language was one of the most decided effects of sin, and the source of endless embarrassments and difficulties, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:0">Genesis 11:0</span>: It is not to be regarded as wonderful that one of the effects of the plan of recovering people should be to show the power of God over all evil, and thus to furnish striking evidence that the gospel could meet all the crimes and calamities of people. And we may add,</p>
<p style=" ">(8) That from this we see the necessity now of training people who are to be missionaries to other lands. The gift of miracles is withdrawn. The apostles, by that miracle, simply were empowered to speak other languages. That power must still be had if the gospel is to be preached. But it is now to be obtained, not by miracle, but by stow and careful study and toil. If possessed, people must be taught it. And as the church is bound <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> to send the gospel to all nations, so it is bound to provide that the teachers who shall be sent forth shall be qualified for their work. Hence, one of the reasons of the importance of training men for the holy ministry.</p>
