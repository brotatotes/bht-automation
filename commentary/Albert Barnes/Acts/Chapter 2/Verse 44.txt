<p style=" "><b>All that believed - </b>That is, that believed that Jesus was the Messiah; for that was the distinguishing point by which they were known from others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Were together - </b>Were united; were joined in the same thing. It does not mean that they lived in the same house, but they were united in the same community, or engaged in the same thing. They were doubtless often together in the same place for prayer and praise. One of the best means for strengthening the faith of young converts is for them often to meet together for prayer, conversation, and praise.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had all things common - </b>That is, all their property or possessions. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32-37">Acts 4:32-37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:1-10">Acts 5:1-10</span>. The apostles, in the time of the Saviour, evidently had all their property in common stock, and Judas was made their treasurer. They regarded themselves as one family, having common needs, and there was no use or propriety in their possessing extensive property by themselves. Yet even then it is probable that some of them retained an interest in their property which was not supposed to be necessary to be devoted to the common use. It is evident that John thus possessed property which he retained, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:27">John 19:27</span>. And it is clear that the Saviour did not command them to give up their property into a common stock, nor did the apostles enjoin it: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:4">Acts 5:4</span>, “While it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold was it not in thine own power?” It was, therefore, perfectly voluntary, and was as evidently adapted to the special circumstances of the early converts. Many of them came from abroad. They were from Parthia, and Media, and Arabia, and Rome, and Africa, etc. It is probable, also, that they now remained longer in Jerusalem than they had at first proposed; and it is not at all improbable that they would be denied now the usual hospitalities of the Jews, and excluded from their customary kindness, because they had embraced Jesus of Nazareth, who had been just put to death. In these circumstances, it was natural and proper that they should share their property while they remained together.</p>
