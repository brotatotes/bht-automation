<p style=" "><b>And sold - </b>That is, they sold as much as was necessary in order to procure the means of providing for the needs of each other.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Possessions - </b>Property, particularly real estate. This word, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτήματα</span></span> ktēmata, refers properly to their fixed property, as lands, houses, vineyards, etc. The word rendered “goods,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὑπάρξεις</span></span> huparxeis, refers to their personal or movable “property.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And parted them to all - </b>They distributed them to supply the needs of their poorer brethren, according to their necessities.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As every man had need - </b>This expression limits and fixes the meaning of what is said before. The passage does not mean that they sold all their possessions, or that they relinquished their title to all their property, but that they so far regarded all as common as to be willing to part with it if it was needful to supply the needs of the others. Hence, the property was laid at the disposal of the apostles, and they were desired to distribute it freely to meet the needs of the poor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:34-35">Acts 4:34-35</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">This was an important incident in the early propagation of religion, and it may suggest many useful reflections:</p>
<p style=" ">1. We see the effect of religion. The love of property is one of the strongest affections which people have. There is nothing that will overcome it but religion. That will; and one of the first effects of the gospel was to loosen the hold of Christians on property.</p>
<p style=" ">2. It is the duty of the church to provide for the needs of its poor and needy members. There can be no doubt that property should now be regarded as so far common as that the needs of the poor should be supplied by those who are rich. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:11">Matthew 26:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">3. If it be asked why the early disciples evinced this readiness to part with their property in this manner, it may be replied:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)It was the nature of religion to do it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)The circumstances of the persons assembled on this occasion were such as to require it. They were many of them from distant regions, and probably many of them of the poorer class of the people in Jerusalem. In this they evinced what should be done in behalf of the poor in the church at all times.</p>
<p style=" ">4. If it be asked whether this was done commonly among the early Christians, it may be replied that there is no evidence that it was. It is mentioned here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32-37">Acts 4:32-37</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:1-7">Acts 5:1-7</span>. It does not appear that it was done even by all who were afterward converted in Judea; and there is no evidence that it was done in Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi, Rome, etc. That the effect of religion was to make people liberal and willing to provide for the poor there can be no doubt. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 9:2</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span>. But there is no proof that it was common to part with their possessions and to lay them at the feet of the apostles. Religion does not contemplate, evidently, that people should break up all the arrangements in society, but it contemplates that those who have property should be ready and willing to part with it for the help of the poor and needy.</p>
<p style=" ">5. If it be asked, then, whether all the arrangements of property should be broken up now, and believers have all things in common, we are prepared to answer “No.” Because:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)It was not even enjoined by the apostles on them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)It was practiced nowhere else.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)It would be impracticable. No community where all things were held in common has long prospered. It has been attempted often, by pagans, by infidels, and by fanatical sects of Christians. It ends soon in anarchy, licentiousness, idleness, and profligacy; or the more cunning secure the mass of the property, and control the whole. Until all people are made alike, there could be no hope of such a community; and if there could be, it would not be desirable. God evidently intended that people should be excited to industry by the hope of gain; and then he demands that their gains shall be devoted to his service. Still, this was a noble instance of Christian generosity, and evinced the power of religion in loosing the hold which people commonly have on the world. It rebukes also those professors of religion, of whom, alas, there are many, who give nothing to benefit either the souls or bodies of their fellow-men.</p>
