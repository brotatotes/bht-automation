<p style=" "><b>In the temple - </b>This was the public place of worship; and the disciples were not disposed to leave the place where their fathers had so long worshipped God. This does not mean that they were constantly in the temple, but only at the customary hours of prayer - at nine o’clock in the morning, and at three o’clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And breaking bread - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:42">Acts 2:42</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From house to house - </b>In the margin, “at home.” So the Syriac and Arabic. The common interpretation, however, is, that they did it in their various houses, now in this and now in that, as might be convenient. If it refers to their ordinary meals, then it means that they partook in common of what they possessed, and the expression “did eat their meat” seems to imply that this refers to their common meals, and not to the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Did eat their meat - </b>Did partake of their food. The word “meat” with us is applied to “flesh.” In the Bible, and in Old English authors, it is applied to “provisions” of any kind. Here it means all kinds of sustenance; what nourished them - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τροφῆς</span></span> trophēs - and the use of this word proves that it does not refer to the Lord’s Supper; for that ordinance is nowhere represented as designed for an ordinary meal, or to nourish the body.

<p style=" "><b>With gladness - </b>With rejoicing. This is one of the effects of religion. It is far from gloom; it diffuses happiness over the mind; it bestows additional joy in the participation of even our ordinary pleasures.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Singleness of heart - </b>This means with a sincere and pure heart. They were satisfied and thankful. They were not perplexed or anxious; nor were they solicitous for the luxurious living, or aspiring after the vain objects of the people of the world.
