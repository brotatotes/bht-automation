Testifying - Bearing witness to the necessity of repentance toward God. Or teaching them the nature of repentance, and exhorting them to repent and believe. Perhaps the word “testifying” includes both ideas of giving evidence, and of urging with great earnestness and affection that repentance and faith were necessary. See 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:14; where the word used here, and here translated “testify,” is there translated correctly, “charge,” in the sense of “strongly urging, or entreating with great earnestness.”And also to the Greeks - To all who were not Jews. “The Greeks” properly denoted “those who lived in Greece, and who spoke the Greek language.” But the phrase, “Jews and Greeks,” among the Hebrews, denoted “the whole human race.” He urged the necessity of repentance and faith in all. Religion makes no distinction, but regards all as sinners, and as needing salvation by the blood of the Redeemer.Repentance toward God - See the notes on Matthew 3:2. Repentance is to be exercised “toward God,” because:And faith - See the notes on Mark 16:16.Toward - εἰς eis. In regard to; in; confidence in the work and merits of the Lord Jesus. This is required, because there is no other one who can save from sin. See the notes on Acts 4:12.
