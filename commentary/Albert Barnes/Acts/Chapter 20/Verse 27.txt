<p style=" "><b>For - </b>This verse contains a reason for what had been said in the previous verse. It shows why Paul regarded himself as innocent if they should be lost.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I have not shunned - </b>I have not kept back; I have not been deterred by fear, by the desire of popularity, by the fact that the doctrines of the gospel are unpalatable to people, from declaring them fully. The proper meaning of the word translated here, “I have not shunned” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὑπεστειλάμην</span></span> hupesteilamēn, is “to disguise any important truth; to withdraw it from public view; to decline publishing it from fear, or an apprehension of the consequences.” Paul means that he had not disguised any truth; he had not withdrawn or kept it from open view, by any apprehension of the effect which it might have on their minds. Truth may be disguised or kept back:</p>
<p style=" ">People may resort to this course:</p>
<p style=" "><b>All the counsel - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πᾶσαν τὴν βουλὴν</span></span> pasan tēn boulēn. The word “counsel” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλὴ</span></span> boulē) denotes properly “consolation, deliberation,” and then “will or purpose,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:51">Luke 23:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>. It means here the will or purpose of God, as revealed in regard to the salvation of people. Paul had made a full statement of that plan of the guilt of people, of the claims of the Law, of the need of a Saviour, of the provisions of mercy, and of the state of future rewards and punishments. Ministers ought to declare all that counsel, because God commands it; because it is needful for the salvation of people; and because the message is not theirs, but God’s, and they have no right to change, to disguise, or to withhold it. And if it is the duty of ministers to declare that counsel, it is the duty of a people to listen to it with respect and candor, and with a desire to know the truth, and to be saved by it. Declaring the counsel of God will do no good unless it is received into honest and humble hearts, and with a disposition to know what God has revealed for salvation.</p>
