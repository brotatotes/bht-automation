<p style=" "><b>Take heed, therefore - </b>Attend to; be on your guard against the dangers which beset you, and seek to discharge your duty with fidelity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto yourselves - </b>To your own piety, opinions, and mode of life. This is the first duty of a minister; for without this all his preaching will be vain. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:17">Colossians 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>. Ministers are beset with unique dangers and temptations, and against them they should be on their guard. In addition to the temptations which they have in common with other people, they are exposed to those special to their office - arising from flattery, and ambition, and despondency, and worldly-mindedness. And just in proportion to the importance of their office is the importance of the injunction of Paul, to take heed to themselves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to all the flock - </b>The church; the charge entrusted to them. The church of Christ is often compared to a flock. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-20">John 10:1-20</span> notes; also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15-17">John 21:15-17</span> notes. The word “flock” here refers particularly to the church, and not to the congregation in general, for it is represented to be what was purchased with the blood of the atonement. The command here is:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) To take heed to the church; that is, to instruct, teach, and guide it; to guard it from enemies <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span>, and to make it their special object to promote its welfare.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) To take heed to all the flock the rich and the poor, the bond and the free, the old and the young. It is the duty of ministers to seek to promote the welfare of each individual of their charge not to pass by the poor because they are poor, and not to be afraid of the rich because they are rich. A shepherd regards the I interest of the tenderest of the fold as much as the strongest; and a faithful minister will seek to advance the interest of all. To do this he should know all his people; should be acquainted, as far as possible, with their unique needs, character, and dangers, and should devote himself to their welfare as his first and main employment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Over the which the Holy Ghost - </b>Though they had been appointed, doubtless, by the church, or by the apostles, yet it is here represented as having been done by the Holy Spirit. It was by him:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Overseers - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπισκόπους</span></span> episkopous. “Bishops.” The word properly denotes those who are appointed “to oversee or inspect anything.” This passage proves that the name “bishop” was applicable to elders; that in the time of the apostles, the name “bishop” and “presbyter,” or “elder,” was given to the same class of officers, and, of course, that there was no distinction between them. One term was originally used to denote “office,” the other term denotes “age,” and both words were applied to the same persons in the congregation. The same thing occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5-7">Titus 1:5-7</span>, where those who in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span> are called “elders,” are in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span> called “bishops.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1-10">1 Timothy 3:1-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To feed - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμαίνειν</span></span> poimainein. This word is properly applied to the care which a shepherd exercises over his flock. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15-16">John 21:15-16</span>. It is applicable not only to the act of feeding a flock, but also to that of protecting, guiding, and guarding it. It here denotes not merely the “duty” of instructing the church, but also of “governing” it; of “securing” it from enemies <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span>, and of “directing” its affairs so as to promote its edification and peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The church of God - </b>This is one of three passages in the New Testament in regard to which there has been a long controversy among critics, which is not yet determined. The controversy is, whether is this the correct and genuine reading. The other two passages are, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:7">1 John 5:7</span>. The mss. and versions here exhibit three readings: “the church of God” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοῦ Θεός</span></span> tou Theos the church of the Lord <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοῦ Κυρίου</span></span> tou Kuriou; and the church of the Lord and God <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυρίος καὶ Θεός</span></span> Kurios kai Theos. The Latin Vulgate reads it “God.” The Syriac, “the Lord.” The Arabic, “the Lord God.” The Ethiopic, “the Christian family of God.” The reading which now occurs in our text is found in no ancient mss. except the Vatican Codex, and occurs nowhere among the writings of the fathers except in Athanasius, in regard to whom also there is a various reading.</p>
<p style=" ">It is retained, however, by Beza, Mill, and Whitby as the genuine reading. The most ancient mss., and the best, read “the church of the Lord,” and this probably was the genuine text. It has been adopted by Griesbach and Wetstein; and many important reasons may be given why it should be retained. See those reasons stated at length in Kuinoel “in loco”; see also Griesbach and Wetstein. It may be remarked, that a change from Lord to God might easily be made in the transcribing, for in ancient mss. the words are not written at length, but are abbreviated. Thus, the name Christ <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστός</span></span> Christos is written ChoS; the name God <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεός</span></span> theos is written ThoS; the name Lord <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κύριος</span></span> kurios is written KOS; and a mistake, therefore, of a single letter would lead to the variations observable in the manuscripts. Compare in this place the note of Mill in his Greek Testament. The authority for the name “God” is so doubtful that it should not be used as a proof text on the divinity of Christ, and is not necessary, as there are so many undisputed passages on that subject.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which he hath purchased - </b>The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεποιήσατο</span></span> periepoiēsato occurs but in one other place in the New Testament - <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:13">1 Timothy 3:13</span>, “For they that have used the office of deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith.” The word properly means “to acquire or gain anything; to make it ours.” This may be done by a price, or by labor, etc. The noun (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιποίησις</span></span> peripoiēsis) derived from this verb is used several times in the New Testament, and denotes “acquisition:” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span>, God hath appointed us “to obtain” (unto the obtaining or acquisition of) salvation”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:14">2 Thessalonians 2:14</span>, “Whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>. In this place it means that Christ had “acquired, gained, or procured,” the church for himself by paying his own life as the price. The church is often represented as having thus been bought with a price, <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 6:20</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23">1 Corinthians 7:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With his own blood - </b>With the sacrifice of his own life; for blood is often put for life, and to shed the blood is equivalent to faking the life. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>. The doctrines taught here are:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That the death of Christ was an atoning sacrifice; that he offered himself to purchase a people to his own service.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That the church is, therefore, of special value a value to be estimated by the price paid for it. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18-19">1 Peter 1:18-19</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) That this fact should make the purity and salvation of the church an object of special solicitude with ministers of the gospel. They should be deeply affected in view of that blood which has been shed for the church; and they should guard and defend it as having been bought with the highest price in the universe. The chief consideration that will make ministers faithful and self-denying is, that the church has been bought with a price. If the Lord Jesus so loved it; if he gave himself for it, they should be willing to deny themselves; to watch, and toil, and pray, that the great object of his death the purity and the salvation of that church - may be obtained.</p>
