The most dangerous enemies which the church has had have been nurtured in its own bosom, and have consisted of those who have perverted the true doctrines of the gospel. Among the Ephesians, as among the Corinthians <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11-13">1 Corinthians 1:11-13</span>, there might be parties formed; there might be people influenced by ambition, like Diotrephes <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:9">3 John 1:9</span>, or like Phygellus or Hermogenes <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:15">2 Timothy 1:15</span>, or like Hymeneus and Alexander, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>. Men under the influence of ambition, or from the love of power or popularity, form parties in the church, produce divisions and distractions, and greatly retard its internal prosperity, and mar its peace. The church of Christ would have little to fear from external enemies if it nurtured no foes in its own bosom; and all the power of persecutors is not so much to be dreaded as the plans, the parties, the strifes, the heart burnings, and the contentions which are produced by those who love and seek power, among the professed friends of Christ.</p>
