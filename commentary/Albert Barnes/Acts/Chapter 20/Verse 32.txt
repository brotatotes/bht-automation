<p style=" "><b>And now, brethren - </b>About to leave them, probably to see them no more, he committed them to the faithful care and keeping of God Amidst all the dangers of the church, when human strength fails or is withdrawn, we may commit that church to the safe keeping and tender care of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I commend you - </b>I commit you; I place you <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατίθεμαι</span></span> paratithemai in his hands and under his protection. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to the word of his grace - </b>That is, to his gracious word; to his merciful promise. Paul refers, doubtless, to the gospel, including its promises of support, its consoling truths, and its directions to seek all needful help and comfort in God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is able - </b>Which has power. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τῷ δυναμένῳ</span></span> Tō dunamenō. Which word, or gospel, has power to build you up, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>, “For the Word of God is quick (living, life-giving, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζῶν</span></span> zōn), and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, etc.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:2">Isaiah 49:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:29">Jeremiah 23:29</span>, “Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?” It is implied here that the gospel is not a dead letter; that it has power to accomplish a great work; that it is adapted to the end in view, the conversion and sanctification of the soul. There is no danger in representing the gospel as mighty, and as suited by infinite wisdom to secure the renovation and salvation of man. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 1:18</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To build you up - </b>The word used here is properly applied to a house which is raised and completed by slow degrees, and by toil. It here means to establish, make firm, or permanent, and hence, to instruct, to establish in doctrine and in hope. The idea is, that the Word of God was able to confirm and establish them, amidst the dangers to which they would be exposed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to give you an inheritance - </b>To make you heirs, or to make you joint partakers with the saints of the blessings in reserve for the children of God. Those blessings are often represented as an inheritance, or heirship, which God will confer on his adopted children, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:29">Matthew 19:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:17">Mark 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12">Hebrews 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:7">Revelation 21:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:24">Colossians 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:29">Galatians 3:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Among all them which are sanctified - </b>With all who are holy; with an the saints. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span>. Those who shall be saved are made holy. They who receive a part in the inheritance beyond the grave will have it only among the sanctified and the pure. They must, therefore, be pure themselves, or they can have no part in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
