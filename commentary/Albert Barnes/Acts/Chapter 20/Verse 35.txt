<p style=" "><b>I have showed you - </b>I have taught you by instruction and example. I have not merely discoursed about it, but have showed you how to do it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All things - </b>Or, in respect to all things. In everything that respects preaching and the proper mode of life, I have for three years set you an example, illustrating the design, nature, and duties of the office by my own self-denials and toil.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How that - </b>Or, that - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὅτι</span></span> hoti. I have showed you that ye should by so laboring support the weak.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So labouring - </b>Laboring as I have done. Setting this example, and ministering in this way to the needs of others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To support the weak - </b>To provide for the needs of the sick and feeble members of the flock, who are unable to labor for themselves. “The weak” here denotes “the poor, the needy, the infirmed.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to remember - </b>To call to mind for encouragement, and with the force of a command,</p>
<p style=" "><b>The words of the Lord Jesus - </b>These words are nowhere recorded by the evangelists. But they did not pretend to record all his sayings and instructions. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:25">John 21:25</span>. There is the highest reason to suppose that many of his sayings which are not recorded would be treasured up by those who heard them; would be transmitted to others; and would be regarded as a precious part of his instructions. Paul evidently addresses the elders of Ephesus as if they had heard this before, and were acquainted with it. Perhaps he had himself reminded them of it. This is one of the Redeemer’s most precious sayings; and it seems even to have a special value from the fact that it is not recorded in the regular and professed histories of his life. It comes to us recovered, as it were, from the great mass of his unrecorded sayings; rescued from that oblivion to which it was hastening if left to mere tradition, and placed in permanent form in the sacred writings by the act of an apostle who had never seen the Saviour before his crucifixion. It is a precious relic - a memento of the Saviour - and the effect of it is to make us regret that more of his words were not recovered from an uncertain tradition, and placed in a permanent form by an inspired penman. God, however, who knows what is requisite to guide us, has directed the words which are needful for the welfare of the church, and has preserved by inspiration the doctrines which are adapted to convert and bless man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is more blessed to give - </b>It is a higher privilege; it tends more to the happiness of the individual and of the world. The giver is more blessed or happy than the receiver. This appears:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Because it is a condition for which we should be thankful when we are in a situation to promote the happiness of others.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Because it tends to promote the happiness of the benefactor himself. There is pleasure in the act of giving when it is done with pure motives. It promotes our own peace; is followed by happiness in the recollection of it; and will be followed by happiness forever. That is the most truly happy man who is most benevolent. He is the most miserable who has never known the luxury of doing good, but who lives to gain all he can, and to hoard all he gains.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) It is blessed in the reward that shall result from it. Those who give from a pure motive God will bless. They will be rewarded, not only in the peace which they shall experience in this life, but in the higher bliss of heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34-36">Matthew 25:34-36</span>. We may also remark that this is a sentiment truly great and noble. It is worthy of the Son of God. It is that on which he himself acted when he came to give pardon to the guilty, comfort to the disconsolate and the mourner, peace to the anxious sinner, sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, life to the dead, and heaven to the guilty and the lost. Acting on this, he gave his own tears to weep over human sorrows and human guilt; his own labors and toils to instruct and save man; his own life a sacrifice for sin on the cross. Loving to give, he has freely given us all things. Loving to give, he delights in the same character in his followers, and seeks that they who have wealth, and strength, and influence should be willing to give all to save the world. Imitating his great example, and complying with his command, the church shall yet learn more and more to give its wealth to bless the poor and needy; its sons and its daughters to bear the gospel to the benighted pagan; its undivided and constant efforts to save a lost world. Here closes this speech of Paul; an address of inimitable tenderness and beauty. Happy would it be if every minister could bid such an adieu to his people, when called to part from them; and happy if, at the close of life, every Christian could leave the world with a like consciousness that he had been faithful in the discharge of his duty. Thus dying, it will be blessed to leave the world; and thus would the example of the saints live in the memory of survivors long after they themselves have ascended to their rest.</p>
