<p style=" "><b>And upon the first day of the week - </b>Showing thus that this day was then observed by Christians as holy time. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To break bread - </b>Evidently to celebrate the Lord’s Supper. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span>. So the Syriac understands it, by translating it, “to break the eucharist”; that is, the eucharistic bread. It is probable that the apostles and early Christians celebrated the Lord’s Supper on every Lord’s day.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And continued his speech until midnight - </b>The discourse of Paul continued until the breaking of day, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:11">Acts 20:11</span>. But it was interrupted about midnight by the accident that occurred to Eutychus. The fact that Paul was about to leave them on the next day, probably to see them no more, was the principal reason why his discourse was so long continued. We are not to suppose, however, that it was one continued or set discourse. No small part of the time might have been passed in hearing and answering questions, though Paul was the chief speaker. The case proves that such seasons of extraordinary devotion may, in special circumstances, be proper. Occasions may arise where it will be proper for Christians to spend a much longer time than usual in public worship. It is evident, however, that such seasons do not often occur.</p>
