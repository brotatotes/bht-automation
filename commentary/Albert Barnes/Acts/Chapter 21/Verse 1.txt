<p style=" "><b>Unto Coos - </b>This was a small island in the Grecian Archipelago, a short distance from the southwestern point of Asia Minor. It is now called “Stan-co.” It was celebrated for its fertility, and for the wine and silk-worms which it produced. It was about 40 miles south of Miletus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto Rhodes - </b>This was also an island in the Grecian Archipelago. On the island was a city of the same name, which was principally distinguished for its brass Colossus, which was built by Chares of Lyndus. It stood across the mouth of the harbor, and was so high that vessels could pass between its legs. It stood for 56 years, and was then thrown down by an earthquake. It was reckoned as one of the seven wonders of the world. When the Saracens took possession of this island they sold this prostrate image to a Jew, who loaded 900 camels with the brass from it. This was 600 a.d., about 900 years after it had been thrown down. The ancient name of the island was Asteria. Its name, Rhodes, was given from the great quantity of roses which it produced.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto Patara - </b>This was a maritime city of Lycia, in Asia Minor, over against Rhodes.</p>
