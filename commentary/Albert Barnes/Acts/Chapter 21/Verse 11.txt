<p style=" "><b>He took Paulâ€™s girdle - </b>The loose, flowing robes, or outer garments, which were worn in Eastern countries, were bound by a girdle, or sash, around the body when they ran, or labored, or walked. Such a girdle was therefore an indispensable part of dress.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And bound his own hands and feet - </b>As emblematic of what would be done by the Jews to Paul. It was common for the prophets to perform actions which were emblematic of the events which they predicted. The design was to make the prediction more forcible and impressive by representing it to the eye. Thus, Jeremiah was directed to bury his girdle by the Euphrates, to denote the approaching captivity of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:4">Jeremiah 13:4</span>. Thus, he was directed to make bands and yokes, and to put them around his neck, as a sign to Edom and Moab, etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+27:2-3">Jeremiah 27:2-3</span>. Thus, the act of the potter was emblematic of the destruction that was coming upon the nation of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:4">Jeremiah 18:4</span>. So Isaiah walked naked and barefoot as a sign of the captivity of Egypt and Ethiopia, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+20:3-4">Isaiah 20:3-4</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+4:12">Ezekiel 4:12</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So shall the Jews ... - </b>This was fulfilled. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:33">Acts 21:33</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:0">Acts 24:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into the hands of the Gentiles - </b>To be tried; for the Romans then had jurisdiction over Judea.</p>
