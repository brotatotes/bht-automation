<p style=" "><b>After those days - </b>After what had occurred, as related in the previous verses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We took up our carriages - </b>This is a most unhappy translation. The word carriage we apply now exclusively to a vehicle for conveying anything as a coach, chariot, gig, cannon carriage, etc. The original word means simply that they prepared themselves; made themselves ready; put their baggage in order, etc. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀποσκευασάμενοι</span></span> aposkeuasamenoi. They prepared for the journey. The English word carriage was formerly used in the sense of what is carried, baggage, burden, vessels, furniture, etc. Thus, it was used in the time that our translation was made; and in this sense it is to be understood in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:22">1 Samuel 17:22</span>, “And David left his carriage (baggage) in the hand of the keeper of the carriage,” etc. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:20">Acts 21:20</span>, margin; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:28">Isaiah 10:28</span>, “At Michmash he hath laid up his carriages” (his baggage, etc.).</p>
