<p style=" "><b>One Mnason of Cyprus - </b>The original in this place would be better translated, “And brought us to Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple,” etc. It is evident that, though Mnason was originally of Cyprus, yet he was now an inhabitant of Jerusalem, and was well known to the disciples at Caesarea. It is possible that he might have been at Caesarea, and accompanied Paul to Jerusalem; but the more correct interpretation of the passage is, that Paul and his fellow-travelers were conducted to his house in Jerusalem, and that he was not with them in the journey.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of Cyprus - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>An old disciple - </b>An early convert to Christianity - perhaps one who was converted before the crucifixion of the Saviour.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With whom we should lodge - </b>In whose house we were to take up our abode. The rites of hospitality were shown in a distinguished manner by the early Christians.</p>
