<p style=" "><b>Unto James - </b>James the Less. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:13">Acts 15:13</span>. He resided at Jerusalem. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span>. It is not improbable that he was the only one of the apostles then at Jerusalem; and there is reason to believe that the church at Jerusalem was left under his particular care. It was natural, therefore, that Paul and his companions should take an early opportunity to see him. James was the cousin of our Lord, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span> he is called the Lordâ€™s brother. On all accounts, therefore, he was entitled to, and would receive, particular respect from the early disciples.</p>
