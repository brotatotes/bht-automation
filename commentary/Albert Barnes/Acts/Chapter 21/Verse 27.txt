<p style=" "><b>And when the seven days were almost ended - </b>Greek: as the seven days were about to be fulfilled - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἔμελλον συντελεῖσθαι</span></span> emellon sunteleisthai. The seven days which were to complete the observance of the vow, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>. Perhaps the whole observance in this case was intended to be but seven days, as the time of such a vow was voluntary. The translation, “were almost ended,” is not quite correct. The Greek implies no more than that the period of the seven days was about to be accomplished, without implying that it was near the close of them when he was seized. By comparing the following places, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:18">Acts 21:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:30">Acts 22:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:12">Acts 23:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:32">Acts 23:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:1">Acts 24:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:11">Acts 24:11</span>, it appears that the time of his seizure must have been near the beginning of those days (Doddridge).</p>
