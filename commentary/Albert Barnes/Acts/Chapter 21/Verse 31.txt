<p style=" "><b>The chief captain of the band - </b>This band or body of Roman soldiers was stationed in the castle Antonia, on the north of the temple. This was built by John Hyrcanus, high priest of the Jews, and was by him called Baris. It was beautified and strengthened by Herod the Great, and was called Antonia in honor of his friend, Mark Antony. Josephus describes this castle as consisting of four towers, one of which overlooked the temple, and which he says was 70 cubits high (<i>Jewish Wars</i>, book 5, chapter 5, section 8). In this castle a guard of Roman soldiers was stationed to secure the temple and to maintain the peace. The commander of this cohort is here called “the chief captain.” Reference is made to this guard several times in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:65-66">Matthew 27:65-66</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:12">John 18:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:26">Acts 5:26</span>. The word translated “chief captain” denotes properly “one who commanded 1,000 men.” The band <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπεῖρα</span></span> speira was the tenth part of a legion, and consisted sometimes of four hundred and twenty-five soldiers, at others of five hundred, and at others of six hundred, according to the size of the legion. The name of this captain was Claudius Lysias, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>.</p>
