<p style=" "><b>Upon the stairs - </b>The stairs which led from the temple to the castle of Antonia. Josephus says (<i>Jewish Wars</i>, book 5, chapter 5, section 8), that the castle of Antonia “was situated at the corner of two cloisters of the temple, of that on the west, and of that on the north; it was erected on a rock of 50 cubits (75 feet) in height, and was on a great precipice. On the corner where it joined to the two cloisters of the temple, it had passages down to them both, through which the guards went several ways among the cloisters with their arms, on the Jewish festivals, etc.” It was on these stairs, as the soldiers were returning, that the tumult was so great, or the crowd so dense, that they were obliged to hear Paul along to rescue him from their violence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The violence of the people - </b>The rush of the multitude.</p>
