<p style=" "><b>Had accomplished those days - </b>When those days were passed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They all brought us on our way - </b>They attended us. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:3">Acts 15:3</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:24">Romans 15:24</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:6">1 Corinthians 16:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:11">1 Corinthians 16:11</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:6">3 John 1:6</span> note. This was an expression of tender attachment, and of a deep interest in the welfare of Paul and his fellow-travelers.</p>

<p style=" "><b>On the shore - </b>Any place may be proper for prayer. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:21-24">John 4:21-24</span>. God is everywhere, and can as easily hear prayer on the seashore as in the most magnificent temple. This is an instance, as well as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:36">Acts 20:36</span>, where the apostle evidently prayed with the church without a form of prayer. No man can believe that he thus poured forth the desires of his heart at parting, and commended them to God in a prescribed form of words. Scenes like this show more clearly than abstract arguments could do that such a form was not needed, and would not be used. Paul and his fellow-Christians, on the sand of the sea-shore, would pour forth the gushing emotions of their souls in language such as their circumstances would suggest, and no man can read this narrative in a dispassionate manner without believing that they offered an extempore prayer.</p>
