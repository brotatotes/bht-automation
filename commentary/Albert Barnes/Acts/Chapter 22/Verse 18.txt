<p style=" "><b>And saw him - </b>Evidently, the Lord Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>. He had received his commission from him, and he now received a distinct command to go to the Gentiles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For they will not receive - </b>The inhabitants of Jerusalem, probably including both Jews and Christians. The Jews would not listen to him because he had become, in their view, an apostate, and they would hate and persecute him. The Christians would not be likely to receive him, for they would remember his former persecutions, and would be suspicious of him because he had been so long in Arabia, and had not sooner connected himself with them. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:26">Acts 9:26</span>, “And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.”</p>
