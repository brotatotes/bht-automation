<p style=" "><b>The castle - </b>The castle of Antonia. He would be there removed entirely from the wrath of the Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Should be examined - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀνετάζεσθαι</span></span> anetazesthai.” The word “examine” with us commonly means “to inquire, to question, to search for, to look carefully into a subject.” The word used here is commonly applied to metals whose nature is tested, or examined by fire; and then it mean to subject to torture or torments, in order to extort a confession where persons were accused of crime. It was often resorted to among the ancients. A common mode has been by the rack, but various kinds of torments have been invented in order to extort confessions of guilt from those who were accused. The whole practice has been one of the most flagrant violations of justice, and one of the foulest blots on human nature. In this case, the tribune saw that Paul was accused violently by the Jews; he was probably ignorant of the Hebrew language, and had not understood the address of Paul; he supposed from the extraordinary excitement that Paul must have been guilty of some flagrant offence, and he therefore resolved to subject him to torture to extort from him a confession.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By scourging - </b>By the scourge or whip. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:36">Hebrews 11:36</span>. This was one mode of torture, in order to extort a secret from those who were accused.</p>
