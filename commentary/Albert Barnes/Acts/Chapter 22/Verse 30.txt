<p style=" "><b>And commanded the chief priests ... - </b>Summoned a meeting of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation. He did this, as he was prevented from scourging Paul, in order to know what he had done, and that he might learn from the Jews themselves the nature of the charge against him. This was necessary for the safety of Paul and for the ends of justice. This should have been done without any attempt to torture him in order to extort a confession.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And brought Paul down - </b>From the elevated castle of Antonia. The council assembled commonly in the house of the high priest.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And set him before them - </b>He brought the prisoner to their bar, that they might have have an opportunity to accuse him, and that thus the chief captain might learn the real nature of the charge against him.</p>
