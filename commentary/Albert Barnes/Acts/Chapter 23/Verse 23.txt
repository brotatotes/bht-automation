And he called unto him two centurions ... - Each centurion had under him 100 men. The chief captain resolved to place Paul beyond the power of the Jews, and to protect him as became a Roman citizen.Two hundred soldiers - These foot soldiers were designed only to guard Paul until he was safely out of Jerusalem.

In this case, however, they were designed to attend Paul to Caesarea.And spearmen - δεξιολάβους dexiolabous.” This word is found nowhere else in the New Testament, and occurs in no Classical writer. It properly means those who take, or apprehend by the right hand; and might be applied to those who apprehend prisoners, or to those who hold a spear or dart in the right hand for the purpose of throwing it. Some have conjectured that it should be read δεξιοβόλους dexiobolous - those who cast or throw (a spear) with the right hand. So the Vulgate, the Syriac, and the Arabic understand it. They were probably those who were armed with spears or darts, and who attended on the tribune as a guard.At the third hour of the night - At nine o’clock.

Nearly 500 men were appointed to guard Paul as he left Jerusalem.
