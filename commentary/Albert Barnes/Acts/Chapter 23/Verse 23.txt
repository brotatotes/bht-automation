<p style=" "><b>And he called unto him two centurions ... - </b>Each centurion had under him 100 men. The chief captain resolved to place Paul beyond the power of the Jews, and to protect him as became a Roman citizen.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Two hundred soldiers - </b>These foot soldiers were designed only to guard Paul until he was safely out of Jerusalem. The horsemen only were intended to accompany him to Caesarea. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:32">Acts 23:32</span>.</p>

Some have conjectured that it should be read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεξιοβόλους</span></span> dexiobolous - those who cast or throw (a spear) with the right hand. So the Vulgate, the Syriac, and the Arabic understand it. They were probably those who were armed with spears or darts, and who attended on the tribune as a guard.</p>

<p style=" ">In order, therefore, to deter them effectually from attacking the guard, it was made very numerous and strong. Nearly 500 men were appointed to guard Paul as he left Jerusalem.</p>
