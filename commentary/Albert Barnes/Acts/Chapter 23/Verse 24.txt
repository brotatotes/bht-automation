<p style=" "><b>Unto Felix the governor - </b>The governor of Judea. His place of residence was Caesarea, about 60 miles from Jerusalem. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:40">Acts 8:40</span>. His name was Antonius Felix. He was a freedman of Antonia, the mother of the Emperor Claudius. He was high in the favor of Claudius, and was made by him governor of Judea. Josephus calls him Claudius Felix. He had married three wives in succession that were of royal families, one of whom was Drusilla, afterward mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:24">Acts 24:24</span>, who was sister to King Agrippa. Tacitus (History, v. 9) says that he governed with all the authority of a king, and the baseness and insolence of a slave. “He was an unrighteous governor, a base, mercenary, and bad man” (Clarke). See his character further described in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>.</p>
