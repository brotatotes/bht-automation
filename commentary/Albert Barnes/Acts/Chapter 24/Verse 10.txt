<p style=" "><b>Had beckoned unto him to speak - </b>Either by a nod or by the hand,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hast been of many years - </b>Felix and Cumanus had been joint governors of Judea; but after Cumanus had been condemned for his bad administration of affairs, the government fell entirely into the hands of Felix. This was about seven years before Paul was arraigned, and might be called many years, as he had been long enough there to become acquainted with the customs and habits of the Jews; and it might also be called long in comparison with the short time which his immediate predecessors had held the office. See Josephus, <i>Antiq.</i>, book 20, chapters 7 and 7.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A judge - </b>This word is evidently used here in the sense of magistrate, or one appointed to administer the affairs of government. To determine litigated matters was, however, one part of his office. It is remarkable that Paul did not begin his speech, as Tertullus had done, by any flattering address, or by any of the arts of rhetoric. He founded his plea on the justice of his cause, and on the fact that Felix had had so much experience in the affairs of Judea that he was well qualified to understand the merits of the case, and to judge impartially. Paul was well acquainted with his character (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>), and would not by flattering words declare what was not strictly true.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I do the more cheerfully ... - </b>Since you are so well acquainted with the customs and habits of the Jews, I the more readily submit the case to your disposal. This address indicated great confidence in the justice of his cause, and was the language of a man bold, fearless, and conscious of innocence.</p>
