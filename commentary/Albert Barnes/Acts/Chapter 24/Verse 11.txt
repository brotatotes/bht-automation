<p style=" "><b>Because that thou mayest understand - </b>Greek: “Thou being able to know.” That is, he could understand or know by taking the proper evidence. Paul does not mean to say that Felix could understand the case because he had been many years a judge of that nation. That fact would qualify him to judge correctly, or to understand the customs of the Jews. But the fact that he himself had been but twelve days in Jerusalem, and had been orderly and peaceable there, Felix could ascertain only by the proper testimony. The first part of Paul’s defense <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:11-13">Acts 24:11-13</span> consists in an express denial of what they alleged against him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are yet but twelve days - </b>Beza reckons these twelve days in this manner: The first was that on which he came to Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:15">Acts 21:15</span>. The second he spent with James and the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:18">Acts 21:18</span>. Six days were spent in fulfilling his vow, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>. On the ninth day the tumult arose, being the seventh day of his vow, and on this day he was rescued by Lysias, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:27">Acts 21:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:29">Acts 22:29</span>. The tenth day he was before the Sanhedrin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:30">Acts 22:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:10">Acts 23:10</span>. On the eleventh the plot was laid to take his life, and on the same day, at evening, he was removed to Caesarea. The days on which he was confined at Caesarea are not enumerated, since his design in mentioning the number of days was to show the improbability that in that time he had been engaged in producing a tumult; and it would not be pretended that he had been so engaged while confined in a prison at Caesarea. The defense of Paul here is, that but twelve days elapsed from the time that he went to Jerusalem until he was put under the custody of Felix; and that during so short a time it was wholly improbable that he would have been able to excite sedition.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For to worship - </b>This further shows that the design of Paul was not to produce sedition. He had gone up for the peaceful purpose of devotion, and not to produce riot and disorder. That this was his design in going to Jerusalem, or at least a part of his purpose, is indicated by the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>. It should be observed, however, that our translation conveys an idea which is not necessarily in the Greek that this was the design of his going to Jerusalem. The original is, “Since I went up to Jerusalem worshipping” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνήσων</span></span> proskunēsōn; that is, he was actually engaged in devotion when the tumult arose. But his main design in going to Jerusalem was to convey to his suffering countrymen there the benefactions of the Gentile churches. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:25-26">Romans 15:25-26</span>.</p>
