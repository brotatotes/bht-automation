<p style=" "><b>And they neither found me ... - </b>The first charge of Tertullus against Paul was <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span> that he was “a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition.” The charge of his being a Test was so general that Paul did not think it necessary to attempt to refute it. To the specification that he was a mover of sedition, he replies by a firm denial, and by a solemn declaration that they had not found him in any synagogue, or in the city, or in the temple, either disputing or exciting a tumult. Pits conduct there had been entirely peaceable, and they had no right to suppose that it had been otherwise anywhere.</p>
