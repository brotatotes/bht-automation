<p style=" "><b>And herein - </b>In this, or for this purpose.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Do I exercise myself - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀσκῶ</span></span> askō. I accustom or employ myself; I make it my constant aim. Paul often appeals to his conscientiousness as the leading habit of his life. Even before his conversion he endeavored to act according to the dictates of conscience. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:5-6">Philippians 3:5-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To have always a conscience ... - </b>To do what is right, so that my conscience shall never reproach me.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Void of offence - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀπρόσκοπον</span></span> aproskopon. That which is inoffensive, or which does not cause one to stumble or fall. He means that he endeavored to keep his conscience so enlightened and pure in regard to duty, and that he acted according to its dictates in such a way that his conduct should not be displeasing to God or injurious to man. To have such a conscience implies two things:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Toward God - </b>In an honest endearour to discharge the duties of public and private worship, and to do constantly what he requires believing all that he has spoken; doing all that he requires; and offering to him the service which he approves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Toward men - </b>In endeavoring to meet all the demands of justice and mercy; to advance their knowledge, happiness, and salvation; living so that I may look back on my life with the reflection that I have done all that I ought to have done, and all that I could do to promote the welfare of the whole human family. What a noble principle of conduct was this! How elevated and how pure! How unlike the conduct of those who live to gratify debasing sensual appetites, or for gold or honor; of those who pass their lives in such a manner as to offer the grossest offence to God and to do the most injury to man. The great and noble aim of Paul was to be pure; and no slander of his enemies, no trials, persecutions, perils, or pains of dying could take away the approving voice of conscience. Alike in his travels and in his persecutions; among friends and foes; when preaching in the synal gogue, the city, or the desert; or when defending himself before governors and kings, he had this testimony of a self-approving mind. Happy they who thus frame their lives. And happy will be the end of a life where this has been the grand object of the journey through this world.</p>
