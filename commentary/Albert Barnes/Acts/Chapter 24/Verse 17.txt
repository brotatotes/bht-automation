Now after many years - After many years’ absence. Paul here commences a reply to the charge of Tentullus, that he had endeavored to profane the temple, Acts 24:6. He begins by saying that his design in coming up to Jerusalem was to bring to his countrymen needed aid in a time of distress. It would be absurd to suppose, therefore, that his object in coming was to violate the customs of the temple, and to defile it.I came to bring - See Acts 11:29-30; compare the notes on Romans 15:25-26.Alms - Charities; the gift of the churches.To my nation - Not to all the nation, but to the poor saints or Christians who were in Judea, and who were suffering much by persecutions and trials.And offerings - The word used here properly denotes “an offering or gift” of any kind; but it is usually applied to an oblation or offering made to God in the temple - “a thank-offering, a sacrifice.” This is probably its meaning here. He came to bring aid to his needy countrymen, and an offering to God; and it was, therefore, no part of his purpose to interfere with, or to profane the worship of the temple.
