<p style=" "><b>Now after many years - </b>After many years’ absence. Paul here commences a reply to the charge of Tentullus, that he had endeavored to profane the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:6">Acts 24:6</span>. He begins by saying that his design in coming up to Jerusalem was to bring to his countrymen needed aid in a time of distress. It would be absurd to suppose, therefore, that his object in coming was to violate the customs of the temple, and to defile it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I came to bring - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29-30">Acts 11:29-30</span>; compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:25-26">Romans 15:25-26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Alms - </b>Charities; the gift of the churches.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To my nation - </b>Not to all the nation, but to the poor saints or Christians who were in Judea, and who were suffering much by persecutions and trials.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And offerings - </b>The word used here properly denotes “an offering or gift” of any kind; but it is usually applied to an oblation or offering made to God in the temple - “a thank-offering, a sacrifice.” This is probably its meaning here. He came to bring aid to his needy countrymen, and an offering to God; and it was, therefore, no part of his purpose to interfere with, or to profane the worship of the temple.</p>
