<p style=" "><b>And when he was called forth - </b>When Paul was called forth from prison. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:35">Acts 23:35</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We enjoy great quietness - </b>This was said in the customary style of flatterers and orators, to conciliate the favor of the judge, and is strikingly in contrast with the more honest and straight forward introduction in reply of Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:10">Acts 24:10</span>. Though it was said for flattery, and though Felix was in many respects an unprincipled man, yet it was true that his administration had been the means of producing much peace and order in Judea, and that he had done many things that tended to promote the welfare of the nation. In particular, he had arrested a band of robbers, with Eleazar at their head, whom he had sent to Rome to be punished (Josephus, <i>Antiq.</i>, book 20, chapter 8); he had arrested the Egyptian false prophet who had led out 4,000 men into the wilderness, and who threatened the peace of Judea (see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:38">Acts 21:38</span>); and he had repressed a sedition which arose between the inhabitants of Caesarea and of Syria (Josephus, <i>Jewish Wars</i>, book 2, chapter 13, section 2).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Very worthy deeds - </b>Acts that tended much to promote the peace and security of the people. He referred to those which have just been mentioned as having been accomplished by Felix, particularly his success in suppressing riots and seditions; and as, in the view of the Jews, the case of Paul was another instance of a similar kind, he appealed to him with the more confidence that he would suppress that also.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By thy providence - </b>By thy foresight,‚Äù skill, vigilance, prudence.</p>
