<p style=" "><b>We accept it always - </b>We admit that it is owing to your vigilance, and we accept your interposition to promote peace with gratitude.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Always, and in all places - </b>Not merely in your presence, but we always acknowledge that it is owing to your vigilance that the land is secure. “What we now do in your presence, we do also in your absence; we do not commend you merely when you are present” (Wetstein).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Most noble Felix - </b>This was the title of office.</p>

But at the same time that he was an energetic and vigilant governor, it was also true that he was proud, avaricious, and cruel. Josephus charges him with injustice and cruelty in the case of Jonathan, the high priest (<i>Antiq.</i>, book 20, chapter 8, section 5), and Tacitus (History, book 5, chapter 9) and Suetonius (Life of Claudius, chapter 28) concur in the charge.</p>
