<p style=" "><b>And desired favour against him - </b>Desired the favor of Festus, that they might accomplish their wicked purpose on Paul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Would send for him to Jerusalem - </b>Probably under a pretence that he might be tried by the Sanhedrin; or perhaps they wished Festus to hear the cause there, and to decide it while he was at Jerusalem. Their real motive is immediately stated.</p>

See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:38">Acts 21:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:12">Acts 23:12</span>. It is altogether probable that if this request had been granted, Paul would have been killed. But God had promised him that he should bear witness to the truth at Rome <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span>, and his providence was remarkable in thus influencing the mind of the Roman governor, and defeating the plans of the Jewish council.</p>
