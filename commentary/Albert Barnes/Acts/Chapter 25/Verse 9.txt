<p style=" "><b>But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure - </b>Desirous of securing their favor, as he had just entered on his administration. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:27">Acts 24:27</span>. In this he evinced rather a desire of popularity than an inclination to do justice. Had he been disposed to do right at once, he would have immediately discharged Paul. Festus perceived that the case was one that did not come fairly within the jurisdiction of a Roman magistrate; that it pertained solely to the customs and questions among the Jews <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:18-20">Acts 25:18-20</span>; and he therefore proposed that the case should be tried before him at Jerusalem. It is remarkable, however, that he had such a sense of justice and law as not to suffer the case to go out of his own hands. He proposed still to hear the cause, but asked Paul whether he was willing that it should be tried at Jerusalem. As the question which he asked Paul was one on which he was at liberty to take his own course, and as Paul had no reason to expect that his going to Jerusalem would facilitate the cause of justice, it is not remarkable that he declined the offer, as perhaps Festus supposed he would.</p>
