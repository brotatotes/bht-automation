<p style=" "><b>Which thing I also did ... - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And many of the saints ... - </b>Many Christians, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And when they were put to death - </b>In the history of those transactions, there is no account of any Christian being put to death except Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:0">Acts 7:0</span>. But there is no improbability in supposing that the same thing which had happened to Stephen had occurred in other cases. Stephen was the first martyr, and as he was a prominent man his case is particularly recorded.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I gave my voice - </b>Paul was not a member of the Sanhedrin, and this does not mean that he voted, but simply that he joined in the persecution; he approved it; he assented to the putting of the saints to death. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:20">Acts 22:20</span>. The Syriac renders it, “I joined with those who condemned them.” It is evident, also, that Paul instigated them in this persecution, and urged them on to deeds of blood and cruelty.</p>
