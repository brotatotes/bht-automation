<p style=" "><b>But rise ... - </b>The particulars mentioned in this verse and the two following are not recorded in the account of Paulâ€™s conversion in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:0">Acts 9:0</span>; but it is not improbable that many circumstances may have occurred which are not recorded. Paul dwells on them here at length in order particularly to show his authority for doing what he had done in preaching to the Gentiles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To make thee a minister - </b>A minister of the gospel; a preacher of the truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And a witness - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:15">Acts 22:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which thou hast seen - </b>On the road to Damascus; that is, of the Lord Jesus, and of the fact that he was risen from the dead.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of those things ... - </b>Of those further manifestations of my person, purposes, and will, which I will yet make to you. It is evident from this that the Lord Jesus promised to manifest himself to Paul in his ministry, and to make to him still further displays of his will and glory. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17-18">Acts 22:17-18</span>. This was done by his rescuing him from destruction and danger; by inspiration; by the growing and expanding view which Paul was permitted to take of the character and perfections of the Lord Jesus. In this we see that it is the duty of ministers to bear witness not only to the truth of religion in general, or of that which they can demonstrate by argument, but more especially of that which they experience in their own hearts, and which they understand by having themselves been the subjects of it. No man is qualified to enter the ministry who has not a personal saving view of the glory and perfections of the Lord Jesus, and who does not go to his work as a witness of those things which he has felt; and no man enters the ministry with these feelings who has not, as Paul had, a promise that he shall see still brighter displays of the perfections of the Saviour, and be permitted to advance in the knowledge of him and of his work. The highest personal consolation in this work is the promise of being admitted to ever-growing and expanding views of the glory of the Lord Jesus, and of experiencing his presence, guidance, and protection.</p>
