<p style=" "><b>To open their eyes - </b>To enlighten or instruct them. Ignorance is represented by the eyes being closed, and the instruction of the gospel by the opening of the eyes. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to turn them from darkness to light - </b>From the darkness of paganism and sin to the light and purity of the gospel. Darkness is an emblem of ignorance and of sin, and the pagan nations are often represented as sitting in darkness. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:16">Matthew 4:16</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4-5">John 1:4-5</span> notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And from the power of Satan - </b>From the dominion of Satan. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:13">Colossians 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span>. Satan is thus represented as the prince of this world, the ruler of the darkness of this world, the prince of the power of the air, etc. The pagan world, lying in sin and superstition, is represented as under his control; and this passage teaches, doubtless, that the great mass of the people of this world are the subjects of the kingdom of Satan, and are led captive by him at his will.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto God - </b>To the obedience of the one living and true God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That they may receive forgiveness of sins - </b>Through the merits of that Saviour who died - that thus the partition wall between the Jews and the Gentiles might be broken down, and all might be admitted to the same precious privileges of the favor and mercy of God. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And inheritance - </b>An heirship, or lot <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλῆρον</span></span> klēron: that they might be entitled to the privileges and favors of the children of God. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which are sanctified - </b>Among the saints; the children of God. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span>.</p>
