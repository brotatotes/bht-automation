Since the proof of his being the Messiah, of his resurrection, and of his calling me to this work, was so clear and plain, I deemed it my duty to engage without delay in the work.I was not disobedient - I was not incredulous or unbelieving; I yielded myself to the command, and at once obeyed. See Acts 9:6; compare Galatians 1:16.Unto the heavenly vision - To the celestial appearance, or to the vision which appeared to me from heaven.

He knew it was the command of God his Saviour, and he gave evidence of repentance by yielding obedience to it at once.
