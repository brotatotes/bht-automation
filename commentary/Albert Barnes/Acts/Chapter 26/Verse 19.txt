<p style=" "><b>I was not disobedient - </b>I was not incredulous or unbelieving; I yielded myself to the command, and at once obeyed. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:6">Acts 9:6</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>.</p>

I did not doubt that this splendid appearance <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:13">Acts 26:13</span> was from heaven, and I did not refuse to obey the command of him who thus appeared to me. He knew it was the command of God his Saviour, and he gave evidence of repentance by yielding obedience to it at once.</p>
