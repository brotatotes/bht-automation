<p style=" "><b>That Christ - </b>That the Messiah expected by the Jews should be a suffering Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Should suffer - </b>Should lead a painful life, and be put to death. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:27">Daniel 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1-12">Isaiah 53:1-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And that he should be the first ... - </b>This declaration contains two points:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That it was taught in the prophets that the Messiah Would rise from the dead. On this, see the proof alleged in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24-32">Acts 2:24-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:32-37">Acts 13:32-37</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That he would be the first that should rise. This cannot mean that the Messiah would be the first dead person who should be restored to life, for Elijah had raised the son of the Shunammite, and Jesus himself had raised Lazarus, and the widow’s son at Nain. It does not mean that he would be the first in the order of time that should rise, but first in eminence; the most distinguished, the chief, the head of those who should rise from the dead - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρῶτος ἐξ ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν</span></span> prōtos ex anastaseōs nekrōn. In accordance with this he is called <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span> “the beginning, the first-born from the dead,” having among all the dead who should be raised up the pre-eminence of primogeniture, or what pertained to the first-born. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span> he is called “the first fruits of them that slept. This declaration is therefore made of him by way of eminence:</p>
<p style=" "><b>And should show light unto the people - </b>To the Jews. Would be their instructor and prophet. This Moses had predicted, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to the Gentiles - </b>This had often been foretold by the prophets, and particularly by Isaiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:1-2">Isaiah 9:1-2</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:14-16">Matthew 4:14-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:6">Isaiah 42:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:3">Isaiah 54:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3">Isaiah 60:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:5">Isaiah 60:5</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:11">Isaiah 60:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:6">Isaiah 61:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:2">Isaiah 62:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:12">Isaiah 66:12</span>.</p>
