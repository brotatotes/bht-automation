<p style=" "><b>For the king - </b>King Agrippa.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Knoweth - </b>He had been many years in that region, and the fame of Jesus and of Paulâ€™s conversion were probably well known to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>These things - </b>The things pertaining to the early persecutions of Christians; the spread of the gospel; and the remarkable conversion of Paul. Though Agrippa might not have been fully informed respecting these things, yet he had an acquaintance with Moses and the prophets; he knew the Jewish expectation respecting the Messiah; and he could not be ignorant respecting the remarkable public events in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, and of his having been put to death by order of Pontius Pilate on the cross.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I speak freely - </b>I speak openly - boldly. I use no disguise; and I speak the more confidently before him, because, from his situation, he must be acquainted with the truth of what I say. Truth is always bold and free, and it is an evidence of honesty when a man is willing to declare everything without reserve before those who are qualified to detect him if he is an impostor. Such evidence of truth and honesty was given by Paul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For I am persuaded - </b>I am convinced; I doubt not that he is well acquainted with these things.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are hidden from him - </b>That he is unacquainted with them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For this thing - </b>The thing to which Paul had mainly referred in this defense, his own conversion to the Christian religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was not done in a corner - </b>Did not occur secretly and obscurely, but was public, and was of such a character as to attract attention. The conversion of a leading persecutor, such as Paul had been, and in the manner in which that conversion had taken place, could not but attract attention and remark; and although the Jews would endeavor as much as possible to conceal it, yet Paul might presume that it could not be entirely unknown to Agrippa.</p>
