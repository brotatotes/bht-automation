It was the result of the whole investigation; and we have, therefore, the concurring testimony of Claudius Lysias <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:29">Acts 23:29</span>, of Felix <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:0">Acts 24:0</span>, of Festus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:26-27">Acts 25:26-27</span>, and of Agrippa, as to the innocence of Paul.
