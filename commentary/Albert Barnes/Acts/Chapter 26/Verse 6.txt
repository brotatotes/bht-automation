<p style=" "><b>And now I stand - </b>I stand before the tribunal. I am arraigned.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And am judged - </b>Am tried with reference to being judged. I am undergoing a trial on the point in which all my nation are agreed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the hope - </b>On account of the hope; or because, in common with my countrymen, I had entertained this hope, and now believe in its fulfillment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the promise ... - </b>See the references in the margin. It is not quite certain whether Paul refers here to the promise of the Messiah or to the hope of the resurrection of the dead. When he stood before the Jewish Sanhedrin <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>, he said that he was called in question on account of holding the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. But it may be observed that in his view the two things were closely united. He hoped that the Messiah would come, and he hoped therefore for the resurrection of the dead. He believed that he had come, and had risen, and therefore he believed that the dead would rise. He argued the one from the other. And as he believed that Jesus was the Messiah, and that he had risen from the dead, and that he had thus furnished a demonstration that the dead would rise, it was evident that the subject of controversy between him and the Jews involved everything that was vital to their opinions and their hopes. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:8">Acts 26:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Made of God - </b>Made by God. See the marginal references. The promises had been made to the fathers of a Messiah to come, and that embraced the promise of a future state, or of the resurrection of the dead. It will help us to understand the stress which Paul and the other apostles laid on the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead to remember that it involved the whole doctrine of the separate existence of the soul and of a future state. The Sadducees denied all this; and when the Pharisees, the Saviour, and the apostles opposed them, they did it by showing that there would be a future state of rewards and punishments. See the argument of the Saviour with the Sadducees explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:23-32">Matthew 22:23-32</span>.</p>
