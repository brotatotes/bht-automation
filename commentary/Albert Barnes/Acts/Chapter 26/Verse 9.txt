<p style=" "><b>I verily thought - </b>I indeed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μὲν</span></span> men supposed. Paul here commences the account of his conversion, and states the evidence on which he judged that he was called of God to do what he had done. He begins by saying that it was not because he was originally disposed to be a Christian, but that he was violently and conscientiously opposed to Jesus of Nazareth, and had been converted when in the full career of opposition to him and his cause.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With myself - </b>I thought to myself; or, I myself thought. He had before stated the hopes and expectations of his countrymen, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:6-8">Acts 26:6-8</span>. He now speaks of his own views and purposes. “For myself, I thought,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That I ought to do - </b>That I was bound, or that it was a duty incumbent on me - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖν</span></span> dein. “I thought that I owed it to my country, to my religion, and to my God, to oppose in every manner the claims of Jesus of Nazareth to be the Messiah.” We here see that Paul was conscientious, and that a man may be conscientious even when engaged in enormous wickedness. It is no evidence that one is right because he is conscientious. No small part of the crimes against human laws, and almost all the cruel persecutions against Christians, have been carried on under the plea of conscience. Paul here refers to his conscientiousness in persecution to show that it was no slight matter which could have changed his course. As he was governed in persecution by conscience, it could have been only by a force of demonstration, and by the urgency of conscience equally clear and strong, that he could ever have been induced to abandon this course and to become a friend of that Saviour whom he had thus persecuted.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Many things - </b>As much as possible. He was not satisfied with a few things a few words, or purposes, or arguments; but he felt bound to do as much as possible to put down the new religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Contrary to the name ... - </b>In opposition to Jesus himself, or to his claims to be the Messiah. The “name” is often used to denote the “person” himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span>.</p>
