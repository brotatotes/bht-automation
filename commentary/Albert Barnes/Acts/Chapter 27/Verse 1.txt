<p style=" "><b>And when it was determined - </b>By Festus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:12">Acts 25:12</span>, and when the time was come when it was convenient to send him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That we should sail - </b>The use of the term “we” here shows that the author of this book, Luke, was with Paul. He had been his traveling companion, and though he had not been accused, yet it was resolved that he should still accompany him. Whether he went at his own expense, or whether he was sent at the expense of the Roman government, does not appear. There is a difference of reading here in the ancient versions. The Syriac reads it, “And thus Festus determined that he (Paul) should be sent to Caesar in Italy,” etc. The Latin Vulgate and the Arabic also read “he” instead of “we.” But the Greek manuscripts are uniform, and the correct reading is doubtless what is in our version.</p>

<p style=" "><b>And certain other prisoners - </b>Who were probably also sent to Rome for a trial before the emperor. Dr. Lardner has proved that it was common to send prisoners from Judea and other provinces to Rome (Credibility, part i. chapter 10, section 10, pp. 248, 249).</p>

<p style=" "><b>Of Augustus’ band - </b>For the meaning of the word “band,” see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27">Matthew 27:27</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span> note. It was a division in the Roman army consisting of from 400 to 600 men. This was called “Augustus’ band” in honor of the Roman emperor Augustus (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:21">Acts 25:21</span>), and was probably distinguished in some way for the care in enlisting or selecting them. The Augustine cohort or band is mentioned by Suetonius in his <i>Life of Nero</i>, 20.</p>
