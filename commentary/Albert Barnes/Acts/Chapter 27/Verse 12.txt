<p style=" "><b>The haven - </b>The fair havens, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:8">Acts 27:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was not commodious to winter in - </b>Not safe or convenient to remain there. Probably it furnished rather a safe anchorage ground in time of a storm than a convenient place for a permanent harbor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The more part - </b>The greater part of the crew.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To Phenice - </b>In the original this is Phoenix - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φοῖνιξ</span></span> Foinix. So it is written by Strabo. The name was probably derived from the palmtrees which were common in Crete. This was a port or harbor on the south side of Crete, and west of the fair havens. It was a more convenient harbor, and was regarded as more safe. It appears, therefore, that the majority of persons on board concurred with Paul in the belief that it was not advisable to attempt the navigation of the sea until the dangers of the winter had passed by.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And lieth toward - </b>Greek: looking toward; that is, it was open in that direction.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The southwest - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατὰ λίβα</span></span> kata liba. Toward Libya, or Africa. That country was situated southwest of the mouth of the harbor. The entrance of the harbor was in a southwest direction.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And northwest - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατὰ χῶρον</span></span> kata chōron. This word denotes “a wind blowing from the northwest.” The harbor was doubtless curved. Its entrance was in a southwest direction. It then turned so as to lie in a direction toward the northwest. It was thus rendered perfectly safe from the winds and heavy seas; and in that harbor they might pass the winter in security. It is sometimes called “Lutro.” Of this harbor Mr. Urquhart, in a letter to James Smith, Esq., whose work on this voyage of Paul has obtained so wide a reputation, says, “Lutro is an admirable harbor. You open it like a box; unexpectedly the rocks stand apart, and the town appears within ... We thought we had cut him off, and that we were driving him right upon the rocks. Suddenly he disappeared - and, rounding in after him, like a change of scenery, the little basin, its shipping, and the town presented themselves ... Excepting Lutro, all the roadsteads looking to the southward are perfectly exposed to the south or east.”</p>
