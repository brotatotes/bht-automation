<p style=" "><b>Arose - </b>Beat violently.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Against it - </b>Against the vessel. Greek: seizing her, and whirling her around.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A tempestuous wind - </b>Turbulent - violent - strong.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Called Euroclydon - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εὐροκλύδων</span></span> Eurokludōn. Interpreters have been much perplexed about the meaning of this word, which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The most probable supposition is, that it denotes “a wind not blowing steadily from any quarter, but a hurricane, or wind veering about to different quarters.” Such hurricanes are known to abound in the Mediterranean, and are now called Levanters, deriving their name from blowing chiefly in the Levant, or eastern part of the Mediterranean. The name euroclydon is derived probably from two Greek words, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εῦρος</span></span> euros, “wind,” and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλύδων</span></span> kludōn, “a wave”; so called from its agitating and exciting the waves. It thus answers to the usual effects of a hurricane, or of a wind rapidly changing its points of compass.</p>
