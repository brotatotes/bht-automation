<p style=" "><b>The ship was caught - </b>By the wind. It came suddenly upon them as a tempest.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Could not bear up ... - </b>Could not resist its violence, or the helmsman could not direct the ship. It was seized by the wind, and driven with such violence, that it became unmanageable.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We let her drive - </b>We suffered the ship to be borne along by the wind without attempting to control it.</p>
