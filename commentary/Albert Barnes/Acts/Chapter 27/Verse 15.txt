The ship was caught - By the wind. It came suddenly upon them as a tempest.Could not bear up ... - Could not resist its violence, or the helmsman could not direct the ship. It was seized by the wind, and driven with such violence, that it became unmanageable.We let her drive - We suffered the ship to be borne along by the wind without attempting to control it.
