<p style=" "><b>A ship of Adramyttium - </b>A maritime town of Mysia, in Asia Minor, opposite to the island of Lesbos. This was a ship which had been built there, or which sailed from that port, but which was then in the port of Caesarea. It is evident, from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:6">Acts 27:6</span>, that this ship was not expected to sail to Italy, but that the centurion expected to find some other vessel into which he could put the prisoners to take them to Rome.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We launched - </b>We loosed from our anchorage, or we set sail. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13">Acts 13:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the coasts of Asia - </b>Of Asia Minor. Probably the owners of the ship designed to make a coasting voyage along the southern part of Asia Minor, and to engage in traffic with the maritime towns and cities.</p>
<p style=" "><b>One Aristarchus, a Macedonian - </b>This man is mentioned as Paul’s companion in travel in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>. He afterward attended him to Macedonia, and returned with him to Asia, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>. He now appears to have attended him, not as a prisoner, but as a voluntary companion, choosing to share with him his dangers, and to enjoy the benefit of his society and friendship. He went with him to Rome, and was a fellow-prisoner with him there <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>, and is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span> as Paul’s fellow-laborer. It was doubtless a great comfort to Paul to have with him two such valuable friends as Luke and Aristarchus; and it was an instance of great affection for him that they were not ashamed of his bonds, but were willing to share his dangers, and to expose themselves to peril for the sake of accompanying him to Rome.</p>
