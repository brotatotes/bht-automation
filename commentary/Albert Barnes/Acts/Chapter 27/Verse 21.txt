<p style=" "><b>But after long abstinence - </b>By the violence of the storm, by their long continued labor, and by their apprehension of danger, they had a long time abstained from food.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to have gained this harm - </b>To have procured this harm, or have subjected yourselves to it. Had you remained there you would have been safe. It seems to be bad English to speak of gaining a loss, but it is a correct translation of the original <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδῆσαί</span></span> kerdēsai, which expresses the idea of acquiring or procuring, whether good or evil. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:9-10">Acts 27:9-10</span>.</p>
