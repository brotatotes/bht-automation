<p style=" "><b>Fear not, Paul - </b>Do not be alarmed with the danger of the loss of life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou must be brought ... - </b>And therefore thy life will be spared.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God hath given thee all ... - </b>That is, they shall all be preserved with thee. None of their lives shall be lost. This does not mean that they would be converted, but that their lives would be preserved. It is implied here that it was for the sake of Paul, or that the leading purpose of the divine interposition in rescuing them from danger was to save his life. The wicked often derive important benefits from being connected with Christians, and God often confers important favors on them in his general purpose to save his own people. The lives of the wicked are often spared because God interposes to save the righteous.</p>
