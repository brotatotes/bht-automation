<p style=" "><b>In Adria - </b>In the Adriatic Sea. This sea is situated between Italy and Dalmatia, now called the Adriatic Gulf. But among the ancients the name was given not only to that gulf, but to the whole sea lying between Greece, Italy, and Africa, including the Sicilian and Ionian Sea. It is evident from the narrative that they were not in the Adriatic Gulf, but in the vicinity of Malta.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Deemed - </b>Judged. Probably by the appearance of the sea.</p>
