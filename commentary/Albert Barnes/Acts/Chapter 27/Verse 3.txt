We touched at Sidon - See the notes on Matthew 11:21. Sidon was about 67 miles north of Caesarea, and the passage could be easily accomplished, under favorable circumstances, in 24 hours. It is probable that the vessel, being a “coaster,” put in there for purposes of trade. Sidon is the last city on the Phoenician coast in which the presence of the apostle can be traced.And Julius courteously entreated Paul - Treated him kindly or humanely.And gave him liberty ... - The same thing had been done by Felix, Acts 24:23.Unto his friends - In Sidon. Paul had frequently traveled in that direction in going to and returning from Jerusalem, and it is not improbable, therefore, that he had friends in all the principal cities.To refresh himself - To enjoy the benefit of their care; to make his present situation and his voyage as comfortable as possible. It is probable that they would furnish him with many supplies which were needful for his long and perilous voyage.
