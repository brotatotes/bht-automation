<p style=" "><b>A ship of Alexandria - </b>A ship belonging to Alexandria. Alexandria was in Egypt, and was founded by Alexander the Great. It appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:38">Acts 27:38</span> that the ship was laden with wheat. It is well known that great quantities of wheat were imported from Egypt to Rome, and it appears that this was one of the large ships which were employed for that purpose. Why the ship was on the coast of Asia Minor is not known But it is probable that it had been driven out of its way by adverse winds or tempests.</p>
