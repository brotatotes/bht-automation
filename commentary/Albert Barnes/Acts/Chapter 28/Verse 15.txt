<p style=" "><b>And from thence - </b>From Puteoli.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When the brethren heard of us - </b>The Christians who wore at Rome.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As far as the Appii Forum - </b>This was a city about 56 miles from Rome. The remains of an ancient city are still seen there. It is on the borders of the Pontine Marshes. The city was built on the celebrated Appian Way, or the road from Rome to Capua. The road was made by Appius Claudius, and probably the city was founded by him also. It was called the forum or market-place of Appius, because it was a convenient place for travelers on the Appian Way to stop for purposes of refreshment. It was also a famous resort for peddlers and merchants. See Horace, book i. Sat. 5, 3.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the Three Taverns - </b>This place was about 8 or 10 miles nearer Rome than the Appii Forum (Cicero, a.d. Art., ii. 10). It undoubtedly received its name because it was distinguished as a place of refreshment on the Appian Way. Probably the greater part of the company of Christians remained at this place while the remainder went forward to meet Paul, and to attend him on his way. The Christians at Rome had doubtless heard much of Paul. His Epistle to them had been written about the year of our Lord 57 a.d., or at least five years before this time. The interest which the Roman Christians felt in the apostle was thus manifested by their coming so far to meet him, though he was a prisoner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He thanked God - </b>He had long ardently desired to see the Christians of Rome, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9-11">Romans 1:9-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:23">Romans 15:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:32">Romans 15:32</span>. He was now grateful to God that the object of his long desire was at least granted, and that he was permitted to see them, though in bonds.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And took courage - </b>From their society and counsel. The presence and counsel of Christian brethren is often of inestimable value in encouraging and strengthening us in the toils and trials of life.</p>
