<p style=" "><b>The Jews spake against it - </b>Against my being set at liberty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I was constrained - </b>By a regard to my own safety and character.</p>

<p style=" "><b>Not that I had aught ... - </b>I did it for my own preservation and safety, not that I wished to accuse my countrymen. Paul had been unjustly accused and injured; yet, with the true spirit of the Christian religion, he here says that he cherished no unkind feelings toward those who had done him wrong.</p>
