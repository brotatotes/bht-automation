<p style=" "><b>The salvation of God - </b>The knowledge of Godâ€™s mode of saving people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is sent unto the Gentiles - </b>Since you have rejected it, it will be offered to them. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And that they will hear it - </b>They will embrace it. Paul was never discouraged. If the gospel was rejected by one class of people he was ready to offer it to another. If his own countrymen despised it, he never allowed himself to suppose that Christ had died in vain, but believed that others would embrace its saving benefits. How happy would it be if all Christians had the same unwavering faith and zeal as Paul.</p>
