<p style=" "><b>Paul dwelt two whole years - </b>Doubtless in the custody of the soldiers. Why he was not prosecuted before the emperor during this time is not known. It is evident, however <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:21">Acts 28:21</span>, that the Jews were not disposed to carry the case before Nero, and the matter, during this time, was suffered quietly to sleep. There is great probability that the Jews did not dare to prosecute him before the emperor. It is clear that they had never been in favor of the appeal to Rome, and that they had no hope of gaining their cause. Probably they might remember the former treatment of their people by the emperor (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>); they might remember that they were despised at the Roman capital, and not choose to encounter the scorn and indignation of the Roman court; and as there was no prosecution, Paul was suffered to live in quietness and safety. Lardner, however, supposed (vol. v. p. 528, 529, ed. 8vo, London, 1829) that the case of Paul was soon brought before Nero and decided, and that the method of confinement was ordered by the emperor himself. Lightfoot also supposes that Paul’s “accusers, who had come from Judea to lay their charge against him, would be urgent to get their business despatched, that they might be returning to their own home again, and so would bring him to trial as soon as they could.” But nothing certainly is known on the subject. It is evident, indeed, from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16">2 Timothy 4:16</span>, that he was at some time arraigned before the emperor; but when it was, or what was the decision or why he was at last set at liberty, are all involved in impenetrable obscurity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In his own hired house - </b>In a house which he was permitted to hire and occupy as his own. Probably in this he was assisted by the kindness of his Roman friends.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And received all ... - </b>Received all hospitably and kindly who came to him to listen to his instructions. It is evident from this that he was still a prisoner, and was not permitted to go at large.</p>
