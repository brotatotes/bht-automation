<p style=" "><b>And killed the Prince of life - </b>The word rendered “prince” denotes properly “a military leader or commander.” Hence, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>, it is translated “captain:” “It became him ...to make the “Captain of their salvation” perfect through sufferings.” As a captain or commander leads on to victory and is said to obtain it, so the word comes to denote one who is the “cause,” the “author,” the “procurer,” etc. In this sense it is used, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>, “Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel,” etc. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span> it is properly rendered author, “Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.” The word “author,” or “giver,” would express the meaning of the word here. It also implies that he has dominion over life; an idea, indeed, which is essentially connected with that of his being the author of it. The word “life” here is used in a large sense, as denoting “all manner of life.” In this sense it is used in reference to Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>, “In him was life.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:11">1 John 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>. Jesus is here called the Prince of life in contrast with him whom the Jews demanded in his place, Barabbas. He was a murderer <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:19">Luke 23:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:7">Mark 15:7</span>, one who had destroyed life, and yet they demanded that he whose character it was to destroy life should be released, and the Author of life be put to death.</p>
