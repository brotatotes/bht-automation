<p style=" "><b>But those things - </b>To wit, those things that did actually occur, pertaining to the life and death of the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had showed - </b>Had announced, or foretold.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the mouth of all his prophets - </b>That is, by the prophets in general, without affirming that each individual prophet had uttered a distinct prediction respecting this. The prophets “taken together,” or the prophecies “as a whole,” had declared this. The word “all” is not infrequently used in this somewhat limited sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:37">Mark 1:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:26">John 3:26</span>. In regard to the prophecies respecting Christ, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:27">Luke 24:27</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath so fulfilled - </b>He has caused to be fulfilled in this manner; that is, by the rejection, the denial, and the wickedness of the rulers. It has turned out to be in strict accordance with the prophecy. This fact Peter uses in exhorting them to repentance; but it is not to be regarded as an excuse for their sins. The mere fact that all this was foretold; that it was in accordance with the purposes and predictions of God, does not take away the quilt of it, or constitute an excuse for it. In regard to this, we may remark:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)This was a signal instance of the power and mercy of God in overruling the wicked conduct of people to further his own purposes and plans.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)All the other sins of people may thus be overruled, and thus the wrath of man may be made to praise him. But,</p>
<p style=" ">If it be asked why Peter insisted on this if he did not mean that it should be regarded as an excuse for their sin, I reply, that it was his design to prove “that Jesus was the Messiah,” and having proved this, he could assure them that there was mercy. Not that they had not been guilty; not that they deserved favor; but that tire fact that the Messiah had come was an argument which proved that any sinners might obtain mercy, as he immediately proceeds to show them.</p>
