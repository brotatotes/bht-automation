<p style=" "><b>Whom the heavens must receive - </b>The common belief of the Jews was, that the Messiah would reign on the earth forever, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span>. On this account they would object that Jesus could not be the Messiah, and hence, it became so important for the apostles to establish the fact that he had ascended to heaven. The evidence which they adduced was the fact that they saw him ascend, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>. The meaning of the expression “whom the heavens must receive,” is that it was “fit” or “proper” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖ</span></span> dei that he should ascend. One reason of that fitness or propriety he himself stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>. It was also fit or expedient that he should do it, to direct the affairs of the universe for the welfare of the church <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-22">Ephesians 1:20-22</span>, and that he should exercise there his office as a priest in interceding for his people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1-2">1 John 2:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>, etc. It is remarkable that Peter did not adduce any passage of Scripture on this subject; but it was one of the points on which there was no clear revelation. Obscure intimations of it might be found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1-7">Psalms 110:1-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:1-11">Psalms 16:1-11</span>; etc., but the fact that he would ascend to heaven was not made prominent in the Old Testament. ‘The words “whom the heaven must receive” also convey the idea of “exaltation” and “power”; and Peter doubtless intended to say that he was clothed with power, and exalted to honor in the presence of God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+115:3">Psalms 115:3</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>, “Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right banal of God; angels, and authorities, and powers being made subject unto him.” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33">Acts 2:33</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Until - </b>This word implies that he would then return to the earth, but it does not imply that he would not again ascend to heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The times of the restitution of all things - </b>The noun rendered restitution <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀποκαταστάσεως</span></span> apokatastaseōs, does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The verb from which it is derived occurs eight times. It means properly “to restore a thing to its former situation,” as restoring a “strained” or “dislocated” limb to its former soundness. Hence, it is used to restore, or to heal, in the New Testament: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:13">Matthew 12:13</span>, “And it (the hand) was restored whole as the other”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:10">Luke 6:10</span>. And hence, it is applied to the preparation or fitness for the coming of the Messiah which was to attend the preaching of John in the character of Elias, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:11">Matthew 17:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:12">Mark 9:12</span>. Thus, in Josephus (Antiq., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:3">Mark 2:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:8">Mark 2:8</span>), the word is used to denote the return of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon, and their restoration to their former state and privileges. The word has also the idea of “consummation, completion, or filling up.” Thus, it is used in Philo, Hesychius, Phavorinus, and by the Greek Classics. (See Lightfoot and Kuinoel.) Thus, it is used here by the Syriac: “Until the complement or filling up of the times”; that is, of all the events foretold by the prophets, etc. Thus, the Arabic: “Until the times which shall establish the perfection or completion of all the predictions of the prophets,” etc. In this sense the passage means that the heavens must receive the Lord Jesus until all thrums spoken by the prophets in relation to his work, his reign, the spread of the gospel, the triumph of religion, etc., shall have been fulfilled. It also conveys the idea of the predicted recovery of the world from sin, and the restoration of peace and order; the con. summation of the work of the Messiah, now begun, but not yet complete; slow it may be in its advances, but triumphant and certain in its progress and its close.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All things - </b>All things which have been foretold by the prophets. The expression is limited by the connection to this; and of course it does not mean that all people will be saved, or that all the evils of sin can be repaired or remedied. This can never be, for the mischief is done and cannot be undone; but everything which the prophets have foretold shall receive their completion and fulfillment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which God hath spoken - </b>Which have been revealed, and are recorded in the Old Testament.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of all his holy prophets - </b>This does not mean that each one of the prophets had spoken of these things, but that all which had been spoken would be fulfilled.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Since the world began - </b>This is an expression denoting the same as from the beginning, meaning to affirm with emphasis that all the prophecies would be fulfilled. The apostles were desirous to show that they, as well as the Jews, held entirely to the prophets, and taught no doctrine which they had not taught before them.</p>
