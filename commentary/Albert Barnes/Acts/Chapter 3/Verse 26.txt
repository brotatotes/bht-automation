<p style=" "><b>Unto you first - </b>To you who are Jews. This was the direction, that the gospel should be first preached to the Jews, beginning at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:47">Luke 24:47</span>. Jesus himself also confined his ministry entirely to the Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having raised up - </b>This expression does not refer to his having raised him from the dead, but is used in the same sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22">Acts 3:22</span>, where God promised that he would raise up a prophet, and send him to teach the people. Peter means that God had appointed his Son Jesus, or had commissioned him to go and preach to the people to turn them away from their sins.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To bless you - </b>To make you happy; to fulfill the promise made to Abraham.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In turning away - </b>That is, by his preaching, example, death, etc. The highest blessing that can be conferred upon people is to be turned from sin. Sin is the source of all woes, and if people are turned from that, they will be happy. Christ blesses no one in sin, or while loving sin, but by turning them from sin. This was the object which he had in view in coming, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:20">Isaiah 59:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>. The design of Peter in these remarks was to show them that the Messiah had come, and that now they might look for happiness, pardon, and mercy through him. As the Jews might, so may all; and as Jesus, while living, sought to turn away people from their sins, so he does still, and still designs to bless all nations by the gospel which he had himself preached, and to establish which he died. All may therefore come and be blessed; and all may rejoice in the prospect that these blessings will yet be bestowed on all the kindreds of the earth. May the happy day soon come!</p>
