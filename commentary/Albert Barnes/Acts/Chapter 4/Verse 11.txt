<p style=" "><b>This is the stone - </b>This passage is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>. It is quoted, also, by our Saviour as applicable to himself. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>. The ancient Jews applied this to David. In the Targum on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>, this passage is rendered, “The child who was among the sons of Jesse, and was worthy to be constituted king, the builders rejected.” The New Testament writers, however, apply it without any doubt to the Messiah. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>. And from this passage we may learn that God will overrule the devices and plans of wicked men to accomplish his own purposes. What people despise and set at naught, he esteems of inestimable value in his kingdom. What the great and the mighty contemn, he regards as the very foundation and cornerstone of the edifice which he designs to rear. Nothing has been more remarkable than this in the history of man; and in nothing is more contempt thrown on the proud projects of people, than that what they have rejected God has made the very basis of his schemes.</p>
