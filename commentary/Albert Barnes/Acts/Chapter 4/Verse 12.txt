<p style=" "><b>Neither is there salvation - </b>The word “salvation” properly denotes any “preservation,” or keeping anything in a “safe” state; a preserving from harm. It I signifies, also, deliverance from any evil of body or mind; from pain, sickness, danger, etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:25">Acts 7:25</span>. But it is in the New Testament applied particularly to the work which the Messiah came to do, “to seek and to save that which was lost,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:10">Luke 19:10</span>. This work refers primarily to a deliverance of the soul from sin <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>. It then denotes, as a consequence of freedom from sin, freedom from all the ills to which sin exposes man, and the attainment of that perfect peace and joy which will be bestowed on the children of God in the heavens. The reasons why Peter introduces this subject here seem to be these:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) He was discoursing on the deliverance of the man that was healed - his salvation from a long and painful calamity. This deliverance had been accomplished by the power of Jesus. The mention of this suggested that greater and more important salvation from sin and death which it was the object of the Lord Jesus to effect. As it was by his power that this man had been healed, so it was by his power only that people could be saved from death and hell. Deliverance from any temporal calamity should lead the thoughts to that higher redemption which the Lord Jesus contemplates in regard to the soul.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) This was a favorable opportunity to introduce the doctrines of the gospel to the notice of the Great Council of the nation. The occasion invited to it; the mention of a part of the work of Jesus invited to a contemplation of his whole work. Peter would not have done justice to the character and work of Christ if he had not introduced that great design which he had in view to save people from death and hell. It is probable, also, that he advanced a sentiment in which he expected they would immediately concur, and which accorded with their wellknown opinions, that salvation was to be obtained only by the Messiah. Thus, Paul <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:22-23">Acts 26:22-23</span> says that he taught nothing else than what was delivered by Moses and the prophets, etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:6">Acts 26:6</span>. The apostles did not pretend to proclaim any doctrine which was not delivered by Moses and the prophets, and which did not, in fact, constitute a part of the creed of the Jewish nation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In any other - </b>Any other person. He does not mean to say that God is not able to save, but that the salvation of the human family is entrusted to the hands of Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For there is none other name - </b>This is an explanation of what he had said in the previous part of the verse. The word “name” here is used to denote “the person himself” (i. e., There is no other being or person.) As we would say, there is no one who can save but Jesus Christ. The word “name” is often used in this sense. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:16">Acts 3:16</span>. That there is no other Saviour, or mediator between God and man, is abundantly taught in the New Testament; and it is, indeed, the main design of revelation to prove this. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:5-6">1 Timothy 2:5-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:43">Acts 10:43</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Under heaven - </b>This expression does not materially differ from the one immediately following, “among men.” They are designed to express with emphasis the sentiment that salvation is to be obtained in “Christ alone,” and not in any patriarch, or prophet, or teacher, or king, or in any false Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Given - </b>In this word it is implied that “salvation” has its origin in God; that a Saviour for people must be given by him; and that salvation cannot be originated by any power among people. The Lord Jesus is thus uniformly represented as given or appointed by God for this great purpose <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4">John 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:6">1 Timothy 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15-18">Romans 5:15-18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span>; and hence, Christ is called the “unspeakable gift” of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:15">2 Corinthians 9:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whereby we must be saved - </b>By which it is fit, or proper <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖ</span></span> dei, that we should be saved. There is no other way of salvation that is adapted to the great object contemplated, and therefore, if saved, it must be in this way and by this plan. The schemes of people’s own devices are not adapted to the purpose, and therefore cannot save. The doctrine that people can be saved only by Jesus Christ is abundantly taught in the Scriptures. To show the failure of all other schemes of religion was the great design of the first part of the Epistle to the Romans. By a labored argument Paul there shows <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:0">Romans 1:0</span> that the Gentiles had failed in their attempt to justify themselves; and in Rom. 2–3 that the same thing was true also of the Jews. If both these schemes failed, then there was need of some other plan, and that plan was that by Jesus Christ. If it be asked, then, whether this affirmation of Peter is to be understood as having respect to infants and the pagan, we may remark:</p>
<p style=" ">Neither has the Scripture affirmed that all the pagan will certainly be cut off. It has been discovered by missionaries among the pagan that individuals have, in a remarkable way; been convinced of the folly of idolatry, and were seeking a better religion; that their minds were in a serious, thoughtful, inquiring state; and that they at once embraced the gospel when it was offered to them as exactly adapted to their state of mind, and as meeting their inquiries. Such was extensively the case in the Sandwich Islands; and the following instance recently occurred in this country: “The Flathead Indians, living west of the Rocky Mountains, recently sent a deputation to the white settlements to inquire after the Bible. The circumstance that led to this singular movement is as follows: It appears that a white man (Mr. Catlin) had penetrated into their country, and happened to be a spectator at one of their religious ceremonies. He informed them that their mode of worshipping the Supreme Being was radically wrong, and that the people away toward the rising of the sun had been put in possession of the true mode of worshipping the Great Spirit. On receiving this information, they called a national council to take this subject into consideration. Some said, if this be true, it is certainly high time we were put in possession of this mode. They accordingly deputed four of the chiefs to proceed to Louis to see their great father, General Clark, to inquire of him the truth of this matter.</p>
<p style=" ">They were cordially received by the general, who gave them a succinct history of revelation, and the necessary instruction relative to their important mission. Two of them sunk under the severe toils attending a journey of 3,000 miles. The remaining two, after acquiring what knowledge they could of the Bible, its institutions and precepts, returned, to carry back those few rays of divine light to their benighted countrymen.” In what way their minds were led to this State we cannot say, or how this preparation for the gospel was connected with the agency and merits of Christ we perhaps cannot understand; but we know that the affairs of this entire world are placed under the control of Christ <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21-22">Ephesians 1:21-22</span>, and that the arrangements of events by which such people were brought to this state of mind are in his hands. Another remark may here be made. It is, that it often occurs that blessings come upon us from benefactors whom we do not see, and from sources which we cannot trace.</p>
<p style=" ">On this principle we receive many of the mercies of life; and from anything that appears, in this way many blessings of salvation may be conferred on the world, and possibly many of the pagan be saved. Still, this view does not interfere with the command of Christ to preach the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>. The great mass of the pagan are not in this state; but the fact here adverted to, so far as it goes, is an encouragement to preach the gospel to the entire world. If Christ thus prepares the way; if he extensively fits the minds of the pagan for the reception of the gospel; if he shows them the evil and folly of their own system, and leads them to desire a better, then this should operate not to produce indolence, but activity, and zeal, and encouragement to enter into the field white for the harvest, and to toil that all who seek the truth, and are prepared to embrace the gospel, may be brought to the light of the Sun of righteousness.</p>
