<p style=" "><b>They lifted up their voice - </b>To lift up the voice, among the Hebrews, was a phrase denoting either an “address” to the people <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+9:7">Judges 9:7</span>, or a phrase expressive of “weeping” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:11">Genesis 29:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+2:4">Judges 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ru+1:9">Ruth 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:16">1 Samuel 24:16</span>, or of “prayer.” To lift up the voice to God means simply they prayed to Him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With one accord - </b>Unitedly. Properly, with one mind or purpose. See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span>. The union of the early Christians is often noticed in the Acts of the Apostles. Thus far, there was no jar or dissension in their society, and everything has the appearance of the most entire affection and confidence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lord - </b>Greek: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δέσποτα</span></span> Despota - “Despota.” From this word is derived the word “despot.” This is not the usual word employed by which to address God. The word commonly translated “Lord” is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυρίος</span></span> Kurios. The word used here denotes “one who rules over others,” and was applied to the highest magistrate or officer. It denotes “authority; power; absoluteness in ruling.” It is a word denoting more authority in ruling than the other. That more commonly denotes a property in a thing; this denotes “absolute rule.” It is applied to God in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:29">Luke 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span>; to Jesus Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>; to masters, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Tit 2:9</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>; to husbands, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:6">1 Peter 3:6</span>; and to a possessor or owner, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:21">2 Timothy 2:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou art God - </b>This ascription of praise seems to have been designed to denote their sense of his power to deliver them, and of his right to dispose of them. They were employed in his service; they were encompassed with dangers; and they acknowledged him as their God, who had made all things, and who had an entire right to direct, and to dispose of them for his own glory. In times of danger and perplexity we should remember that God has a right to do with us as he pleases; and we should go cheerfully, and commit ourselves into his hands.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which hast made ... - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:0">Genesis 1:0</span>: This passage is taken directly from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+146:6">Psalms 146:6</span>.
