The word which is used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παῖς</span></span> pais is different from what is commonly applied to the Lord Jesus <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υἱός</span></span> huios. The latter expresses sonship without respect to age. The word which is here used also sometimes expresses sonship with out any regard to age, and the word “son” would have been a more happy translation. Thus, the same word is translated in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:26">Acts 3:26</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:12">Acts 20:12</span>, it is translated “youngman.”</p>
