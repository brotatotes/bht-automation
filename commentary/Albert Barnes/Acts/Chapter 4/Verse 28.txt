<p style=" "><b>For to do ... - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:18">Acts 3:18</span>. The facts which are brought to view in these verses are among the most remarkable on record. They are briefly these:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That the very people to whom he came, and for whose benefit he labored, joined in the opposition, so that it became the act of a united people.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)That the Romans, who were there as a sort of representation of all pagan nations, were easily prevailed on to join in the persecution, and to become the executioners.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)That thus opposite factions, and dissimilar and prejudiced people, became united in opposing the Messiah.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)That the rulers of the Roman people, the emperors, the statesmen, the philosophers, and the rulers of other nations, united to oppose the gospel, and brought all the power of persecution to stay its progress.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (6)That the people of the empire, the mass of people, were easily prevailed upon to join in the persecution, and to endeavor to arrest its progress. It may be added,</p>
<p style=" ">It is not proper here to enter into an examination of the causes of this opposition. We may state the outlines, however, in few words:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) The Jewish rulers were mortified, humbled, and moved with envy, that one so poor and despised should claim to be the Messiah. They had expected a Messiah of a different rank and character; and all their prejudices rose at once against his claims to this high office, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:18">Matthew 27:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:10">Mark 15:10</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) The common people, disposed extensively to acknowledge his claims, were urged on by the enraged and vindictive priests to demand his death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:20">Matthew 27:20</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) Pilate was pressed on against his will by the impetuous and enraged multitude to deliver one whom he regarded as innocent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4) The Christian religion, in its advances, struck at once at the whole fabric of superstition in the Roman empire and throughout the world. It did not, like other religions, ask a place amidst the religions already existing. It was exclusive in its claims. It denounced all other systems as idolatry or superstition, and sought to overthrow them. Those religions were interwoven with all the habits of the people; they were connected with all the departments of the state; they gave occupation to a vast number of priests and other officer who obtained their livelihood by the existing superstitions, and who brought, of course, all the supposed sacredness of their character to support them. A religion which attempted to overthrow the whole fabric, therefore, at once excited all their malice. The monarchs whose thrones were based on the existing state of things, and the people who venerated the religion of their ancestors, would be opposed to the new system.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5) Christianity was despised. It was regarded as one form of the superstition of the Jews, and there were no people who were regarded with so much contempt by other nations as the Jews. The writings of the Romans on this point are full proof.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (6) The new religion was opposed to all the crimes of the world. It began its career in a time of eminent wickedness. It plunged at once into the midst of that wickedness; sought the great cities where crimes and pollutions were concentrated, and boldly reproved every form of prevailing impiety. At Athens, at Corinth, at Ephesus, at Rome itself, it denounced the judgment of God against every form of guilt. Whatever may be charged on the apostles, it will not be alleged that they were timid in denouncing the sins of the world. From all these causes it is not wonderful that the early Christians were persecuted. If it be asked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (7) Why the same religion meets with opposition now in lands that are nominally Christian, it may be remarked:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a)That the human heart is the same that it always was, opposed to truth and righteousness;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (b)That religion encounters still a host of sins that are opposed to it - pride, envy, malice, passion, and the love of the world;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (c)That there has always been a special opposition in the human heart to receiving salvation as the gift of God through a crucified Redeemer; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (d)That all the forms of vice, and lust, and profaneness that exist in the world, are opposed, and ever will be, to a religion of purity, self-denial, and love.</p>
<p style=" ">On the whole, we may remark here:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)This religion cannot be destroyed; it will triumph; opposition to it is vain; it will make its way throughout the world; and the path of safety is not to oppose what God is intending to establish in the earth. Sinners who stand opposed to the gospel should tremble and be afraid, for sooner or later they must fall before its triumphant advances. It is not safe to oppose what has already been opposed by kings and rulers in every form, and yet has triumphed. It is not wise to risk one’s eternal welfare on the question of successful opposition to what God has, in so many ages and ways, pledged himself to protect; and when God has solemnly declared that the Son, the Messiah, whom he would set on his holy hill of Zion, should “break” his enemies “with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:9">Psalms 2:9</span>.</p>
