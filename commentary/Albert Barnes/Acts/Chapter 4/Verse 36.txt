<p style=" "><b>And Joses - </b>Many manuscripts, instead of “Joses,” here read “Joseph.” The reasons why this individual is selected and specified particularly were, doubtless, because he was a foreigner; because it was a remarkable instance of liberality; and because he subsequently distinguished himself in the work of the ministry. He gave himself, his property, his all, to the service of the Lord Jesus, and went forth to the self-denying labors of the gospel. He is mentioned elsewhere with honor in the New Testament <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:24">Acts 11:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>, and usually as the companion of the apostle Paul. The occasion on which he became connected with Paul in the ministry was when he himself was sent forth by the church at Jerusalem to Antioch. There, it seems, he heard of the fame of Paul and went to Tarsus to seek him, and brought him with him to Antioch, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:22-26">Acts 11:22-26</span>. Before this he had been acquainted with him, and had introduced him to the other apostles at a time when they were afraid of Paul, and unwilling to acknowledge him as an apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:26-27">Acts 9:26-27</span>. At Antioch, Barnabas was led into dissimulation by Peter in regard to the Gentiles, and was reproved by his friend and companion, Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:13">Galatians 2:13</span>. He and Paul continued to travel in fellowship until a dispute arose at Antioch about Mark, and they separated, Paul going with Silas through Syria and Cilicia, and Barnabas, with Mark, sailing for his native place, Cyprus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:35-41">Acts 15:35-41</span>. See the following places for particulars of his history: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:22">Acts 11:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:25">Acts 11:25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1-2">Acts 13:1-2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:50">Acts 13:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:12">Acts 14:12</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Act 15:12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:6">1 Corinthians 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who by the apostles was surnamed ... - </b>The practice of giving surnames, as expressive of character, was not uncommon. Thus, Simon was called Peter, or Cephas, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span>; and thus James and John were surnamed Boanerges, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:17">Mark 3:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Barnabas, which is ... - </b>This word properly denotes “the son of prophecy.” It is compounded of two Syriac words, the one meaning “son,” and the other “prophecy.” The Greek word which is used to interpret this <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παράκλησις</span></span> paraklēsis, translated “consolation,” means properly exhortation, entreaty, petition, or advocacy. It also means “consolation or solace”; and from this meaning the interpretation has been given to the word “Barnabas,” but with evident impropriety. It does not appear that the name was bestowed on account of this, though it is probable that he possessed the qualification for administering comfort or consolation in an eminent degree, but on account of his talent for “speaking,” or “exhorting” the people to holiness, and his success in preaching. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:23">Acts 11:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A Levite - </b>One of the descendants of Levi employed in the lower services of the temple. The whole tribe of Levi was set apart to the service of religion. It was divided into priests and Levites. The three sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Of the family of “Kohath” Aaron was descended, who was the first high priest. His oldest son succeeded him, and the remainder of his sons were “priests.” All the others of the tribe of Levi were called “Levites,” and were employed in the work of the temple, in assisting the priests in performing sacred music, etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:0">Numbers 3:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+12:18-19">Deuteronomy 12:18-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:6-8">Deuteronomy 18:6-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+23:24">1 Chronicles 23:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the country of Cyprus - </b>Cyprus is the largest island in the Mediterranean; an island extremely fertile, abounding in wine, honey, oil, wool, etc. It is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:4">Acts 13:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span>. The island is near to Cicilia, and is not far from the Jewish coast. It is said by Dion Caccius (lib. 68, 69) that the Jews were very numerous in that island - Clark. Barnabas afterward became, with Paul, a distinguished preacher to the Gentiles. It is worthy of remark, that “both” were born in pagan countries, though by descent Jews; and as they were trained in pagan lands, they were better suited for their special work. The case of Barnabas is that of a man who had property when he entered the ministry, and who gave up all for the Lord Jesus. The great mass of ministers, like very many who have been distinguished in other professions, have been taken from among the poor, and from humble ranks in life. But all have not been. Many have been wealthy, and have devoted all to Christ; and in regard to others, it is to be remarked, that a very considerable proportion of them could have gained more “wealth” in some other profession than they do in the ministry. The ministry is a work of self-denial, and none should enter it who are not prepared to devote all to the service of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
