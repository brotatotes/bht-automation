<p style=" "><b>Their rulers - </b>The rulers of the Jews; doubtless the members of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:15">Acts 4:15</span>. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4">Matthew 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>. The expression their rulers looks as if this book was written for the Gentiles, or Luke would have said our rulers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Elders - </b>Presbyters, or those who were chosen from among the people to sit in the Sanhedrin. It is probable that the rulers were those who held also some other office, but were also authorized to sit in the Great Council.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Scribes - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4">Matthew 2:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And Annas ... - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>. It is by no means certain that Annas was at that time the high priest, but he had been, and doubtless retained the title. He was father-in-law to Caiaphas, the high priest; and from this fact, together with his former dignity, he is mentioned first.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Caiaphas - </b>Son-in-law of Annas, and now exercising the office of the high priest, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>John, and Alexander ... - </b>Of these persons nothing more is known. It is clear that they were members of the Great Council, and the mention of their names shows that the men of chief authority and influence were assembled to silence the apostles. Annas and Caiaphas had been concerned in the condemnation of Jesus, and they would now feel a special interest in arresting the progress of the gospel among the people. All the success of the gospel reflected back light upon the wicked ness of the act of condemning the Lord Jesus. And this fact may serve, in part, to account for their strong desire to silence the apostles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>At Jerusalem - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis. This was the usual place of assembling the Sanhedrin. But the Jewish writers (see Lightfoot on this place) say that 40 years before the destruction of the city, on account of the great increase of crime, etc., the Sanhedrin was removed from place to place. The declaration of Luke that they were now assembled in Jerusalem, seems to imply that they sometimes met in other places. It is probable that the members of the Sanhedrin were not in the city at the time mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:3">Acts 4:3</span>, and this was the reason why the trial was deferred to the next day.</p>
