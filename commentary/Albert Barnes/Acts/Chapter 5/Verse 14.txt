<p style=" "><b>And believers - </b>This is the name by which Christians were designated, because one of the main things that distinguished them was that they “believed” that Jesus was the Christ. It is also an incidental proof that none should join themselves to the church who are not “believers”; that is, who do not profess to be Christians in heart and in life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Were the more added - </b>The effect of all these things was to increase the number of converts. Their persecutions, their preaching, and the judgment of God, “all” tended to impress the minds of the people, and to lead them to the Lord Jesus Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:4">Acts 4:4</span>. Though the judgment of God had the effect of deterring hypocrites from entering the church - though it produced awe and caution, yet still the number of true converts was increased. An effort to keep the church pure by wholesome discipline, and by cutting off unworthy members, however rich or honored, so far from weakening its true strength, has a tendency greatly to increase its numbers as well as its purity. People will not seek to enter a corrupt church, or regard it as worth any effort to be connected with a society that does not endeavor to be pure.</p>
