<p style=" "><b>There came also ... - </b>Attracted by the fame of Peter’s miracles, as the people formerly had been by the miracles of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Vexed - </b>Troubled, afflicted, or tormented.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unclean spirits - </b>Possessed with devils; called “unclean” because they prompted to sin and impurity of life. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23-24">Matthew 4:23-24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they were healed - </b>Of these persons it is expressly affirmed that they were healed. Of those who were so laid as that the shadow of Peter might pass over them, there is no such direct affirmation.</p>
