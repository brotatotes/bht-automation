<p style=" "><b>And kept back - </b>The word used here means properly “to separate, to part:” and then it means to “separate surreptitiously or clandestinely for our own use” a part of public property, as taxes, etc. It is used but three times in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:10">Titus 2:10</span>, where it is rendered “purloining.” Here it means that they “secretly” kept back a part, while “professedly” devoting all to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His wife also being privy to it - </b>His wife “knowing it,” and evidently concurring in it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And laid it at the apostles’ feet - </b>This was evidently an act professedly of devoting all to God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:37">Acts 4:37</span>; also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:8-9">Acts 5:8-9</span>. That this was his “profession,” or “pretence,” is further implied in the fact that Peter charges him with having “lied” unto God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3-4">Acts 5:3-4</span>.</p>
