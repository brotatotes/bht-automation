Early in the morning - Greek: at the break of day. Compare Luke 24:1; John 8:2.Called the council together - The Sanhedrin, or the Great Council of the nation. This was clearly for the purpose of “trying” the apostles for disregarding their commandments.And all the senate - Greek: “eldership.” Probably these were not a part of the Sanhedrin, but were people of age and experience, who in Acts 4:8; Acts 25:15, are called “elders of the Jews,” and who were present for the sake of counsel Canal advice in a case of emergency.
