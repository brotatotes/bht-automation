<p style=" "><b>Straitly command you - </b>Did we not command you with a “threat?” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:17-18">Acts 4:17-18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:21">Acts 4:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In this name - </b>In the name of Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye have filled Jerusalem - </b>This, though not so desired, was an honorable tribute to the zeal and fidelity of the apostles. When Chastens are arraigned or persecuted, it is well if the only charge which their enemies can bring against them is that they have been distinguished for zeal and success in propagating their religion. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span>, “If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glory God on this behalf”; also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:13-15">Acts 5:13-15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Intend to bring this man’s blood upon us - </b>To bring “one’s blood” upon another is a phrase signifying to hold or to prove him guilty of murdering the innocent. The expression here charges them with desiring to prove that they had put Jesus to death when he was innocent; to convince “the people” of this, and thus to enrage them against the Sanhedrin; and also to prove that they were guilty, and were exposed to the divine vengeance for having put the Messiah to death. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:52">Acts 7:52</span>. That the apostles “did” intend to charge them with being guilty of murder is clear; but it is observable that on “this occasion” they had said no thing of this, and it is further observable that they did not charge it on them “except in their presence.” See the places just referred to. They took no pains to spread this among the people, “except as the people were accessory to the crime of the rulers,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>. Their consciences were not at ease, and the remembrance of the death of Jesus would occur to them at once at the sight of the apostles.</p>
