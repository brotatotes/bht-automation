<p style=" "><b>But Peter said ... - </b>Peter could have known this only by “revelation.” It was the manifest design of Ananias to deceive; nor was there any way of detecting him but by its being revealed to him by the Spirit of God. As it was an instance of enormous wickedness, and as it was very important to detect and punish the crime, it was made known to Peter directly by God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Why hath Satan - </b>Great deeds of wickedness in the Scripture are traced to the influence of Satan. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:3">Luke 23:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:27">John 13:27</span>. Especially is Satan called the “father of lies,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44-45">John 8:44-45</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:1-5">Genesis 3:1-5</span>. As this was an act of “falsehood,” or an attempt to deceive, it is with great propriety traced to the influence of Satan. The sin of Ananias consisted in his “yielding” to the temptation. Nowhere in the Bible are people supposed to be free from guilt from the mere fact that they have been “tempted” to commit it. God requires them to “resist” temptation; and if they “yield” to it, they must be punished.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Filled thine heart - </b>A man’s “heart” or “mind” is “full” of a thing when he is “intent on it”; when he is strongly “impelled to it”; or when he is fully occupied with it. The expression here means that he was “strongly impelled” or “excited” by Satan to this crime.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To lie to - </b>To attempt to deceive. The deception which he meant to practice was to keep back a “part” of the price, while he “pretended” to bring the whole of it; thus “tempting” God, and supposing that he could not detect the fraud.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Holy Ghost - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον</span></span> to pneuma to hagion. The main inquiry here is, whether the apostle Peter intended to designate in this place the “third person” of the Trinity; or whether he meant to speak of God “as God,” without any reference to the distinction of persons; or whether he referred to the “divine influence” which inspired the apostles, without reference to the special offices which are commonly ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Or, in other words, is there a “distinction” here recognized between the Father and the Holy Spirit? That there “is,” will be apparent from the following considerations:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) If no such distinction is “intended,” it is remarkable that Peter did not use the usual and customary “name” of God. It does not appear why he guarded it so carefully as to denote that this offence was committed against the “Holy Spirit,” and “the Spirit of the Lord,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:9">Acts 5:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The name used here is the one employed in the Scriptures to designate the third person of the Trinity, as implying a distinction from the Father. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:32">Matthew 12:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:8">Mark 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:36">Mark 12:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:10">Luke 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:22">John 20:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:8">Acts 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:32">Acts 5:32</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Peter intended, doubtless, to designate an offence as committed particularly against the person, or influence, by which he and the other apostles were inspired. Ananias supposed that he could escape detection, and the offence was one, therefore, against the Inspirer of the apostles. Yet that was the Holy Spirit as “distinct from the Father.” See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16-17">John 14:16-17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7-11">John 16:7-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:22">John 20:22</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:32">Acts 5:32</span>. The offence, therefore, being against him who was “sent” by the Father, and who was appointed to a particular work, clearly supposes that the Holy Spirit is distinct from the Father.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) A further incidental proof of this may be found in the fact that the sin here committed was one of special magnitude - so great as to be deemed worthy of the immediate and signal vengeance of God. Yet the sin against the Holy Spirit is uniformly represented to be of this description. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31-32">Matthew 12:31-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:28-29">Mark 3:28-29</span>. As these sins evidently coincide in enormity, it is clear that the same class of sins is referred to in both places; or, in other words, the sin of Ananias was against the third person of the Trinity. Two remarks may be made here:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The Holy Spirit is a distinct Person from the Father and the Son; or, in other words, there is a distinction of some kind in the divine nature that may be designated by the word “person.” This is clear from the fact that sin is said to have been committed against him - a sin which it was supposed could not be detected. “Sin” cannot be committed against an “attribute” of God, or an “influence” from God. We cannot “lie unto” an attribute, or against wisdom, or power, or goodness; nor can we “lie unto” an “influence,” merely, of the Most High. Sin is committed against a “Being,” not against an “attribute”; and as a sin is here charged on Ananias against “the Holy Spirit,” it follows that the Holy Spirit has a “personal” existence, or that there is such a distinction in the divine essence that it may be proper to “specify” a sin as committed especially against him. In the same way sin may be represented as committed especially against the “Father” when his “name” is blasphemed; when his “dominion” is denied; when his mercy in sending his Son is called in question. Sin may be represented as committed against “the Son” when his atonement is denied; his divinity assailed; his character derided, or his invitations slighted. And thus sin may be represented as committed against “the Holy Spirit” when his office of renewing the heart, or sanctifying the soul, is called in question, or when “his” work is ascribed to some malign or other influence. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22-30">Mark 3:22-30</span>. And as sin against the Son proves that he is in some sense distinct from the Father, so does sin against the Holy Spirit prove that in some sense he is distinct from the Father and the Son.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The Holy Spirit is divine. This is proved, because he is represented here as being able to search the heart, and to detect insincerity and hypocrisy. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:10">Jeremiah 17:10</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ch 28:9</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>, “The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:23">Revelation 2:23</span>. And he is expressly “called” God. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:4">Acts 5:4</span>.</p>
