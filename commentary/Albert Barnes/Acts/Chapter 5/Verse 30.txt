<p style=" "><b>Raised up Jesus - </b>This refers to his resurrection.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hanged on a tree - </b>That is, on the “cross,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39">Acts 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:29">Acts 13:29</span>. This is the amount of Peter’s defense. He begins with the great principle <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:29">Acts 5:29</span>, which they could not gainsay, that God ought to be obeyed rather than man. He then proceeds to state that they were convinced that God had raised up Jesus from the dead, and as they had such decisive evidence of that, and were commanded by the authority of the Lord Jesus to be “witnesses of that,” they were not “at liberty” to be silent. They were bound to obey God rather than the Sanhedrin, and to make known everywhere the fact that the Lord Jesus was risen. The remark that God had raised up Jesus whom they had “slain,” does not seem to have been made to irritate or to reproach them, but merely to “identify” him as the person that had been raised. It was also a confirmation of the truth and reality of the miracle. Of his “death” they had no doubt, for they had been at pains to certify it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31-34">John 19:31-34</span>. It is certain, however, that Peter did not shrink from charging on them their guilt; nor was he at any pains to “soften” or “mitigate” the severe charge that they had murdered their own Messiah.</p>
