See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>. In that place he is called the “Prince of life.” Here it means that he is actually in the “exercise” of the office of a prince or a king, at the right hand of his Father. The title “Prince,” or “King,” was one which was well known as applied to the Messiah. It denotes that he has “dominion” and “power,” especially the power which is needful to give repentance and the pardon of sins.</p>

<p style=" "><b>To give repentance - </b>The word “repentance” here is equivalent to “reformation” and “a change of life.” The sentiment does not differ from what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:26">Acts 3:26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To Israel - </b>This word properly denotes the “Jews”; but his office was not to be confined to the Jews. Other passages show that it would be also extended to the “Gentiles.” The reasons why the “Jews” are particularly specified here are, probably:</p>

<p style=" ">If it be asked in what sense the Lord Jesus “gives repentance,” or how his “exaltation” is connected with it, we may answer:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) His exaltation is evidence that his work was accepted, and that thus a foundation is laid by which repentance is available, and may be connected with pardon. Unless there was some way of “forgiveness,” sorrow for sin would be of no value, even if exercised. The relentings of a culprit condemned for murder will be of no avail unless the executive can “consistently” pardon him; nor would relentings in hell be of avail, for there is no promise of forgiveness. But Jesus Christ by his death has laid a foundation by which repentance “may be” accepted.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He is entrusted with all power in heaven and earth with “reference” to this, to apply his work to people; or, in other words, to bring them to repentance. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) His exaltation is immediately connected with the bestowment of the Holy Spirit, by whose influence people are brought to repentance, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7-11">John 16:7-11</span>. The Spirit is represented as being “sent” by him as well as by the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Jesus has power in this state of exaltation over all things that can affect the mind. He sends his ministers; he directs the events of sickness or disappointment, of health or prosperity, that will influence the heart. There is no doubt that he can so recall the sins of the past life, and refresh the memory, as to overwhelm the soul in the consciousness of guilt. Thus also he can appeal to man by his “goodness,” and by a sense of his mercies; and especially he can so present a view of “his own” life and death as to affect the heart, and show the evil of the past life of the sinner. Knowing the heart, he knows all the avenues by which it can be approached, and in an instant he can overwhelm the soul with the remembrance of crime.</p>
<p style=" ">It was “proper” that the power of pardon should be lodged with the same being that has the power of producing repentance, because:</p>
<p style=" ">And from this we may learn:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That Christ is “divine.” It is a dictate of natural religion that none can forgive sins against God but God himself. None can pardon but the Being who has been offended. And this is also the dictate of the Bible. The power of “pardoning” sin is one that God claims as “his” prerogative, and it is clear that it can pertain to no other. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:25">Isaiah 43:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:9">Daniel 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+130:4">Psalms 130:4</span>. Yet Jesus Christ exercised this power when on earth; gave “evidence” that the exercise of that power was one that was acceptable to God by working a miracle, and removing the “consequences” of sin with which God had visited upon the sinner <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:6">Matthew 9:6</span>, and exercises it still in heaven. He must, therefore, be divine.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The sinner is dependent on him for the exercise of repentance, and for forgiveness.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The proud sinner must be humbled at his feet. He must be willing to come and receive eternal life at “his” hands. No step is more humiliating than this for proud and hardened people; and there is none which they are more reluctant to do. We always shrink from coming into the presence of one whom we have offended; we are extremely reluctant to confess a fault; but it “must be done,” or the soul must be lost for ever.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Christ has power to pardon the greatest offender. He is exalted for this purpose; and he is suited to his work. Even his murderers he could pardon; and no sinner need fear that he who is “a Prince and a Saviour at the right hand of God” is unable to pardon his sins. To him we may come with confidence; and when pressed with the consciousness of the blackest crimes, and when we feel that we deserve eternal death, we may confidently roll all on his arm.</p>
