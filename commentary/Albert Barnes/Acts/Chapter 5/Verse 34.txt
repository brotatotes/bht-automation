<p style=" "><b>Then stood there up one - </b>He rose, as is usual in deliberative assemblies, to speak.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the council - </b>In the Sanhedrin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:15">Acts 4:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A Pharisee - </b>The high priest and those who had been most active in opposing the apostles were Sadducees. The Pharisees were opposed to them, particularly on the doctrine in regard to which the apostles were so strenuous, the resurrection of the dead. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Gamaliel - </b>This name was very common among the Jews. Dr. Lightfoot says that this man was the teacher of Paul <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span>, the son of the “Simon” who took the Saviour in his arms <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:0">Luke 2:0</span>, and the grandson of the famous “Hillel,” and was known among the Jews by the title of “Rabban Gamaliel the elder.” There were other people of this name, who were also eminent among the Jews. This man is said to have died 18 years after the destruction of Jerusalem, and he died as he had lived, a Pharisee. There is not the least evidence that he was a friend of the Christian religion; but he was evidently a man of far more liberal views than the other members of the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A doctor of the law - </b>That is, “a teacher” of the Jewish Law; one whose province it was to “interpret” the laws of Moses, and probably to preserve and transmit the “traditional” laws of the Jews. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:3">Matthew 15:3</span>. So celebrated was he, that Saul of Tarsus went to Jerusalem to receive the benefit of his instructions, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had in reputation among all the people - </b>“Honored” by all the people. His advice was likely, therefore, to be respected.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To put the apostles forth - </b>This was done, doubtless, because, if the apostles had been suffered to remain, it was apprehended that they would take fresh courage, and be confirmed in their purposes. It was customary, besides, when they deliberated, to command those accused to retire, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:15">Acts 4:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A little space - </b>A little “time,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:58">Luke 22:58</span>.</p>
