<p style=" "><b>For before those days - </b>The “advice” of Gamaliel was to permit these men to go on. The “arguments” by which he enforced his advice were:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rose up - </b>That is, commenced or excited an insurrection.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Theudas - </b>This was a name quite common among the Jews. Of this man nothing more is known than is here recorded. Josephus (Antiq., book 20, chapter 5) mentions one “Theudas,” in the time of “Fadus,” the procurator of Judea, in the reign of the Emperor Claudius (45 or 46 a.d.), who persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them and follow him to the river Jordan. He told them he was a prophet, and that he would divide the river and lead them over. Fadus, however, came suddenly upon them, and slew many of them. Theudas was taken alive and conveyed to Jerusalem, and there beheaded. But this occurred at least ten or fifteen years after this discourse of Gamaliel. Many efforts have been made to reconcile Luke and Josephus, on the supposition that they refer to the same man. Lightfoot supposed that Josephus had made an error in chronology. But there is no reason to suppose that there is reference to the same event; and the fact that Josephus has not recorded the insurrection referred to by Gamaliel does not militate at all against the account in the Acts . For:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)The name “Theudas” was a common name among the Jews; and there is no improbability that there were “two” leaders of an insurrection of this name. If it “is” improbable, the improbability would affect Josephus’ credit as much as that of Luke.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)It is altogether improbable that “Gamaliel” should refer to a case which was not well authenticated, and that Luke should record a speech of this kind unless it was delivered, when it would be so easy to detect the error.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Boasting himself to be somebody - </b>Claiming to be an eminent prophet probably, or the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Obeyed him - </b>The word used here is the one commonly used to denote “belief.” As many as believed on him, or gave credit to his pretensions.</p>
