<p style=" "><b>Looking stedfastly on him - </b>Fixing the eyes intently on him. They were probably attracted by the unusual appearance of the man, his meekness, his calm and collected fearlessness, and the proofs of conscious innocence and sincerity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The face of an angel - </b>This expression is one evidently denoting that he manifested evidence of sincerity, gravity, fearlessness, confidence in God. It is used in the Old Testament to denote special wisdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+14:17">2 Samuel 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+19:27">2 Samuel 19:27</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:10">Genesis 33:10</span>, it is used to denote special majesty and glory, as if it were the face of God. When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, it is said that the skin of his face shone so that the children of Israel were afraid to come near him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:29-30">Exodus 34:29-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:13">2 Corinthians 3:13</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span>. The expression is used to denote the impression produced on the countenance by communion with God; the calm serenity and composure which follow a confident committing of all into his hands. It is not meant that there was anything “miraculous” in the case of Stephen, but it is language that denotes calmness, dignity, and confidence in God, all of which were so marked on his countenance that it impressed them with clear proofs of his innocence and piety. The language is very common in the Jewish writings. It is not unusual for deep feeling, sincerity, and confidence in God, to impress themselves on the countenance. Any deep emotion will do this; and it is to be expected with religious feeling, the most tender and solemn of all feeling, will diffuse seriousness, serenity, calmness, and peace not affected sanctimoniousness, over the countenance.</p>
<p style=" ">In this chapter we have another specimen of the manner in which the church of the Lord Jesus was established. It was from the beginning amidst scenes of persecution, encountering opposition adapted to try the nature and power of religion. If Christianity was an imposture, it had enemies acute and malignant enough to detect the imposition. The learned, the cunning, and the mighty rose up in opposition, and by all the arts of sophistry, all the force of authority, and all the fearfulness of power, attempted to destroy it in the commencement. Yet it lived; it gained new accessions of strength from every new form of opposition; it evinced its genuineness more and more by showing that it was superior to the arts and malice of earth and of hell.</p>
