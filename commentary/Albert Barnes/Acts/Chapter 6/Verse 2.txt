<p style=" "><b>Then the twelve - </b>That is, the apostles. Matthias had been added to them after the apostasy of Judas, which had completed the original number.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The multitude of the disciples - </b>It is not necessary to suppose that all the disciples were convened, which amounted to many thousands, but that the business was laid before a large number; or perhaps “the multitude” here means those merely who were more particularly interested in the matter, and who had been engaged in the complaint.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is not reason - </b>The original words used here properly denote “it is not pleasing or agreeable”; but the meaning evidently is, it is not “suitable” or “proper.” It would be a departure from the design of their appointment, which was to preach the gospel, and not to attend to the pecuniary affairs of the church.</p>

The “gospel” is here called the “Word of God,” because it is his message; it is what he has spoken, or which he has commanded to be proclaimed to people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Serve tables - </b>This expression properly denotes “to take care of, or provide for the table, or for the daily needs of a family.” It is an expression that properly applies to a steward or a servant. The word “tables” is, however, sometimes used with reference to “money,” as being the place where money was kept for the purpose of “exchange, etc.,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:27">Matthew 25:27</span>. Here the expression means, therefore, to attend to the pecuniary transactions of the church, and to make the proper distribution for the needs of the poor.</p>
