<p style=" "><b>But we will give ourselves continually - </b>The original expression used here denotes “intense and persevering” application to a thing, or unwearied effort in it. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span>. It means that the apostles designed to make this their constant and main object, undistracted by the cares of life, and even by attention to the temporal needs of the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To prayer - </b>Whether this means “private” or “public” prayer cannot be certainly determined. The passage, however, would rather incline us to suppose that the “latter” was meant, as it is immediately connected with preaching. If so, then the phrase denotes that they would give themselves to the duties of their office, one part of which was public prayer, and another preaching. Still it is to be believed that the apostles felt the need of secret prayer, and practiced it, as preparatory to their public preaching.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to the ministry of the word - </b>To preaching the gospel, or communicating the message of eternal life to the world. The word “ministry” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονία</span></span> diakonia properly denotes the employment of a “servant,” and is given to the preachers of the gospel because they are employed in this as the “servants” of God and of the church. We have here a view of what the apostles thought to be the proper work of the ministry. They were set apart to this work. It was their main, their only employment. To this their lives were to be devoted, and both by their example and their writings they have shown that it was on this principle they acted. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:15-16">1 Timothy 4:15-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:2">2 Timothy 4:2</span>. It follows also that if their time and talents were to be wholly devoted to this work, it was reasonable that they should receive competent support from the churches, and this reasonable claim is often urged. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7-14">1 Corinthians 9:7-14</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:6">Galatians 6:6</span> note.</p>
