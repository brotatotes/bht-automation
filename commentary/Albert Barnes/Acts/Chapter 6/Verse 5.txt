<p style=" "><b>And the saying - </b>“The word” - the counsel, or command,</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they chose Stephen ... - </b>A man who soon showed <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:0">Acts 7:0</span> that he was in every way qualified for his office, and also suited to defend the cause of the Lord Jesus. This man had the distinguished honor of being the first Christian martyr.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And Nicolas - </b>From this man some of the fathers (Iren., lib. 1:27; Epiphanius, 1; Haeres., 5) says that the sect of the “Nicolaitanes,” mentioned with so much disapprobation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:15">Revelation 2:15</span>, took their rise. But the evidence of this is not clear.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A proselyte - </b>A “proselyte” is one who is converted from one religion to another. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:15">Matthew 23:15</span>. The word does not mean here that he was a convert to “Christianity” - which was true - but that he had been converted at Antioch from paganism to the Jewish religion. As this is the only proselyte mentioned among the seven deacons, it is evident that the others were native-born Jews, though a part of them might have been born out of Palestine, and have been of the denomination of “Grecians,” or “Hellenists.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of Antioch - </b>This city, often mentioned in the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19-20">Acts 11:19-20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:35">Acts 15:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11">Galatians 2:11</span>, etc.), was situated in Syria, on the river Orontes, and was formerly called “Riblath.” It is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but is frequently mentioned in the Apocrypha. It was built by Seleucus Nicanor, b.c. 301, and was named “Antioch,” in honor of his father Antiochus. It became the seat of empire of the Syrian kings of the Macedonian race, and afterward of the Roman governors of the eastern provinces. In this place the disciples of Christ were first called “Christians,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>. Josephus says it was the third city in size of the Roman provinces, being inferior only to Seleucia and Alexandria. It was long, indeed, the most powerful city of the East. The city was almost square, had many gates, was adorned with fine fountains, and possessed great fertility of soil and commercial opulence. It was subject to earthquakes, and was often almost destroyed by them. In 588 a.d. above 60,000 persons perished in it in this manner. In 970 a.d. an army of 100,000 Saracens besieged it, and took it. In 1268 a.d. it was taken possession of by the Sultan of Egypt, who demolished it, and placed it under the dominion of the Turks. It is now called “Antakia,” and until the year 1822 it occupied a remote corner of the ancient enclosure of its walls, its splendid buildings being reduced to hovels, and its population living in Turkish debasement. It contains now about 10,000 inhabitants (Robinson’s Calmet). This city should be distinguished from Antioch in Pisidia, also mentioned in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:14">Acts 13:14</span>.</p>
