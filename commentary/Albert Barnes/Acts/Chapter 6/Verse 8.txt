And Stephen - The remarkable death of this first Christian martyr, which soon occurred, gave occasion to the sacred writer to give a detailed account of his character, and of the causes which led to his death. Hitherto the opposition of the Jews had been confined to threats and imprisonment; but it was now to burst forth with furious rage and madness, that could be satisfied only with blood. This was the first in a series of persecutions against Christians which filled the church with blood, and which closed the lives of thousands, perhaps a million, in the great work of establishing the gospel on the earth.Full of faith - Full of “confidence” in God, or trusting entirely to his promises. See the notes on Mark 16:16.And power - The power which was evinced in working miracles.Wonders - This is one of the words commonly used in the New Testament to denote miracles.
