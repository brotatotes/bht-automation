<p style=" "><b>Then there arose - </b>That is, they stood up against him, or they opposed him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the synagogue - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>. The Jews were scattered in all parts of the world. In every place they would have synagogues. But it is also probable that there would be enough foreign Jews residing at Jerusalem from each of those places to maintain the worship of the synagogue; and at the great feasts, those synagogues adapted to Jewish people of different nations would be attended by those who came up to attend the great feasts. It is certain that there was a large number of synagogues in Jerusalem. The common estimate is, that there were four hundred and eighty in the city (Lightfoot; Vitringa).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the Libertines - </b>There has been very great difference of opinion about the meaning of this word. The chief opinions may be reduced to three:</p>
<p style=" ">1. The word is Latin, and means properly a “freedman,” a man who had been a slave and was set at liberty. Many have supposed that these persons were manumitted slaves of Roman origin, but who had become proselyted to the Jewish religion, and who had a synagogue in Jerusalem. This opinion is not very probable; though it is certain, from Tacitus (Ann., lib. 2:c. 85), that there were many persons of this description at Rome. He says that 4,000 Jewish proselytes of Roman slaves made free were sent at one time to Sardinia.</p>
<p style=" ">2. A second opinion is, that these persons were Jews by birth, and had been taken captives by the Romans, and then set at liberty, and were thus called “freedmen” or “liberties.” That there were many Jews of this description there can be no doubt. Pompey the Great, when he subjugated Judea, sent large numbers of the Jews to Rome (Philo, In Legat. a.d. Caium). These Jews were set at liberty at Rome, and assigned a place beyond the Tiber for a residence. See Introduction to the Epistle to the Romans. These persons are by Philo called “libertines,” or “freedmen” (Kuinoel, in loco). Many Jews were also conveyed as captives by Ptolemy I. to Egypt, and obtained a residence in that country and the vicinity.</p>
<p style=" ">3. Another opinion is, that they took their name from some “place” which they occupied. This opinion is more probable from the fact that all the “other” persons mentioned here are named from the countries which they occupied. Suidas says that this is the name of a place. And in one of the fathers this passage occurs: “Victor, Bishop of the Catholic Church at Libertina, says, unity is there, etc.” from this passage it is plain that there was a place called “Libertina.” That place was in Africa, not far from ancient Carthage. See Dr. Pearce’s Commentary on this place.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cyrenians - </b>Jews who dwelt at “Cyrene” in Africa. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:32">Matthew 27:32</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Alexandrians - </b>Inhabitants of Alexandria in Egypt. That city was founded by Alexander the Great, 332 b.c., and was populated by colonies of Greeks and Jews. It was much celebrated, and contained not less than 300,000 free citizens, and as many slaves. The city was the residence of many Jews. Josephus says that Alexander himself assigned to them a particular quarter of the city, and allowed them equal privileges with the Greeks (Antiq., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7">Romans 14:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:2">Romans 14:2</span>; Against Apion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>). Philo affirms that of five parts of the city, the Jews inhabited two. According to his statement, there dwelt in his time at Alexandria and the other Egyptian cities not less than “ten hundred thousand Jews.” Amron, the general of Omar, when he took the city, said that it contained 40,000 tributary Jews. At this place the famous version of the Old Testament called the “Septuagint,” or the Alexandrian version, was made. See Robinson’s Calmet.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cilicia - </b>This was a province of Asia Minor, on the seacoast, at the north of Cyprus. The capital of this province was Tarsus, the native place of Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11">Acts 9:11</span>. As Paul was of this place, and belonged doubtless to this synagogue, it is probable that he was one who was engaged in this dispute with Stephen. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of Asia - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Disputing with Stephen - </b>Doubtless on the question whether Jesus was the Messiah. This word does not denote “angry disputing,” but is commonly used to denote “fair and impartial inquiry”; and it is probable that the discussion began in this way, and when they were overcome by “argument,” they resorted, as disputants are apt to do, to angry criminations and violence.</p>
