<p style=" "><b>Men, brethren, and fathers - </b>These were the usual titles by which the Sanhedrin was addressed. In all this Stephen was perfectly respectful, and showed that he was disposed to render due honor to the institutions of the nation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The God of glory - </b>This is a Hebrew form of expression denoting “the glorious God.” It properly denotes His “majesty, or splendor, or magnificence”; and the word “glory” is often applied to the splendid appearances in which God has manifested Himself to people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+5:24">Deuteronomy 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:18">Exodus 33:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:7">Exodus 16:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:10">Exodus 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+9:23">Leviticus 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:10">Numbers 14:10</span>. Perhaps Stephen meant to affirm that God appeared to Abraham in some such glorious or splendid manifestation, by which he would know that he was addressed by God. Stephen, moreover, evidently uses the word “glory” to repel the charge of “blasphemy” against God, and to show that he regarded him as worthy of honor and praise.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Appeared ... - </b>In what manner he appeared is not said. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1">Genesis 12:1</span>, it is simply recorded that God “had said” unto Abraham, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto our father - </b>The Jews valued themselves much on being the children of Abraham. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>. The expression was therefore well calculated to conciliate their minds.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When he was in Mesopotamia - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:31">Genesis 11:31</span>, it is said that Abraham dwelt “in Ur of the Chaldees.” The word “Mesopotamia” properly denotes the region between the two rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris. See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>. The name is Greek, and the region had also other names before the Greek name was given to it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:31">Genesis 11:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:7">Genesis 15:7</span>, it is called Ur of the Chaldees. Mesopotamia and Chaldea might not exactly coincide; but it is evident that Stephen meant to say that “Ur” was in the country afterward called Mesopotamia. Its precise situation is unknown. A Persian fortress of this name is mentioned by Ammianus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+25:8">Genesis 25:8</span> between Nisibis and the Tigris.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before he dwelt in Charran - </b>From <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:31">Genesis 11:31</span>, it would seem that Terah took his son Abraham of his own accord, and removed to Haran. But from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1">Genesis 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:7">Genesis 15:7</span>, it appears that God had commanded “Abraham” to remove, and so he ordered it in his providence that “Terah” was disposed to remove his family with an intention of going into the land of Canaan. The word “Charran” is the Greek form of the Hebrew “Haran,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:31">Genesis 11:31</span>. This place was also in Mesopotamia, in 36 degrees 52 minutes north latitude and 39 degrees 5 minutes east longitude. Here Terah died <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:32">Genesis 11:32</span>; and to this place Jacob retired when he fled from his brother Esau, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:43">Genesis 27:43</span>. It is situated “in a flat and sandy plain, and is inhabited by a few wandering Arabs, who select it for the delicious water which it contains” (Robinson’s Calmet).</p>
