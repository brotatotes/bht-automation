<p style=" "><b>In which time ... - </b>During this period of oppression. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:2">Exodus 2:2</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was exceeding fair - </b>Greek: “was fair to God”; properly rendered, “was very handsome.” The word “God” in the Greek here in accordance with the Hebrew usage, by which anything that is “very handsome, lofty, or grand” is thus designated. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:7">Psalms 36:7</span>, “mountains of God,” mean lofty mountains; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+80:11">Psalms 80:11</span>, “cedars of God,” mean lofty, beautiful cedars. Thus, Nineveh is called “a great city to God” (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jon+3:3">Jonah 3:3</span>, Greek), meaning a very great city. The expression here simply means that Moses was “very fair,” or handsome. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:23">Hebrews 11:23</span>, where he is called “a proper child”; that is, a “handsome child.” It would seem from this that Moses was preserved by his mother on account of his “beauty”; and this is hinted at in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:2">Exodus 2:2</span>. And it would also seem from this that Pharaoh had succeeded by his oppressions in what he had attempted; and that it was not unusual for parents among the Jews to expose their children, or to put them to death.</p>
