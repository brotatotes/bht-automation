Then fled Moses ... - Moses fled because he now ascertained that what he had done was known. He supposed that it had been unobserved, Exodus 2:12. But he now thought that the knowledge of it might reach Pharaoh, and that his life might thus be endangered. Nor did he judge incorrectly; for as soon as Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to take his life, Exodus 2:15.Was a stranger - Or became a sojourner πάροικος paroikos, one who had a temporary abode in the land. The use of this word implies that he did not expect to make that his permanent dwelling.In the land of Madian - This was a part of Arabia. “This would seem,” says Gesenius, “to have been a tract of country extending from the eastern shore of the Elanitic Gulf to the region of Moab on the one hand, and to the vicinity of Mount Sinai on the, other. The people were nomadic in their habits, and moved often from place to place.” This was extensively a desert region, an unknown land; and Moses expected there to be safe from Pharaoh.Where he begat two sons - He married Zipporah, the daughter of “Reuel” Exodus 2:18, or “Jethro” Numbers 10:29; Exodus 3:1, a “priest” of Midian. The names of the two sons were Gershom and Eliezer, Exodus 18:3-4.
