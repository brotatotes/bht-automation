<p style=" "><b>And when forty years ... - </b>At the age of 80 years. This, however, was known by tradition. It is not expressly mentioned by Moses. It is said, however, to have been after the king of Egypt had died <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:23">Exodus 2:23</span>; and the tradition is not improbable.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the wilderness of mount Sina - </b>In the desert adjacent to, or that surrounded Mount Sinai. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:1">Exodus 3:1</span>, it is said that this occurred at Mount “Horeb.” But there is no contradiction; Horeb and Sinai are different peaks or elevations of the same mountain. They are represented as springing from the same base, and branching out in different elevations. The mountains, according to Burckhardt, are a prodigious pile, comprehending many peaks, and about thirty miles in diameter. From one part of this mountain, Sinai, the Law was given to the children of Israel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>An angel of the Lord - </b>The word “angel” means properly a “messenger” (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>), and is applied to the invisible spirits in heaven, to people, to the winds, to the pestilence, or to whatever is appointed as a messenger “to make known” or to execute the will of God. The mere “name,” therefore, can determine nothing about the “nature” of the messenger. That “name” might be applied to any messenger, even an inanimate object. The nature and character of this messenger are to be determined by other considerations. The word may denote that the “bush on fire” was the messenger. But a comparison with the other places where this occurs will show that it was a celestial messenger, and perhaps that it was the Messiah who was yet to come, appearing to take the people of Israel under his own charge and direction. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>, where the Jews are called “his own.” In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:2">Exodus 3:2</span>, it is said that the angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire; in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:4">Exodus 3:4</span> it is said that Yahweh spake to him out of the midst of the bush; language which implies that God was there, and which is strongly expressive of the doctrine that the angel was Yahweh. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:20-21">Exodus 23:20-21</span>, God says, “I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey “his” voice,” etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:23">Exodus 23:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:34">Exodus 32:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:2">Exodus 33:2</span>. In all these places this angel is mentioned as an extraordinary messenger sent to conduct them to the land of Canaan. He was to guide them, to defend them, and to drive out the nations before them. All these circumstances seem to point to the conclusion that this was no other than the future deliverer of the world, who came then to take his people under his own guidance, as emblematic of the redemption of his people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In a flame of fire - </b>That is, in what “appeared” to be a flame of fire. The “bush” or clump of trees seemed to be on fire, or to be illuminated with a special splendor. God is often represented as encompassed with this splendor, or glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1-5">Matthew 17:1-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:3">Acts 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:7">Acts 12:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In a bush - </b>In a grove, or clump of trees. Probably the light was seen issuing from the “midst” of such a grove.</p>
