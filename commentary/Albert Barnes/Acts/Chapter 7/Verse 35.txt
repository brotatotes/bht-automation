<p style=" "><b>Whom they refused - </b>That is, when he first presented himself to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:13-14">Exodus 2:13-14</span>. Stephen introduces and dwells upon this refusal in order, perhaps, to remind them that this had been the character of their nation, and to prepare the way for the charge which he intended to bring against those whom he addressed, as being stiff-necked and rebellious. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51-52">Acts 7:51-52</span>, etc.</p>

<p style=" "><b>A deliverer - </b>A Redeemer - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτρωτὴν</span></span> lutrōtēn. It properly means one who redeems a captive or a prisoner by paying a “price” or “ransom.” It is applied thus to the Lord Jesus, as having redeemed or purchased sinners by his blood as a price, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>. It is used here, however, in a more “general” sense to denote “the deliverance,” without specifying the manner.
