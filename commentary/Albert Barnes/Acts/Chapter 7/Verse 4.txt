<p style=" "><b>When his father was dead - </b>This passage has given rise to no small difficulty in the interpretation. The difficulty is this: From <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:26">Genesis 11:26</span>, it would seem that Abraham was born when Terah was 70 years of age. “And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.” From <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:4">Genesis 12:4</span>, it seems that Abraham was 75 years of age when he departed from Haran to Canaan. The age of Terah was therefore but 145 years. Yet in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:32">Genesis 11:32</span>, it is said that Terah was 205 old when he died, thus leaving 60 years of Terah’s life beyond the time when Abraham left Haran. Various modes have been proposed of explaining this difficulty:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Errors in “numbers” are more likely to occur than any other. In the “Samaritan” copy of the Pentateuch, it is said that Terah died in Haran at the age of 105 years, which would suppose that his death occurred 40 years before Abraham left Haran. But the Hebrew, Latin, Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic read it as 205 years.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It is not affirmed that Abraham was born just at the time when Terah was 70 years of age. All that the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:26">Genesis 11:26</span> proves, according to the usual meaning of similar expressions, is, that Terah was 70 years old before he had any sons, and that the three were born subsequently to that. But which was born first or what intervals intervened between their birth does not appear. Assuredly, it does not mean that all were born precisely at the time when Terah was 70 years of age. Neither does it appear that Abraham was the oldest of the three. The sons of Noah are said to have been Shem, Ham, and Japheth <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:32">Genesis 5:32</span>; yet Japheth, though mentioned last, was the oldest, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+10:21">Genesis 10:21</span>. As Abraham afterward became much the most distinguished, and as he was the father of the Jewish people, of whom Moses was writing, it was natural that he should be mentioned first if it cannot be proveD that Abraham was the oldest, as assuredly it cannot be, then there is no improbability in supposing that his birth might have occurred many years after Terah was 70 years of age.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The Jews unanimously affirm that Terah relapsed into idolatry before Abraham left Haran; and this they denominate “death,” or a moral death (Kuinoel). It is certain, therefore, that, from some cause, they were accustomed to speak of Terah as “dead” before Abraham left him. Stephen only used language which was customary among the Jews, and would employ it, doubtless, correctly, though we may not be able to see precisely how it can be reconciled with the account in Genesis.</p>
