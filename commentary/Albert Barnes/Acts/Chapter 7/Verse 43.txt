<p style=" "><b>Yea, ye took up - </b>That is, you bore, or you carried with you, for purposes of idolatrous worship.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The tabernacle - </b>This word properly means a “tent”; but it is also applied to the small tent or house in which was contained the image of the god; the shrine, box, or tent in which the idol was placed. It is customary for idolatrous nations to bear their idols about with them, enclosed in cases or boxes of various sizes, usually very small, as their idols are commonly small. Probably they were made in the shape of small “temples” or tabernacles; and such appear to have been the “silver shrines” for Diana, made at Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:24">Acts 19:24</span>. These shrines, or images, were borne with them as a species of amulet, charm, or talisman to defend them from evil. Such images the Jews seem to have carried with them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Moloch - </b>This word comes from the Hebrew word signifying “king.” This was a god of the Ammonites, to whom human sacrifices were offered. Moses in several places forbids the Israelites, under penalty of death, to dedicate their children to Moloch, by making them pass through the fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+18:21">Leviticus 18:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+20:2-5">Leviticus 20:2-5</span>. There is great probability that the Hebrews were addicted to the worship of this deity after they entered the land of Canaan. Solomon built a temple to Moloch on the Mount of Olives <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+11:7">1 Kings 11:7</span>; and Manasseh made his son pass through the fire in honor of this idol, <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Ki 21:3</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+21:6">2 Kings 21:6</span>. The image of this idol was made of brass, and his arms extended so as to embrace anyone; and when they offered children to him, they heated the statue, and when it was burning hot, they placed the child in his arms, where it was soon destroyed by heat. It is not certain what this god was supposed to represent. Some suppose it was in honor of the planet Saturn; others, the sun; others, Mercury, Venus, etc. What particular god it was is not material. It was the most cutting reproof that could be made to the Jews, that their fathers had been guilty of worshipping this idol.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the star - </b>The Hebrew in this place is, “Chiun your images, the star of your god.” The expression used here leads us to suppose that this was a star which was worshipped, but what star it is not easy to ascertain; nor is it easy to determine why it is called both “Chiun” and “Remphan.” Stephen quotes from the Septuagint translation. In that translation the word “Chiun” is rendered by the word “Raiphan,” or “Rephan,” easily changed into “Remphan.” Why the authors of that version adopted this is not known. It was probably, however, from one of two causes:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Either because the word “Chiun” in Hebrew meant the same as “Remphan” in the language of Egypt, where the translation was made; or,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Because the “object” of worship called “Chiun” in Hebrew was called “Remphan” in the language of Egypt. It is generally agreed that the object of their worship was the planet “Saturn,” or “Mars,” both of which planets were worshipped as gods of evil influence. In Arabic, the word “Chevan” denotes the planet Saturn. Probably “Rephan,” or “Remphan,” is the Coptic name for the same planet, and the Septuagint adopted this because that translation was made in Egypt, where the Coptic language was spoken.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Figures which ye made - </b>Images of the god which they made. See the article “Chiun” in Robinson’s Calmet.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I will carry you away ... - </b>This is simply expressing in few words what is stated at greater length in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+5:27">Amos 5:27</span>. In Hebrew it is “Damascus”; but this evidently denotes the Eastern region, in which also Babylon was situated.</p>
