<p style=" "><b>The tabernacle of witness - </b>The “tent” or “tabernacle” which Moses was commanded to make. It was called a tabernacle of “witness,” or of “testimony,” because it was the visible witness or proof of God’s presence with them; the evidence that he to whom it was devoted was their protector and guide. The name is given either to the “tent,” to the two tables of stone, or to the ark; all of which were “witnesses,” or “evidences” of God’s relation to them as their Lawgiver and guide, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:34">Exodus 16:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:16">Exodus 25:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:21">Exodus 25:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+27:21">Exodus 27:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:6">Exodus 30:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:36">Exodus 30:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+31:18">Exodus 31:18</span>, etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:50">Numbers 1:50</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:53">Numbers 1:53</span>. The two charges against Stephen were, that he had spoken blasphemy against Moses or his Law, and against the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13-14">Acts 6:13-14</span>. In the previous part of this defense he had shown his respect for Moses and his Law. He now proceeds to show that he did not design to speak with disrespect of the temple, or the holy places of their worship. He therefore expresses his belief in the divine appointment of both the tabernacle <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:44-46">Acts 7:44-46</span> and of the temple <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:47">Acts 7:47</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to the fashion ... - </b>According to the pattern that was shown to him, by which it was to be made, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:9">Exodus 25:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:40">Exodus 25:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+26:30">Exodus 26:30</span>. As God showed him “a pattern,” it proved that the tabernacle had his sanction. Against that Stephen did not intend to speak.</p>
