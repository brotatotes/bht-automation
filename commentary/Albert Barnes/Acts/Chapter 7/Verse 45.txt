<p style=" "><b>Our fathers that came after - </b>None of the generation that came out of Egypt were permitted to enter into the and of Canaan except Caleb and Joshua, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:22-24">Numbers 14:22-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+32:11-12">Numbers 32:11-12</span>. Hence, it is said that their fathers who “came after,” that is, after the generation when the tabernacle was built. The Greek, however, here means, properly, “which also our fathers, having “received,” brought,” etc. The sense is not materially different. Stephen means that it was not brought in by that generation, but by the next.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With Jesus - </b>This should have been rendered “with Joshua.” Jesus is the Greek mode of writing the name “Joshua.” But the Hebrew name should by all means have been retained here, as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:8">Hebrews 4:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into the possession of the Gentiles - </b>Into the land possessed by the Gentiles, that is, into the promised land then occupied by the Canaanites, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whom God ... - </b>That is, he continued to drive them out until the time of David, when they were completely expelled. Or it may mean that the tabernacle was in the possession of the Jews, and was the appointed place of worship, until the time of David, who desired to build him a temple. The Greek is ambiguous. The “connection” favors the latter interpretation.</p>
