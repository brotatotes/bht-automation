Howbeit - But. Stephen was charged with speaking against the temple. He had now shown that he had due veneration for it, by his declaring that it had been built by the command of God. But he “now” adds that God does not need such a temple. Heaven is his throne; the universe his dwelling-place; and “therefore” this temple might be destroyed. A new, glorious truth was to be revealed to mankind, that God was not “confined” in his worship to any age, or people, or nation.

This sentiment was expressed by Solomon when the temple was dedicated, 1 Kings 8:27.As saith the prophet - Isaiah 66:1-2. The place is not literally quoted, but the sense is given.
