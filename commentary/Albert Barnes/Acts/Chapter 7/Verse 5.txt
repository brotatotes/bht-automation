<p style=" "><b>And he gave him none inheritance - </b>Abraham led a wandering life; and this passage means that he did not himself receive a permanent possession or residence in that land. The only land which he owned was the field which he “purchased” of the children of Heth for a burial place, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:0">Genesis 23:0</span>: As this was obtained by “purchase,” and not by the direct gift of God, and as it was not designed for a “residence,” it is said that God gave him no “inheritance.” It is mentioned as a strong instance of his faith that he should remain there without a permanent residence himself, with only the prospect that his children, at some distant period, would inherit it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not so much as to set his foot on - </b>This is a proverbial expression, denoting in an emphatic manner that he had no land, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+2:5">Deuteronomy 2:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Would give it to him - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:15">Genesis 13:15</span>. Abraham did not himself possess all that land; and the promise is evidently equivalent to saying that it would be conferred on the family of Abraham, or the family of which he was the father, without affirming that “he” would himself personally possess it. It is true, however, that Abraham himself afterward dwelt many years in that land as his home, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:0">Genesis 13:0</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For a possession - </b>To be held as his own property.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When as yet he had no child - </b>When there was no human probability that he would have any posterity. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:2-3">Genesis 15:2-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:11-12">Genesis 18:11-12</span>. This is mentioned as a strong instance of his faith; “who against hope believed in hope,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:18">Romans 4:18</span>.</p>
