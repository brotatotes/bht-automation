<p style=" "><b>Full of the Holy Ghost - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Looked up stedfastly - </b>Fixed his eyes intently on heaven. Foreseeing his danger, and the effect his speech had produced; seeing that there was no safety in the Great Council of the nation, and no prospect of justice at their hands, he cast his eyes to heaven and sought protection there. When dangers threaten us, our hope of safety lies in heaven. When people threaten our persons, reputation, or lives, it becomes us to fix our eyes on the heavenly world; and we shall not look in vain.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And saw the glory of God - </b>This phrase is commonly used to denote the visible symbols of God. It means some magnificent representation; a splendor, or light, that is the appropriate exhibition of the presence of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>. In the case of Stephen there is every indication of a vision or supernatural representation of the heavenly objects; something in advance of mere “faith” such as dying Christians now have. What was its precise nature we have no means of ascertaining. Objects were often represented to prophets by “visions”; and probably something similar is intended here. It was such an elevation of view - such a representation of truth and of the glory of God, as to be denoted by the word “see”; though it is not to be maintained that Stephen really saw the Saviour with the bodily eye.</p>
<p style=" "><b>On the right hand of God - </b>That is, exalted to a place of honor and power in the heavens. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:25">Acts 2:25</span> note.</p>
