<p style=" "><b>And cast him out of the city - </b>This was in accordance with the usual custom. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+24:14">Leviticus 24:14</span>, it was directed to bring forth him that had cursed without the camp; and it was not usual, the Jewish writers inform us, to stone in the presence of the Sanhedrin. Though this was a popular tumult, and Stephen was condemned without the regular process of trial, yet some of the “forms” of law were observed, and he was stoned in the manner directed in the case of blasphemers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And stoned him - </b>This was the punishment appointed in the case of blasphemy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+24:16">Leviticus 24:16</span>. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:31">John 10:31</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the witnesses - </b>That is, the false witnesses who bore testimony against him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13">Acts 6:13</span>. It was directed in the Law <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+17:7">Deuteronomy 17:7</span> that the “witnesses” in the case should be first in executing the sentence of the Law. This was done to prevent false accusations by the prospect that they must be employed as executioners. After they had commenced the process of execution, all the people joined in it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+17:7">Deuteronomy 17:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+24:16">Leviticus 24:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Laid down their clothes - </b>Their “outer garments.” They were accustomed to lay these aside when they ran or worked. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>At a young man’s feet ... - </b>That is, they procured him to take care of their garments. This is mentioned solely because Saul, or Paul, afterward became so celebrated, first as a persecutor, and then an apostle. His whole heart was in this persecution of Stephen; and he himself afterward alluded to this circumstance as an evidence of his sinfulness in persecuting the Lord Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:20">Acts 22:20</span>.</p>
