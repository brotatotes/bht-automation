<p style=" "><b>Calling upon God - </b>The word God is not in the original, and should not have been in the translation. It is in none of the ancient mss. or versions. It should have been rendered, “They stoned Stephen, invoking, or calling upon, and saying, Lord Jesus,” etc. That is, he was engaged “in prayer” to the Lord Jesus. The word is used to express “prayer” in the following, among other places: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23">2 Corinthians 1:23</span>, “I call God to witness”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:17">1 Peter 1:17</span>, “And if ye call on the Father,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:21">Acts 2:21</span>, “whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:14">Acts 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12-14">Romans 10:12-14</span>. This was, therefore, an act of worship; a solemn invocation of the Lord Jesus, in the most interesting circumstances in which a man can be placed - in his dying moments. And this shows that it is right to worship the Lord Jesus, and to pray to him. For if Stephen was inspired, it settles the question. The example of an inspired man in such circumstances is a safe and correct example. If it should be said that the inspiration of Stephen cannot be made out, yet the inspiration of Luke, who has recorded it, will not be called into question. Then the following circumstances show that he, an inspired man, regarded it as right, and as a proper example to be followed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)The Spirit who inspired Luke knew what use would be made of this case. He knew that it would be used as an example, and as an evidence that it was right to worship the Lord Jesus. It is one of the cases which has been used to perpetuate the worship of the Lord Jesus in every age. If it was wrong, it is inconceivable that it should be recorded without some expression of disapprobation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)The case is strikingly similar to that recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>, where Thomas offered worship to the Lord Jesus “as his God,” without reproof. If Thomas did it in the presence of the Saviour without reproof, it was right. If Stephen did it without any expression of disapprobation from the inspired historian, it was right.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)These examples were used to encourage Christians and Christian martyrs to offer homage to Jesus Christ. Thus, Pliny, writing to the Emperor Trajan, and giving an account of the Christians in Bithynia, says that they were accustomed to meet and “sing hymns to Christ as to God” (Latriner).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)It is worthy of remark that Stephen, in his death, offered the same act of homage to Christ that Christ himself did to the Father when he died, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>. From all these considerations, it follows that the Lord Jesus is a proper object of worship; that in most solemn circumstances it is right to call upon him, to worship him, and to commit our dearest interests to his hands. If this may be done, he is divine.</p>
