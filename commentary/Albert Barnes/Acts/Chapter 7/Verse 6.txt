<p style=" "><b>And God spake on this wise - </b>In this manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:13-14">Genesis 15:13-14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His seed - </b>His posterity; his descendants.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Should sojourn - </b>This means that they would have a “temporary residence there.” The word is used in opposition to a fixed, permanent home, and is applied to travelers, or foreigners.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In a strange land - </b>In the Hebrew <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:13">Genesis 15:13</span>, “Shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs.” The land of Canaan and the land of Egypt were strange lands to them, though the obvious reference here is to the latter.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Should bring them into bondage - </b>Or, would make them slaves, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:11">Exodus 1:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And entreat them evil - </b>Would oppress or afflict them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Four hundred years - </b>This is the precise time which is mentioned by Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:13">Genesis 15:13</span>. Great perplexity has been experienced in explaining this passage, or reconciling it with other statements. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:40">Exodus 12:40</span>, it is said that their sojourning in Egypt was 430 years. Josephus (<i>Antiq.</i>, book 2, chapter 9, section 1) also says that the time in which they were in Egypt was 400 years; though in another place (<i>Antiq.</i>, book 2, chapter 15, section 2) he says that they left Egypt f 430 years after their forefather, Abraham, came to Canaan, but 215 years after Jacob removed to Egypt. Paul also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span> says that it was 430 years from the time when the promise was given to Abraham to the time when the Law was given on Mount Sinai. The Samaritan Pentateuch also says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:40">Exodus 12:40</span> that the “dwelling of the sons of Israel, and of their fathers, which they dwelt “in the land of Canaan,” and in the land of Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.”</p>
<p style=" ">The same is the version of the Septuagint. “A part” of this perplexity is removed by the fact that Stephen and Moses use, in accordance with a very common custom, “round numbers” in speaking of it, and thus speak of 400 years when the literal time was 430. The other perplexities are not so easily removed. From the account which Moses has given of the lives of certain persons, it would seem clear that the time which they spent in “Egypt” was not 400 years. From <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:8">Genesis 46:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:11">Genesis 46:11</span>, it appears that “Kohath” was born when Jacob went into Egypt. He lived 133 years, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:18">Exodus 6:18</span>. Amram, his son, and the father of Moses lived 137 years, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:20">Exodus 6:20</span>. Moses was 80 years old when he was sent to Pharaoh, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:7">Exodus 7:7</span>. The whole time thus mentioned, including the time in which the father lived after his son was born, was only 350 years. Exclusive of that, it is reasonable to suppose that the actual time of their being in Egypt could not have been but about 200 years, according to one account of Josephus. The question then is, how can these accounts be reconciled? The only satisfactory way is by supposing that the 430 years includes the whole time from the calling of Abraham to the departure from Egypt. And that this was the fact is probable from the following circumstances:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)All this period was properly the period of “promise,” not of “possession.” In this respect the wanderings of Abraham and the oppressions of Egypt came under the same general description.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)All this receives countenance from the version of the Septuagint, and from the Samaritan text, showing the manner in which the ancient Jews were accustomed to understand it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)It should be added, that difficulties of chronology are more likely to occur than any others; and it should not be deemed strange if there are perplexities of this kind found in ancient writings which we cannot explain. It is so in all ancient records; and all that is usually expected in relation to such difficulties is that we should be able to present a “probable” explanation.</p>
