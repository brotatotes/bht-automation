<p style=" "><b>And he gave him - </b>That is, God appointed or commanded this, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:9-13">Genesis 17:9-13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The covenant - </b>The word “covenant” denotes properly “a compact or agreement between two or more persons,” usually attended with seals, pledges, or sanctions. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:7">Genesis 17:7</span>, and elsewhere, it is said that God would establish his “covenant” with Abraham; that is, he made him certain definite promises, attended with pledges and seals, etc. The idea of a strict “compact” or “agreement” between God and man, as between “equal parties”; is not found in the Bible. The word is commonly used, as here, to denote “a promise on the part of God,” attended with pledges, and demanding, on the part of man, in order to avail himself of its benefits, a specified course of conduct. The “covenant” is therefore another name for denoting two things on the part of God:</p>
<p style=" "><b>The twelve patriarchs - </b>The word “patriarch” properly denotes “the father and ruler of a family.” But it is commonly applied, by way of eminence, to “the progenitors” of the Jewish race, particularly to “the twelve sons of Jacob.” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:29">Acts 2:29</span>.</p>
