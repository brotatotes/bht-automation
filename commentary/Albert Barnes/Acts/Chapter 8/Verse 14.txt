<p style=" "><b>They sent - </b>That is, the apostles “deputed” two of their number. This shows conclusively that there was no “chief” or ruler among them. They acted as being equal in authority. The reason why they sent Peter and John was probably that there would be a demand for more labor than Philip could render; a church was to be founded, and it was important that persons of experience and wisdom should be present to organize it, and to build it up. The “harvest” had occurred in Samaria, of which the Saviour spoke <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>, and it was proper that they should enter into it. In times of revival there is often more to be done than can be done by the regular servant of a people, and it is proper that he should be aided from abroad.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Peter - </b>This shows that “Peter” had no such authority and primacy as the Roman Catholics claim for him. He exercised no authority in “sending” others, but was himself “sent.” He was appointed by their united voice, instead of claiming the power himself of directing “them.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And John - </b>Peter was ardent, hold, zealous, rash; John was mild, gentle, tender, persuasive. There was wisdom in uniting them in this work, as the talents of both were needed; and the excellencies in the character of the one would compensate for the defects of the other. It is observable that the apostles sent “two” together, as the Saviour had himself done. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span>.</p>
