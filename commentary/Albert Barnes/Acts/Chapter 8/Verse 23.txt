<p style=" "><b>For I perceive - </b>That is, by the act which he had done. His offer had shown a state of mind that was wholly inconsistent with true religion. One single sin “may” as certainly show that there is no true piety as many acts of iniquity. It may be so decided, so malignant, so utterly inconsistent with just views as at once to determine what the character is. The sin of Simon was of this character. Peter here does not appear to have claimed the power of judging the “heart”; but he judged, as all other people would, by the act.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the gall - </b>This word denotes properly “bile,” or “that bitter, yellowish-green fluid that is secreted in the liver.” Hence, it means anything very bitter; and also any bad passion of the mind, as anger, malice, etc. We speak of “bitterness” of mind, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of bitterness - </b>This is a Hebraism; the usual mode of expressing the “superlative,” and means “excessive bitterness.” The phrase is used respecting idolatry <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+29:18">Deuteronomy 29:18</span>, “Lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood.” A similar expression occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span>, “Lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you.” “Sin” is thus represented as a “bitter” or poisonous thing; a tiring not only “unpleasant” in its consequences, but ruinous in its character, as a poisonous plant would be in the midst of other plants, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:19">Jeremiah 2:19</span>, “It is an evil and bitter thing that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:18">Jeremiah 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:14">Romans 3:14</span>, “Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:31">Ephesians 4:31</span>. The meaning here is, that the heart of Simon was full of dreadful, malignant sin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Bond of iniquity - </b>Or, that thou art “bound by” iniquity. That is, that it has the rule over you, and “binds” you as a captive. Sin is often thus represented as “bondage” and “captivity,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:16">Psalms 116:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+5:22">Proverbs 5:22</span>, “He shall be holden with the cords of his sins”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23-24">Romans 7:23-24</span>. These expressions prove conclusively that Simon was a stranger to religion.</p>
