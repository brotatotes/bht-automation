He did not understand how it could be applied to the Messiah; how the description of his humiliation and condemnation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:33">Acts 8:33</span> could be reconciled to the prevalent ideas of his being a prince and a conqueror. The same sentiment is expressed by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:14">Romans 10:14</span>. The circumstance, the state of mind in the eunuch, and the result, strongly remind one of the declaration in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+25:9">Psalms 25:9</span>, “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.”</p>
