The place ... - Isaiah 53:7-8.He was led ... - This quotation is taken literally from the Septuagint. It varies very little from the Hebrew. It has been almost universally understood that this place refers to the Messiah; and Philip expressly applies it to him. The word “was led” ἤχθη ēchthē implies that he was conducted by others; that he was led as a sheep is led to be killed. The general idea is that of “meekness” and “submission” when he was led to be put to death; a description that applies in a very striking manner to the Lord Jesus.To the slaughter - To be killed. The characteristic here recorded is more remarkable in sheep than in any other animal.And like a lamb dumb ... - Still, patient, unresisting.So he opened not his mouth - He did not “complain” or “murmur”; he offered no resistance, but yielded patiently to what was done by others. Compare the notes on Isaiah 53:0.
