<p style=" "><b>He was led ... - </b>This quotation is taken literally from the Septuagint. It varies very little from the Hebrew. It has been almost universally understood that this place refers to the Messiah; and Philip expressly applies it to him. The word “was led” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἤχθη</span></span> ēchthē implies that he was conducted by others; that he was led as a sheep is led to be killed. The general idea is that of “meekness” and “submission” when he was led to be put to death; a description that applies in a very striking manner to the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the slaughter - </b>To be killed. The characteristic here recorded is more remarkable in sheep than in any other animal.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And like a lamb dumb ... - </b>Still, patient, unresisting.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So he opened not his mouth - </b>He did not “complain” or “murmur”; he offered no resistance, but yielded patiently to what was done by others. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:0">Isaiah 53:0</span>.</p>
