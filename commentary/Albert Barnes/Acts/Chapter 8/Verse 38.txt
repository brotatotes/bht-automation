<p style=" "><b>And they went down both into the water - </b>This passage has been made the subject of much discussion on the subject of baptism. It has been adduced in proof of the necessity of immersion. It is not proposed to enter into that subject here (see the Editors’ Notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:6">Matthew 3:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>). It may be remarked here that the preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis, translated “into,” does not of necessity mean that they went “into” the water. Its meaning would be as well expressed by “to” or “unto,” or as we should say, “they went “to” the water,” without meaning to determine whether they went “into” it or not. Out of “twenty-six” significations which Schleusner has given the word, this is one, and one which frequently occurs: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:38">John 11:38</span>, “Jesus, therefore, groaning in himself, cometh to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis the grave” - assuredly not “into” the grave; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49">Luke 11:49</span>, “I send them prophets,” Greek, “I send to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis them prophets” - “to” them, not “into” them, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:36">1 Corinthians 14:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41">Matthew 12:41</span>, “They repented at <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis the preaching of Jonas” - not into his preaching; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:5">John 4:5</span>, “Then cometh he “to” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis a city of Samaria,” that is, “near to it,” for the context shows that he had not yet entered “into” it, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:6">Acts 7:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:8">Acts 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:4">John 21:4</span>, “Jesus stood “on” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis the shore,” that is, not “in,” but “near” the shore. These passages show:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)It is incumbent on those who maintain that “immersion” is the only valid mode of baptism to prove that this passage cannot possibly mean anything else, and that there was no other mode practiced by the apostles.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)It would still be incumbent to show that if this were the common and even the only mode then, in a warm climate, that it is indispensable that this mode should be practiced everywhere else. No such positive command can be adduced. And it follows, therefore, that it cannot be proved that immersion is the only lawful mode of baptism.
