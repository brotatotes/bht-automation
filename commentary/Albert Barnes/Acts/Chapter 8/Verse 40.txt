<p style=" "><b>But Philip was found - </b>That is, he came to Azotus, or he was not heard of until he reached Azotus. The word is often used in this sense. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+29:17">1 Chronicles 29:17</span>, margin; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+29:29">2 Chronicles 29:29</span>, margin; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:20">Genesis 2:20</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:18">Luke 17:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:10">Romans 7:10</span>. In all these places the word is used in the sense of to be, or to be present. It does not mean here that there was any miracle in the case, but that Philip, after leaving the eunuch, came to or was in Azotus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Azotus - </b>This is the Greek name of the city which by the Hebrews was called Ashdod. It was one of the cities which were not taken by Joshua, and which remained in the possession of the Philistines. It was to this place that the ark of God was sent when it was taken by the Philistines from the Israelites; and here Dagon was cast down before it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+5:2-3">1 Samuel 5:2-3</span>. Uzziah, King of Judah, broke down its wall, and built cities or watch-towers around it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+26:6">2 Chronicles 26:6</span>. It was a place of great strength and consequence. It was distant about thirty miles from Gaza. It was situated on the coast of the Mediterranean, and had a seaport, which has now entirely disappeared. The sea is now some two miles distant, and the intervening space is a desert of moving sand, which has reached the outskirts of the town (Land and the Book, Dr. Thomson, vol. ii, p. 320). Prof. Hackett (<i>Illustrations of Scripture</i>, pp. 142, 143) says of this place: “A little village called Esdud perpetuates the ancient name. Ashdod was one of the chief cities of the Philistines, but is now utterly forsaken. The prophet’s sentence has been executed upon it to the letter: ‘I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod’ <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+1:8">Amos 1:8</span>. The only marks of antiquity which I could discover were a high mound, where the old city stood, covered now with fragments of pottery; two or three cellars or cisterns that seemed to have been recently laid open; two marble columns, one prostrate in the court of a neighboring khan, and the other made into a drinking-trough; several broken pieces of columns or tablets, mostly built into a sakieh, or watering machine; and a few traces of masonry near the Jaffa road, which may have belonged to the city walls. These last are so concealed as to be found only with special pains.”</p>

<p style=" "><b>Cesarea - </b>This city was formerly called Strato’s Tower. It is situated on the coast of the Mediterranean, at the mouth of a small river, and has a fine harbor. It is 36 miles south of Acre, and about 62 miles northwest of Jerusalem, and about the same distance northeast of Azotus. The city is supposed by some to be the Hazor mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+11:1">Joshua 11:1</span>. It was rebuilt by Herod the Great, and named Caesarea in honor of Augustus Caesar. The city was dedicated to him, and was called Sebaste, the Greek word for Augustus. It was adorned with most splendid houses; and the Temple of Caesar was erected by Herod over against the mouth of the haven, in which was placed the statue of the Roman emperor. It became the seat of the Roman governor while Judea was a Roman province, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:33">Acts 23:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:6">Acts 25:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:13">Acts 25:13</span>. Philip afterward resided at this place. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:8-9">Acts 21:8-9</span>. Caesarea at present is inhabited only by jackals and beasts of prey. “Perhaps,” says Dr. Clarke, “there has not been in the history of the world an example of any city that in so short a space of time rose to such an extraordinary height of splendor as did this of Caesarea, or that exhibits a more awful contrast to its former magnificence by the present desolate appearance of its ruins. Not a single inhabitant remains. Of its gorgeous palaces and temples, enriched with the choicest works of art, scarcely a trace can be discerned. Within the space of 10 years after laying the foundation, from an obscure fortress, it became the most flourishing and celebrated city of all Syria.” Now it is in utter desolation. See Robinson’s Calmet, “Caesarea.”</p>
