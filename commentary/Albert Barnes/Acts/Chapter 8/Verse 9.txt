<p style=" "><b>But there was a certain man called Simon - </b>The fathers have written much respecting this man, and have given strange accounts of him; but nothing more is certainly known of him than is stated in this place. Rosenmuller and Kuinoel suppose him to have been a Simon mentioned by Josephus (<i>Antiq.</i>, book 20, chapter 7, section 2), who was born in Cyprus. He was a magician, and was employed by Felix to persuade Drusilla to forsake her husband Azizus, and to marry Felix. But it is not very probable that this was the same person. (See the note in Whiston’s <i>Josephus</i>.) Simon Magus was probably a “Jew” or a “Samaritan,” who had addicted himself to the arts of magic, and who was much celebrated for it. He had studied philosophy in Alexandria in Egypt (Mosheim, vol. i., pp. 113, 114, Murdock’s translation), and then lived in Samaria. After he was cut off from the hope of adding to his other powers the power of working miracles, the “fathers” say that he fell into many errors, and became the founder of the sect of the Simonians. They accused him of affirming that he came down as the “Father” in respect to the Samaritans, the “Son” in respect to the Jews, and the “Holy Spirit” in respect to the Gentiles. He did not acknowledge Christ to be the Son of God, but a rival, and pretended himself to be Christ. He rejected the Law of Moses. Many other things are affirmed of him which rest on doubtful authority. He seems to have become an enemy to Christianity, though he was willing “then” to avail himself of some of its doctrines in order to advance his own interests. The account that he came to a tragical death in Rome; that he was honored as a deity by the Roman senate; and that a statue was erected to his memory in the isle of Tiber, is now generally rejected. His end is not known. (See Calmet, art. “Simon Magus,” and Mosheim, vol. i., p. 114, note.)</p>
<p style=" "><b>Beforetime - </b>The practice of magic, or sorcery, was common at that time, and in all the ancient nations.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Used sorcery - </b>Greek: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαγεύων</span></span> mageuōn. Exercising the arts of the “Magi,” or “magicians”; hence, the name Simon “Magus.” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span>. The ancient “Magi” had their rise in Persia, and were at first addicted to the study of philosophy, astronomy, medicine, etc. This name came afterward to signify those who made use of the knowledge of these arts for the purpose of imposing on mankind - astrologers, soothsayers, necromancers, fortune-tellers, etc. Such persons pretended to predict future events by the positions of the stars, and to cure diseases by incantations, etc. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:6">Isaiah 2:6</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+1:20">Daniel 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:2">Daniel 2:2</span>. It was expressly forbidden the Jews to consult such persons on pain of death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:31">Leviticus 19:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+20:6">Leviticus 20:6</span>. In these arts Simon had been eminently successful.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And bewitched - </b>This is an unhappy translation. The Greek means merely that he “astonished” or amazed the people, or “confounded” their judgment. The idea of “bewitching” them is not in the original.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Giving out ... - </b>“Saying”; that is, boasting. It was in this way, partly, that he so confounded them. Jugglers generally impose on people just in proportion to the “extravagance” and folly of their pretensions. The same remark may be made of “quack doctors,” and of all persons who attempt to delude and impose on people.</p>
