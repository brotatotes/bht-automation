<p style=" "><b>And Saul - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>. He had been engaged be fore in persecuting the Christians, but he now sought opportunity to gratify his insatiable desire on a larger scale.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yet breathing out - </b>Not satisfied with what he had done, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>. The word breathing out is expressive often of any deep, agitating emotion, as we then breathe rapidly and violently. It is thus expressive of violent anger. The emotion is absorbing, agitating, exhausting, and demands a more rapid circulation of blood to supply the exhausted vitality; and this demands an increased supply of oxygen, or vital air, which leads to the increased action of the lungs. The word is often used in this sense in the Classics (Schleusner). It is a favorite expression with Homer. Euripides has the same expression: “Breathing out fire and slaughter.” So Theocritus: “They came unto the assembly breathing mutual slaughter” (Idyll. 22:82).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Threatening - </b>Denunciation; threatening them with every breath the action of a man violently enraged, and who was bent on vengeance. It denotes also “intense activity and energy in persecution.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Slaughter - </b>Murder. Intensely desiring to put to death as many Christians as possible. He rejoiced in their death, and joined in condemning them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10-11">Acts 26:10-11</span>. From this latter place it seems that he had been concerned in putting many of them to death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The disciples of the Lord - </b>Against Christians.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Went unto the high priest - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4">Matthew 2:4</span>. The letters were written and signed in the name and by the authority of the Sanhedrin, or written and signed in the name and by the authority of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation. The high priest did it as president of that council. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:14">Acts 9:14</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:5">Acts 22:5</span>. The high priest at that time was Theophilus, son of Ananus, who had been appointed at the feast of Pentecost, 37 a.d., by Vitellius, the Roman governor. His brother Jonathan had been removed from that office the same year (Kuinoel).</p>
