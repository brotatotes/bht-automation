<p style=" "><b>A certain disciple - </b>A Christian. Many have supposed that he was one of the 70 disciples. But nothing more is certainly known of him than is related here. He had very probably been some time a Christian <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13">Acts 9:13</span>, and had heard of Saul, but was personally a stranger to him. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:12">Acts 22:12</span>, it is said that he was a devout man according to the Law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there. There was wisdom in sending such a Christian to Saul, as it might do much to conciliate the minds of the Jews there toward him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Said the Lord - </b>The Lord Jesus is alone mentioned in all this transaction. And as he had commenced the work of converting Saul, it is evident that he is intended here. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In a vision - </b>Perhaps by a dream. The main idea is, that he revealed his will to him in the case. The word “vision” is often used in speaking of the “communications” made to the prophets, and commonly means that future events were made to pass in review before the mind, as we look upon a landscape.
