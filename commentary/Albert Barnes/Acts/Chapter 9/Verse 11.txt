<p style=" "><b>Into the street which is called Straight - </b>This street extends now from the eastern to the western gate, about three miles, crossing the whole city and suburbs in a direct line. Near the eastern gate is a house, said to be that of Judah, in which Paul lodged. There is in it a very small closet, where tradition reports that the apostle passed three days without food, until Ananias restored him to sight. Tradition also says that he had here the vision recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2">2 Corinthians 12:2</span>. There is also in this street a fountain whose water is drunk by Christians, in remembrance of what, they suppose, the same fountain produced for the baptism of Paul (Robinson, Calmet).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of Tarsus - </b>This city was the capital of Cilicia, a province of Asia Minor. It was situated on the hanks of the Cydnus River. It was distinguished for the culture of Greek philosophy and literature, so that at one time in its schools, and in the number of its learned men, it was the rival of Athens and Alexandria. In allusion to this, perhaps, Paul says that he was “born in Tarsus, a citizen of no mean city,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:39">Acts 21:39</span>. In reward for its exertions and sacrifices during the civil wars of Rome, Tarsus was made a free city by Augustus. See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:37">Acts 16:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:39">Acts 21:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:28">Acts 22:28</span>. It still exists as “Tersous,” with a population of about 20,000, but is described as “filthy and ruinous.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Behold, he prayeth - </b>This gives us a full indication of the manner in which Saul passed the three days mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:9">Acts 9:9</span>. It is plain, from what follows, that Ananias regarded Saul as an enemy to Christianity, and that he would have been apprehensive of danger if he were with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13-14">Acts 9:13-14</span>. This remark, “Behold, he prayeth,” is made to him to silence his fears, and to indicate the change in the feelings and views of Saul. Before, he was a persecutor; now, his change is indicated by his giving himself to prayer. That Saul did not pray before is not implied by this; for he fully accorded with the customs of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:4-6">Philippians 3:4-6</span>. But his prayers were not the prayers of a saint. They were the prayers of a Pharisee (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:10">Luke 18:10</span>, etc.), now they were the prayers of a broken-hearted sinner; then he prayed depending on his own righteousness, now depending on the mercy of God in the Messiah. We may learn here:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That one indication of conversion to God is real prayer. A Christian may as well be characterized by that as by any single appellation - “a man of prayer.”</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It is always the attendant of true conviction for sin that we pray. The convicted Sinner feels his danger, and his need of forgiveness. Conscious that he has no righteousness himself, he now seeks that of another, and depends on the mercy of God. Before, he was too proud to pray; now, he is willing to humble himself and to ask for mercy.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) It is a sufficient indication of the character of any man to say, “Behold, he prays.” It at once tells us, better than volumes would without this, what is his real character. Knowing this, we know all about him. We at once confide in his piety, his honesty, his humility, his willingness to do good. It is at the same time the indication of his state with God, and the pledge that he will do his duty to people. We mean, of course, real prayer. Knowing that a man is sincere, and humble, and faithful in his private devotions, and in the devotions of his family, we confide in him; and are willing to trust to his readiness to do all that he is convinced that he ought to do. Ananias, apprised of this in Saul, had full evidence of the change of his character, and was convinced that he ought to lay aside all his former prejudices, and to seek him, and to acknowledge him as a brother.</p>
