<p style=" "><b>Go thy way - </b>This is often the only answer that we obtain to the suggestion of our doubts and hesitations about duty. God tells us still to do what he requires, with an assurance only that his commands are just, and that there are good reasons for them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A chosen vessel - </b>The usual meaning of the word “vessel” is well known. It commonly denotes a “cup or basin,” such as is used in a house. It then denotes “any instrument which may be used to accomplish a purpose, perhaps particularly with the notion of conveying or communicating.” In the Scriptures it is used to denote the “instrument” or “agent” which God employs to convey his favors to mankind, and is thus employed to represent the ministers of the gospel, <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 4:7</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:5-7">Isaiah 10:5-7</span>. Paul is called “chosen” because Christ had “selected” him, as he did his other apostles, for this service. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To bear my name - </b>To communicate the knowledge of me.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before the Gentiles - </b>The nations; all who were not Jews. This was the principal employment of Paul. He spent his life in this, and regarded himself as especially called to be the apostle of the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:16">Romans 15:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:8">Galatians 2:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And kings - </b>This was fulfilled, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:23">Acts 25:23</span>, etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:32">Acts 26:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:24">Acts 27:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the children of Israel - </b>The Jews. This was done. He immediately began to preach to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:20-22">Acts 9:20-22</span>. Wherever he went, he preached the gospel first to them, and then to the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:17">Acts 28:17</span>.</p>
