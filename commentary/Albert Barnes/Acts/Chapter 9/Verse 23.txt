<p style=" "><b>And after that many days ... - </b>How long a time elapsed before this is not recorded in this place, but it is evident that the writer means to signify that a considerable time intervened. There is, therefore, an interval here which Luke has not filled up; and if this were the only narrative which we had, we should be at a loss how to understand this. From all that we know now of the usual conduct of the Jews toward the apostles, and especially toward Paul, it would seem highly improbable that this interval would be passed peaceably or quietly. Nay, it would be highly improbable that he would be allowed to remain in Damascus many days without violent persecution. Now it so happens that by turning to another part of the New Testament, we are enabled to ascertain the manner in which this interval was filled up. Turn then to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17">Galatians 1:17</span>, and we learn from Paul himself that he went into Arabia, and spent some time there, and then returned again to Damascus. The precise time which would be occupied in such a journey is not specified, but it would not be performed under a period of some months.</p>
<p style=" ">In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>, we are informed that he did not go to Jerusalem until three years after his conversion; and as there is reason to believe that he went up to Jerusalem directly after escaping from Damascus the second time <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25-26">Acts 9:25-26</span>, it seems probable that the three years were spent chiefly in Arabia. We have thus an account of the “many days” here referred to by Luke. And in this instance we have a striking example of the truth and honesty of the sacred writers. By comparing these two accounts together, we arrive at the whole state of the case. Neither seems to be complete without the other. Luke has left a chasm which he has nowhere else supplied. But that chasm we are enabled to fill up from the apostle himself, in a letter written long after, and without any design to amend or complete the history of Luke - for the introduction of this history into the Epistle to the Galatians was for a very different purpose - to show that he received his commission directly from the Lord Jesus, and in a manner independent of the other apostles.</p>
<p style=" ">The two accounts, therefore, are like the two parts of a tally; neither is complete without the other; and yet, being brought together, they so exactly fit as to show that the one is precisely adjusted to the other. And as the two parts were made by different individuals, and without design of adapting them to each other, they show that the writers had formed no collusion or agreement to impose on the world; that they are separate and independent witnesses; that they are honest men; that their narratives are true records of what actually occurred; and the two narratives constitute, therefore, a strong and very valuable proof of the correctness of the sacred narrative. If asked why Luke has not reherded a full account of this in the Acts , it may be replied that there are many circumstances and facts omitted in all histories from the necessity of the case. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:25">John 21:25</span>. It is remarkable here, not that he has not recorded this, but that he has left a chasm in his own history which can he so readily filled up.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Were fulfilled - </b>Had elapsed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Took counsel ... - </b>Laid a scheme, or designed to kilt him. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:12">Acts 23:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:3">Acts 25:3</span>. His zeal and success would enrage them, and they knew of no other way in which they could free themselves from the effects of his arguments and influence.</p>
