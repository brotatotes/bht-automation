<p style=" "><b>Took him by night ... - </b>This was done through a window in the wall, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:33">2 Corinthians 11:33</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In a basket - </b>This word is used to denote commonly “the basket in which food was carried,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:37">Matthew 15:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:8">Mark 8:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:20">Mark 8:20</span>. It was in this way that Rahab let down the spies <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:15">Joshua 2:15</span>, and so David escaped from Saul, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+19:12">1 Samuel 19:12</span>. Probably this occurred in an unguarded part of the wall, where some overhanging houses, as is usual in Eastern cities, opened into the outer country. This conduct of Saul was in accordance with the direction of the Lord Jesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span>, “When they persecute you in one city, flee ye into another,” etc. Saul was certain of death if he remained; and as he could secure his life by flight without abandoning any principle of religion, or denying his Lord, it was his duty to do so. Christianity requires us to sacrifice our lives only when we cannot avoid it without denying the Saviour, or abandoning the principles of our religion.</p>
