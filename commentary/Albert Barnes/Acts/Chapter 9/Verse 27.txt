<p style=" "><b>But Barnabas - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span>. Barnabas was of Cyprus, not far from Tarsus, and it is not improbable that he had been before acquainted with Saul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the apostles - </b>To Peter and James, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18-19">Galatians 1:18-19</span>. Probably the other apostles were at that time absent from Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And declared unto them ... - </b>It may seem remarkable that the apostles at Jerusalem had not before heard of the conversion of Saul. The following considerations may serve in some degree to explain this:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It is certain that contact between different countries was then much more difficult than it is now. There were no posts; no public conveyances; no mails; no telegraphs; nothing that corresponded with our modes of contact between one part of the world and another.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) There was at this time a state of animosity amounting to hostility subsisting between Herod and Aretas. Herod the tetrarch had married the daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia, and had put her away (Josephus, <i>Antiq.</i>, book 18, chapter 5, section 1, 2). The result of this was a long misunderstanding between them, and a war; and the effects of that war might have been to interrupt the communication very much throughout all that country.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Though the Jews at Jerusalem might have heard of the conversion of Saul, yet it was for their interest to keep it a secret, and not to mention it to Christians. But,</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Though the Christians who were there had heard of it, yet it is probable that they were not fully informed on the subject; that they had not had all the evidence of his conversion which they desired; and that they looked with suspicion on him. It was therefore proper that they should have a full statement of the evidence of his conversion; and this was made by Barnabas.</p>
