<p style=" "><b>And as he journeyed - </b>On his way, or while he was traveling. The place where this occurred is not known. Irby and Mangles say it is “outside the eastern gate.” In the Boat and Caravan it is described as about a mile from the town, and near the Christian burying-ground which belongs to the Armenians. All that we know of it is that it was near to Damascus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And suddenly - </b>Like a flash of lightning.</p>
<p style=" "><b>There shined round about him ... - </b>The language which is expressed here would be used in describing a flash of lightning. Many critics have supposed that God made use of a sudden flash to arrest Paul, and that he was thus alarmed and brought to reflection. That God might make use of such means cannot be denied. But to this supposition in this case there are some unanswerable objections:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Those who were with Saul saw the light, but did not hear the voice, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span>. This is incredible on the supposition that it was a flash of lightning near them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)It was manifestly regarded as a message to Saul. The light appeared, and the voice spake to him. The others did not even hear the address. Besides,</p>
<p style=" ">In order to understand this, it may be necessary to make the following remarks:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) God was accustomed to appear to the Jews in a cloud; in a pillar of smoke, or of fire; in that special splendor which they denominated the Shechinah. In this way he went before them into the land of Canaan, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:21-22">Exodus 13:21-22</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:5-6">Isaiah 4:5-6</span>. This appearance or visible manifestation they called the “glory of” Yahweh, is. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:1-4">Isaiah 6:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:7">Exodus 16:7</span>, “in the morning ye shall see the glory of the Lord”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:10">Acts 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+9:23">Leviticus 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:10">Numbers 14:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:19">Numbers 16:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:42">Numbers 16:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:16">Numbers 24:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:11">1 Kings 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+10:4">Ezekiel 10:4</span>. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>, “The glory of the Lord shone round about them.”</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The Lord Jesus, in his transfiguration on the mount, had been encompassed with that glory. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1-5">Matthew 17:1-5</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) He had spoken of similar glory as pertain that with which he had been invested before his incarnation, and to which he would return; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>, “And now, Father, glorify thou me with the glory which I had with thee before the world was”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span>, “The Son of Man shall come in his glory.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>. To this glory he had returned when he left the earth.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) It is a sentiment which cannot be shown to be incorrect, that the various appearances of “the angel of Yahweh,” and of Yahweh, mentioned in the Old Testament, were appearances of the Messiah the God who would be incarnate - the special protector of his people. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:1-13">Isaiah 6:1-13</span>; compare with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:41">John 12:41</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) If the Lord Jesus appeared to Saul, it would be in his appropriate glory and honor as the ascended Messiah. That he did appear is expressly affirmed.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) This was an occasion when, if ever, such an appearance was proper. The design was to convert an infuriated persecutor, and to make him an apostle. To do this, it was necessary that he should see the Lord Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1-2">1 Corinthians 9:1-2</span>. The design was further to make him an eminent instrument in carrying the gospel to the Gentiles. A signal miracle; a demonstration that he was invested with his appropriate glory <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; a calling up a new witness to the fact of his resurrection, and of his solemn investment with glory in the heavens, seemed to be required in thus calling a violent persecutor to be an apostle and friend.</p>
<p style=" ">(7) We are to regard this appearance, therefore, as the reappearance of the Shechinah, the Son of God invested with appropriate glory, appearing to convince an enemy of his ascension, and to change him from a foe to a friend.</p>
<p style=" ">It has been objected that as the Lord Jesus had ascended to heaven, it cannot be presumed that his body would return to the earth again. To this we may reply, that the New Testament has thrown no light on this. Perhaps it is not necessary to suppose that his body returned, but that he made such a visible manifestation of himself as to convince Saul that he was the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From heaven - </b>From above; from the sky. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:13">Acts 26:13</span>, Paul says that the light was above the brightness of the sun at mid-day.</p>
