<p style=" "><b>And he fell to the earth - </b>He was astonished and overcome by the sudden flash of light. There is a remarkable similarity between what occurred here, and what is recorded of Daniel in regard to the visions which he saw, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:17">Daniel 8:17</span>. Also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+10:8">Daniel 10:8</span>, “Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision; and there remained no strength in me, for my comeliness (vigor) was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength.” The effect was such as to overpower the body.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And heard a voice - </b>The whole company heard a voice <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>, but did not distinguish it as addressed particularly to Saul. He heard it speaking to himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Saying unto him ... - </b>This shows that it was not thunder, as many have supposed. It was a distinct articulation or utterance, addressing him by name.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Saul, Saul - </b>A mode of address that is emphatic. The repetition of the name would fix his attention. Thus, Jesus addresses Martha <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:41">Luke 10:41</span>, and Simon <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31">Luke 22:31</span>, and Jerusalem <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Why - </b>For what reason. Jesus had done him no injury; had given him no provocation. All the opposition of sinners to the Lord Jesus and his church is without cause. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:25">John 15:25</span>, “They hated me without a cause.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Persecutest - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11">Matthew 5:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou me? - </b>Christ and his people are one, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1-6">John 15:1-6</span>. To persecute them, therefore, was to persecute him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:45">Matthew 25:45</span>.</p>
