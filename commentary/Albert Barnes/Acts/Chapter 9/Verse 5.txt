<p style=" "><b>And he said, Who art thou, Lord? - </b>The word “Lord” here, as is frequently the case in the New Testament, means no more than “sir,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:19">John 4:19</span>. It is evident that Saul did not as yet know that this was the Lord Jesus. He heard a voice as of a man; he heard himself addressed, but by whom the words were spoken was to him unknown. In his amazement and confusion, he naturally asked who it was that was thus addressing him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the Lord said - </b>In this place the word “Lord” is used in a higher sense, to denote “the Saviour.” It is his usual appellation. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am Jesus - </b>It is clear, from this, that there was a personal appearance of the Saviour; that he was present to Saul; but in what particular form - whether seen as a man, or only appearing by the manifestation of his glory, is not affirmed. Though it was a personal appearance, however, of the Lord Jesus, designed to take the work of converting such a persecutor into his own hands, yet he designed to convert him in a natural way. He arrested his attention; he filled him with alarm at his guilt; and then he presented the truth respecting himself. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:8">Acts 22:8</span>, the expression is thus recorded: “I am Jesus of Nazareth,” etc. There is no contradiction, as Luke here records only a part of what was said; Paul afterward stated the whole. This declaration was suited especially to humble and mortify Saul. There can be no doubt that he had often blasphemed his name, and profanely derided the notion that the Messiah could come out of Nazareth. Jesus here uses, however, that very designation. “I am Jesus the Nazarene, the object of your contempt and scorn.” Yet Saul saw him now invested with special glory.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is hard ... - </b>This is evidently a proverbial expression. Kuinoel has quoted numerous places in which a similar mode of expression occurs in Greek writers. Thus, Euripides, Bacch., 791, “I, who am a frail mortal, should rather sacrifice to him who is a god, than, by giving place to anger, kick against the goads.” So Pindar, Pyth., 2:173, “It is profitable to bear willingly the assumed yoke. To kick against the goad is pernicious conduct.” So Terence, Phome., 1, 2, 27, “It is foolishness for thee to kick against a goad.” Ovid has the same idea, Tristam, ii. 15. The word translated “pricks” here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κέντρον</span></span> kentron means properly “any sharp point which will pierce or perforate,” as the sting of a bee, etc. But it commonly means an ox-goad, a sharp piece of iron stuck into the end of a stick, with which the ox is urged on. These goads among the Hebrews were made very large. Thus, Shamgar killed 600 men with one of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+3:31">Judges 3:31</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:21">1 Samuel 13:21</span>. The expression “to kick against the prick” is derived from the action of a stubborn and unyielding ox kicking against the goad. And as the ox would injure no one by it but himself; as he would gain nothing, it comes to denote “an obstinate and refractory disposition and course of conduct, resisting the authority of him who has a right to command, and opposing the leadings of Providence, to the injury of him who makes the resistance.” It denotes “rebellion against lawful authority, and thus getting into greater difficulty by attempting to oppose the commands to duty.” This is the condition of every sinner. If people wish to be happy, they should cheerfully submit to the authority of God. They should not rebel against his dealings. They should not complain against their Creator. They should not resist the claims of their consciences. By all this they only injure themselves. No man can resist God or his own conscience and be happy. People evince this temper in the following ways:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) By violating plain laws of God.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) By attempting to resist his claims.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) By refusing to do what their conscience requires.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) By attempting to free themselves from serious impressions and alarms.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) By pursuing a course of vice and wickedness against what they know to be right.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) By refusing to submit to the dealings of Providence. And,</p>
<p style=" ">(7) In any way by opposing God, and refusing to submit to his authority, and to do what is right.</p>
