<p style=" "><b>And the men which journeyed with him - </b>Why these men attended him is unknown. They might have been appointed to aid him, or they may have been travelers with whom Saul had accidentally fallen in.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Stood speechless - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span>, it is said that they all fell to the earth at the appearance of the light. But there is no contradiction. The narrative in that place refers to the immediate effect of the appearance of the light. They were immediately smitten to the ground together. This was before the voice spake to Saul, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span>. In this place <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span> the historian is speaking of what occurred after the first alarm. There is no improbability that they rose from the ground immediately, and surveyed the scene with silent amazement and alarm. The word “speechless” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐννεοὶ</span></span> enneoi properly denotes “those who are so astonished or stupefied as to be unable to speak.” In the Greek writers it means those who are deaf-mutes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hearing a voice - </b>Hearing a sound or noise. The word here rendered “voice” is thus frequently used, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:8">Genesis 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+12:18">1 Samuel 12:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+29:3-4">Psalms 29:3-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span> (Greek); <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span>, it is said, “They which were with me (Paul) saw indeed the light, and were afraid, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.” In this place, the words “heard not the voice” must be understood in the sense of “understanding the words,” of hearing the address, the distinct articulation, which Paul heard. They heard a “noise”; they were amazed and alarmed, but they did not hear the distinct words addressed to Saul. A similar instance occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28-29">John 12:28-29</span>, when the voice of God came from heaven to Jesus, “The people who stood by and heard it said it thundered.” They heard the sound, the noise; they did not distinguish the words addressed to him. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+10:7">Daniel 10:7</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:11-13">1 Kings 19:11-13</span>.</p>
