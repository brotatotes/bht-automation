<p style=" "><b>I have heard by many ... - </b>This was in the vision, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:10">Acts 9:10</span>. The passage of such a train of thoughts through the mind was perfectly natural at the command to go and search out Saul. There would instantly occur all that had been heard of his fury in persecution; and the expression here may indicate the state of a mind amazed that such a one should need his counsel, and afraid, perhaps, of entrusting himself to one thus bent on persecution. All this evidently passed in the dream or vision of Ananias, and perhaps cannot be considered as any deliberate unwillingness to go to him. It is clear, however, that such thoughts should have been banished, and that he should have gone at once to the praying Saul. When Christ commands, we should suffer no suggestion of our own thoughts, and no apprehension of our own danger, to interfere.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By many - </b>Probably many who had fled from persecution, and had taken refuge in Damascus. It is also evident <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:14">Acts 9:14</span> that Ananias had been apprised, perhaps by letters from the Christians at Jerusalem, of the purpose which Saul had in view in now going to Damascus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To thy saints - </b>Christians; called saints <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἅγιοι</span></span> hagioi because they are holy, or consecrated to God.</p>
