<p style=" "><b>And Timotheus our brother - </b>On the question as to why Paul associated others with him in his epistles, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>. There was a particular reason why Timothy should be associated with him in writing this Epistle. He was a native of the region where the church was situated <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1-3">Acts 16:1-3</span>, and had been with Paul when be preached there, and was doubtless well known to the church there; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>. It is evident, however, from the manner in which Paul mentions him here, that he did not regard him as “an apostle,” and did not wish the church at Colosse to consider him as such. It is not “Paul and Timothy, apostles of Jesus Christ,” but “Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother.” Paul is careful never to apply the term “apostle” to Timothy; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>. “Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ;” compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:1">2 Thessalonians 1:1</span>. If he had regarded Timothy as an apostle, or as having apostolic authority, it is not easy to conceive why he should not have referred to him as such in these letters to the churches. Could he have failed to see that the manner in which he referred to him was adapted to produce a very important difference in file estimate in which he and Timothy would be held by the Colossians?</p>
