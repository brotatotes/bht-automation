<p style=" "><b>Strengthened with all might - </b>This was also an object of Paul’s earnest prayer. He desired that they might be strengthened for the performance of duty; to meet temptations; and to bear up under the various trials of life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to his glorious power - </b>Not by any human means, but by the power of God. There is a manifestation of power in the spirit with which Christians are enabled to bear up under trials, which shows that it is not of human origin. It is the power which God gives them in the day of trial. This power is “glorious,” or, as it is in the Greek, it is the “power of his glory.” It is manifestly the power of the great and glorious God, and it tends to promote his glory, and to show forth his praise.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto all patience - </b>So that you may be enabled to bear all your trials without complaining. It is only the power of God that can enable us to do that.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And long-suffering - </b>Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:4">1 Corinthians 13:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With joyfulness - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>, note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span>, note. The Syriac version, Chrysostom, and a few manuscripts attach this to the following verse, and read it: “With joyfulness giving thanks to the Father,” etc. The only difference is in the pointing, and either reading makes good sense.</p>
