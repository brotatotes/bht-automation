<p style=" "><b>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness - </b>The power exerted over us in that dark kingdom to which we formerly belonged - the kingdom of Satan. The characteristic of this empire is darkness - the emblem of:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)Sin;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Error;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Misery and death.</p>
<p style=" ">Over us, by nature, these things had uncontrollable power; but now we are delivered from them, and brought to the enjoyment of the privileges of those who are connected with the kingdom of light. Darkness is often used to represent the state in which men are by nature; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79">Luke 1:79</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Rom 13:12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And hath translated us - </b>The word rendered here “translated” is often used in the sense of removing a people from one country to another; see Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. ix. 11. 1. It means, here, that they who are Christians have been transferred from one kingdom to another, as if a people were thus removed. They become subjects of a new kingdom, are under different laws, and belong to a different community. This change is made in regeneration, by which we pass from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light; from the empire of sin, ignorance, and misery, to one of holiness, knowledge, and happiness. No change, therefore, in a man’s life is so important as this; and no words can suitably express the gratitude which they should feel who are thus transferred from the empire of darkness to that of light.</p>
