<p style=" "><b>In the body of his flesh through death - </b>The death of his body, or his death in making an atonement, has been the means of producing this reconciliation. It:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Removed the obstacles to reconciliation on the part of God - vindicating his truth and justice, and maintaining the principles of his government as much as if the sinner had himself suffered the penalty of the law - thus rendering it consistent for God to indulge the benevolence of his nature in pardoning sinners; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It was the means of bringing the sinner himself to a willingness to be reconciled - furnishing the strongest possible appeal to him; leading him to reflect on the love of his Creator, and showing him his own guilt and danger. No means ever used to produce reconciliation between two alienated parties has had so much tenderness and power as those which God has adopted in the plan of salvation; and if the dying love of the Son of God fails to lead the sinner back to God, everything else will fail. The phrase “the body of his flesh” means, the body of flesh which he assumed in order to suffer in making an atonement. The reconciliation could not have been effected but by his assuming such a body, for his divine nature could not so suffer as to make atonement for sins.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To present you - </b>That is, before God. The object of the atonement was to enable him to present the redeemed to God freed from sin, and made holy in his sight. The whole work had reference to the glories of that day when the Redeemer and the redeemed will stand before God, and he shall present them to his Father as completely recovered from the ruins of the fall.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Holy - </b>Made holy, or made free from sin; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:36">Luke 20:36</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And unblameable - </b>Not that in themselves they will not be deserving of blame, or will not be unworthy, but that they will be purified from their sins. The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄμωμος</span></span> amōmos - means, properly “spotless, without blemish;” see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>, note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>, note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:4">Hebrews 9:4</span>, note.

<p style=" "><b>And unreproveable in his sight - </b>There will be none to accuse them before God; or they will be free from all accusation. The law will not accuse them - for the death of their Redeemer has done as much to honor it as their own punishment would have done; God will not accuse them - for he has freely forgiven them; their consciences will not accuse them - for their sins will all have been taken away, and they will enjoy the favor of God as if they had not sinned; holy angels will not accuse them - for they will welcome them to their society; and even Satan will not accuse them, for he will have seen that their piety is sincere, and that they are truly what they profess to be; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33-34">Romans 8:33-34</span>.</p>
