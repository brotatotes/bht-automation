<p style=" "><b>If ye continue in the faith - </b>In the belief of the gospel, and in holy living. If this were done, they would be presented unblameable be fore God; if not, they would not be. The meaning is, that it will be impossible to be saved unless we continue to lead lives becoming the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Grounded - </b>On a firm foundation; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>, where the same word occurs.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And settled - </b>Greek, “firm;” as a building is that is founded on a rock; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:25">Matthew 7:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And be not moved away from the hope of the gospel - </b>By the arts of philosophy, and the allurements of sin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which was preached to every creature which is under heaven - </b>It cannot be supposed that it was literally true that every creature under heaven had actually heard the gospel. But this may mean:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That it was designed to be preached to every creature, or that the commission to make it known embraced everyone, and that, so far as the provisions of the gospel are concerned, it may be said that it was a system proclaimed to all mankind; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>. If a vast army, or the inhabitants of a distant province, were in rebellion against a government, and a proclamation of pardon were issued, it would not be improper to say that it was made to every one of them, though, as a matter of fact, it might not be true that everyone in the remote parts of the army or province had actually heard of it.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The gospel in the time of Paul seems to have been so extensively preached, that it might be said that it was proclaimed to everybody. All known countries appear to have been visited; and so zealous and laborious had been the heralds of salvation, that it might be said that the message had been proclaimed to all the world; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:14">Matthew 24:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whereof I Paul am made a minister - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1-7">Ephesians 3:1-7</span>. Paul here pursues the same train of thought which he does in the Epistle to the Ephesians, where, having shown the exalted nature of the Redeemer, and the design of the gospel, he adverts to his own labors and sufferings in making it known. The object seems to be to show that he regarded it as the highest honor to be thus intrusted with the message of mercy to mankind, and considered it as a privilege to suffer in that cause.</p>
