<p style=" "><b>To whom - </b>To the saints.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God would make known - </b>“Willed (Greek) to make known;” that is, he was pleased to make this known. It was concealed in his bosom until he chose to reveal it to his apostles. It was a doctrine which the Jewish people did not understand; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5-6">Ephesians 3:5-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>What is the riches of the glory of this mystery - </b>The rich glory of this great, long-concealed truth. On the use of the word “riches,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>. It is a favorite word with the apostle Paul to denote that which is valuable, or that which abounds. The meaning here is, that the truth that the gospel was to be preached to all mankind, was a truth abounding in glory.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Among the Gentiles - </b>That is, the glory of this truth is manifested by the effects which it has produced among the Gentiles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is Christ in you, the hope of glory - </b>Or, Christ among you. Margin. The meaning is, that the whole of that truth, so full of glory, and so rich and elevated in its effect, is summed up in this - that Christ is revealed among you as the source of the hope of glory in a better world. This was the great truth which so animated the heart and fired the zeal of the apostle Paul. The wonderful announcement had burst on his mind like a flood of day, that the offer of salvation was not to be confined, as he had once supposed, to the Jewish people, but that all men were now placed on a level; that they had a common Saviour; that the same heaven was now opened for all, and that there were none so degraded and vile that they might not have the offer of life as well as others. This great truth Paul burned to communicate to the whole world; and for holding it, and in making it known, he had involved himself in all the difficulties which he had with his own countrymen; had suffered from want, and peril, and toil; and had finally been made a captive, and was expecting to be put to death. It was just such a truth as was fitted to fire such a mind as that of Paul, and to make it; known as worth all the sacrifices and toils which he endured. Life is well sacrificed in making known such a doctrine to the world.</p>
