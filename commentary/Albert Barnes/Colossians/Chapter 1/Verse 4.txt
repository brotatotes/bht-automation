<p style=" "><b>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus - </b>To wit, by Epaphras, who had informed Paul of the steadfastness of their faith and love; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7-8">Colossians 1:7-8</span>. This does not prove that Paul had never been at Colossae, or that he did not establish the church there, for he uses a similar expression respecting the church at Ephesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:15">Ephesians 1:15</span>, of which he was undoubtedly the founder. The meaning is, that he had heard of their faith at that time, or of their perseverance in faith and love.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which ye have to all the saints - </b>In what way they had manifested this is not known. It would seem that Paul had been informed that this was a character of their piety, that they had remarkable love for all who bore the Christian name. Nothing could be more acceptable information respecting them to one who himself so ardently loved the church; and nothing could have furnished better evidence that they were influenced by the true spirit of religion; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14">1 John 3:14</span>.</p>
