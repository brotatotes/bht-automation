<p style=" "><b>Which is come unto you - </b>It has not been confined to the Jews, or limited to the narrow country where it was first preached, but has been sent abroad to the Gentile world. The object of the apostle here seems to be, to excite in them a sense of gratitude that the gospel had been sent to them. It was owing entirely to the goodness of God in sending them the gospel, that they had this hope of eternal life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As it is in all the world - </b>It is confined to no place or people, but is designed to be a universal religion. It offers the same blessedness in heaven to all; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And bringing forth fruit - </b>The fruits of righteousness or good living; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>. The meaning is, that the gospel was not without effect wherever it was preached. The same results were observable everywhere else as in Colossae, that it produced most salutary influences on the hearts and lives of those who received it. On the nature of the “fruits” of religion, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22-23">Galatians 5:22-23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Since the day ye heard of it - </b>It has constantly been producing these fruits since you first heard it preached.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And knew the grace of God in truth - </b>Since the time ye knew the true grace of God; since you became acquainted with the real benevolence which God has manifested in the gospel. The meaning is, that ever since they had heard the gospel it had been producing among them abundantly its appropriate fruit, and that the same thing had also characterized it wherever it had been dispensed.</p>
