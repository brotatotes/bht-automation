He offered a similar prayer in behalf of the Ephesians; see the parallel place in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17-19">Ephesians 1:17-19</span>, and the notes at those verses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In all wisdom - </b>That you may be truly wise in all things; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And spiritual understanding - </b>In understanding those things that pertain to the “Spirit;” that is, those things taught by the Holy Spirit, and those which he produces in the work of salvation; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:12-13">1 Corinthians 2:12-13</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:20">1 John 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>.</p>
