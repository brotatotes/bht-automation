<p style=" "><b>For I would that ye knew - </b>I wish you knew or fully understood. He supposes that this would deeply affect them if they understood the solicitude which he had had on their account.</p>
<p style=" "><b>What great conflict - </b>Margin, fear, or care. The Greek word is “agony” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀγῶνα</span></span> agōna. It is not, however, the word rendered “agony” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:44">Luke 22:44</span> - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀγωνία</span></span> agōnia - though that is derived from this. The word is rendered conflict in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:30">Philippians 1:30</span>; contention, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>; fight, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>; and race, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>. It properly refers to the combats, contests, struggles, efforts at the public games; the toil and conflict to obtain a victory. It refers here to the anxious care, the mental conflict, the earnest solicitude which he had in their behalf, in view of the dangers to which they were exposed from Judaizing Christians and Pagan philosophy. This mental struggle resembled that which the combatants had at the public games; compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>, note, 27, note. And for them at Laodicea For Christians there, who were exposed to similar danger. Laodicea was the capital of Phrygia, in Asia Minor, and a little south of Colossae. See Introduction, Section 1. 6. Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>. There was a church early planted there - the “lukewarm” church mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>. Being in the vicinity of Colossae, the church there would be exposed to the same perils, and the rebuke in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>, showed that the fears of Paul were well founded, and that the arts of the false teachers were too successful.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh - </b>That is, evidently in that region. He had, doubtless, a general solicitude for all Christians, but his remark here has reference to those in the neighborhood of the church at Colossae, or in that church. On the question which has been raised, whether this proves that the apostle Paul had never been at Colossae or Laodicea, see Introduction, Section 2, 4. This passage does not seem to me to prove that he had not been there. It may mean that he had great solicitude for those Christians there whom he knew, and for all others there, or in the vicinity, even though he was not personally acquainted with them. He may refer:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) To some churches in the neighborhood formed since he was there; or.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) To strangers who had come in there since he was with them; or.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) To those who had been converted since he was there, and with whom he had no personal acquaintance. For all these he would feel the same solicitude, for they were all exposed to the same danger. To “see one’s face in the flesh,” is a Hebraism, meaning to become personally acquainted with him.</p>
