<p style=" "><b>In whom - </b>In connection with whom, or in virtue of whose religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye are circumcised - </b>You have received that which was designed to be represented by circumcision - the putting away of sin; Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With the circumcision made without hands - </b>That made in the heart by the renunciation of all sin. The Jewish teachers insisted on the necessity of the literal circumcision in order to salvation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11">Ephesians 2:11</span>); and hence, this subject is so often introduced into the writings of Paul, and he is at so much pains to show that, by believing in Christ, all was obtained which was required in order to salvation. Circumcision was an ordinance by which it was denoted that all sin was to be cut off or renounced, and that he who was circumcised was to be devoted to God and to a holy life. All this, the apostle says, was obtained by the gospel; and, consequently they had all that was denoted by the ancient rite of circumcision. What Christians had obtained, moreover, related to the heart; it was not a mere ordinance pertaining to the flesh.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In putting off the body of the sins of the flesh - </b>That is, in renouncing the deeds of the flesh, or becoming holy. The word “body,” here, seems to be used with reference to circumcision. In that ordinance, the body of the FLesH was subjected to the rite; with Christians, it is the body of Sin that is cut off.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the circumcision of Christ - </b>Not by the fact that Christ was circumcised, but that we have that kind of circumcision which Christ established, to wit, the renouncing of sin. The idea of the apostle here seems to be, that since we have thus been enabled by Christ to renounce sin, and to devote ourselves to God, we should not, be induced by any plausible arguments to return to an ordinance pertaining to the flesh, as if that were needful for salvation.</p>
