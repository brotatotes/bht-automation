<p style=" "><b>In whom - </b>Margin, “wherein.” The more correct translation is “in whom.” The reference is doubtless to Christ, as his name is the immediate antecedent, and as what is affirmed here properly appertains to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are hid - </b>Like treasures that are concealed or garnered up. It does not mean that none of those “treasures” had been developed; but that, so to speak, Christ, as Mediator, was the great treasure-house where were to be found all the wisdom and knowledge needful for people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All the treasures - </b>It is common to compare any thing valuable with “treasures” of silver or gold. The idea here is, that in reference to the wisdom and knowledge needful for us, Christ is what abundant treasures are in reference to the supply of our wants.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Wisdom - </b>The wisdom needful for our salvation. Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And knowledge - </b>The knowledge which is requisite to guide us in the way to life. Christ is able to instruct us in all that it is desirable for us to know, so that it is not necessary for us to apply to philosophy, or to the teachings of human beings.</p>
