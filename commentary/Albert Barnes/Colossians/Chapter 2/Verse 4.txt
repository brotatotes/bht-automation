<p style=" "><b>And this I say - </b>Respecting the character and sufficiency of the truth revealed in Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lest any man should beguile you - </b>Deceive you, lead you away from the truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With enticing words - </b>Artful words, smooth and plausible arguments; such as were employed by the Greek sophists and rhetoricians.</p>
