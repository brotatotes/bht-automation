<p style=" "><b>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit - </b>That is, I seem to see you; I feel as if I were there, and were looking upon you; and I have the same solicitude as if I were there, and saw all the danger which exists that your beautiful order and harmony should be disturbed by the influence of false philosophy; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:3">1 Corinthians 5:3</span>. The word “spirit,” here, does not refer to the Holy Spirit, or to any inspiration by which the apostle was enabled to see them; but it is equivalent to what we mean when we say, “My heart is with you.” He seemed to be beholding them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Joying and beholding your order - </b>That is, I rejoice as if I saw your order. He had such confidence that everything would be done among them as became Christians, that he could rejoice as if he actually saw it.</p>
