<p style=" "><b>Forbearing one another - </b>Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And forgiving one another - </b>Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If any man have a quarrel against any - </b>Margin, “or complaint.” The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μομφή</span></span> momphē - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, “fault found, blame, censure;” and here denotes occasion of complaint. The idea is, that if another one has given us just occasion of complaint, we are to forgive him; that is, we are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)To harbor no malice against him;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)We are to be ready to do him good as if he had not given us occasion of complaint;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)We are to be willing to declare that we forgive him when be asks it; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)We are always afterward to treat him as kindly as if he had not injured us - as God treats us when he forgives us; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:21">Matthew 18:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye - </b>Learn here that Christ has power to forgive sin; compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:6">Matthew 9:6</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span> note. Christ forgave us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)Freely - he did not hesitate or delay when we asked him;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Entirely - he pardoned all our offences;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Forever - he did it so as to remember our sins no more, and to treat us ever onward as if we had not sinned.</p>
<p style=" ">So we should forgive an offending brother.</p>
