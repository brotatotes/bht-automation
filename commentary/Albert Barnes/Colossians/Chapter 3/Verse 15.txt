<p style=" "><b>And let the peace of God - </b>The peace which God gives; Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rule in your hearts - </b>Preside in your hearts; sit as umpire there (Doddridge); govern and control you. The word rendered here “rule” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραβεύετω</span></span> brabeuetō - is commonly used in reference to the Olympic and other games. It means, to be a director, or arbiter of the public games; to preside over them and preserve order, and to distribute the prizes to the victors. The meaning here is, that the peace which God gives to the soul is to be to us what the brabeutes, or governor at the games was to those who contended there. It is to preside over and govern the mind; to preserve every thing in its place; and to save it from tumult, disorder, and irregularity. The thought is a very beautiful one. The soul is liable to the agitations of passion and excitement - like an assembled multitude of men. It needs something to preside over it, and keep its various faculties in place and order; and nothing is so well fitted to do this as the calm peace which religion gives, a deep sense of the presence of God, the desire and the evidence of his friendship, the hope of his favor, and the belief that he has forgiven all our sins. The “peace of God” will thus calm down every agitated element of the soul; subdue the tumult of passion, and preserve the mind in healthful action and order - as a ruler sways and controls the passions of assembled multitudes of people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the which ye are also called - </b>To which peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In one body - </b>To be one body; or to be united as one; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4-6">Ephesians 4:4-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And be ye thankful - </b>For all mercies, and especially for your privileges and hopes as Christians. A spirit of thankfulness, also, would tend much to promote harmony and peace. An ungrateful people is commonly a tumultuous, agitated, restless, and dissatisfied people. Nothing better tends to promote peace and order than gratitude to God for his mercies.</p>
