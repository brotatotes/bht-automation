<p style=" "><b>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed - </b>Whatever ye say or do - whether relating to temporal affairs or to religion. The command here extends to all that we do.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Do all in the name of the Lord Jesus - </b>Do it all because he requires and commands it, and with a desire to honor him. His authority should be the warrant; his glory the aim of all our actions and words. See the general sentiment here expressed, fully illustrated in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:31">1 Corinthians 10:31</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Giving thanks to God and the Father by him - </b>Through him; or in his name. All our actions are to be accompanied with thanksgiving; Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:6">Philippians 4:6</span>. We are to engage in every duty, not only in the name of Christ, but with thankfulness for strength and reason; for the privilege of acting so that we may honor him; and with a grateful remembrance of the mercy of God that gave us such a Saviour to be an example and guide. He is most likely to do his duty well who goes to it with a heart overflowing with gratitude to God for his mercies, and he who is likely to perform his duties with the most cheerful fidelity, is he who has the deepest sense of the divine goodness in providing a Saviour for his lost and ruined soul; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14-15">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</span>.</p>
