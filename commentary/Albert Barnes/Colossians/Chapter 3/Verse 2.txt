<p style=" "><b>Set your affection - </b>Margin, “or mind.” Greek” think of” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονεῖτε</span></span> phroneite. The thoughts should be occupied about the things where Christ now dwells, where our final home is to be, where our great interests are. Since we are raised from the death of sin, and are made to live anew, the great object of our contemplation should be the heavenly world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not on things on the earth - </b>Wealth, honor, pleasure. Our affections should not be fixed on houses and lands; on scenes of fashion and gaiety; on low and debasing enjoyments.</p>
