Mortify therefore your members - Since you are dead to sin and the world, and are to appear with Christ in the glories of his kingdom, subdue every carnal and evil propensity of your nature. The word mortify means to put to death (Romans 8:13, note; Galatians 5:24, note), and the meaning here is that they were entirely to subdue their evil propensities, so that they would have no remains of life; that is, they were not at all to indulge them. The word “members” here, refers to the different members of the body - as the seat of evil desires and passions; compare the notes at Romans 6:13. They were wholly to extirpate those evil passions which he specifies as having their seat in the various members of the earthly body.Fornication - Notes, Romans 1:2.Uncleanness - Notes, Romans 1:24.Inordinate affection - πάθος pathos. Rendered in Romans 1:26, “vile affections;” see the notes at that verse. In 1 Thessalonians 4:5, the word is rendered “lust” - which is its meaning here.Evil concupiscence - Evil desires; licentious passions; Romans 1:24. Greek.And covetousness, which is idolatry - It is remarkable that the apostle always ranks covetousness with these base and detestable passions. The meaning here is:(1) That it is a low and debasing passion, like those which he had specified; and,(2) That it secures the affections which properly belong to God, and is, therefore, idolatry. Of all base passions, this is the one that most dethrones God from the soul. See this whole passage more fully explained in the notes at Ephesians 5:3-5.
