<p style=" "><b>And Jesus, who is called Justus - </b>The name Jesus was probably that which he bore among the Jews. Justus is a Roman name, and was probably that by which he was known among the Romans. It was not uncommon thus to assume another name when one went among a foreign people; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who are of the circumcision - </b>Jews, or Jewish Christians. Nothing more is known of Justus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>These only are my fellow-workers unto the kingdom of God - </b>The word “only” here, probably refers to the fact that they only of all the Jews who were at Rome assisted Paul in his work. Epaphras and Luke were also with him at Rome, and doubtless aided him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which have been a comfort unto me - </b>The more so because they were Jews. The other Jews in Rome stood aloof, and doubtless endeavored to augment the trials of the apostle; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:23-29">Acts 28:23-29</span>.</p>
