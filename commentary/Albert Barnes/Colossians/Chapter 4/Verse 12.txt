<p style=" "><b>Always laboring fervently for you in prayers - </b>Margin, “or striving.” Greek: “agonizing.” The word denotes the intense desire which he had for their salvation; his fervent, earnest pleading for their welfare.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye may stand perfect and complete - </b>Margin, as in Greek, filled. The desire was, that they might maintain their Christian principles unadulterated by the mixture of philosophy and error, and completely perform the will of God in every respect. This is the expression of a pious wish in regard to them, without any affirmation that any had been absolutely perfect, or that they would be perfect in this world. It is, however, a command of God that we should be perfect (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span>), and it is the highest wish of benevolence in reference to anyone that he may be complete in moral character, and may do all the will of God; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:9">1 Corinthians 13:9</span>.</p>
