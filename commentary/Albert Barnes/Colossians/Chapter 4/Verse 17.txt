<p style=" "><b>And say to Archippus - </b>Archippus is mentioned also in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span>. He is not elsewhere referred to in the New Testament, and nothing further is known of him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Take heed to the ministry ... - </b>The Greek here is, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὴν διακονίαν</span></span> tēn diakonian - meaning the office of ministering in divine things; but it is not certain precisely what office he held there. It seems probable from the language which the apostle applies to him - “the ministry” - (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:17">Acts 1:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:19">Acts 21:19</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Rom 11:13</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7-9">2 Corinthians 3:7-9</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 4:1</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:3">2 Corinthians 6:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:12">Ephesians 4:12</span>), that he was not a deacon, properly so called, but that he was a preacher of the word. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span>, he is mentioned by Paul as his “fellow-soldier,” and it is evident that the apostle meant to speak of him with honor. There is no evidence, as has been supposed by some, that he intended to imply, by what he said, that he had been remiss in the performance of his duties, but the apostle doubtless meant to encourage him and to excite him to increased ardor and zeal in the work of the Lord; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>. It is always proper to caution even the most faithful and self-denying servants of the Lord to “take heed,” or see to it, that they perform their duties with fidelity. The office of the ministry is such, and the temptations to unfaithfulness are so great, that we need constant watchfulness.</p>
