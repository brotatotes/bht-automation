<p style=" "><b>The salutation by the hand of me Paul - </b>Probably the rest of the Epistle was written by an amanuensis. As was his custom, Paul affixed his own hand to it in the form of a salutation; compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Remember my bonds - </b>Also evidently written by his own hand, to make the injunction more impressive; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:3">Hebrews 13:3</span>. The meaning is, that they should not forget him in his confinement. They should remember that he was suffering on their account (Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>), and that he was entitled to every expression of sympathy and love.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Grace be with you - </b>Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The subscription to this Epistle is undoubtedly correct. See the Introduction.</p>
