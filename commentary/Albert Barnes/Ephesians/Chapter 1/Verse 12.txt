That we should be to the praise of his glory - Should be the occasion or the means of celebrating his glory; or that praise should be ascribed to him as the result of our salvation.Who first trusted in Christ - Margin, “hoped.” This is in accordance with the original. The foundation of their “hope” was the Saviour. Some suppose that the apostle here refers to the Jews who were converted before the gospel was preached extensively to the Gentiles. The reason for this opinion is, that in the following verse he contrasts those to whom he here refers with others whom he was addressing. But it may be that by the word “we” in Ephesians 1:11-12, he refers to himself and to his fellow-laborers who had “first” hoped in the Saviour, and had then gone and proclaimed the message to others; see the notes on Ephesians 1:11. They “first” believed, and then preached to others; and they also believed, and became partakers of the same privileges.
