<p style=" "><b>Which is the earnest of our inheritance - </b>On the meaning of this, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Until the redemption - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>. The meaning here is, we have the Holy Spirit as the pledge that that shall be ours, and the Holy Spirit will be imparted to us until we enter on that inheritance.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the purchased possession - </b>Heaven, purchased for us by the death of the Redeemer. The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιποίησις</span></span> peripoiēsis - occurs in the following places in the New Testament: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span>, rendered “to obtain salvation;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:14">2 Thessalonians 2:14</span>, “to the obtaining of the glory of the Lord;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:39">Hebrews 10:39</span>, “to the saving of the soul;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, “a peculiar people;” literally, a people of “acquirement” to himself; and in the passage before us. It properly means, an acquisition, an obtaining, a laying up. Here it means, the complete deliverance from sin, and the eternal salvation “acquired” for us by Christ. The influence of the Holy Spirit, renewing and sanctifying us, comforting us in trials, and sustaining us in afflictions, is the pledge that the redemption is yet to be wholly ours.</p>
