It was imparting life to a cold and “mangled” frame. It was to open again the arteries and veins, and teach the heart to beat and the lungs to heave. It was to diffuse vital warmth through the rigid muscles, and to communicate to the body the active functions of life. It is impossible to conceive of a more direct exertion of “power” than in raising up the dead; and there is no more striking illustration of the nature of conversion than in such a resurrection.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And set him at his own right hand - </b>The idea is, that great power was displayed by this, and that a similar exhibition is made when man is renewed and exalted to the high honor of being made an heir of God. On the fact that Jesus was received to the right hand of God, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span>; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33">Acts 2:33</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the heavenly places - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>. The phrase here evidently means in heaven itself.</p>
