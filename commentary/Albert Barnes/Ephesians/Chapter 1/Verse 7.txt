<p style=" "><b>In whom we have redemption - </b>On the meaning of the word here rendered “redemption” - (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀπολύτρωσις</span></span> apolutrōsis) - see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>. The word here, as there, denotes that deliverance from sin and from the evil consequences of sin, which has been procured by the atonement made by the Lord Jesus Christ. This verse is one of the passages which prove conclusively that the apostle here does not refer to “nations” and to “national privileges.” Of what “nation” could it be said that it had “redemption through the blood of Jesus, even the forgiveness of sins?”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through his blood - </b>By means of the atonement which he has made; see this phrase fully explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The forgiveness of sins - </b>We obtain through his blood, or through the atonement which he has made, the forgiveness of sins. We are not to suppose that this is all the benefit which we receive from his death, or that this is all that constitutes redemption. It is the main, and perhaps the most important thing. But we also obtain the hope of heaven, the influences of the Holy Spirit, grace to guide us and to support us in trial, peace in death, and perhaps many more benefits. Still “forgiveness” is so prominent and important, that the apostle has mentioned that as if it were all.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to the riches of his grace - </b>According to his rich grace; see a similar phrase explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>. The word “riches,” in the form in which it is used here, occurs also in several other places in this Epistle; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>. It is what Paley (Horae Paul) calls “a cant phrase,” and occurs often in the writings of Paul; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:23">Romans 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:12">Romans 11:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:19">Philippians 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>. It is not found in any of the other writings of the New Testament, except once in a sense somewhat similar, in James <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:5">James 2:5</span>, “Hath not God chosen the poor of this world “rich” in faith,” and Dr. Paley from this fact has constructed an argument to prove that this Epistle was written by Paul. It is unique to him, and marks his style in a manner which cannot be mistaken. An impostor, or a forger of the Epistle, would not have thought of introducing it, and yet it is just such a phrase as would naturally be used by Paul.</p>
