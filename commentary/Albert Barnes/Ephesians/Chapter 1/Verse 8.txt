<p style=" "><b>Wherein he hath abounded - </b>Which he has liberally manifested to us This grace has not been stinted and confined, but has been liberal and abundant.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In all wisdom - </b>That is, he has evinced great wisdom in the plan of salvation; wisdom in so saving people as to secure the honor of his own law, and in devising a scheme that was eminently adapted to save people; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And prudence - </b>The word used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονήσις</span></span> phronēsis) means understanding, thinking, prudence. The meaning here is, that, so to speak, God had evinced great “intelligence” in the plan of salvation. There was ample proof of “mind” and of “thought.” It was adapted to the end in view. It was far-seeing; skillfully arranged; and carefully formed. The sense of the whole is, that there was a wise design running through the whole plan, and abounding in it in an eminent degree.</p>
