<p style=" "><b>And you hath he quickened - </b>The words “hath he quickened,” or “made to live,” are supplied, but not improperly, by our translators. The object of the apostle is to show the great power which God had evinced toward the people <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>; and to show that this was put forth in connection with the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and his exaltation to the right hand of God in heaven; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4-11">Romans 6:4-11</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12-13">Colossians 2:12-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>. The words “hath he quickened” mean, hath he made alive, or made to live; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Rom 4:17</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36">1 Corinthians 15:36</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who were dead in trespasses and sins - </b>On the meaning of the word “dead,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2">Romans 6:2</span>, note. It is affirmed here of those to whom Paul wrote at Ephesus, that before they were converted, they were “dead in sins.” There is not anywhere a more explicit proof of depravity than this, and no stronger language can be used. They were “dead” in relation to that to which they afterward became alive - i. e., to holiness. Of course, this does not mean that they were in all respects dead. It does not mean that they had no animal life, or that they did not breathe, and walk, and act. Nor can it mean that they had no living intellect or mental powers, which would not have been true. Nor does it settle any question as to their ability or power while in that state. It simply affirms a fact - that in relation to real spiritual life they were, in consequence of sin, like a dead man in regard to the objects which are around him.</p>
<p style=" ">A corpse is insensible. It sees not, and hears not, and feels not. The sound of music, and the voice of friendship and of alarm, do not arouse it. The rose and the lily breathe forth their fragrance around it, but the corpse perceives it not. The world is busy and active around it, but it is unconscious of it all. It sees no beauty in the landscape; hears not the voice of a friend; looks not upon the glorious sun and stars; and is unaffected by the running stream and the rolling ocean. So with the sinner in regard to the spiritual and eternal world. He sees no beauty in religion; he hears not the call of God; he is unaffected by the dying love of the Saviour; and he has no interest in eternal realities. In all these he feels no more concern, and sees no more beauty, than a dead man does in the world around him. Such is, in “fact,” the condition of a sinful world. There is, indeed, life, and energy, and motion. There are vast plans and projects, and the world is intensely active. But in regard to religion, all is dead. The sinner sees no beauty there; and no human power can arouse him to act for God, anymore than human power can rouse the sleeping dead, or open the sightless eyeballs on the light of day. The same power is needed in the conversion of a sinner which is needed in raising the dead; and one and the other alike demonstrate the omnipotence of him who can do it. </p>
