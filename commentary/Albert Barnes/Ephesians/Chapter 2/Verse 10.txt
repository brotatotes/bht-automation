<p style=" "><b>For we are his workmanship - </b>We are his “making” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποίημα</span></span> poiēma. That is, we are “created or formed” by him, not only in the general sense in which all things are made by him, but in that special sense which is denoted by the new creation; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>. Whatever of peace, or hope, or purity we have, has been produced by his agency on the soul. There cannot be conceived to be a stronger expression to denote the agency of God in the conversion of people, or the fact that salvation is wholly of grace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Created in Christ Jesus - </b>On the word “created,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto good works - </b>With reference to a holy life; or, the design for which we have been created in Christ is, that we should lead a holy life. The primary object was not to bring us to heaven. It was that we should be “holy.” Paul held perhaps more firmly than any other man, to the position that people are saved by the mere grace of God, and by a divine agency on the soul; but it is certain that no man ever held more firmly that people must lead holy lives, or they could have no evidence that they were the children of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which God hath before ordained - </b>Margin, “prepared.” The word here used means to “prepare beforehand,” then to predestinate, or appoint before. The proper meaning of this passage is, “to which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οἷς</span></span> hois good works God has predestinated us, or appointed us beforehand, that we should walk in them.” The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προετοιμάζω</span></span> proetoimazō - occurs in the New Testament nowhere else except in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:23">Romans 9:23</span>, where it is rendered “had afore prepared.” It involves the idea of a previous determination, or an arrangement beforehand for securing a certain result. The previous preparation here referred to was, the divine intention; and the meaning is, that God had predetermined that we should lead holy lives. It accords, therefore, with the declaration in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>, that he had chosen his people before the foundation of the world that they should be holy: see the notes at that verse.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That we should walk in them - </b>That we should live holy lives. The word “walk” is often used in the Scriptures to denote the course of life; notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>.</p>
