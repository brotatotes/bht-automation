But now, in Christ Jesus - By the coming and atonement of the Lord Jesus, and by the gospel which he preached.Ye who sometimes were afar off - Who were “formerly” - ποτὲ pote Tyndale translates it, “a whyle agoo.” The phrase “afar off” - μακρὰν makran - means that they were formerly far off from God and his people. The expression is derived from the custom of speaking among the Hebrews. God was supposed to reside in the temple. It was a privilege to be near the temple. Those who were remote from Jerusalem and the temple were regarded as far off from God, and hence as especially irreligious and wicked; see the notes at Isaiah 57:19.Are made nigh - Are admitted to the favor of God, and permitted to approach him as his worshippers.By the blood of Christ - The Jews came near to the mercy seat on which the symbol of the divine presence rested (the notes at Romans 3:25), by the blood that was offered in sacrifice; that is, the high priest approached that mercy-seat with blood and sprinkled it before God. Now we are permitted to approach him with the blood of the atonement. The shedding of that blood has prepared the way by which Gentiles as well as Jews may approach God, and it is by that offering that we are led to seek God.
