<p style=" "><b>And that he might reconcile both unto God - </b>This was another of the effects of the work of redemption, and indeed the main effect. It was not merely to make them harmonious, but it was that both, who had been alienated from God, should be reconciled to “him.” This was a different effect from that of producing peace between themselves, though in some sense the one grew out of the other. They who are reconciled to God will be at peace with each other. They will feel that they are of the same family, and are all brethren. On the subject of reconciliation, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In one body - </b>One spiritual personage - the church; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the cross - </b>By the atonement which he made on the cross; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>. It is by the atonement only that men ever become reconciled to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having slain the enmity - </b>Not only the enmity between Jews and Gentiles, but the enmity between the sinner and God. He has by that death removed all the obstacles to reconciliation on the part of God and on the part of man. It is made efficacious in removing the enmity of the sinner against God, and producing peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thereby - </b>Margin, “in himself.” The meaning is, in his cross, or by means of his cross.</p>
