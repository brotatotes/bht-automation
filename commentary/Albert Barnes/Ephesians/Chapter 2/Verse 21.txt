<p style=" "><b>In whom - </b>That is, “by” whom, or “upon” whom. It was in connection with him, or by being reared on him as a foundation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All the building - </b>The whole church of Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fitly framed together - </b>The word used here means “to joint together,” as a carpenter does the frame-work of a building. The materials are accurately and carefully united by mortises and tenons. so that the building shall be firm. Different materials may be used, and different kinds of timber may be employed, but one part shall be worked into another, so as to constitute a durable and beautiful edifice. So in the church. The different materials of the Jews and Gentiles; the people of various nations, though heretofore separated and discordant, become now united, and form an harmonious society. They believe the same doctrines; worship the same God; practice the same holiness; and look forward to the same heaven.</p>
