The materials are accurately and carefully united by mortises and tenons. so that the building shall be firm. Different materials may be used, and different kinds of timber may be employed, but one part shall be worked into another, so as to constitute a durable and beautiful edifice. So in the church.

They believe the same doctrines; worship the same God; practice the same holiness; and look forward to the same heaven.Groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord - see the 1 Corinthians 3:17 note; 2 Corinthians 6:16 note.
