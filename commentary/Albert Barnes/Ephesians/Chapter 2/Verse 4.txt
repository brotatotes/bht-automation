<p style=" "><b>But God, who is rich in mercy - </b>On the use of the word “rich” by Paul, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>. It is a beautiful expression. “God is ‘rich’ in mercy;” overflowing, abundant. Mercy is the riches or the wealth of God. People are often rich in gold, and silver, and diamonds, and they pride themselves in these possessions; but God is “rich in mercy.” In that he abounds and he is so rich in it that he is wilting to impart it to others; so rich that he can make all blessed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For his great love - </b>That is, his great love was the reason why he had compassion upon us. It is not that we had any claim or deserved his favor; but it is, that God had for man original and eternal love, and that love led to the gift of a Saviour, and to the bestowment of salvation.</p>
