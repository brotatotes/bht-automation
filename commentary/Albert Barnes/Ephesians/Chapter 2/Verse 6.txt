<p style=" "><b>And hath raised us up together - </b>That is, we are raised from the death of sin to the life of religion, in connection with the resurrection of Jesus, and in virtue of that. So close is the connection between him and his people, that his resurrection made theirs certain; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And made us sit together - </b>Together with him. That is, we share his honors. So close is our connection with him, that we shall partake of his glory, and in some measure do now; compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>, note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>, note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In heavenly places - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>. The meaning is, that he has gone to the heavenly world as our Head and Representative. His entrance there is a pledge that we shall also enter there. Even here we have the anticipation of glory, and are admitted to exalted honors, as if we sat in heavenly places, in virtue of our connection with him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Christ Jesus - </b>It is in connection with him that we are thus exalted, and thus filled with joy and peace. The meaning of the whole is,” We are united to Christ. We die with him, and live with him. We share his sufferings, and we share his joys. We become dead to the world in virtue of his death; we become alive unto God in virtue of his resurrection. On earth we are exalted to honor, peace, and hope, in virtue of his resurrection; in heaven we shall share his, glory and partake of his triumphs.”</p>
