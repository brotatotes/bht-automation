<p style=" "><b>That in the ages to come - </b>In all future times. The sense is, that the riches of divine grace, and the divine benignity, would be shown in the conversion of Christians and their salvation, to all future times. Such was his love to those who were lost, that it would be an everlasting monument of his mercy, a perpetual and unchanging proof that he was good. The sense is, we are raised up with Christ, and are made to partake of his honor and glory in order that others may forever be impressed wish a sense of the divine goodness and mercy to us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The exceeding riches of his grace - </b>The “abounding, overflowing” riches of grace; compare the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>. This is Paul’s favorite expression - an expression so beautiful and so full of meaning that it will bear often to be repeated. We may learn from this verse:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That one object of the conversion and salvation of sinners, is to furnish a “proof” of the mercy and goodness of God.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Another object is, that their conversion may be an “encouragement” to others. The fact that such sinners as the Ephesians had been, were pardoned and saved, affords encouragement also to others to come and lay hold on life. And so of all other sinners who are saved. Their conversion is a standing encouragement to all others to come in like manner; and now the history of the church for more than eighteen hundred years furnishes all the encouragement which we could desire.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The conversion of “great” sinners is a special proof of the divine benignity. So Paul argues in the case before us; and so he often argued from his own case; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Heaven, the home of the redeemed, will exhibit the most impressive proof of the goodness of God that the universe furnishes. There will be a countless host who were once polluted and lost; who were dead in sins; who were under the power of Satan, and who have been saved by the riches of the divine grace - a host now happy and pure, and free from sin, sorrow, and death - the living and eternal monuments of the grace of God.</p>
