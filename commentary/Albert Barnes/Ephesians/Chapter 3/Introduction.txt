This chapter Ephesians 3:0 consists properly of three parts: (2)He reminds them all of the fact that he was called by special revelation to make known this truth, and to convey to the Gentiles this gospel - supposing that they had heard of the manner of his conversion; Ephesians 3:2-3. (3)He refers them to what he had said before in few words on this point as proof of his acquaintance with this great plan of the gospel; Ephesians 3:3-4. (4)He speaks of this great truth as a “mystery” - the “mystery of Christ;” the great and important truth which was concealed until Christ came, and which was fully made known by him; Ephesians 3:4-6. This had been hidden for ages. But now it had been fully revealed by the Spirit of God to the apostles and prophets in the Christian church that the great wall of partition was to be broken down, and the gospel proclaimed alike to all. (5)The apostle says, that to him especially was this office committed to proclaim among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches. of Christ; Ephesians 3:8-9. (6)The “design” of this was to illustrate, in view of all worlds, the great wisdom of God in the plan of salvation; Ephesians 3:10-12. It was intended to show to other intelligent beings the glory of the divine perfections, and to make manifestations of the divine character which could be perceived nowhere else.
