<p style=" "><b>According to the eternal purpose - </b>see the note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>. Literally, “the purpose of ages,” or of eternity. Locke, Chandler, and Whitby render this, “according to that disposition or arrangement of the ages which he made in Jesus Christ, or through him.” The object of such an interpretation seems to be to avoid the doctrine that God had a purpose or plan in the salvation of people, and hence such expositors suppose it refers to the arrangement of the “ages” of the world by which the plan of redemption was introduced. On the word rendered here as “purpose” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προθέσις</span></span> prothesis - see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>. It is rendered “showbread” - the bread of setting before,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:4">Matthew 12:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:26">Mark 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:4">Luke 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span>; “purpose,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:23">Acts 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:13">Acts 27:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:10">2 Timothy 3:10</span>. It does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. In most of these cases it refers to the “purpose or intention” of God; in not a single case does it mean “arrangement or disposition” in any sense like that of making an arrangement of “ages” or periods of the world; and the interpretation proposed by Whitby, Locke, Clarke, and others, is wholly at variance with the settled use of the word.</p>
<p style=" ">The word rendered “eternal” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αἰώνων</span></span> aiōnōn - may mean “ages;” but it also most usually means eternity; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>. Here it may mean “the purpose of ages;” i. e., the purpose formed in past ages; but the word is most commonly used in the New Testament in the sense of “ever, and forever;” compare the following places, where it is so rendered in our common version, and beyond a doubt correctly; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:13">Matthew 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:14">Mark 11:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:33">Luke 1:33</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:55">Luke 1:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:35">John 8:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:25">Romans 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:9">2 Corinthians 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:31">2 Corinthians 11:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>. The fair meaning of the passage here is, that God had formed a plan which was “eternal” in reference to the salvation of people; that that plan had reference to the Lord Jesus; and that it was now executed by the gospel. It is impossible to get away from the idea that God has a “plan.” It is too often affirmed in the Scriptures, and is too consonant with out’ reason to be disputed. It is as “undesirable” as it is impossible to escape from that idea. Who could respect or honor an intelligent being that had no plan, no purpose, no intention, and that did all things by caprice and hap-hazard? If God has any plan, it must he eternal. He has no new schemes; he has no intentions which he did not always have.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which he purposed - </b>Literally, “which he made.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Christ Jesus - </b>With reference to him; or which were to be executed through him. The eternal plan had respect to him, and was to be executed by his coming and work.</p>
