<p style=" "><b>We have boldness - </b>The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παῤῥησίαν</span></span> parrēsian - means, properly, boldness of speaking; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:26">John 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:13">Acts 4:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>. Here it seems to mean “freedom of utterance;” and the idea is, that we may come to God now in prayer with confidence through the Lord Jesus; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And access - </b>see notes <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:18">Ephesians 2:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the faith of him - </b>By faith in him. The sense is, that we may now come confidently and boldly to the throne of grace for mercy in the name of the Redeemer. Boldness is not rashness; and faith is not presumption; but we may come without hesitating, and with an assurance that our prayers will be heard.</p>
