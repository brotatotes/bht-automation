<p style=" "><b>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not - </b>The connection here is this. Paul was then a prisoner at Rome. He had been made such in consequence of his efforts to diffuse the Christian religion among the Gentiles; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>. His zeal in this cause, and the opinions which he held on this subject, had roused the wrath of the Jews, and led to all the calamities which he was now suffering. Of that the Ephesians. he supposes, were aware. It was natural that they should be distressed at his sufferings, for all his privations were endured on their account. But here he tells them not to be troubled and disheartened. He was indeed suffering; but he was reconciled to it, and they should be also, since it was promoting their welfare. The word rendered “faint” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐκκακέω</span></span> egkakeō - means literally, to turn out “a coward,” or to lose one’s courage; then to be fainthearted, etc.; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1">2 Corinthians 4:1</span>. It is rendered “faint” in <span class="_0000ff"><u>Luk 18:1</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1">2 Corinthians 4:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:13">Ephesians 3:13</span>, and “weary” in <span class="_0000ff"><u>Gal 6:9</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:13">2 Thessalonians 3:13</span>. It does not elsewhere occur. It is rendered here by Locke “dismayed.” Koppe supposes it means that they should not suppose that the Christian religion was vain and false because he was suffering so much from his countrymen on account of it. But it rather means that they might be in danger of being discouraged by the fact that “he” was enduring so much. They might become disheartened in their attachment to a system of religion which exposed its friends to such calamities. Paul tells them that this ought not to follow. They were to be profited by all his sufferings, and they should, therefore, hold fast to a religion which was attended with so many benefits to them - though he should suffer.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is your glory - </b>Which tends to your honor and welfare. You have occasion to rejoice that you have a friend who is willing thus to suffer for you; you have occasion to rejoice in all the benefits which will result to you from, his trials in your behalf.</p>
