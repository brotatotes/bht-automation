<p style=" "><b>For this cause - </b>Some suppose that this is a resumption of what he had commenced saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>, but which had been interrupted by a long parenthesis. So Bloomfield explains it. But it seems to me more probable that he refers to what immediately precedes. “Wherefore, that the great work may be carried on, and that the purposes of these my sufferings may be answered in your benefit and glory, I bow my knees to God, and pray to him.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>I bow my knees - </b>I pray. The usual, and the proper posture of prayer is to kneel; Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+6:13">2 Chronicles 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+6:10">Daniel 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:21">Luke 22:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:40">Acts 9:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:26">Acts 20:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:5">Acts 21:5</span>. It is a posture which indicates reverence, and should, therefore, be assumed when we come before God. It has been an unhappy thing that the custom of kneeling in public worship has ever been departed from in the Christian churches.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ - </b>To whom, undoubtedly, prayer should ordinarily be addressed. But this does not make it improper to address the Lord Jesus in prayer; see the notes; 7:59-60 on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>.</p>
