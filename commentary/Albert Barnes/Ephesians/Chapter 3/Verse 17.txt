<p style=" "><b>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith - </b>see the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span>. Expressions like this often occur in the Scriptures, where God is said to dwell in us, and we are said to be the temples of the Holy Spirit; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:23">John 14:23</span>, note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span>, note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye being rooted - </b>Firmly established - as a tree is whose roots strike deep, and extend afar. The meaning is, that his love should be as firm in our hearts, as a tree is in the soil, whose roots strike deep into the earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And grounded - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεθεμελιωμένοι</span></span> tethemeliōmenoi - “founded” - as a building is on a foundation. The word is taken from architecture, where a firm foundation is laid, and the meaning is, that he wished them to be as firm in the love of Christ, as a building is that rests on a solid basis.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In love - </b>In love to the Redeemer - perhaps also in love to each other - and to all. Love was the great principle of the true religion, and the apostle wished that they might be fully settled in that.</p>
