Now unto him - It is not uncommon for Paul to utter an ascription of praise in the midst of an argument; see Romans 9:5; Romans 11:36; Galatians 1:5. Here his mind is full of the subject; and in view of the fact that God communicates to his people such blessings - that they may become filled with all his fulness, he desires that praise should be given to him.That is able to do - see the notes, Romans 16:25.Exceeding abundantly - The compound word used here occurs only in this place, and in 1Th 3:10; 1 Thessalonians 5:13. It means, to an extent which we cannot express.Above all that we ask or think - More than all that we can desire in our prayers; more than all that we can conceive; see the notes on 1 Corinthians 2:9.According to the power that worketh in us - The exertion of that same power can accomplish for us more than we can now conceive.
