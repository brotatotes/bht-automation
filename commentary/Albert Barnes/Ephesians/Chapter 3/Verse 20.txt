<p style=" "><b>Now unto him - </b>It is not uncommon for Paul to utter an ascription of praise in the midst of an argument; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>. Here his mind is full of the subject; and in view of the fact that God communicates to his people such blessings - that they may become filled with all his fulness, he desires that praise should be given to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That is able to do - </b>see the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Exceeding abundantly - </b>The compound word used here occurs only in this place, and in <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Th 3:10</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:13">1 Thessalonians 5:13</span>. It means, to an extent which we cannot express.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Above all that we ask or think - </b>More than all that we can desire in our prayers; more than all that we can conceive; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:9">1 Corinthians 2:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to the power that worketh in us - </b>The exertion of that same power can accomplish for us more than we can now conceive.</p>
