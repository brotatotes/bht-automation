Whereof I was made a minister - see the notes at Ephesians 3:2.According to the gift of the grace of God - It was not by my own seeking or merit; it was a free gift.Of the grace of God - The sentiment is, that throughout it was a mere matter of grace that he was called into the ministry, and that so important an office was entrusted to him as that of bearing the gospel to the Gentiles.By the effectual working of his power - Not by any native inclination which I had to the gospel, and not by any power which I have put forth. It is by “the energy of his power;” compare notes, Galatians 2:8. Locke understands this of the energy or power which God put forth in converting the Gentiles under his ministry. But it seems to me that it refers rather to the power which God put forth in the conversion of Paul himself, and putting him into the ministry. This is clear from the following verse. The meaning is, that such was his opposition to the gospel by nature, that nothing but the “energy of God” could overcome it, and that his conversion was to be traced to that alone.
