<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:0">Ephesians 4:0</span> is the commencement of the “practical” part of the Epistle, and is made up, like the remaining chapters, of various exhortations. It is in accordance with the usual habit of Paul to conduct an “argument” in his epistles, and then to enforce various practical duties, either growing out of the argument which he had maintained, or, more commonly, adapted to some particular state of things in the church to which he wrote. The points of exhortation in this chapter are, in general, the following:</p>
<p style=" ">I. An exhortation to unity; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1-6">Ephesians 4:1-6</span>. He entreats them to walk worthy of their vocation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>; shows them how it could be done, or what he meant; and that, in order to that, they should show meekness and kindness <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>, and particularly exhorts them to unity <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>; for they had one God, one Saviour, one baptism, one religion; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4-6">Ephesians 4:4-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">II. He shows them that God had made ample provision for his people, that they might be sound in the faith, and in unity of life and of doctrine, and need not be driven about with every wind of opinion; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:7-16">Ephesians 4:7-16</span>. He assures them that to every Christian is given grace in the Redeemer adapted to his circumstances <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:7">Ephesians 4:7</span>; that the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven to obtain gifts for his people <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8-10">Ephesians 4:8-10</span>; that he had given apostles prophets and evangelists, for the very purpose of imparting instruction, and confirming them in the faith of the gospel <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11-12">Ephesians 4:11-12</span>; that this was in order that they might attain to the highest elevation in Christian knowledge and piety <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>; and particularly that they might not be driven to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14-16">Ephesians 4:14-16</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">III. Having these arrangements made for their knowledge and piety, he exhorts them not to live as the pagan around them lived; But to show that they were under a better influence; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17-24">Ephesians 4:17-24</span>. Their understanding was darkened, and they were alienated from the life of God, or true religion <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span>; they were past feeling, and were given over to every form of sensuality; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:19">Ephesians 4:19</span>. The Ephesians, however, had been taught a different thing <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:20-21">Ephesians 4:20-21</span>, and the apostle exhorts them to lay aside everything pertaining to their former course of life, and to become wholly conformed to the principles of the new man; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22-24">Ephesians 4:22-24</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">IV. He exhorts them to perform particular Christian duties, and to put away certain evils, of which they and all others were in danger; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:25-32">Ephesians 4:25-32</span>. In particular, he entreats them to avoid lying <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:25">Ephesians 4:25</span>; anger <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:26">Ephesians 4:26</span>; theft <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:28">Ephesians 4:28</span>; corrupt and corrupting conversation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:29">Ephesians 4:29</span>; grieving the Holy, Spirit <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span>; bitterness, evil-speaking, and malice <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span> l; and entreats them to manifest in their conversation with each other a spirit of kindness and forgiveness; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span>.</p>
