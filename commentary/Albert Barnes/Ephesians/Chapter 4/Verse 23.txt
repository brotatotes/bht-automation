<p style=" "><b>And be renewed - </b>That is, it is necessary that a man who has been following these should become a new man; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span> ff., compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>. The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀνανεόω</span></span> ananeoō - does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament; but it has the same meaning as the word used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>. It means to make new, and is descriptive of the work of regeneration. This was addressed to the church, and to those whom Paul regarded as Christians; and we learn from this:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That it is necessary that man should be “renewed” in order to be saved.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That it is proper to exhort Christians to be renewed. They need renovated strength every day.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) That it is a matter of “obligation” to be renewed. People are “bound” thus to be renovated, And,</p>
<p style=" ">(4) That they have sufficient natural ability to change from the condition of the old to that of the “new” man, or they could not be exhorted to it.</p>
