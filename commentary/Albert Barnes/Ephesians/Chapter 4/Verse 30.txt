It is rendered “grieved,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:22">Mark 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:17">John 21:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4-5">2 Corinthians 2:4-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:20">Ephesians 4:20</span>; and once. “in heaviness,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:6">1 Peter 1:6</span>. The verb does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The common meaning is, to treat others so as to cause grief. We are not to suppose that the Holy Spirit literally endures “grief, or pain,” at the conduct of people. The language is such as is suited to describe what “men” endure, and is applied to him to denote that kind of conduct which is “suited” to cause grief; and the meaning here is, “do not pursue such a course as is “suited” in its own nature, to pain the benevolent heart of a holy being. Do not act toward the Holy Spirit in a manner which would produce pain in the bosom of a friend who loves you. There is a course of conduct which will drive that Spirit from the mind as if he were grieved and pained - as a course of ingratitude and sin would pain the heart of an earthly friend, and cause him to leave you.” If asked what that conduct is, we may reply:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Open and gross sins. They are particularly referred to here; and the meaning of Paul is. that theft, falsehood, anger, and kindred vices, would grieve the Holy Spirit and cause him to depart.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Anger, in all its forms. Nothing is more suited to drive away all serious and tender impressions from the mind, than the indulgence of anger.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Licentious thoughts and desires. The Spirit of God is pure, and he dwells not in a soul that is filled with corrupt imaginings.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Ingratitude. “We” feel ingratitude more than almost anything else; and why should we suppose that the Holy Spirit would not feel it also?</p>
<p style=" ">(5) Neglect. The Spirit of God is grieved by that. Often he prompts us to pray; he disposes the mind to seriousness, to the perusal of the Bible, to tenderness and penitence. We neglect those favored moments of our piety, and lose those happy seasons for becoming like God.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) Resistance. Christians often resist the Holy Spirit. He would lead them to be dead to the world; yet they drive on their plans Of gain. He would teach them the folly of fashion and vanity; yet they deck themselves in the most frivolous apparel. He would keep them from the splendid party, the theater, and the ballroom; yet they go there. A l that is needful for a Christian to do in order to be eminent in piety, is to yield to the gentle influences which would draw him to prayer and to heaven.</p>
