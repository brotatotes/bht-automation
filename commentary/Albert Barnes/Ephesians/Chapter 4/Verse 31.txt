<p style=" "><b>And wrath - </b>The word here does not differ essentially from anger.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Anger - </b>see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:26">Ephesians 4:26</span>. All cherished, unreasonable anger.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And clamour - </b>Noise, disorder, high words; such as men use in a brawl, or when they are excited. Christians are to be calm and serious. Harsh contentions and strifes; hoarse brawls and tumults, are to be unknown among them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And evil-speaking - </b>Slander, backbiting, angry expressions, tale-bearing, reproaches, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With all malice - </b>Rather, “with all evil” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακίᾳ</span></span> kakia. Every kind and sort of evil is to be put away, and you are to manifest only that which is good.</p>
