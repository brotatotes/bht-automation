<p style=" "><b>And have no fellowship - </b>See the sentiment here expressed fully explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:14-18">2 Corinthians 6:14-18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The unfruitful works - </b>The deeds of darkness that produce no “benefit” to the body or the soul. The word “unfruitful” is used here in contrast with the “fruit of the Spirit,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:9">Ephesians 5:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But rather reprove them - </b>By your life, your conversation, and all your influence. This is the business of Christians. Their lives should be a standing rebuke of a sinful world, and they should be ever ready to express their disapprobation of its wickedness in every form.</p>
