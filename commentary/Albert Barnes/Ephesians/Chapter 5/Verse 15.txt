<p style=" "><b>See then that ye walk circumspectly - </b>carefully, anxiously, solicitous lest you fall into sin. The word rendered “circumspectly” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀκριβῶς</span></span> akribōs - means “diligently,” and the idea here is, that they were to take special pains to guard against the temptations around them, and to live as they ought to.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not as fools, but as wise - </b>Not as the people of this world live, indulging in foolish pleasures and desires, but as those who have been taught to understand heavenly wisdom, and who have been made truly wise.</p>
