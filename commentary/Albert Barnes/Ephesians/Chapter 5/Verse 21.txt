<p style=" "><b>Submitting yourselves one to another - </b>Maintaining due subordination in the various relations of life. This general principle of religion, the apostle proceeds now to illustrate in reference to wives <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22-24">Ephesians 5:22-24</span>; to children <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:1-3">Ephesians 6:1-3</span>; and to servants, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5-8">Ephesians 6:5-8</span>. At the same time that he enforces this duty of submission, however, he enjoins on others to use their authority in a proper manner, and gives solemn injunctions that there should be no abuse of power. Particularly he enjoins on husbands the duty of loving their wives with all tenderness <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25-33">Ephesians 5:25-33</span>; on fathers, the duty of treating their children so that they might easily obey them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4">Ephesians 6:4</span>; and on masters, the duly of treating their servants with kindness, remembering that they have a Master also in heaven; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span>. The general meaning here is, that Christianity does not break up the relations of life, and produce disorder, lawlessness, and insubordination; but that it will confirm every proper authority, and make every just yoke lighter. Infidelity is always disorganizing; Christianity, never.</p>
