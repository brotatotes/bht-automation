<p style=" "><b>As Christ is the head of the church - </b>As Christ rules over the church, and has a right to direct and control it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he is the Saviour of the body - </b>That is, of the church, represented as “his body;” see notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>. The idea here seems to be, that as Christ gave himself to save his body, the church; as he practiced self-denial and made it an object of intense solicitude to preserve that church, so ought the husband to manifest a similar solicitude to make his wife happy, and to save her from want, affliction, and pain. He ought to regard himself as her natural protector; as bound to anticipate and provide for her needs; as under obligation to comfort her in trial, even as Christ does the church. What a beautiful illustration of the spirit which a husband should manifest is the care which Christ has shown for his “bride,” the church!
