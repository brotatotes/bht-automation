<p style=" "><b>That he may present it to himself - </b>In the last day, when he shall receive the church as his spouse to heaven; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>. Perhaps the word “prepare” would better express the sense here than “present” - that he may prepare it for himself as a holy church. Tyndale renders it, “to make it unto himself.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>A glorious church - </b>A church full of honor, splendor, beauty. The idea of “shining,” or of being “bright,” would convey the sense here. Probably there is still here an allusion to a bride “adorned for her husband” (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:9-14">Psalms 45:9-14</span>); and the ideal is, that the church will be worthy of the love of the bridegroom, to whom it will then be presented.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not having spot - </b>Not having a stain, a defect, or any impurity - still retaining the allusion to a bride, and to the care taken to remove every blemish.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or wrinkle - </b>In the vigor and beauty of youth like a bride in whom there is no wrinkle of age.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or any such thing - </b>Nothing to deform, disfigure, or offend. To this beautiful illustration of the final glory of the church, the apostle was led by the mention of the relation of the husband and the wife. It shows:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The tendency of the thoughts of Paul. He delighted to allow the associations in his mind, no matter what the subject was, to draw him along to the Redeemer.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The passage here shows us what the church will yet be. There will be a period in its history when there shall not be any imperfection; when there shall be neither spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing. In heaven all will be pure. On earth we are preparing for that world of purity; and it cannot be denied that here there is much that is imperfect and impure. But in that future world, where the church shall be presented to Christ, clothed in the robes of salvation, there shall not be one unholy member; one deceiver or hypocrite; one covetous or avaricious man; one that shall pain the hearts of the friends of purity by an unholy life. And in all the million that shall be gathered there out of every land, and people, and tongue, and age, there shall be no envy, malice, backbiting, pride, vanity, worldliness; there shall be no annoying and vexing conflict in the heart with evil passions, “nor any such thing.” How different from the church as it now is; and how we should pant for that blessed world!</p>
