<p style=" "><b>For we are members of his body - </b>Of the body of Christ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3">1 Corinthians 11:3</span>, note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:27">1 Corinthians 12:27</span>, note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1-6">John 15:1-6</span>, notes, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>, note. The idea here is, that there is a close and intimate union between the Christian and the Saviour - a union so intimate that they may be spoken of as “one”.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of his flesh, and of his bones - </b>There is an allusion here evidently to the language which Adam used respecting Eve. “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:23">Genesis 2:23</span>. It is language which is employed to denote the closeness of the marriage relation, and which Paul applies to the connection between Christ and his people. Of course, it cannot be understood “literally.” It is not true literally that our bones are a part of the bones of Christ, or our flesh of his flesh; nor should language ever be used that would imply a miraculous union. It is not a physical union, but a union of attachment; of feeling; of love. If we avoid the notion of a “physical” union, however, it is scarcely possible to use too strong language in describing the union of believers with the Lord Jesus. The Scriptures make use of language which is stronger than that employed to describe any other connection; and there is no union of affection so powerful as that which binds the Christian to the Saviour. So strong is it, that he is willing for it to forsake father, mother, and home; to leave his country, and to abandon his possessions; to go to distant lands and dwell among barbarians to make the Redeemer known; or to go to the cross or the stake from simple love to the Saviour. Account for it as people may, there has been manifested on earth nowhere else so strong an attachment as that which binds the Christian to the cross. It is stronger love that that which a man has for his own flesh and bones; for it makes him willing that his flesh should be consumed by fire, or his bones broken on the wheel rather than deny him. Can the infidel account for this strength of attachment on any other principle than that it has a divine origin?</p>
<p style=" ">(See the supplementary note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>, on the union between Christ and his people, in which it is shown that a mere union of feeling and love is far beneath the truth.)</p>
