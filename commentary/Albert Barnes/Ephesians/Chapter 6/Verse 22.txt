<p style=" "><b>Whom I have sent unto you - </b>The churches where Paul had preached, would feel a great interest in his welfare. He was a prisoner at Rome, and it was doubtful what the result would be. In this situation, he felt it proper to despatch a special messenger to give information about his condition; to state what was doing in Rome; to ask the prayers of the churches; and to administer consolation to them in their various trials. The same sentiment in regard to the embassy of Tychicus, is expressed in the Epistle to the Colossians, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7-8">Colossians 4:7-8</span>. No small part of the consolation which he would impart to them would be found in these invaluable letters which he bore to them from the apostle.</p>
