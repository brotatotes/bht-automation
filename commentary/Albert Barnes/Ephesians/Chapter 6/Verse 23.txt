Peace be to the brethren - The Epistle is closed with the usual salutations. The expression “peace to you,” was the common form of salutation in the East (see the Matthew 10:13 note; Luke 24:36 note; Romans 15:33 note; compare Galatians 6:16; 1 Peter 5:14; 3 John 1:14), and is still the “salam” which is used - the word “salam” meaning “peace.”And love with faith - Love united with faith; not only desiring that they might have faith, but the faith which worked by love.From God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ - The Father and the Son are regarded as equally the author of peace and love; compare notes on 2 Corinthians 13:14.
