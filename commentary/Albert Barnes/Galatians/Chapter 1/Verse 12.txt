<p style=" "><b>For I neither received it of man - </b>This is very probably said in reply to his opponents, who had maintained that Paul had derived his knowledge of the gospel from other people, since he had not been personally known to the Lord Jesus, or been of the number of those whom Jesus called to be his apostles. In reply to this, he says, that he did not receive his gospel in any way from man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither was I taught it - </b>That is, by man. He was not taught it by any written account of it, or by the instruction of man in any way. The only plausible objection to this statement which could be urged would be the fact that Paul had an interview with Ananias <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span> before his baptism, and that he would probably receive instructions from him. But to this it may be replied:</p>
<p style=" "><b>But by the revelation of Jesus Christ - </b>On his way to Damascus, and subsequently in the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17-21">Acts 22:17-21</span>. Doubtless, he received communications at various times from the Lord Jesus with regard to the nature of the gospel and his duty. The sense here is, that he was not indebted to people for his knowledge of the gospel, but had derived it entirely from the Saviour.</p>
