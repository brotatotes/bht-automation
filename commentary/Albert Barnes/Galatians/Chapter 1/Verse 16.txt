<p style=" "><b>To reveal his Son in me - </b>This is to be regarded as connected with the first part of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>, “When it pleased God to reveal his Son in me,” that is, on the way to Damascus. The phrase evidently means, to make me acquainted with the Lord Jesus, or to reveal his Son to me; compare the Greek in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span>, for a similar expression. The revelation here referred to was the miraculous manifestation which was made to Paul on his way to Damascus; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>. That revelation was in order to convince him that he was the Messiah; to acquaint him with his nature, rank, and claims; and to qualify him to be a preacher to the pagan.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That I might preach him - </b>In order that I might so preach him; or with a view to my being appointed to this work. This was the leading purpose for which Paul was converted, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:21">Acts 22:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The heathen - </b>The Gentiles; the portion of the world that was not Jewish, or that was destitute of the true religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Immediately - </b>Koppe supposes that this is to be connected with “I went into Arabia” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17">Galatians 1:17</span>. Rosenmuller supposes it means, “Immediately I consented.” Dr. Wells and Locke suppose that it refers to the fact that he immediately went to Arabia. But this seems to me to be an unnatural construction. The words are too remote from each other to allow of it. The evident sense is, that he was at once decided. He did not take time to deliberate whether he should or should not become a Christian. He made up his mind at once and on the spot. He did not consult with anyone; he did not ask advice of anyone; he did not wait to be instructed by anyone. He was convinced by the vision in an overpowering manner that Jesus was the Messiah, and he yielded at once. The main idea is, that there was no delay, no consultation, no deferring it, that he might see and consult with his friends, or with the friends of Christianity. The object for which he dwells on this is to show that he did not receive his views of the gospel from man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I conferred not - </b>I did not “lay the case” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσανεθέμην</span></span> prosanethemēn) before any man; I did not confer with anyone.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Flesh and blood - </b>Any human being, for so the phrase properly signifies; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>. This does not mean here, that Paul did not consult his own ease and happiness; that he was regardless of the sufferings which he might be called to endure; that he was willing to suffer, and was not careful to make provision for his own comfort - which was true in itself - but that he did not lay the case before any man, or any body of human beings for instruction or advice. He acted promptly and decisively. He was not disobedient to the heavenly vision <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:19">Acts 26:19</span>, but resolved at once to obey. Many suppose that this passage means that Paul did not take counsel of the evil passions and suggestions of his own heart, or of the feelings which would have prompted him to lead a life of ambition, or a life under the influence of corrupt desires. But however true this was in fact, no such thing is intended here. It simply means that he did not take counsel of any human being. He resolved at once to follow the command of the Saviour, and at once to obey him. The passage shows:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That when the Lord Jesus calls us to follow him we should promptly and decidedly obey.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) We should not delay even to take counsel of earthly friends, or wait for human advice, or consult their wishes, but should at once resolve to follow the Lord Jesus. Most persons, when they are awakened to see their guilt, and their minds are impressed on the subject of religion are prone to defer it; to resolve to think of it at some future time; or to engage in some other business before they become Christians; or, at least, they wish to finish what they have on hand before they yield to God. If Paul had pursued this course, he probably never would have become a Christian. It follows, therefore:</p>
<p style=" ">(3) That when the Lord Jesus calls us, we should at once abandon any course of life, however pleasant, or any plan of ambition, however brilliant, or any scheme of gain, however promising, in order that we may follow him. What a brilliant career of ambition that Paul did abandon! and how promptly and decidedly did he do it! He did not pause or hesitate a moment! However brilliant as his prospects were, he at once forsook everything; paused in mid-career in his ambition; and without consulting one human being, he immediately gave his heart to God. Such a course should be pursued by all. Such a promptness and decision will prepare one to become an eminent Christian, and to be eminently useful.</p>
