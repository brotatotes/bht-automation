<p style=" "><b>Then after three years - </b>Probably three years after his departure from Jerusalem to Damascus, not after his return to Arabia. So most commentators have understood it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Went up to Jerusalem - </b>More correctly, as in the margin, returned.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To see Peter - </b>Peter was the oldest and most distinguished of the apostles. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>, he, with James and John, is called a pillar. But why Paul went particularly to see him is not known. It was probably, however, from the celebrity and distinction which he knew Peter had among the apostles that he wished to become particularly acquainted with him. The word which is here rendered “to see” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἱστορῆσαι</span></span> historēsai) is by no means that which is commonly employed to denote that idea. It occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; and properly means to ascertain by personal inquiry and examination, and then to narrate, as a historian was accustomed to do, whence our word history. The notion of personally seeing and examining, is one that belongs essentially to the word, and the idea here is that of seeing or visiting Peter in order to a personal acquaintance.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And abode with him fifteen days - </b>Probably, says Bloomfield, including three Lord’s days. Why he departed then is unknown. Beza supposes that it was on account of the plots of the Grecians against him, and their intention to destroy him <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:29">Acts 9:29</span>; but this is not assigned by Paul himself as a reason. It is probable that the purpose of his visit to Peter would be accomplished in that time, and he would not spend more time than was necessary with him. It is clear that in the short space of two weeks he could not have been very extensively taught by Peter the nature of the Christian religion, and probably the time is mentioned here to show that he had not been under the teaching of the apostles.</p>
