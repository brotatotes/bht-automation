It was not material to the purpose which he has here in view, which is to state that he was not indebted to the apostles for his knowledge of the doctrines of Christianity.

<p style=" "><b>The regions of Syria - </b>Syria was between Jerusalem and Cilicia. Antioch was the capital of Syria, and in that city and the adjacent places he spent considerable time; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:41">Acts 15:41</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cilicia - </b>This was a province of Asia Minor, of which Tarsus, the native place of Paul, was the capital; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:9">Acts 6:9</span>.</p>
