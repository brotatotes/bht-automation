<p style=" "><b>To whom be glory ... - </b>Let Him have all the praise and honor of the plan and its execution. It is not uncommon for Paul to introduce an ascription of praise in the midst of an argument: see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:25">Romans 1:25</span>. It results from the strong desire which he had, that all the glory should be given to God, and showed that he believed that all blessings had their origin in God, and that God should be always acknowledged.</p>
