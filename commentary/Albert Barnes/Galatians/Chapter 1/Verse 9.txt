<p style=" "><b>As we said before - </b>That is, in the previous verse. It is equivalent to saying, “as I have just said;” see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:3">2 Corinthians 7:3</span>. It cannot be supposed that he had said this when he was with them, as it cannot be believed that he then anticipated that his doctrines would be perverted, and that another gospel would be preached to them. The sentiment of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span> is here repeated on account of its importance. It is common in the Scriptures, as indeed it is everywhere else, to repeat a declaration in order to deepen the impression of its importance and its truth. Paul would not be misunderstood on this point. He would leave no doubt as to his meaning. He would not have it supposed that he had uttered the sentiment in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span> hastily; and he therefore repeats it with emphasis.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Than that ye have received - </b>In the previous verse, it is, “that which we have preached.” By this change in the phraseology he designs, probably, to remind them that they had once solemnly professed to embrace that system. It had not only been “preached” to them, it had been “embraced” by them. The teachers of the new system, therefore, were really in opposition to the once avowed sentiments of the Galatians; to what they knew to be true. They were not only to be held accursed, therefore, because Paul so declared, but because they preached what the Galatians themselves knew to be false, or what was contrary to that which they had themselves professed to be true.</p>
