<p style=" ">The second chapter is closely connected in sense with the first, and is indeed a part of the same argument. Injury has been done by the division which is made. The proper division would have been at the close of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span>. The general scope of the chapter, like the first, is to show that he did not receive the gospel from man; that he had not derived it from the apostles; that he did not acknowledge his indebtedness to them for his views of the Christian religion; that they had not even set up authority over him; but that they had welcomed him as a fellow-laborer, and acknowledged him as a co-adjutor in the work of the apostleship. In confirmation of this, he states <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span> that he had indeed gone to Jerusalem, but that he had done it by express revelation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>; that he was cordially received by the apostles there - especially by those who were pillars in the church; and that so far from regarding himself as inferior to the other apostles, he had resisted Peter to his face at Antioch on a most important and vital doctrine.</p>
<p style=" ">The chapter, therefore, may be regarded as divided into two portions, namely:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. “The account of his visit to Jerusalem and of what occurred there,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. “The scene at Antioch, where Paul rebuked Peter for his dissimulation;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11-21">Galatians 2:11-21</span>. The main object of mentioning this seems to be to show, first, that he did not regard himself as inferior to the other apostles, or that he had not derived his views of the gospel from them; and, secondly, to state that the observance of the Jewish rites was not necessary to salvation, and that he had maintained that from the beginning. He had strongly urged it in a controversy with Peter, and in a case where Peter was manifestly wrong; and it was no new doctrine on the subject of justification which he had preached to the Galatians. He states, therefore:</p>
