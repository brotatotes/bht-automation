<p style=" "><b>Then fourteen years after - </b>That is, 14 years after his first visit there subsequent to his conversion. Some commentators, however, suppose that the date of the fourteen years is to be reckoned from his conversion. But the more obvious construction is, to refer it to the time of his visit there, as recorded in the previous chapter; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:18">Galatians 2:18</span>. This time was spent in Asia Minor chiefly in preaching the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I went up again to Jerusalem - </b>It is commonly supposed that Paul here refers to the visit which he made as recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:0">Acts 15:0</span>. The circumstances mentioned are substantially the same; and the object which he had at that time in going up was one whose mention was entirely pertinent to the argument here. He went up with Barnabas to submit a question to the assembled apostles and elders at Jerusalem, in regard to the necessity of the observance of the laws of Moses. Some persons who had come among the Gentile converts from Judea had insisted on the necessity of being circumcised in order to be saved. Paul and Barnabas had opposed them; and the dispute had become so warm that it was agreed to submit the subject to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. For that purpose Paul and Barnabas had been sent, with certain others, to lay the case before all the apostles. As the question which Paul was discussing in this Epistle was about the necessity of the observance of the laws of Moses in order to justification, it was exactly in point to refer to a journey when this very question had been submitted to the apostles. Paul indeed had made another journey to Jerusalem before this with the collection for the poor saints in Judea <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29-30">Acts 11:29-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span>, but he does not mention that here, probably because he did not then see the other apostles, or more probably because that journey furnished no illustration of the point now under debate. On the occasion here referred to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:0">Acts 15:0</span>, the very point under discussion here constituted the main subject of inquiry, and it was definitely settled.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And took Titus with me also - </b>Luke, in the Acts of the Apostles <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span>, says, that there were others with Paul and Barnabas on that journey to Jerusalem, but who they were he does not mention. It is by no means certain that Titus was appointed by the church to go to Jerusalem; but the contrary is more probable. Paul seems to have taken him with him as a private affair; but the reason is not mentioned. It may have been to show his Christian liberty, and his sense of what he had a right to do; or it may have been to furnish a case on the subject of inquiry, and submit the matter to them whether Titus was to be circumcised. He was a Greek; but he had been converted to Christianity. Paul had not circumcised him; but had admitted him to the full privileges of the Christian church. Here then was a case in point; and it may have been important to have had such a case before them, so that they might fully understand it. This, as Doddridge properly remarks, is the first mention which occurs of Titus. He is not mentioned by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles, and though his name occurs several times in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6">2 Corinthians 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:16">2 Corinthians 8:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:18">2 Corinthians 12:18</span>, yet it is to be remembered that that Epistle was written a considerable time after this to the Galatians. Titus was a Greek, and was doubtless converted by the labors of Paul, because he calls him his own “son,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>. He attended Paul frequently in his travels; was employed by him in important services (see 2 Corinthians in the places referred to above); was left by him in Crete to set in order the things that were missing, and to ordain elders there <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>; subsequently, he went into Dalmatia <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:10">2 Timothy 4:10</span>, and is supposed to have returned again to Crete, where it is said he propagated the gospel in the neighboring islands, and died at the age of 94 - Calmet.</p>
