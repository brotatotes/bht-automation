<p style=" "><b>And the other Jews - </b>That is, those who had been converted to Christianity. It is probable that they were induced to do it by the example of Peter, as they would naturally regard him as a leader.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Dissembled likewise with him - </b>Dissembled or concealed their true sentiments. That is, they attempted to conceal from those who had come down from James the fact that they had been in the habit of associating with the Gentiles, and of eating with them. From this it would appear that they intended to conceal this wholly from them, and that they withdrew from the Gentiles before anything had been said to them by those who came down from James.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away ... - </b>Concerning Barnabas, see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span>. Barnabas was the intimate friend of Paul. He had been associated with him in very important labors; and the fact, therefore, that the conduct of Peter was exciting so unhappy an influence as even to lead so worthy and good a man as he was into hypocrisy and error, made it the more proper that Paul should publicly notice and reprove the conduct of Peter. It could not but be a painful duty, but the welfare of the church and the cause of religion demanded it, and Paul did not shrink from what was so obvious a duty.</p>
