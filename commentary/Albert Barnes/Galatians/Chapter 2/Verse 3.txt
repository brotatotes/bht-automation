<p style=" "><b>But neither Titus, who was with me - </b>Paul introduces this case of Titus undoubtedly to show that circumcision was not necessary for salvation. It was a case just in point. He had gone up to Jerusalem with the express reference to this question. Here was a man whom he had admitted to the Christian church without circumcising him. He claimed that he had a right to do so; and that circumcision was not necessary in order for salvation. If it were necessary, it would have been proper that Titus should have been compelled to submit to it. But Paul that says this was not demanded; or if demanded by anyone, the point was yielded, and he was not compelled to be circumcised. It is to be remembered that this was at Jerusalem; that it was a case submitted to the apostles there; and that consequently the determination of this case settled the whole controversy about the obligation of the Mosaic laws on the Gentile converts.</p>
<p style=" ">It is quite evident from the whole statement here that Paul did not intend that Titus should be circumcised; that he maintained that it was not necessary; and that he resisted it when it was demanded; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4-5">Galatians 2:4-5</span>. Yet on another occasion he himself performed the act of circumcision upon Timothy; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>. But there is no inconsistency in Paulâ€™s conduct. In the case of Titus, it was demanded as a matter of right and as obligatory upon him, and Paul resisted the principle as dangerous. In the case of Timothy, it was a voluntary compliance on his part with the usual customs of the Jews, where it was not pressed as a matter of obligation, and where it would not be understood as indispensable to salvation. No danger would follow from compliance with the custom, and it might do much to conciliate the favor of the Jews, and he therefore submitted to it. Paul would not have hesitated to have circumcised Titus in the same circumstances in which it was done to Timothy; but the circumstances were different; and when it was insisted upon as a matter of principle and of obligation, it became a matter of principle and of obligation with him to oppose it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being a Greek - </b>Born of Gentile parents, of course he had not been circumcised. Probably both his parents were Greeks. The case with Timothy was somewhat different. His mother was a Jewess, but his father was a Greek <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was compelled to be circumcised - </b>I think it is implied here that this was demanded and insisted on by some that he should be circumcised. It is also implied that Paul resisted it, and the point was yielded, thus settling the great and important principle that it was not necessary in order for salvation; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:5">Galatians 2:5</span>.</p>
