<p style=" "><b>For as many as are of the works of the law - </b>As many as are seeking to be justified by yielding obedience to the Law - whether the moral law, or the ceremonial law. The proposition is general; and it is designed to show that, from the nature of the case, it is impossible to be justified by the works of the Law, since, under all circumstances of obedience which we can render, we are still left with its heavy curse resting on us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are under the curse - </b>The curse which the Law of God denounces. Having failed by all their efforts to yield perfect obedience, they must, of course, be exposed to the curse which the Law denounces on the guilty. The word rendered “curse” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατάρα</span></span> katara) means, as with us, properly, “imprecation,” or “cursing.” It is used in the Scriptures particularly in the sense of the Hebrew <span class="_800000">אלה</span> 'alah, malediction, or execration <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+31:30">Job 31:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+29:18">Jeremiah 29:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:11">Daniel 9:11</span>; of the word <span class="_800000">מארה</span> m<sup>e</sup>'ēraah <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mal+2:2">Malachi 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>; and especially of the common Hebrew word <span class="_800000">קללה</span> q<sup>e</sup>laalaah, a curse; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:12-13">Genesis 27:12-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+11:26">Deuteronomy 11:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+11:28-29">Deuteronomy 11:28-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+23:5">Deuteronomy 23:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+27:13">Deuteronomy 27:13</span>, et scope al. It is here used evidently in the sense of devoting to punishment or destruction; and the idea is, that all who attempt to secure salvation by the works of the Law, must be exposed to its penalty. It denounces a curse on all who do not yield entire obedience; and no partial compliance with its demands can save from the penalty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For it is written - </b>The substance of these words is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+28:26">Deuteronomy 28:26</span>; “Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them.” It is the solemn close of a series of maledictions, which Moses denounces in that chapter on the violators of the Law. In this quotation, Paul has given the sense of the passage, but he has quoted literally neither from the Hebrew nor from the Septuagint. The sense, however, is retained, The word “cursed” here means, that the violator of the Law shall be devoted to punishment or destruction. The phrase “that continueth not,” in the Hebrew is “that confirmeth not” - that does not establish or confirm by his life. He would confirm it by continuing to obey it; and thus the sense in Paul and in Moses is substantially the same. The word “all” is not expressed in the Hebrew in Deuteronomy, but it is evidently implied, and has been insorted by the English translators. It is found, however, in six manuscripts of Kennicott and DeRossi; in the Samaritan text; in the Septuagint; and in several of the Targums - Clarke.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The book of the law - </b>That is, in the Law. This phrase is not found in the passage in Deuteronomy. The expression there is, “the words of this law.” Paul gives it; a somewhat larger sense, and applies it to the whole of the Law of God. The meaning is, that the whole law must be obeyed, or man cannot be justified by it, or will be exposed to its penalty and its curse. This idea is expressed more fully by James <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:10">James 2:10</span>; “Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all;” that is, he is guilty of breaking the Law as a whole, and must be held responsible for such violation. The sentiment here is one that is common to all law, and must be, from the nature of the ease. The idea is, that a man who does not yield compliance to a whole law, is subject to its penalty, or to a curse. All law is sustained on this principle. A man who has been honest, and temperate, and industrious, and patriotic, if he commits a single act of murder, is subject to the curse of the Law, and must meet the penalty. A man who has been honest and honorable in all his dealings, yet if he commits a single act of forgery, he must meet the curse denounced by the laws of his country, and bear the penalty. So, in all matters pertaining to law: no matter what the integrity of the man; no matter how upright he has been, yet, for the one offence the law denounces a penalty, and he must bear it. It is out of the question for him to be justified by it. He cannot plead as a reason why he should not be condemned for the act of murder or forgery, that he has in all other respects obeyed the law, or even that he has been guilty of no such offences before. Such is the idea of Paul in the passage before us. It was clear to his view that man had not in all respects yielded obedience to the Law of God. If he had not done this, it was impossible that he should be justified by the Law, and he must bear its penalty.</p>
