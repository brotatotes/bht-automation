<p style=" "><b>But that no man is justified ... - </b>The argument which Paul has been pursuing he proceeds to confirm by an express declaration of the Bible. The argument is this: “It is impossible that a man should be justified by the Law, because God has appointed another way of justification.” But there cannot be two ways of obtaining life, and as he has appointed faith as the condition on which people shall live, he has precluded from them the possibility of obtaining salvation in any other mode.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For, The just shall live by faith - </b>This is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span>. This passage is also quoted by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>; see it explained in the note on that verse. The sense here is, that life is promised to man only in connection with faith. It is not by the works of the Law that it is done. The condition of life is faith: and he lives who believes. The meaning is not, I apprehend, that the man who is justified by faith shall live, but that life is promised and exists only in connection with faith, and that the just or righteous man obtains it only in this way. Of course it cannot be obtained by the observance of the Law, but must be by some other scheme.</p>
