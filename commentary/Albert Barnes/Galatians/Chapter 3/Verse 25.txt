<p style=" "><b>But after that faith is come - </b>The scheme of salvation by faith. After that is revealed; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We are no longer under a schoolmaster - </b>Under the poedagogus, or pedagogue. We are not kept in restraint, and under bondage, and led along to another to receive instruction. We are directly under the great Teacher, the Instructor himself; and have a kind of freedom which we were not allowed before. The bondage and servitude have passed away; and we are free from the burdensome ceremonies and expensive rites (compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>) of the Jewish law, and from the sense of condemnation which it imposes. This was true of the converts from Judaism to Christianity - that they became free from the burdensome rites of the Law and it is true of all converts to the faith of Christ, that, having been made to see their sin by the Law, and having been conducted by it to the cross of the Redeemer, they are now made free.</p>
