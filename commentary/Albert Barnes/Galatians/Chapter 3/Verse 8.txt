<p style=" "><b>And the Scripture - </b>The word Scripture refers to the Old Testament; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>. It is here personified, or spoken of as foreseeing. The idea is, that he by whom the scriptures were inspired, foresaw that. It is agreeable, the meaning is, to the account on the subject in the Old Testament. The Syriac renders this, “Since God foreknew that the Gentiles would be justified by faith, he before announced to Abraham, as the scripture saith, In thee shall all nations be blessed.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Foreseeing - </b>That is, this doctrine is contained in the Old Testament. It was foreseen and predicted that the pagan would be justified by faith, and not by the works of the Law.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That God would justify the heathen - </b>Greek: “The nations” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὰ ἔθνη</span></span> ta ethnē - the Gentiles. The fact that the pagan, or the Gentiles would be admitted to the privileges of the true religion, and be interested in the benefits of the coming of the Messiah, is a fact which is everywhere abundantly predicted in the Old Testament. As an instance, see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:22-23">Isaiah 49:22-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:0">Isaiah 60:0</span>. I do not know that it is anywhere distinctly foretold that the pagan would be justified by faith, nor does the argument of the apostle require us to believe this. He says that the Scriptures, that is, he who inspired the Scriptures, foresaw that fact, and that the Scriptures were written as if with the knowledge of that fact; but it is not directly affirmed. The whole structure and frame of the Old Testament, however, proceeds on the supposition that it would be so; and this is all that the declaration of the apostle requires us to understand,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Preached before the gospel - </b>This translation does not convey quite the idea to us, which the language of Paul, in the original, would to the people to whom he addressed it. We have affixed a technical sense to the phrase “to preach the gospel.” It is applied to the formal and public annunciation of the truths of religion, especially the “good news” of a Saviour’s birth, and of redemption by his blood. But we are not required by the language used here to suppose that this was done to Abraham, or that “the gospel” was preached to him in the sense in which we all now use that phrase. The expression, in Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προευηγγελίσατο</span></span> proeuēngelisato, means merely, “the joyful news was announced beforehand to Abraham;” scil. that in him should all the nations of the earth be blessed. It was implied, indeed, that it would be by the Messiah; but the distinct point of the “good news” was not the “gospel” as we understand it, but it was that somehow through him all the nations of the earth would be made happy. Tyndale has well translated it,” Showed beforehand glad tidings unto Abraham.” This translation should have been adopted in our common version.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In thee shall all nations be blessed - </b>See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:25">Acts 3:25</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:13">Romans 4:13</span> note. All nations should be made happy in him, or through him. The sense is, that the Messiah was to be descended from him, and the religion of the Messiah, producing peace and salvation, was to be extended to all the nations of the earth: see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>; compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εὐαγγελίζω</span></span> Euangelizō doubtless here, as elsewhere, signifies to announce glad tidings. And in all the passages where this word occurs, even in those where the author might be disposed to allow that the “gospel technically” was meant, the translation which he proposes here would be very suitable and exact. It was certainly the same gospel that was preached to Abraham, that is now preached to us, though not with, the same fulness of revelation, in his case. The apostle here affirms that the gospel, that is, the way of justification through Christ, in opposition to the legal system he had been condemning - was, in few words, preached to Abraham, being contained in that promise, “in thee shall all nations be blessed;” see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:17">Genesis 22:17</span>. The full meaning of the promise, indeed, could not be gathered from the words themselves, but Abraham must have understood their application in a far more extensive sense than that “somehow through him all the nations of the earth would be made happy.” Whether the true import were made known to him directly by the Spirit of God, or discerned by him in typical representation, it is certain that Abraham’s faith terminated on the promised Seed, that is, Christ whose day he desired to see, and seeing it afar, was glad, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>. “Hereof it followeth,” says Luther on the place, “that the blessing and faith of Abraham is the same that ours is, that Abraham’s Christ is our Christ, that Christ died as well for the sins of Abraham as for us.”)</p>
