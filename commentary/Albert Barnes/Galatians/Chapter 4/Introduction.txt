<p style=" ">The design of this chapter is, to show the effect of being under the Law, and the inconsistency of that kind of bondage or servitude with the freedom which is vouchsafed to the true children of God by the gospel. It is, in accordance with the whole drift of the Epistle, to recall the Galatians to just views of the gospel; and to convince them of their error in returning to the practice of the Mosaic rites and customs. In the previous chapter he had shown them that believers in the gospel were the true children of Abraham; that they had been delivered from the curse of the Law; that the Law was a schoolmaster to lead them to Christ, and that they were all the children of God. To illustrate this further, and to show them the true nature of the freedom which they had as the children of God, is the design of the argument in this chapter. He therefore states:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That it was under the gospel only that they received the full advantages of freedom; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:1-5">Galatians 4:1-5</span>. Before Christ came, indeed, there were true children of God, and heirs of life. But they were in the condition of minors; they had not the privileges of sons. An heir to a great estate, says the apostle <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:1-2">Galatians 4:1-2</span>, is treated substantially as if he were a servant. He is under tutors and governors: he is not permitted to enter on his inheritance; he is kept under the restraint of law. So it was with the people of God under the Law of Moses. They were under restraints, and were admitted to comparatively few of the privileges of the children of God. But Christ came to redeem those who were under the Law, and to place them in the elevated condition of adopted sons; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4-5">Galatians 4:4-5</span>. They were no longer servants; and it was as unreasonable that they should conform again to the Mosaic rites and customs, as it would be for the heir of full age, and who has entered on his inheritance, to return to the condition of minorship, and to be placed again under tutors and governors, and to be treated as a servant.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) As sons of God, God had sent forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts, and they were enabled to cry Abba, Father. They were no longer servants, but heirs of God, and should avail themselves of the privileges of heirs; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6-7">Galatians 4:6-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Sustaining this relation, and being admitted to these privileges, the apostle remonstrates with them for returning again to the “weak and beggarly elements” of the former dispensation - the condition of servitude to rites and customs in which they were before they embraced the gospel; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8-11">Galatians 4:8-11</span>. When they were ignorant of God, they served those who were no gods, and there was some excuse for that; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8">Galatians 4:8</span>. But now they had known God, they were acquainted with his laws; they were admitted to the privileges of his children; they were made free, and there could be no excuse for returning again to the bondage of those who had no true knowledge of the liberty which the gospel gave. Yet they observed days and times as though these were binding, and they had never been freed from them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:10">Galatians 4:10</span>; and the apostle says, that he is afraid that his labors bestowed on them, to make them acquainted with the plan of redemption, had been in vain.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) To bring them to a just sense of their error, he reminds theta of their former attachment to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:12-20">Galatians 4:12-20</span>. He had indeed preached to them amidst much infirmity, and much that was suited to prejudice them against him <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13">Galatians 4:13</span>; but they had disregarded that, and had evinced toward him the highest proofs of attachment - so, much so, that they had received him as an angel of God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:14">Galatians 4:14</span>, and had been ready to pluck out their own eyes to give them to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:15">Galatians 4:15</span>. With great force, therefore, he asks them why they had changed their views toward him so far as to forsake his doctrines? Had he become their enemy by telling the truth? <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:16">Galatians 4:16</span>. He tenderly addresses them, therefore, as little children, and says, that he has the deepest solicitude for their welfare, and the deepest anxiety on account of their danger - a solicitude which he compares <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span>, with the pains of childbirth.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) In order to enforce the whole subject, and to show the true nature of the conformity to the Law compared with the liberty of the gospel, he allegorizes an interesting part of the Mosaic history - the history of the two children of Abraham; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:21-31">Galatians 4:21-31</span>. The condition of Hagar - a slave - under the command of a master - harshly treated - cast out and disowned, was an apt illustration of the condition of those who were under the servitude of the Law. It would strikingly represent Mount Sinai, and the Law that was promulgated there, and the condition of those who were under the Law. That, too, was a condition of servitude. The Law was stern, and showed no mercy. It was like a master of a slave, and would treat those who were under it with a rigidness that might be compared with the condition of Hagar and her son; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24-25">Galatians 4:24-25</span>. That same Mount Sinai also was a fair representation of Jerusalem as it was then - a city full of rites and ceremonies, where the Law reigned with rigor, where, there was a burdensome system of religion, and where there was none of the freedom which the gospel would furnish; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:25">Galatians 4:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">On the other hand, the children of the free woman were an apt illustration of those who were made free from the oppressive ceremonies of the Law by the gospel; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:22">Galatians 4:22</span>. That Jerusalem was free. The new system from heaven was one of liberty and rejoicing; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26-27">Galatians 4:26-27</span>. Christians were, like Isaac, the children of promise, and were not slaves to the Law; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:28">Galatians 4:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:31">Galatians 4:31</span>. And as there was a command <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:30">Galatians 4:30</span> to east out the bondwoman and her son, so the command now was to reject all that would bring the mind into ignoble servitude, and prevent its enjoying the full freedom of the gospel. The whole argument is, that it would be as unreasonable for those who were Christians to submit again to the Jewish rites and ceremonies, as it would be for a freeman to sell himself into slavery. And the design of the whole is, to recall them from the conformity to Jewish rites and customs, and from their regarding them as now binding on Christians.</p>
