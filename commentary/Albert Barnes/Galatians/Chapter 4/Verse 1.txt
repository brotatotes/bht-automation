<p style=" "><b>Now I say - </b>He had before said <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24-25">Galatians 3:24-25</span> that while they were under the Law they were in a state of minority. This sentiment he proceeds further to illustrate by showing the true condition of one who was a minor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That the heir - </b>Any heir to an estate, or one who has a prospect of an inheritance. No matter how great is the estate; no matter how wealthy his father; no matter to how elevated a rank he may be raised on the moment that he enters on his inheritance, yet until that time he is in the condition of a servant.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As long as he is a child - </b>Until he arrives at the age. The word rendered “child” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νήπιοι</span></span> nēpioi) properly means an infant; literally, “one not speaking” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νη</span></span> nē insep. <i>un</i>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἔπος</span></span> epos), and hence, a child or babe, but without any definite limitation - Robinson. It is used as the word “infant” is with us in law, to denote “a minor.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Differeth nothing from a servant - </b>That is, he has no more control of his property; he has it not at his command. This does not mean that he does not differ in any respect, but only that in the matter under consideration he does not differ. He differs in his prospects of inheriting the property, and in the affections of the father, and usually in the advantages of education, and in the respect and attention shown him. but in regard to property, he does not differ, and he is like a servant, under the control and direction of others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Though he be lord of all - </b>That is, in prospect. He has a prospective right to all the property, which no one else has. The word “lord” here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κύριος</span></span> kurios), is used in the same sense in which it is often in the Scriptures, to denote master or owner. The idea which this is designed to illustrate is, that the condition of the Jews before the coming of the Messiah was inferior in many respects to what the condition of the friends of God would be under him - as inferior as the condition of an heir was before he was of age, to what it would be when he should enter on his inheritance. The Jews claimed, indeed, that they were the children or the sons of God, a title which the apostle would not withhold from the pious part of the nation; but it was a condition in which they had not entered on the full inheritance, and which was far inferior to that of those who had embraced the Messiah, and who were admitted to the full privileges of sonship. They were indeed heirs. They were interested in the promises. But still they were in a condition of comparative servitude, and could be made free only by the gospel.</p>
