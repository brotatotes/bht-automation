<p style=" "><b>My little children - </b>The language of tender affection, such as a parent would use toward his own offspring; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:15">1 Corinthians 4:15</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:3">Matthew 18:3</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Joh 13:33</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:12-13">1 John 2:12-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:4">1 John 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:21">1 John 5:21</span>.

<p style=" "><b>Of whom I travail in birth again - </b>For whose welfare I am deeply anxious: and for whom I endure deep anguish; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:15">1 Corinthians 4:15</span>. His anxiety for them he compares to the deepest sufferings which human nature endures; and his language here is a striking illustration of what ministers of the gospel should feel, and do sometimes feel, in regard to their people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Until Christ be formed in you - </b>The name Christ is often used to denote his religion, or the principles of his gospel; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:14">Romans 13:14</span>. Here it means, until Christ reigns wholly in your hearts; until you wholly and entirely embrace his doctrines; and until you become wholly imbued with his spirit; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>.</p>
