<p style=" "><b>But Jerusalem which is above - </b>The spiritual Jerusalem; the true church of God. Jerusalem was the place where God was worshipped, and hence, it became synonymous with the word church, or is used to represent the people of God. The word rendered “above,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄνω</span></span> anō) means properly “up above,” that which is above; and hence, heavenly, celestial; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1-2">Colossians 3:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:23">John 8:23</span>. Here it means the heavenly or celestial Jerusalem; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>, “And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of heaven.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span>,” ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.” Here it is used to denote the church, as being of heavenly origin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is free - </b>The spirit of the gospel is that of freedom. It is freedom from sin, freedom from the bondage of rites and customs, and it tends to promote universal freedom; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:32">John 8:32</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span>; and the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is the mother of us all - </b>Of all who are true Christians, whether we are by birth Jews or Gentiles. We should not, therefore, yield ourselves to any degrading and debasing servitude el any kind; compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:12">1 Corinthians 6:12</span>.</p>
