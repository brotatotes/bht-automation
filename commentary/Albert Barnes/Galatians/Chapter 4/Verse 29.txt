<p style=" "><b>But as then he that was born after the flesh - </b>Ishmael; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:23">Galatians 4:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Persecuted him that was born after the Spirit - </b>That is, Isaac. The phrase, “after the Spirit,” here, is synonymous with “according to the promise” in the previous verse. It stands opposed to the phrase “after the flesh,” and means that his birth was by the special or miraculous agency of God; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:0">Romans 4:0</span>. It was not in the ordinary course of events. The persecution here referred to, was the injurious treatment which Isaac received from Ishmael, or the opposition which subsisted between them. The particular reference of Paul is doubtless to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:9">Genesis 21:9</span>, where it is said that “Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.” It was on account of this, and at the special request of Sarah, that Hagar and her son were expelled from the house of Abraham; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:10">Genesis 21:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even so it is now - </b>That is, Christians, the children of the promise, are persecuted by the Jews, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “as it now is,” and who are uninterested in the promises, as Ishmael was. For an illustration of this, see Paley’s Hora Paulina, on this Epistle, no. v. Dr. Paley has remarked that it does not appear that the apostle Paul was ever set upon by the Gentiles, unless they were first stirred up by the Jews, except in two instances. One of these was at Philippi, after the cure of the Pythoness <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>; and the other at Ephesus, at the instance of Demetrius; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:24">Acts 19:24</span>. The persecutions of the Christians arose, therefore, mainly from the Jews, from those who were in bondage to the Law, and to rites and customs; and Paul’s allusion here to the case of the persecution which Isaac the free-born son endured, is exceedingly pertinent and happy.</p>
