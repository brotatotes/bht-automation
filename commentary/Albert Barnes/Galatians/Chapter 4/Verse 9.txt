<p style=" "><b>But now ... - </b>The sense is, that since they had been made free from their ignoble servitude in the worship of false gods, and had been admitted to the freedom found in the worship of the true God, it was absurd that they should return again to that which was truly slavery or bondage, the observance of the rites of the Jewish law.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye have known God - </b>The true God, and the ease and freedom of his service in the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or rather are known of God - </b>The sense is, “Or, to speak more accurately or precisely, are known by God.” The object of this correction is to avoid the impression which might be derived from the former phrase that their acquaintance with God was owing to themselves. He therefore states, that it was rather that they were known of God; that it was all owing to him that they had been brought to an acquaintance with himself. Perhaps, also, he means to bring into view the idea that it was a favor and privilege to be known by God, and that therefore it was the more absurd to turn back to the weak and beggarly elements.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How turn ye again - </b>Margin, “Back.” “How is it that you are returning to such a bondage?” The question implies surprise and indignation that they should do it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the weak and beggarly elements - </b>To the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish law, imposing a servitude really not less severe than the customs of paganism. On the word elements, see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span>. They are called “weak” because they had no power to save the soul; no power to justify the sinner before God. They are called “beggarly” (Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτωχὰ</span></span> ptōcha, poor), because they could not impart spiritual riches. They really could confer few benefits on man. Or it may be, as Locke supposes, because the Law kept people in the poor estate of pupils from the full enjoyment of the inheritance; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:1-3">Galatians 4:1-3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage - </b>As if you had a wish to be under servitude. The absurdity is as great as it would be for a man who had been freed from slavery to desire his chains again. They had been freed by the gospel from the galling servitude of paganism, and they now again had sunk into the Jewish observances, as if they preferred slavery to freedom, and were willing to go from one form of it to another. The main idea is, that it is absurd for people who have been made free by the gospel to go back again into any kind of servitude or bondage. We may apply it to Christians now. Many sink into a kind of servitude not less galling than was that to sin before their conversion. Some become the slaves of mere ceremonies and forms in religion. Some are slaves to fashion, and the world still rules them with the hand of a tyrant. They have escaped, it may be, from the galling chains of ambition, and degrading vice, and low sensuality; but they became slaves to the love of money, or of dress, or of the fashions of the world, as if they loved slavery and chains; and they seem no more able to break loose than the slave is to break the bonds which bind him. And some are slaves to some expensive and foolish habit. Professed Christians, and Christian ministers too, become slaves to the disgusting and loathsome habit of using tobacco, bound by a servitude as galling and as firm as that which ever shackled the limbs of an African. I grieve to add also that many professed Christians are slaves to the habit of “sitting long at the wine” and indulging in it freely. O that such knew the liberty of Christian freedom, and would break away from all such shackles, and show how the gospel frees people from all foolish and absurd customs!</p>
