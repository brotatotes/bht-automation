<p style=" "><b>I have confidence in you ... - </b>Though they had been led astray, and had embraced many false opinions, yet, on the whole, Paul had confidence in their piety, and believed they would yet return and embrace the truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye will be none otherwise minded - </b>That is, than you have been taught by me; or than I think and teach on the subject. Paul doubtless means to say, that he had full confidence that they would embrace the views which he was inculcating on the subject of justification, and he makes this remark in order to modify the severity of his tone of reprehension, and to show that, notwithstanding all he had said, he had confidence still in their piety. He believed that they would coincide with him in his opinion, alike on the general subject of justification, and in regard to the cause of their alienation from the truth. He, therefore, gently insinuates that it was not to be traced to themselves that they had departed from the truth, but to the “little leaven” that had leavened the mass; and he adds, that whoever had done this, should be held to be responsible for it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But he that troubleth you - </b>By leading you into error.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall bear his judgment - </b>Shall be responsible for it, and will receive proper treatment from you. He gently states this general principle, which is so obvious; states that he does not believe that the defection is to be traced to themselves; and designs to prepare their minds for a proposition which he intends to submit <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:12">Galatians 5:12</span>, that the offending person or persons should be disowned and cut off.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whosoever he be - </b>“I do not know who he is. I mention no names; accuse no one by name; and advise no severe measures against any particular individual. I state only the obvious principle that every man should bear his own burden, and be held responsible for what he has done - no matter who he is.”</p>
