<p style=" "><b>I would they were even cut off - </b>That is, as I understand it, from the communion of the church. So far am I, says Paul, from agreeing with them, and preaching the necessity of circumcision as they do, that I sincerely wish they were excluded from the church as unworthy a place among the children of God. For a very singular and monstrous interpretation of this passage, though adopted by Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Jerome, Grotius, Rosenmuller, Koppe, and others, the learned reader may consult Koppe on this verse. To my amazement, I find that this interpretation has also been adopted by Robinson in his Lexicon, on the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀποκόπτω</span></span> apokoptō. I will state the opinion in the words of Koppe. “<i>Non modo circumcidant se, sed, si velint, etiam mutilant se - ipsa genitalia resecent</i>.” The simple meaning is, I think, that Paul wished that the authors of these errors and disturbances were excluded from the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which trouble you - </b>Who pervert the true doctrines of salvation, and who thus introduce error into the church. Error always sooner or later causes trouble; compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>.</p>
