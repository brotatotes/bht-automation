<p style=" "><b>For all the law is fulfilled ... - </b>That is, this expresses the substance of the whole law; it embraces and comprises all. The apostle of course here alludes to the Law in regard to our duty to our fellow-men, since that was the point which he particularly enforces. He is saying that this law would counteract all the evil workings of the flesh, and if this were fulfilled, all our duty to others would be discharged. A similar sentiment he has expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8-10">Romans 13:8-10</span>; see the notes at that passage. The turn here in the discussion is worthy of particular notice. With great skill he changes the subject from a doctrinal argument to a strain of practical remark, and furnishes most important lessons for the right mode of overcoming our corrupt and sensual passions, and discharging our duty to others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou shalt love thy neighbor ... - </b>See this explained in the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:19">Matthew 19:19</span>.</p>
