<p style=" "><b>But if ye bite - </b>The word used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δάκνω</span></span> daknō), means, properly, to bite, to sting; and here seems to be used in the sense of contending and striving - a metaphor not improbably taken from dogs and wild beasts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And devour one another - </b>As wild beasts do. The sense is, “if you contend with each other;” and the reference is, probably, to the strifes which would arise between the two parties in the churches - the Jewish and the Gentile converts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Take heed that ye be not consumed ... - </b>As wild beasts contend sometimes until both are slain. Thus, the idea is, in their contentions they would destroy the spirituality and happiness of each other; their characters would be ruined; and the church be overthrown. The readiest way to destroy the spirituality of a church, and to annihilate the influence of religion, is to excite a spirit of contention.</p>
