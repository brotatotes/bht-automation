But if ye be led of the Spirit - If you submit to the teachings and guidance of the Holy Spirit.Ye are not under the law - You are under a different dispensation - the dispensation of the Spirit. You are free from the restraints and control of the Mosaic law, and are under the control of the Spirit of God.
