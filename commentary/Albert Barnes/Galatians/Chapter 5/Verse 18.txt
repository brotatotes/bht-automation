<p style=" "><b>But if ye be led of the Spirit - </b>If you submit to the teachings and guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye are not under the law - </b>You are under a different dispensation - the dispensation of the Spirit. You are free from the restraints and control of the Mosaic law, and are under the control of the Spirit of God.</p>
