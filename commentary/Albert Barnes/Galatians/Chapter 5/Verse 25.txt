<p style=" "><b>If we live in the Spirit - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:16">Galatians 5:16</span>. The sense of this verse probably is, “We who are Christians profess to be under the influences of the Holy Spirit. By his influences and agency is our spiritual life. We profess not to be under the dominion of the flesh; not to be controlled by its appetites and desires. Let us then act in this manner, and as if we believed this. Let us yield ourselves to his influences, and show that we are controlled by that Spirit.” It is an earnest exhortation to Christians to yield wholly to the agency of the Holy Spirit on their hearts, and to submit to his guidance; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span>, note9, note.</p>
