<p style=" "><b>For in Jesus Christ - </b>In the religion which Christ came to establish.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither circumcision ... - </b>It makes no difference whether a man is circumcised or not. He is not saved because he is circumcised, nor is he condemned because he is not. The design of Christianity is to abolish these rites and ceremonies, and to introduce a way of salvation that shall be applicable to all mankind alike; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>, note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:19">1 Corinthians 7:19</span>, note; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But faith which worketh by love - </b>Faith that evinces its existence by love to God, and benevolence to people. It is not a mere intellectual belief, but it is that which reaches the heart, and controls the affections. It is not a dead faith, but it is that which is operative, and which is seen in Christian kindness and affection. It is not mere belief of the truth, or mere orthodoxy, but it is that which produces trite attachment to others. A mere intellectual assent to the truth may leave the heart cold and unaffected; mere orthodoxy, however bold and self-confident, and “sound,” may not be inconsistent with contentions, and strifes, and logomachies, and divisions. The true faith is that which is seen in benevolence, in love to God, in love to all who bear the Christian name; in a readiness to do good to all mankind. This shows that the heart is affected by the faith that is held; and this is the nature and design of all genuine religion. Tyndale renders this, “faith, which by love is mighty in operation.”</p>
