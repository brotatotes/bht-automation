<p style=" "><b>Let him that is taught in the word - </b>In the word of God; that is, the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Communicate unto him - </b>Let him share with him who teaches; let there be a common participation of all good things.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In all good things - </b>In everything that is needful for their comfortable subsistence. On the duty here enjoined see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:11-13">1 Corinthians 9:11-13</span>.</p>
