<p style=" "><b>And let us not be weary in welldoing - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:58">1 Corinthians 15:58</span>. The reference here is particularly to the support of the ministers of religion <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:6">Galatians 6:6</span>, but the apostle makes the exhortation general. Christians sometimes become weary. There is so much opposition to the best plans for doing good; there is so much to be done; there are so many calls on their time and their charities; and there is often so much ingratitude among those whom they endeavor to benefit, that they become disheartened. Such Paul addresses, and exhorts them not to give over, but to persevere.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For in due season - </b>At the day of judgment. Then we shall receive the full reward of all our self-denials and charities.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We shall reap, if we faint not - </b>If we do not give over, exhausted and disheartened. It is implied here, that unless a man perseveres in doing good to the end of life, he can hope for no reward. He who becomes disheartened, and who gives over his efforts; he that is appalled by obstacles, and that faints on account of the embarrassments thrown in his way; he that pines for ease, and withdraws from the field of benevolence, shows that he has no true attachment to the cause, and that his heart has never been truly in the work of religion. He who becomes a true Christian, becomes such for eternity. He has enlisted, never to withdraw. He becomes pledged to do good and to serve God always. No obstacles are to deter, no embarrassments are to drive him from the field. With the vigor of his youth, and the wisdom and influence of his riper years; with his remaining powers when enfeebled by age; with the last pulsation of life here, and with his immortal energies in a higher world, he is to do good. For that he is to live. In that he is to die; and when he awakes in the resurrection with renovated powers, he is to awake to an everlasting service of doing good, as far as he may have opportunity, in the kingdom of God.</p>
