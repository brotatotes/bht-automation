<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">The main object of the Epistle is to commend the Christian religion to those who were addressed in it in such a way as to prevent defection from it. This is done, principally, by showing its superiority to the Mosaic system. The great danger of Christians in Palestine was of relapsing into the Jewish system. The imposing nature or its rites; the public sentiment in its favor; the fact of its antiquity, and its undisputed divine origin, would all tend to that. To counteract this, the writer of this Epistle shows that the gospel bad higher claims on their attention, and that if that was rejected ruin was inevitable. In doing this, he begins, in this chapter, by showing the superiority of the Author of Christianity to prophets and to the angels; that is, that he had a rank that entitled him to the profoundest regard. The drift of this chapter, therefore, is to show the dignity and exalted nature of the Author of the Christian system - the Son of God. The chapter comprises the following points:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. The announcement of the fact that God, who had formerly spoken by the prophets, had in this last dispensation spoken by his Son; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-2">Hebrews 1:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. The statement respecting his rank and dignity. He was:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)The Heir of all things;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (2)The Creator of the worlds;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (3)The Brightness of the divine glory and the proper expression of his nature;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (4)He upheld all things; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2-3">Hebrews 1:2-3</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. The work and exaltation of the Author of the Christian system:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (2)He is seated at the right hand of God.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (3)He has a more exalted and valuable inheritance than the angels, in proportion as his name is more exalted than theirs; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3-4">Hebrews 1:3-4</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. Proofs that what is here ascribed to him belongs to him, particularly that he is declared to be superior to the angels; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5-14">Hebrews 1:5-14</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)The angels have never been addressed with the title of Son: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (2)He is declared to be the object of worship by the angels, while they are employed merely as the messengers of God; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6-7">Hebrews 1:6-7</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (3)He is addressed as God, and his throne is said to be forever and ever; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8-9">Hebrews 1:8-9</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (4)He is addressed as immutable. He is declared to have laid the foundations of heaven and earth; and though they would perish, yet he would remain the same; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:10-12">Hebrews 1:10-12</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (5)None of the angels had been addressed in this manner, but they were employed in the subordinate work of ministering to the heirs of salvation; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13-14">Hebrews 1:13-14</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">From this train of reasoning, the inference is drawn in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:1-4">Hebrews 2:1-4</span>, that we ought to give diligent heed to what had been spoken. The Great Author of the Christian scheme had special claims to be heard, and there was special danger in disregarding his message. The object of this chapter is to impress those to whom the Epistle was addressed with the high claims of the Founder of Christianity, and to show that it was superior in this respect to any other system.</p>
