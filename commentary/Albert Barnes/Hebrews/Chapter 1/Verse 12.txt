<p style=" "><b>And as a vesture - </b>A garment; literally something thrown around - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβόλαιον</span></span> peribolaion - and denoting properly the outer garment, the cloak or mantle; see notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>. “Shalt thou fold them up.” That is, the heavens. They are represented in the Scriptures as an “expanse.” or something spread out (the Hebrew text of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:7">Genesis 1:7</span>): as a “curtain,” or “tent” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:22">Isaiah 40:22</span>, and as a “scroll” that might be spread out or rolled up like a book or volume, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:4">Isaiah 34:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:14">Revelation 6:14</span>. Here they are represented as a garment or mantle that might be folded up - language borrowed from folding up and laying aside garments that are no longer fit for use. “And they shall be changed.” That is, they shall be exchanged for others, or they shall give place to the new heavens and the new earth; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:13">2 Peter 3:13</span>. The meaning is, that the present form of the heavens and the earth is not to be permanent, but is to be succeeded by others, or to pass away, but that the Creator is to remain the same. “Thou art the same.” Thou wilt not change. “And thy years shall not fail.” Thou wilt exist forever unchanged. What could more clearly prove that he of whom this is spoken is immutable? Yet it is indubitably spoken of the Messiah, and must demonstrate that he is divine. These attributes cannot be conferred on a creature; and nothing can be clearer than that he who penned the Epistle believed that the Son of God was divine.</p>
