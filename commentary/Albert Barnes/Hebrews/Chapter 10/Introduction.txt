<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">The general subject of this chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:0">Hebrews 10:0</span> is the sacrifice which Christ has made for sin, and the consequences which flow from the fact, that he has made a sufficient atonement. In chapter IX. the apostle had shown that the Jewish rites were designed to be temporary and typical, and that the offerings which were made under that dispensation could never remove sin. In this chapter he shows that the true sacrifice had been made, by which sin could be pardoned, and that certain very important consequences followed from that fact. The subject of “sacrifice” was the most important part of the Jewish economy, and was also the essential thing in the Christian dispensation, and hence, it is that the apostle dwells upon it at so great length. The chapter embraces the following topics.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. The apostle repeats what he had said before about the inefficacy of the sacrifices made under the Law; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1-4">Hebrews 10:1-4</span>. The Law was a mere shadow of good things to come, and the sacrifices which were made under it could never render those who offered them perfect. This was conclusively proved by the fact, that they continued constantly to be offered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. Since this was the fact in regard to those sacrifices, a better offering had been provided in the gospel by the Redeemer; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5-10">Hebrews 10:5-10</span>. A body had been prepared him for this work; and when God had said that he had no pleasure in the offerings under the Law, Christ had come and offered his body once for all, in order that an effectual atonement might be made for sin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. This sentiment the apostle further illustrates, by showing how this one great offering was connected with the forgiveness of sins; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11-18">Hebrews 10:11-18</span>. Under the Jewish dispensation, sacrifices were repeated every day; but under the Christian economy, when the sacrifice was once made, he who had offered it sat down forever on the right hand of God, for his great work was done. Having done this, he looked forward to the time when his work would have full effect, and when his enemies would be made his footstool. That this was to be the effect of the offering made by the Messiah, the apostle then shows from the Scriptures themselves, where it is said <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:33-34">Jeremiah 31:33-34</span>, that under the gospel the laws of God would be written on the heart, and sin would be remembered no more. There must then be, the apostle inferred, some way by which this was to be secured, and this was by the great sacrifice on the cross, which had the effect of perfecting forever those who were sanctified.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. Since it was a fact that such an atonement had been made; that one great offering for sin had been presented to God which was never to be repeated, there were certain consequences which followed from that, which the apostle proceeds to state; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-25">Hebrews 10:19-25</span>. They were these:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a)The privilege of drawing near to God with full assurance of faith <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:22">Hebrews 10:22</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (b)The duty of holding fast the profession of faith without wavering<span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span></span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (c)The duty of exhorting one another to fidelity and to good works <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:24">Hebrews 10:24</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (d)The duty of assembling for public worship, since they had a High Priest in heaven, and might now draw near to God; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> V. As a “reason” for fidelity in the divine life, and for embracing the offer of mercy now made through the one sacrifice on the cross, the apostle urges the consequence which “must” follow from the rejection of that atonement, and especially after having been made acquainted with the truth; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26-31">Hebrews 10:26-31</span>. The result, says he, must be certain destruction. If that was rejected, there could remain nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment for there was no other way of salvation. In support of this, the apostle refers to what was the effect, under the Law of Moses, of disobedience, and says that, under the greater light of the gospel, much more fearful results must follow.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> VI. The chapter closes <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32-39">Hebrews 10:32-39</span> with an exhortation to fidelity and perseverance. The apostle reminds those to whom he wrote of what they had already endured; encourages them by the commendation of what they had already done, and especially by the kindness which they had shown to him; says that they had need only of patience, and that the time of their deliverance from all trial was not far off, for that he who was to come would come; says that it was their duty to live by faith, but that if any one drew back, God could have no pleasure in him. Having thus in the close of the chapter alluded to the subject of faith, he proceeds in the following chapter to illustrate its value at length. The object of the whole is to encourage Christians to make strenuous efforts for salvation; to guard them against the danger of apostasy; and to exhort them to bear their trials with patience, and with submission to the will of God.</p>
