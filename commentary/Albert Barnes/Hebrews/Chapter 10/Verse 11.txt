<p style=" "><b>And every priest standeth daily ministering - </b>That is, this is done every day. It does not mean literally that every priest was daily concerned in offering sacrifices, for they took turns according to their courses, (notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:5">Luke 1:5</span>), but that this was done each day, and that every priest was to take his regular place in doing it; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+28:3">Numbers 28:3</span>. The object of the apostle is to prove that under the Jewish economy sacrifices were repeated constantly, showing their imperfection, but that under the Christian economy the great sacrifice had been offered once, which was sufficient for all.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And offering oftentimes the same sacrifices - </b>The same sacrifices were offered morning and evening every day.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which can never take away sins - </b>notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>.</p>
