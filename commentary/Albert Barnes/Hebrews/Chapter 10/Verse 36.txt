<p style=" "><b>For ye have need of patience - </b>They were then suffering, and in all trials we have need of patience. We have need of it because there is in us so much disposition to complain and repine; because our nature is liable to sink under sufferings; and because our trials are often protracted. All that Christians can do in such cases is to be patient - to lie calmly in the hands of God, and submit to his will day by day, and year by year; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:3-4">James 1:3-4</span>; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That after ye have done the will of God - </b>That is, in bearing trials, for the reference here is particularly to afflictions.<b>Ye might receive the promise - </b>The promised inheritance or reward - in heaven. It is implied here that this promise will not be received unless we are patient in our trials, and the prospect of this reward should encourage us to endure them.</p>
