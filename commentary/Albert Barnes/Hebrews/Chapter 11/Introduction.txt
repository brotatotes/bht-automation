<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">In the close of the previous chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:0">Hebrews 10:0</span>, the apostle had incidentally made mention of faith <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:38-39">Hebrews 10:38-39</span>, and said that the just should live by faith. The object of the whole argument in this Epistle was to keep those to whom it was addressed from apostatizing from the Christian religion, and especially from relapsing again into Judaism. They were in the midst of trials, and were evidently suffering some form of persecution, the tendency of which was to expose them to the danger of relapsing. The indispensable means of securing them from apostasy was “faith,” and with a view to show its efficacy in this respect, the apostle goes into an extended account of its nature and effects, occupying this entire chapter. As the persons whom he addressed had been Hebrews, and as the Old Testament contained an account of numerous instances of persons in substantially the same circumstances in which they were, the reference is made to the illustrious examples of the efficacy of faith in the Jewish history. The object is, to show that “faith,” or confidence in the divine promises, has been in all ages the means of perseverance in the true religion, and consequently of salvation. In this chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:0">Hebrews 11:0</span>, therefore, the apostle first describes or defines the nature of faith <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>, and then illustrates its efficacy and power by reference to numerous instances; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:2-40">Hebrews 11:2-40</span>. In these illustrations he refers to the steady belief which we have that God made the worlds, and then to the examples of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and Rahab in particular, and then to numerous other examples without mentioning their names. The object is to show that there is power in faith to keep the mind and heart in the midst of trials, and that having these examples before them, those whom he addressed should continue to adhere steadfastly to the profession of the true religion.</p>
