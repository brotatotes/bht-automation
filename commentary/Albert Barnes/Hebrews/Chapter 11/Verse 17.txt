<p style=" "><b>By faith Abraham - </b>The apostle had stated one strong instance of the faith of Abraham, and he now refers to one still more remarkable - the strongest illustration of faith, undoubtedly, which has ever been evinced in our world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When he was tried - </b>The word used here is rendered “tempted,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:3">Matthew 19:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:18">Matthew 22:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:35">Matthew 22:35</span>, and in twenty-two other places in the New Testament; “prove,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:6">John 6:6</span>; “hath gone about,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:6">Acts 24:6</span>; “examine,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5">2 Corinthians 13:5</span>; and “tried,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>. It does not mean here, as it often does, to place inducements before one to lead him to do wrong, but to subject his faith to a “trial” in order to test its genuineness and strength. The meaning here is, that Abraham was placed in circumstances which showed what was the real strength of his confidence in God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Offered up Isaac - </b>That is, he showed that he was ready and willing to make the sacrifice, and would have done it if he had not been restrained by the voice of the angel; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:11-12">Genesis 22:11-12</span>. So far as the intention of Abraham was concerned, the deed was done, for he had made every preparation for the offering, and was actually about to take the life of his son.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son - </b>The promises particularly of a numerous posterity. The fulfillment of those promises depended on him whom he was now about to offer as a sacrifice. If Abraham had been surrounded with children, or if no special promise of a numerous posterity had been made to him, this act would not have been so remarkable. It would in any case have been a strong act of faith; it “was especially” strong in his ease from the circumstances that he had an only son, and that the fulfillment of the promise depended on his life.</p>
