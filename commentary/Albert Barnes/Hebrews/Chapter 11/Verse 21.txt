<p style=" "><b>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:31">Genesis 47:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:1-20">Genesis 48:1-20</span>. That is, when he was about to die. He saw his death near when he pronounced this blessing on Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff - </b>This is an exact quotation from the Septuagint in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:31">Genesis 47:31</span>. The English version of that place is, “and Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head,” which is a proper translation, in the main, of the word <span class="_800000">מטּה</span> miTTah. That word, however, with different vowel points - <span class="_800000">מטּה</span> maTTeh, means a branch, a bough, a rod, a staff, and the translators of the Septuagint have so rendered it. The Masoretic points are of no authority, and either translation, therefore, would be proper. The word rendered “head” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:31">Genesis 47:31</span> - “bed’s head” - <span class="_800000">ראשׁ</span> ro'sh, means properly head, but may there mean the top of anything, and there is no impropriety in applying it to the head or top of a staff. The word rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:31">Genesis 47:31</span> as “bowed” - <span class="_800000">וישׁתחו</span> wayishtachuw - implies properly the idea of “worshipping.” It is bowing, or prostration for the purpose of worship or homage.</p>
<p style=" ">Though the Septuagint and the apostle here have, therefore, given a somewhat different version from that commonly given of the Hebrew, and sustained by the Masoretic pointing, yet it cannot be demonstrated that the version is unauthorized, or that it is not a fair translation of the Hebrew. It has also the probabilities of the case in its favour. Jacob was tenderly affected in view of the goodness of God, and of the assurance that he would be conveyed from Egypt when he died, and buried in the land of his fathers. Deeply impressed with this, nothing was more natural than that the old man should lean reverently forward and incline his head upon the top of his staff, and adore the covenant faithfulness of his God. Such an image is much more natural and probable than that he should “bow upon his bed’s head” - a phrase which at best is not very intelligible. If this be the true account, then the apostle does not refer here to what was done when he “blessed the sons of Joseph,” but to an act expressive of strong faith in God which had occurred just before. The meaning then is, “By faith when about to die he blessed the sons of Joseph; and by faith also he reverently bowed before God in the belief that when he died his remains would be conveyed to the promised land, and expressed his gratitude in an act of worship, leaning reverently on the top of his staff.” The order in which these things are mentioned is of no consequence, and thus the whole difficulty in the case vanishes. Both the acts here referred to were expressive of strong confidence in God.</p>
