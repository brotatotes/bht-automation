<p style=" "><b>By faith he forsook Egypt - </b>Some have understood this of the first time in which Moses forsook Egypt, when he fled into Midian, as recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:0">Exodus 2:0</span>; the majority of expositors have supposed that it refers to the time when he left Egypt to conduct the Israelites to the promised land. That the latter is the time referred to is evident from the fact that it is said that he did “not fear the wrath of the king.” When Moses first fled to the land of Midian it is expressly said that he went because he did fear the anger of Pharaoh for his having killed an Egyptian; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:14-15">Exodus 2:14-15</span>. He was at that time in fear of his life; but when he left Egypt at the head of the Hebrew people, he had no such apprehensions. God conducted him out with “an high hand,” and throughout all the events connected with that remarkable deliverance, he manifested no dread of Pharaoh, and had no apprehension from what he could do. He went forth, indeed, at the head of his people when all the power of the king was excited to destroy them, but he went confiding in God: and this is the faith referred to here.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For he endured - </b>He persevered, amidst all the trials and difficulties connected with his leading forth the people from bondage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As seeing him who is invisible - </b>“As if” he saw God. He had no more doubt that God had called him to this work, and that he would sustain him, than if he saw him with his physical eyes. This is a most accurate account of the nature of faith; compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>.</p>
