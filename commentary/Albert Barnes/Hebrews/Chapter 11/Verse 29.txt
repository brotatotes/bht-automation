<p style=" "><b>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:22">Exodus 14:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:29">Exodus 14:29</span>. That is, it was only by confidence in God that they were able to do this. It was not by power which they had to remove the waters and to make a passage for themselves; and it was not by the operation of any natural causes. It is not to be supposed that all who passed through the Red sea had saving faith. The assertion of the apostle is, that the passage was made in virtue of strong confidence in God, and that if it had not been for this confidence the passage could not have been made at all. Of this no one can entertain a doubt who reads the history of that remarkable transaction.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which the Egyptians assaying to do, were drowned - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:27-28">Exodus 14:27-28</span>. Evidently referred to here as showing the effects of not having faith in God, and of what must inevitably have befallen the Israelites if they had had no faith. The destruction of the Egyptians by the return of the waters in accordance with natural laws, showed that the Israelites would have been destroyed in the passage if a divine energy had not been employed to prevent it. On the passage through the Red sea, see Robinsonâ€™s <i>Biblical Researches</i>, vol. 1, pp. 81-86.</p>
