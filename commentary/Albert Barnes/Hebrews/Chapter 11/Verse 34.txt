<p style=" "><b>Quenched the violence of fire - </b>As Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+3:15-26">Daniel 3:15-26</span>. “Escaped the edge of the sword.” As Elijah did when he fled from Ahab, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:3">1 Kings 19:3</span>; as Elijah did when he was delivered from the king of Syria, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+6:16">2 Kings 6:16</span>; and as David did when he fled from Saul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Out of weakness were made strong - </b>Enabled to perform exploits beyond their natural strength, or raised up from a state of physical infirmity, and invigorated for conflict. Such a case as that of Samson may be referred to, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+15:15">Judges 15:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+16:26-30">Judges 16:26-30</span>; or as that of Hezekiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+20:0">2 Kings 20:0</span> who was restored from dangerous sickness by the immediate interposition of God; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+38:0">Isaiah 38:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Waxed valiant in fight - </b>Became valiant. Like Joshua. Barak, David, etc. The books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings supply instances of this in abundance.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Turned to flight the armies of the aliens - </b>The foreigners - as the invading Philistines, Ammonites, Moabites, Assyrians, etc.</p>
