<p style=" "><b>And others had trial of cruel mockings - </b>Referring to the scorn and derision which the ancient victims of persecution experienced. This has been often experienced by martyrs, and doubtless it was the case with those who suffered on account of their religion, before the advent of the Saviour as well as afterward. Some instances of this kind are mentioned in the Old Testament <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:23">2 Kings 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:24">1 Kings 22:24</span>; and it was frequent in the time of the Maccabees.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And scourging - </b>Whipping. This was a common mode of punishment, and was usually inflicted before a martyr was put to death; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:17">Matthew 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:26">Matthew 27:26</span>.
