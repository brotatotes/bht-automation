<p style=" "><b>Wherefore - </b>In view of the facts which have been now stated - that afflictions are sent from God, and are evidences of his paternal watchfulness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lift up the hands which hang down - </b>As if from weariness and exhaustion. Renew your courage; make a new effort to bear them. The hands fall by the side when we are exhausted with toil, or worn down by disease; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:3">Isaiah 35:3</span>, from which place this exhortation is taken.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the feeble knees - </b>The knees also become enfeebled by long effort, and tremble as if their strength were gone. Courage and resolution may do much, however, to make them firm, and it is to this that the apostle exhorts those to whom he wrote. They were to make every effort to bear up under their trials. The hope of victory will do much to strengthen one almost exhausted in battle; the desire to reach home invigorates the frame of the weary traveler. So it is with the Christian. In persecution, and sickness, and bereavement, he may be ready to sink under his burdens. The hands fall, and the knees tremble, and the heart sinks within us. But confidence in God, and the hope of heaven, and the assurance that all this is for our good, will reinvigorate the enfeebled frame, and enable us to bear what we once supposed would crush us to the dust. A courageous mind braces a feeble body, and hope makes it fresh for new conflicts.</p>
