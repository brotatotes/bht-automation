<p style=" "><b>See that ye refuse not - </b>That you do not reject or disregard.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Him that speaketh - </b>That is, in the gospel. Do not turn away from him who has addressed you in the new dispensation, and called you to obey and serve him. The meaning is, that God had addressed “them” in the gospel as really as he had done the Hebrews on Mount Sinai, and that there was as much to be dreaded in disregarding his voice now as there was then. He does not speak, indeed, amidst lightnings, and thunders, and clouds, but he speaks by every message of mercy; by every invitation; by every tender appeal. He spake by his Son <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>; he speaks by the Holy Spirit, and by all his calls and warnings in the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For if they escaped not - </b>If they who heard God under the old dispensation, who refused to obey him, were cut off; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:28">Hebrews 10:28</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who refused him that spake on earth - </b>That is, Moses. The contrast here is between Moses and the Son of God - the head of the Jewish and the head of the Christian dispensation. Moses was a mere man, and spake as such, though in the name of God. The Son of God was from above, and spake as an inhabitant of heaven. “Much more,” etc.; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2-3">Hebrews 2:2-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>.</p>
