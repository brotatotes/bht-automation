<p style=" "><b>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved - </b>We who are Christians. We pertain to a kingdom that is permanent and unchanging. The meaning is, that the kingdom of the Redeemer is never to pass away. It is not like the Jewish dispensation, to give place to another, nor is there any power that can destroy it; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>. It has now endured for eighteen hundred years, amidst all the revolutions on earth, and in spite of all the attempts which have been made to destroy it; and it is now as vigorous and stable as it ever was. The past has shown that there is no power of earth or hell that can destroy it, and that in the midst of all revolutions this kingdom still survives. Its great principles and laws will endure on earth to the end of time, and will be made permanent in heaven. This is the only kingdom in which we can be certain that there will be no revolution; the only empire which is destined never to fall.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let us have grace, whereby we may serve God - </b>Margin, “let us hold fast.” The Greek is, literally, let us have grace; the meaning is, “let us hold fast the grace or favor which we have received in being admitted to the privileges of that kingdom.” The object of the apostle is, to keep them in the reverent fear and service of God. The “argument” which he presents is, that this kingdom is permanent. There is no danger of its being overthrown. It is to continue on earth to the end of time; it is to be established in heaven forever. If it were temporary, changeable, liable to be overthrown at any moment, there would be much less encouragement to perseverance. But in a kingdom like this there is every encouragement, for there is the assurance:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That all our interests there are safe;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That all our exertions will be crowned with ultimate success,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)That the efforts which we make to do good will have a permanent influence on mankind, and will bless future ages; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)That the reward is certain.</p>
<p style=" ">A man subject to a government about whose continuance there would be the utmost uncertainty, would have little encouragement to labor with a view to any permanent interest. In a government where nothing is settled; where all policy is changing, and where there are constantly vacillating plans, there is no inducement to enter on any enterprise demanding time and risk. But where the policy is settled; where the principles and the laws are firm; where there is evidence of permanency, there is the highest encouragement. The highest possible encouragement of this kind is in the permanent and established kingdom of God. All other governments may be revolutionized; this never will be - all others may have a changeful policy; this has none - all others will be overthrown; this never will.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With reverence and godly fear - </b>With true veneration for God, and with pious devotedness.</p>
