<p style=" "><b>And ye have forgotten the exhortation - </b>This exhortation is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:11-12">Proverbs 3:11-12</span>. The object of the apostle in introducing it here is, to show that afflictions were designed on the part of God to produce some happy effects in the lives of his people, and that they ought, therefore, to bear them patiently. In the previous verses, he directs them to the example of the Saviour. In this verse and the following, for the same object he directs their attention to the design of trials, showing that they are necessary to our welfare, and that they are in fact proof of the paternal care of God. This verse might be rendered as a question. “And have ye forgotten?” etc. This mode of rendering it will agree somewhat better with the design of the apostle.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which speaketh, unto you - </b>Which may be regarded as addressed to you; or which involves a principle as applicable to you as to others. He does not mean that when Solomon used the words, he had reference to them particularly, but that he used them with reference to the children of God, and they might therefore be applied to them. in this way we may regard the language of the Scriptures as addressed to us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As unto children - </b>As if he were addressing children. The language is such as a father uses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My son - </b>It is possible that in these words Solomon may have intended to address a son literally, giving him paternal counsel; or he may have spoken as the Head of the Jewish people, designing to address all the pious, to whom he sustained, as it were, the relation of a father. Or, it is possible also, that it may be regarded as the language of God himself addressing his children. Whichever supposition is adopted, the sense is substantially the same.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Despise not thou the chastening of the Lord - </b>Literally, “Do not regard it as a small matter, or as a trivial thing - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὀλιγώρει</span></span> oligōrei. The Greek word used here does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The word rendered here “chastening” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδεία</span></span> paideia - and also in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6-8">Hebrews 12:6-8</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:9">Hebrews 12:9</span>, “corrected” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδευτὰς</span></span> paideutas - does not refer to affliction in general, but that kind of affliction which is designed to correct us for our faults, or which is of the nature of discipline. The verb properly relates to the training up of a child - including instruction, counsel, discipline, and correction (see this use of the verb in <span class="_0000ff"><u>Act 7:22</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:12">Titus 2:12</span>), and then especially discipline or correction for faults - to “correct, chastise, chasten;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:32">1 Corinthians 11:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:9">2 Corinthians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:19">Revelation 3:19</span>. This is the meaning here; and the idea is, not that God will afflict his people in general, but that if they wander away he will correct them for their faults. He will bring calamity upon them as a punishment for their offences, and in order to bring them back to himself. He will not suffer them to wander away unrebuked and unchecked, but will mercifully reclaim them though by great sufferings. Afflictions have many objects, or produce many happy effects. That referred to here is, that they are means of reclaiming the wandering and erring children of God, and are proofs of his paternal care and love; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:14">2 Samuel 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+12:13-14">2 Samuel 12:13-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:31-34">Psalms 89:31-34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:11-12">Proverbs 3:11-12</span>. Afflictions, which are always sent by God, should not be regarded as small matters, for these reasons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)They are sent for some important purpose, and they should be regarded, therefore, with attentive concern.</p>
<p style=" ">Men “despise” them when:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)They treat them with affected or real unconcern;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)When they fail to receive them as divine admonitions, and regard them as without any intelligent design; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)When they receive them with “expressions” of contempt, and speak of them and of the government of God with scorn.</p>
<p style=" ">It should be a matter of deep concern when we are afflicted in any manner, not to treat the matter lightly, but to derive from our trials all the lessons which they are adapted to produce on the mind.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor faint ... - </b>Bear up patiently under them. This is the second duty. We are first to study their character and design; and secondly, to bear up under them, however severe they may be, and however long they may be continued. “Avoid the extremes of proud insensibility and entire dejection” - Doddridge.</p>
