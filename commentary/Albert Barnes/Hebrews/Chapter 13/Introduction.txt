<p style=" ">The closing chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:0">Hebrews 13:0</span> of this Epistle is made up almost entirely of exhortations to the performance of various practical duties. The exhortations relate to the following points: brotherly love, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:1">Hebrews 13:1</span>; hospitality, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:2">Hebrews 13:2</span>; sympathy with those in bonds, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:3">Hebrews 13:3</span>; fidelity in the marriage relation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span>; contentment, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5-6">Hebrews 13:5-6</span>; submission to those in authority, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7-8">Hebrews 13:7-8</span>; stability in the doctrines of religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:9-15">Hebrews 13:9-15</span>; benevolence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:16">Hebrews 13:16</span>; obedience to those entrusted with office, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:17">Hebrews 13:17</span>; and special prayer for him who wrote this Epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:18-19">Hebrews 13:18-19</span>. The Epistle then closes with a beautiful and impressive benediction, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20-21">Hebrews 13:20-21</span>; with an entreaty that they would receive with favor what had been written, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:22">Hebrews 13:22</span>; with the grateful announcement that Timothy, in whom they doubtless felt a great interest, was set at liberty, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:23">Hebrews 13:23</span>; and with a salutation to all the saints, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:24-25">Hebrews 13:24-25</span>.</p>
