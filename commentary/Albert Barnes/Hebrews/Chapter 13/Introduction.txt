Analysis Of The ChapterThe closing chapter Hebrews 13:0 of this Epistle is made up almost entirely of exhortations to the performance of various practical duties. The exhortations relate to the following points: brotherly love, Hebrews 13:1; hospitality, Hebrews 13:2; sympathy with those in bonds, Hebrews 13:3; fidelity in the marriage relation, Hebrews 13:4; contentment, Hebrews 13:5-6; submission to those in authority, Hebrews 13:7-8; stability in the doctrines of religion, Hebrews 13:9-15; benevolence, Hebrews 13:16; obedience to those entrusted with office, Hebrews 13:17; and special prayer for him who wrote this Epistle, Hebrews 13:18-19. The Epistle then closes with a beautiful and impressive benediction, Hebrews 13:20-21; with an entreaty that they would receive with favor what had been written, Hebrews 13:22; with the grateful announcement that Timothy, in whom they doubtless felt a great interest, was set at liberty, Hebrews 13:23; and with a salutation to all the saints, Hebrews 13:24-25.
