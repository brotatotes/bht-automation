For the bodies of those beasts ... - The word rendered here “for” - γὰρ gar - would be here more properly rendered “moreover.” Stuart. The apostle is not urging a reason for what he had said in the previous verse, but is suggesting a new consideration to excite those whom he addressed to fidelity and perseverance. In the previous verse the consideration was, that Christians are permitted to partake of the benefits of a higher and more perfect sacrifice than the Jews were, and therefore should not relapse into that religion. In this verse the consideration is, that the bodies of the beasts that were burnt were taken without the camp, and that in like manner the Lord Jesus suffered without the gate of Jerusalem, and that we should be willing to go out with him to that sacrifice, whatever reproach or shame it might be attended with.Whose blood is brought into the sanctuary - ; see the notes on Hebrews 9:7, Hebrews 9:12. “Are burned without the camp;” Leviticus 4:12, Leviticus 4:21; Leviticus 16:27. The “camp” here refers to the time when the Israelites were in the wilderness, and lived in encampments. The same custom was observed after the temple was built by conveying the body of the animal slain for a sin-offering on the great day of atonement beyond the walls of Jerusalem to be consumed there. “Whatever,” says Grotius, “was not lawful to be done in the camp, afterward was not lawful to be done in the city.”
