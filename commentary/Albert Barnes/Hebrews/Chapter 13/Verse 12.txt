<p style=" "><b>Wherefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood - </b>That there might be a conformity between his death for sin and the sacrifices which typified it. It is implied here that it was voluntary on the part of Jesus that he suffered out of the city; that is, it was so ordered by Providence that it should be so. This was secured by his being put to death as the result of a judicial trial, and not by popular tumult; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:8">Isaiah 53:8</span>. If he had been killed in a tumult, it is possible that it might have been done as in other cases (compare the case of Zacharias son of Barachias, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span>), even at the altar. As he was subjected, however, to a judicial process, his death was effected with more deliberation, and in the usual form. Hence, he was conducted out of the city, because no criminal was executed within the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Without the gate - </b>Without the gate of Jerusalem; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:17-18">John 19:17-18</span>. The place where he was put to death was called Golgotha, the place of a skull, and hence, the Latin word which we commonly use in speaking of it, Calvary, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:33">Luke 23:33</span>; compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:33">Matthew 27:33</span>. Calvary, as it is now shown, is within the walls of Jerusalem, but there is no reason to believe that this is the place where the Lord Jesus was crucified, for that was outside of the walls of the city. The precise direction from the city is not designated by the sacred writers, nor are there any historical records, or traditional marks by which it can now be known where the exact place was. All that we know on the subject from the New Testament is, that the name was Golgotha; that the place of the crucifixion and sepulchre were near each other; that they were without the gate and nigh to the city, and that they were in a frequented spot; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:20">John 19:20</span>. “This would favor the conclusion that the place was probably upon a great road leading from one of the gates: and such a spot would only be found upon the western or northern sides of the city, on the roads leading toward Joppa or Damascus.” See the question about the place of the crucifixion examined at length in Robinson’s Bibli. Research., vol. ii. pp. 69-80, and Bibliotheca Sacra, No. 1.</p>
