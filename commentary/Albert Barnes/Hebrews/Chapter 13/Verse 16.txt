<p style=" "><b>But to do good, and to communicate, forget not - </b>To communicate or impart to others; that is, to share with them what we have. The Greek word means having in common with others. The meaning is, that they were to show liberality to those who were in want, and were to take special pains not to forget this duty. We are prone to think constantly of our own interests, and there is great danger of forgetting the duty which we owe to the poor and the needy. On the duty here enjoined, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For with such sacrifices God is well pleased - </b>He is pleased with the sacrifices of prayer and of praise; with the offerings of a broken and a contrite heart: but he is especially pleased with the religion which leads us to do good to others. This was eminently the religion of his Son, the Lord Jesus; and to this all true religion prompts. The word “sacrifices” here is not taken in a strict sense, as denoting what is offered as an expiation for sin, or in the sense that we are by doing good to attempt to make atonement for our transgressions, but in the general sense of an offering made to God. God is pleased with this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)Because it shows in us a right state of heart;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Because it accords with his own nature. He does good continually, and he is pleased with all who evince the same spirit.</p>
