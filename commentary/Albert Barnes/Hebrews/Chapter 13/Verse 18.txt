<p style=" "><b>Pray for us - </b>This is a request which the apostle often makes in his own behalf, and in behalf of his fellow laborers in the gospel; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:25">1 Thessalonians 5:25</span>. notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:18-19">Ephesians 6:18-19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For we trust we have a good conscience ... - </b>see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:16">Acts 24:16</span>. The apostle here appeals to the uprightness of his Christian life as a reason why he might claim their sympathy. He was conscious of an aim to do good; he sought the welfare of the church; and having this aim he felt that he might appeal to the sympathy of all Christians in his behalf. It is only when we aim to do right, and to maintain a good conscience, that we can with propriety ask the prayers of others, or claim their sympathy. And if we are “willing in all things to live honestly,” we may expect the sympathy, the prayers, and the affections of all good people.</p>
