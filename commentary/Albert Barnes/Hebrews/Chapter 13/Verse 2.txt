<p style=" "><b>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers - </b>On the duty of hospitality, see a full explanation in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:13">Romans 12:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For thereby some have entertained angels unawares - </b>Without knowing that they were angels. As Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:2">Genesis 18:2</span> ff), and Lot did; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:0">Genesis 19:0</span>. The motive here urged for doing it is, that by entertaining the stranger we may perhaps be honored with the presence of those whose society will be to us an honor and a blessing. It is not well for us to miss the opportunity of the presence, the conversation, and the prayers of the good. The influence of such guests in a family is worth more than it costs to entertain them. If there is danger that we may sometimes receive those of an opposite character. yet it is not wise on account of such possible danger, to lose the opportunity of entertaining those whose presence would be a blessing. Many a parent owes the conversion of a child to the influence of a pious stranger in his family; and the hope that this may occur, or that our own souls may be blessed, should make us ready, at all proper times, to welcome the feet of the stranger to our doors. Many a man, if, he had been accosted as Abraham was at the door of his tent by strangers, would have turned them rudely away; many a one in the situation of Lot would have sent the unknown guests rudely from his door; but who can estimate what would have been the results of such a course on the destiny of those good people and their families? For a great number of instances in which the pagan were supposed to have entertained the gods, though unknown to them, see Wetstein in loc.</p>
