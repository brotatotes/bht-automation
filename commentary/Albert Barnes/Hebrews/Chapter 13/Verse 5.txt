<p style=" "><b>Let your conversation - </b>Your “conduct” - for so the word “conversation” is used in the Scriptures; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>.</p>

The particular reason here given for contentment is, that God has promised never to leave his people. Compare with this the beautiful argument of the Saviour in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span> ff.</p>

<p style=" "><b>I will never leave thee nor forsake thee - </b>see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+31:6">Deuteronomy 31:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+1:5">Joshua 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+28:20">1 Chronicles 28:20</span>. Substantially the same expression is found in each of those places, and all of them contain the principle on which the apostle here relies, that God will not forsake his people.</p>
