<p style=" "><b>So that we may boldly say - </b>Without any hesitation or doubt, In all times of perplexity and threatening want; in all times when we scarcely know whence the supplies for our necessities are to come, we may put our trust in God, and be assured that he will not leave us to suffer. In the facts which occur under the providential dealings, there is a ground for confidence on this subject which is not always exercised even by good people. It remains yet to be shown that they who exercise simple trust in God for the supply of their wants are ever forsaken; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:25">Psalms 37:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Lord is my helper - </b>Substantially this sentiment is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+27:1">Psalms 27:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:6">Psalms 118:6</span>. The apostle does not adduce it as a quotation, but as language which a true Christian may employ. The sentiment is beautiful and full of consolation. What can we fear if we have the assurance that the Lord is on our side, and that he will help us? Man can do no more to us than he permits, and of course no more than will be for our own good; and under whatever trials we may be placed, we need be under no painful apprehensions, for God will be our protector and our friend.</p>
