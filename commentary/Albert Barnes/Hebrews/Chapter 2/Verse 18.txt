Jesus is thus able to alleviate the sufferer. In all our temptations and trials let us remember: (1) That he suffered more - infinitely more - than we can do, and that in all our sorrows we shall never reach what he endured. We enter no region of trial where he has not gone beyond us; we tread no dark and gloomy way where he has not gone before us. (2) That he is to us “a brother,” for he “is not ashamed to call us brethren.” He had a nature like ours; he condescended to appear as one of our race, with all the innocent propensities and passions of a man. What matchless condescension! And what an honor for us to be permitted to address him as an “older brother,” and to know that he feels a deep sympathy in our woes! (3) Let us then, in all times of affliction, look to him. Go not, suffering Christian, to philosophy; attempt not to deaden your feelings by the art of the Stoic; but go at once to the Saviour - the great, sympathizing High Priest, who is able to succour you - and rest your burdens on him. “His heart is made of tenderness, His soul is filled with love. “Touch’d with a sympathy within, He knows our feeble frame; He knows what sore temptations mean, For he has felt the same. “Then let our humble faith address. His mercy and his power; We shall obtain delivering grace, In every trying hour.”
