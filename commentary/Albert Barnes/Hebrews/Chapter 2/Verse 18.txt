<p style=" ">Jesus is thus able to alleviate the sufferer. In all our temptations and trials let us remember:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) That he suffered more - infinitely more - than we can do, and that in all our sorrows we shall never reach what he endured. We enter no region of trial where he has not gone beyond us; we tread no dark and gloomy way where he has not gone before us.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) That he is to us “a brother,” for he “is not ashamed to call us brethren.” He had a nature like ours; he condescended to appear as one of our race, with all the innocent propensities and passions of a man. What matchless condescension! And what an honor for us to be permitted to address him as an “older brother,” and to know that he feels a deep sympathy in our woes!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) Let us then, in all times of affliction, look to him. Go not, suffering Christian, to philosophy; attempt not to deaden your feelings by the art of the Stoic; but go at once to the Saviour - the great, sympathizing High Priest, who is able to succour you - and rest your burdens on him.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “His heart is made of tenderness,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> His soul is filled with love.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Touch’d with a sympathy within,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> He knows our feeble frame;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> He knows what sore temptations mean,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> For he has felt the same.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Then let our humble faith address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> His mercy and his power;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> We shall obtain delivering grace,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> In every trying hour.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> <br/><br/> </p>
