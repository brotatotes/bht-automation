<p style=" "><b>God also bearing them witness - </b>By miracles. Giving them the sanction of his authority, or showing that they were sent by him. No man can work a miracle by his own power. When the dead are raised, the deaf made to hear and the blind to see by a word, it is the power of God alone that does it. He thus becomes a “witness” to the divine appointment of him by whose instrumentality the miracle is performed; or furnishes an attestation that what he says is true; see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:3">Acts 14:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With signs and wonders. - </b>These words are usually connected in the New Testament. The word rendered “signs” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεῖον</span></span> sēmeion - means any miraculous event that is suited to show that what had been predicted by a prophet would certainly take place; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>; compare note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:11">Isaiah 7:11</span>. A “wonder” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τέρας</span></span> teras - denotes a portent, or prodigy - something that is suited to excite wonder or amazement - and hence, a miracle. The words together refer to the various miracles which were performed by the Lord Jesus and his apostles, designed to confirm the truth of the Christian religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And with divers miracles. - </b>Various miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, etc. The miracles were not of one class merely, but were various, so that all pretence of deception should be taken away.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And gifts of the Holy Ghost. - </b>Margin, “Distributions.” The various influences of the Holy Spirit enabling them to speak different languages, and to perform works beyond the power of man; see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4-11">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to his will - </b>As he chose. He acted as a sovereign in this. He gave them where he pleased, and imparted them in such measure as he chose. The sense of this whole passage is, “The gospel has been promulgated to man in a solemn manner. It was first published by the Lord of glory himself. It was confirmed by the most impressive and solemn miracles. It is undoubtedly a revelation from heaven; was given in more solemn circumstances than the Law of Moses, and its threatenings are more to be dreaded than those of the Law. Beware, therefore, how you trifle with it, or disregard it. It cannot be neglected with safety; its neglect or rejection must be attended with condemnation.”</p>
