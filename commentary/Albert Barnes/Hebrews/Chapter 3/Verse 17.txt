<p style=" "><b>But with whom was he grieved forty years? - </b>With whom was he angry; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:10">Hebrews 3:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was it not with them that had sinned - </b>That had sinned in various ways - by rebellion, murmuring, unbelief. As God was angry with them for their sins, we have the same reason to apprehend that he will be angry with us if we sin; and we should, therefore, be on our guard against that unbelief which would lead us to depart from him; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whose carcasses fell ... - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:29">Numbers 14:29</span>. That is, they all died, and were left on the sands of the desert. The whole generation was strewed along in the way to Canaan. All of those who had seen the wonders that God had done “in the land of Ham;” who had been rescued in so remarkable a manner from oppression, were thus cut down, and died in the deserts through which they were passing; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+26:64-65">Numbers 26:64-65</span>. Such an example of the effects of revolt against God, and of unbelief, was well suited to admonish Christians in the time of the apostle, and is suited to admonish us now, of the danger of the sin of unbelief. We are not to suppose that all of those who thus died were excluded from heaven. Moses and Aaron were among the number of those who were not permitted to enter the promised land, but of their piety there can be no doubt; Beyond all question, also, there were many others of that generation who were truly pious. But at different times they seem all to have partaken of the prevalent feelings of discontent, and were all involved in the sweeping condemnation that they should die in the wilderness.</p>
