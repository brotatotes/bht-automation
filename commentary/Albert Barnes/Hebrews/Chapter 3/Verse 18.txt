<p style=" "><b>And to whom sware he - </b>note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:11">Hebrews 3:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But to them that believed not - </b>That did not confide in God; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+1:32">Deuteronomy 1:32</span>. “Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God.” In consequence of this want of faith, God solemnly sware unto them that they should not enter into the promised land; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+1:34-35">Deuteronomy 1:34-35</span>. “And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, “Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I sware to give unto your fathers, save Caleb,” etc. The distinct reason, therefore, assigned by Moses why they did not enter the promised land, was a want of faith, and this accords directly with the design of the apostle here. He is exhorting those whom he addressed to beware of an evil heart of unbelief; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>. He says that it was such a heart that excluded the Hebrews from the promised land. The same thing, says he, must exclude you from heaven - the promised home of the believer; and if that firm confidence in God and his promises which he requires is wanting, you will be excluded from the world of eternal rest.</p>
