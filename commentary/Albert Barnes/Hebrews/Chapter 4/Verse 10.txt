<p style=" "><b>For he that is entered into rest - </b>That is, the man who is so happy as to reach heaven, will enjoy a rest similar to what God had when he finished the work of creation. It will be:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)A cessation from toil; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)It will be a rest similar to that of God - the same kind of enjoyment, the same freedom from care, anxiety, and labor.</p>
<p style=" ">How happy then are they who have entered into heaven! Their toils are over. Their labors are done. Never again will they know fatigue. Never more will they feel anxious care. Let us learn then:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) Not to mourn improperly for those who have left us and gone to heaven. Happy in the rest of God, why should not we rejoice? Why wish them back again in a world of toil!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) Let us in our toils look forward to the world of rest. Our labors will all be over. The weary man will lay down his burden; the exhausted frame will know fatigue no more. Rest is sweet at night after the toils of day; how much more sweet will it be in heaven after the toils of life! Let us.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) Labor while is is called today. Soon we shall cease from our work. All that we have to do is to be done soon. We shall soon cease from “our” work as God did from his. What we have to do for the salvation of children, brothers, sisters, friends, and for the world, is to be done soon. From the abodes of bliss we shall not be sent forth to speak to our kindred of the blessedness of that world, or to admonish our friends to escape from the place of despair. The pastor will not come again to warn and invite his people; the parent will not come again to tell his children of the Saviour and of heaven; the neighbor will not come to admonish his neighbor; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:24-29">Luke 16:24-29</span>. We shall all have ceased from our work as God did from his; and never again shall we speak to a living friend to invite him to heaven.</p>
