<p style=" "><b>Let us therefore labour - </b>Let us earnestly strive. Since there is a rest whose attainment is worth all our efforts; since so many have failed of reaching it by their unbelief, and since there is so much danger that we may fail of it also, let us give all diligence that we may enter into it. Heaven is never obtained but by diligence; and no one enters there who does not earnestly desire it, and who does not make a sincere effort to reach it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of unbelief - </b>Margin, “disobedience.” The word “unbelief” best expresses the sense, as the apostle was showing that this was the principal thing that prevented people from entering into heaven; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>.</p>
