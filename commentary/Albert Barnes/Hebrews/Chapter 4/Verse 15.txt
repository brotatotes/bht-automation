<p style=" "><b>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched - </b>Our High Priest is not cold and unfeeling. That is, we have one who is abundantly qualified to sympathize with us in our afflictions, and to whom, therefore, we may look for aid and support in trials. Had we a high priest who was cold and heartless; who simply performed the external duties of his office without entering into the sympathies of those who came to seek for pardon; who had never experienced any trials, and who felt himself above those who sought his aid, we should necessarily feel disheartened in attempting to overcome our sins, and to live to God. His coldness would repel us; his stateliness would awe us; his distance and reserve would keep us away, and perhaps render us indifferent to all desire to be saved. But tenderness and sympathy attract those who are feeble, and kindness does more than anything else to encourage those who have to encounter difficulties and dangers; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16-18">Hebrews 2:16-18</span>. Such tenderness and sympathy has our Great High Priest.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But was in all points tempted like as we are - </b>“Tried” as we are; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:18">Hebrews 2:18</span>. He was subjected to all the kinds of trial to which we can be, and he is, therefore, able to sympathize with us and to aid us. He was tempted - in the literal sense; he was persecuted; he was poor; he was despised; he suffered physical pain; he endured the sorrows of a lingering and most cruel death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yet without sin - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:22">1 Peter 2:22</span>. “Who did no sin;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9">Isaiah 53:9</span>, “He had done no violence, neither was there any deceit in his mouth;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span>, “Who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.” The importance of this fact - that the Great High Priest of the Christian profession was “without sin,” the apostle illustrates at length in Heb. 7–9. He here merely alludes to it, and says that one who was “without sin” was able to assist those who were sinners, and who put their trust in him.</p>
