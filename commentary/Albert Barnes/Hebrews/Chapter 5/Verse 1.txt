<p style=" "><b>For every high priest - </b>That is, among the Jews, for the remarks relate to the Jewish system. The Jews had one high priest who was regarded as the successor of Aaron. The word “high priest” means “chief priest;” that is, a priest of higher rank and office than others. By the original regulation the Jewish high priest was to be of the family of Aaron <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:9">Exodus 29:9</span>, though in later times the office was frequently conferred on others. In the time of the Romans it had become venal, and the Mosaic regulation was disregarded; 2 Macc. 4:7; Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. xv. 3. 1. It was no longer held for life, so that there were several persons at one time to whom was given the title of high priest. The high priest was at the head of religious affairs, and was the ordinary judge of all that pertained to religion, and even of the general justice of the Hebrew commonwealth; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+17:8-12">Deuteronomy 17:8-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+19:17">Deuteronomy 19:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:5">Deuteronomy 21:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+27:9-10">Deuteronomy 27:9-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">He only had the privilege of entering the most holy place once a year, on the great day of atonement, to make expiation for the sins of the people; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:0">Leviticus 16:0</span>. He was to be the son of one who had married a virgin, and was to be free from any corporeal defect; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+21:13">Leviticus 21:13</span>. The “dress” of the high priest was much more costly and magnificent than that of the inferior order of priests; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+39:1-7">Exodus 39:1-7</span>. He wore a mantle or robe - <span class="_800000">מציל</span> m<sup>e</sup> ̀iyl - of blue, with the borders embroidered with pomegranates in purple and scarlet; an “ephod” - <span class="_800000">אפוד</span> ‛ephowd - made of cotton, with crimson, purple, and blue, and ornamented with gold worn over the robe or mantle, without sleeves, and divided below the arm-pits into two parts or halves, of which one was in front covering the breast, and the other behind covering the back. In the ephod was a breastplate of curious workmanship, and on the head a mitre. The breastplate was a piece of broidered work about ten inches square, and was made double, so as to answer the purpose of a pouch or bag. It was adorned with twelve precious stones, each one having the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The two upper corners of the breastplate were fastened to the ephod, and the two lower to the girdle.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Taken from among men - </b>There maybe an allusion here to the fact that the great High Priest of the Christian dispensation had a higher than human origin, and was selected from a rank far above people. Or it may be that the meaning is, that every high priest on earth - including all under the old dispensation and the great high priest of the new - is ordained with reference to the welfare of people, and to bring some valuable offering forman to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is ordained for men - </b>Is set apart or consecrated for the welfare of people. The Jewish high priest was set apart to his office with great solemnity; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:0">Exodus 29:0</span>:</p>
<p style=" "><b>In things pertaining to God - </b>In religious matters, or with reference to the worship and service of God. He was not to be a civil ruler, nor a teacher of science, nor a military leader, but his business was to superintend the affairs of religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That he may offer both gifts - </b>That is, thank-offerings, or oblations which would be the expressions of gratitude. Many such offerings were made by the Jews under the laws of Moses, and the high priest was the medium by whom they were to be presented to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And sacrifices for sin - </b>Bloody offerings; offerings made of slain beasts. The blood of expiation was sprinkled by him on the mercyseat, and he was the appointed medium by which such sacrifices were to be presented to God; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:6-10">Hebrews 9:6-10</span>. We may remark here:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That the proper office of a priest is to present a “sacrifice” for sin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)It is “improper” to give the name “priest” to a minister of the gospel. The reason is, that he offers no sacrifice; he sprinkles no blood. He is appointed to “preach the word,” and to lead the devotions of the church, but not to offer sacrifice. Accordingly the New Testament preserves entire consistency on this point, for the name “priest” is never once given to the apostles, or to any other minister of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" ">Among the Papists there is “consistency” - though gross and dangerous error - in the use of the word “priest.” They believe that the minister of religion offers up” the real body and blood of our Lord;” that the bread and wine are changed by the words of consecration into the “body and blood, the soul and divinity, of the Lord Jesus” (Decrees of the Council of Trent), and that “this” is really offered by him as a sacrifice. Accordingly they “elevate the host;” that is, lift up, or offer the sacrifice and, require all to bow before it and worship, and with this view they are “consistent” in retaining the word “priest.” But why should this name be applied to a “Protestant” minister, who believes that all this is blasphemy, and who claims to have no “sacrifice” to offer when he comes to minister before God? The great sacrifice; the one sufficient atonement, has been offered - and the ministers of the gospel are appointed to proclaim that truth to men, not to offer sacrifices for sin.</p>
