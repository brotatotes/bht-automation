<p style=" "><b>Called of God - </b>Addressed by him, or greeted by him. The word used here does not mean that he was “appointed” by God, or “called” to the office, in the sense in which we often use the word, but simply that he was “addressed” as such, to wit, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1-7">Psalms 110:1-7</span>;</p>
<p style=" "><b>An high priest - </b>In the Septuagint <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:6">Hebrews 5:6</span>, above, it is rendered “priest” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἱερεύς</span></span> hiereus - but the Hebrew word - <span class="_800000">כהן</span> kohēn - is often used to denote the high priest, and may mean either; see Septuagint in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:3">Leviticus 4:3</span>. Whether the word “priest,” or “high priest,” be used here, does not affect the argument of the apostle. “After the order of Melchizedek.” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:6">Hebrews 5:6</span>.</p>
