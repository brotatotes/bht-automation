Called of God - Addressed by him, or greeted by him. The word used here does not mean that he was “appointed” by God, or “called” to the office, in the sense in which we often use the word, but simply that he was “addressed” as such, to wit, in Psalms 110:1-7;An high priest - In the Septuagint Psalms 110:4, and in Hebrews 5:6, above, it is rendered “priest” - ἱερεύς hiereus - but the Hebrew word - כהן kohēn - is often used to denote the high priest, and may mean either; see Septuagint in Leviticus 4:3. Whether the word “priest,” or “high priest,” be used here, does not affect the argument of the apostle. “After the order of Melchizedek.” see the notes at Hebrews 5:6.
