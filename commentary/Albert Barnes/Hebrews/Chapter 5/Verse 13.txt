<p style=" "><b>For every one that useth milk - </b>Referring to the food of children. The apostle has in view here those Christians who resemble children in this respect, that they are not capable of receiving the stronger food adapted to those of mature age.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is unskilful - </b>Inexperienced; who has not skill to perform anything. The word is properly applied to one who has not experience or skill, or who is ignorant. Here it does not mean that they were not true Christians - but that they had not the experience or skill requisite to enable them to understand the higher mysteries of the Christian religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the word of righteousness - </b>The doctrine respecting the way in which men become righteous, or the way of salvation by the Redeemer; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For He is a babe - </b>That is, in religious matters. He understands the great system only as a child may. It is common to speak of “babes in knowledge,” as denoting a state of ignorance.</p>
