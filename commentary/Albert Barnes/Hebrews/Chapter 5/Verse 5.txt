<p style=" "><b>So also Christ glorified not himself; - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54">John 8:54</span>. The meaning is, that Jesus was not ambitious; that he did not obtrude himself into the great office of high priest; he did not enter upon its duties without being regularly called to it. Paul claimed that Christ held that office; but, as he was not descended front Aaron, and as no one might perform its duties without being regularly called to it, it was incumbent on him to show that Jesus was not an intruder, but had a regular vocation to that work. This he shows by a reference to two passages of the Old Testament.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But he that said unto him - </b>That is, he who said to him “Thou art my Son,” exalted him to that office. He received his appointment from him. This was decisive in the case, and this was sufficient, if it could be made out, for the only claim which Aaron and his successors could have to the office, was the fact that they had received their appointment front God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou art my Son - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>. See this passage explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:38">Acts 13:38</span>. It is used here with reference to the designation to the priestly office, though in the Psalm more particularly to the anointing to the office of king. The propriety of this application is founded on the fact that the language in the Psalm is of so general a character, that it may be applied to “any” exaltation of the Redeemer, or to any honor conferred on him. It is used here with strict propriety, for Paul is saying that Jesus did not exalt “himself,” and in proof of that he refers to the fact that God had exalted him by calling him his “Son.”</p>
