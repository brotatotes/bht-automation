Sufferings were necessary to the “completeness” or the “finish” of his character as a Saviour, not to his moral perfection, for he was always without sin; see this explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>.</p>

It is to be traced wholly to his sufferings and death; see the note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>. “Unto all them that obey him.” It is not to save those who live in sin. Only those who “obey” him have any evidence that they will be saved; see the note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:15">John 14:15</span>.</p>
