<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:10-11">Hebrews 5:10-11</span>, the apostle had said that the Lord Jesus was called to the office of high priest after the order of Melchizedek, and that there were many things to be said of him which were not easy to be understood. They had not, he says, advanced as far in the knowledge of the true religion as might have been reasonably expected, but had rather gone back; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12-14">Hebrews 5:12-14</span>. The design of this chapter seems to be to warn them against the danger of going back entirely, and to encourage them to make the highest attainments possible in the knowledge of Christianity, and in the divine life. The apostle would keep them from entire apostasy, and would excite them to make all the advances which they possibly could make, and particularly he designs to prepare them to receive what he had yet to say about the higher doctrines of the Christian religion. In doing this he presents the following considerations:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) An exhortation to leave the elements or rudiments of the Christian religion, and to go on to the contemplation of the higher doctrines. The elements were the doctrines of repentance, faith, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. These entered into the very nature of Christianity. They were its first principles, and were indispensable. The higher doctrines related to other matters, which the apostle called them now to contemplate; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:1-3">Hebrews 6:1-3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He warns them, in the most solemn manner, against apostasy. He assures them that if they should apostatize, it would be impossible to renew them again. They could not fall away from grace and again be renewed; they could not, after having been Christians and then apostatizing, be recovered. Their fall in that case would be final and irrecoverable, for there was no other way by which they could be saved; and by rejecting the Christian scheme, they would reject the only plan by which they could ever be brought to heaven. By this solemn consideration, therefore, he warns them of the danger of going back from their exalted hopes, or of neglecting the opportunities which they had to advance to the knowledge of the higher truths of religion; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4-6">Hebrews 6:4-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) This sentiment is illustrated <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:7-8">Hebrews 6:7-8</span> by a striking and beautiful figure drawn from agriculture. The sentiment was, that they who did not improve their advantage, and grow in the knowledge of the gospel, but who should go back and apostatize, would inevitably be destroyed. They could not be renewed and saved. It will be says the apostle, as it is with the earth. That which receives the rain that falls, and that bears its proper increase for the use of man, partakes of the divine blessing. That which does not - which bears only thorns and briers - is rejected, and is nigh to cursing, and will be burned with fire.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Yet the apostle says, he hoped better things of them. They had, indeed, receded from what they had been. They had not made the advances which he says they might have done. But still, there was reason to hope that they would not wholly apostatize, and be cast off by God. They had shown that they had true religion, and he believed that God would not forget the evidence which they had furnished that they loved him; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:9-10">Hebrews 6:9-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) He expresses his earnest wish that they all would show the same diligence until they attained the full assurance of hope; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:11-12">Hebrews 6:11-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) To encourage them in this, he refers them to the solemn oath which God had taken, and his sacred covenant with them confirmed by an oath, in order that they might have true consolation, and be sustained in the temptations and trials of life. That hope was theirs. It was sure and steadfast. It entered into that within the veil; it had been confirmed by him who had entered heaven as the great High Priest after the order of Melchizedek; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:13-20">Hebrews 6:13-20</span>. By such considerations he would guard them from the danger of apostasy; he would encourage them to diligence in the divine life; and he would seek to prepare them to welcome the more high and difficult doctrines of the Christian religion.</p>
