For God is not unrighteous - God will do no wrong. He will not forget or fail to reward the endeavors of his people to promote his glory, and to do good. The meaning here is, that by their kindness in ministering to the wants of the saints, they had given full evidence of true piety. If God should forget that, it would be “unrighteous: (1)Because there was a propriety that it should be remembered; and, (2)Because it is expressly promised that it shall not fail of reward; Matthew 10:42.Your work - Particularly in ministering to the wants of the saints.Labour of love - Deeds of benevolence when there was no hope of recompense, or when love was the motive in doing it.Which ye have showed toward his name - Toward him - for the word “name” is often used to denote the person himself. They had showed that they loved God by their kindness to his people; Matthew 25:40, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.In that ye have ministered to the saints - You have supplied their wants. This may refer either to the fact that they contributed to supply the wants of the poor members of the church (compare the note on Galatians 2:10), or it may refer to some special acts of kindness which they had shown to suffering and persecuted Christians. It is not possible now to know to what particular acts the apostle refers. We may learn. (1)That to show kindness to Christians, because they are Christians, is an important evidence of piety. (2)It will in no case be unrewarded. God is not “unjust;” and he will remember an act of kindness shown to his people - even though it be nothing but giving a cup of cold water.
