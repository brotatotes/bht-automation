<p style=" "><b>And we desire that every one of you - </b>We wish that every member of the church should exhibit the same endeavor to do good until they attain to the full assurance of hope. It is implied here that the full assurance of hope is to be obtained by a persevering effort to lead a holy life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The same diligence - </b>The same strenuous endeavor, the same ardor and zeal.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the full assurance of hope - </b>In order to obtain the full assurance of hope. The word rendered “full assurance,” means firm persuasion, and refers to a state of mind where there is the fullest conviction, or where there is no doubt; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:22">Hebrews 10:22</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:21">Romans 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Ti 4:5</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span>, where the same word, in different forms, occurs. Hope is a compound emotion (see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>), made up of an earnest “desire” for an object, and a corresponding “expectation” of obtaining it. The hope of heaven is made up of an earnest “wish” to reach heaven, and a corresponding “expectation” of it, or “reason to believe” that it will be ours. The full assurance of that hope exists where there is the highest desire of heaven, and such corresponding evidence of personal piety as to leave no doubt that it will be ours.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the end - </b>To the end of life. The apostle wished that they would persevere in such acts of piety to the end of their course, as to have their hope of heaven fully established, and to leave no doubt on the mind that they were sincere Christians. Hence, learn:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That full assurance of hope is to be obtained only by holy living.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)It is only when that is persevered in that it can be obtained.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)It is not by visions and raptures; by dreams and revelations that it can now be acquired, for God imparts no such direct revelation now.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)It is usually only as the result of a life of consistent piety that such an assurance is to be obtained. No man can have it who does not persevere in holy living, and they who do obtain it usually secure it only near the end of a life of eminent devotedness to God.</p>
<p style=" ">God could impart it at once when the soul is converted, but such is the tendency of man to indolence and sloth that even good people would then relax their efforts, and sit down contented, feeling that they had now the undoubted prospect of heaven. As it is, it is held out as a prize to be won - as that whose acquisition is to cheer us in our old age, when the warfare is over, and when amidst the infirmities of years, and the near prospect of death, we need special consolation; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6-7">2 Timothy 4:6-7</span>.</p>
