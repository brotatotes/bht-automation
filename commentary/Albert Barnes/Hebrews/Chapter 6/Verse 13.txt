<p style=" "><b>For when God made promise to Abraham - </b>That he would bless him, and multiply his seed as the stars of heaven; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16-17">Genesis 22:16-17</span>. The object of introducing this example here is, to encourage those to whom the apostle was writing to persevere in the Christian life, This he does by showing that God had given the highest possible assurance of his purpose to bless his people, by an oath. Reference is made to Abraham in this argument, probably, for two reasons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Because the “example” of Abraham was just in point. He had persevered. He had relied firmly and solely on the promise of God. He did this when appearances were much against the fulfillment of the promise, and he thus showed the advantage of perseverance and fidelity in the cause of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because he could swear by no greater - </b>There is no being greater than God. In taking an oath among people it is always implied that the appeal is to one of superior power, who is able to punish for its infraction. But this could not occur in the case of God himself. There was no greater being than himself, and the oath, therefore, was by his own existence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He sware by himself - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16">Genesis 22:16</span>. “By myself have I sworn;” compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:23">Isaiah 45:23</span>. In an oath of this kind God pledges his veracity; declares that the event shall be as certain as his existence; and secures it by all the perfections of his nature. The usual form of the oath is, “As I live, saith the Lord;” see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:21">Numbers 14:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:28">Numbers 14:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+33:11">Ezekiel 33:11</span>.</p>
