<p style=" "><b>And this will we do - </b>We will make these advances toward a higher state of knowledge and piety. Paul had confidence that they would do it (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:9-10">Hebrews 6:9-10</span>), and though they had lingered long around the elements of Christian knowledge, he believed that they would yet go on to make higher attainments.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If God permit - </b>This is not to be interpreted as if God was “unwilling” that they should make such advances, or as if it were “doubtful” whether he would allow it if they made an honest effort, and their lives were spared; but it is a phrase used to denote their “dependence” on him. It is equivalent to saying, “if he would spare their lives, their health, and their reason; if he would continue the means of grace, and would impart his Holy Spirit; if he would favor their efforts and crown them with success, they would make these advances.” In reference to anything that we undertake, however pleasing to God in itself, it is proper to recognize our entire dependence on God; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:13-15">James 4:13-15</span>; compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:5">John 15:5</span>.</p>
