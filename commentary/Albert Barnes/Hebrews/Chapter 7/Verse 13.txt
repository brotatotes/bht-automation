<p style=" "><b>For he of whom these things are spoken - </b>The Lord Jesus, the Messiah, to whom they had reference. The things here spoken of pertain to his office as priest; his being of the order of Melchizedek. The apostle here “assumes” it as a point concerning which there could be no dispute, that these things referred to the Lord Jesus. Those whom he addressed would not be disposed to call this in question, and his argument had conducted him to this conclusion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Pertaineth to another tribe - </b>To the tribe of Judah; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:14">Hebrews 7:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of which no man gave attendance at the altar - </b>The priestly office pertained only to the tribe of Levi. No one of the tribe of Judah had any part in the performance of the duties of that office. This was settled by the Jewish Law.</p>
