<p style=" "><b>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah - </b>It is well known: it cannot be a matter of dispute. About the fact that the Lord Jesus was of the tribe of Judah, there could be no doubt; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:3">Matthew 1:3</span>. But probably the apostle means here to refer to more than that simple fact. It was a doctrine of the Old Testament, and was admitted by the Jews, that the Messiah was to be of that tribe; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:6">Matthew 2:6</span>. This was an additional consideration to show that there was to be a change of some kind in the office of the priesthood, since it was declared (Ps. cx) that the Messiah was to be a priest. The fact that the Messiah is to be of the tribe of Judah is still admitted by the Jews. As their distinction of tribes now, however, is broken up, and as it is impossible for them to tell who belongs to the tribe of Judah, it is held by them that when he comes this will be made known by miracle.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood - </b>That is, in the Mosaic laws respecting the office of priest, this tribe is not mentioned. All the arrangements pertain to the tribe of Levi.</p>
