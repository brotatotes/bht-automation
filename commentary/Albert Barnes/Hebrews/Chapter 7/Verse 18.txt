<p style=" "><b>For there is verily a disannulling - </b>A setting aside. The Law which existed before in regard to the priesthood becomes now abrogated in consequence of the change which has been made in the priesthood; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:12">Hebrews 7:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the commandment - </b>Relating to the office of priest, or to the ceremonial rites in general. This does not refer to the moral law, as if that was abrogated, for:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)The reasoning of the apostle does not pertain to that, and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That law cannot be abrogated. It grows out of the nature of things, and must be perpetual and universal.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Going before - </b>Going before the Christian dispensation and introducing it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the weakness and unprofitableness thereof - </b>That is, it was not adapted to save man; it had not power to accomplish what was necessary to be done in human salvation. It answered the end for which it was designed - that of introducing a more perfect plan, and then vanished as a matter of course. It did not expiate guilt; it did not give peace to the conscience; it did not produce perfection <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span>, and therefore it gave place to a better system.</p>
