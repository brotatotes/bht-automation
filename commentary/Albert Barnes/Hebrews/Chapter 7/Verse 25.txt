<p style=" "><b>Wherefore he is able also - </b>As he ever lives, and ever intercedes, he has power to save. He does not begin the work of salvation, and then relinquish it by reason of death, but he lives on as long as it is necessary that anything should be done for the salvation of his people. We need a Saviour who has power, and Christ has shown that he has all the power which is needful to rescue man from eternal death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the uttermost - </b>This does not mean simply “forever” - but that he has power to save them so that their salvation shall be “complete” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς τὸ παντελὲς</span></span> eis to panteles. He does not abandon the work midway; he does not begin a work which he is unable to finish. He can aid us as long as we need anything done for our salvation; he can save all who will entrust their salvation to his hands.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That come unto God by him - </b>In his name; or depending on him. To come to God, is to approach him for pardon and salvation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Seeing he ever liveth - </b>He does not die as the Jewish priests did.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To make intercession for them - </b>see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>. He constantly presents the merits of his death as a reason why we should be saved. The precise mode, however, in which he makes intercession in heaven for his people is not revealed. The general meaning is, that he undertakes their cause, and assists them in overcoming their foes and in their endeavors to live a holy life; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>. He does in heaven whatever is necessary to obtain for us grace and strength; secures the aid which we need against our foes; and is the pledge or security for us that the law shall be honored, and the justice and truth of God maintained, though we are saved. It is reasonable to presume that this is somehow by the presentation of the merits of his great sacrifice, and that that is the ground on which all this grace is obtained. As that is infinite, we need not fear that it will ever be exhausted.</p>
