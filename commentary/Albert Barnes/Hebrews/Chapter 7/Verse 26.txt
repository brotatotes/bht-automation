<p style=" "><b>For such an High Priest became us - </b>Was suited to our condition. That is, there was that in our character and circumstances which demanded that a high priest for us should be personally holy. It was not requisite merely that he should have great power; or that he should be of a rank superior to that of the Jewish priesthood; but there was a special propriety that he should surpass all others in “moral” purity. Other priests were mere mortal men, and it was necessary that their office should pass to other hands; they were “sinful” men also, and it was necessary that sacrifices should be made for themselves as well as others. We need, however, a different priest. We need not only one who ever lives, but one who is perfectly holy, and who has no need to bring an offering for himself, and all the merit of whose sacrifice, therefore, may be ours. Such an high priest we have in the person of the Lord Jesus; and there is no truth more interesting, and no proposition more susceptible of proof, than that he is exactly Fitted to man. In his moral character, and in the great work which he has accomplishcd, he is just such a Saviour as is adapted to the wants of ignorant, fallen, wretched, sinful man. He is benevolent, and pities our woes; wise, and is able to enlighten our ignorance; compassionate, and ready to forgive our faults. He has made such a sacrifice as was necessary to put away our guilt, and offers such intercession as we need to have offered for us in order that we may be preserved from falling.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who is holy - </b>Not merely “outwardly righteous,” but pure in heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Harmless - </b>Not injuring anyone. To no one did he do wrong. Neither to their name, person, or property, did he ever do injury; nor will he ever. He is the only one who has lived on earth of whom it could be said that he never, in any way, did wrong to another.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Undefiled - </b>By sin; by any improper desire or passion. He was unstained by crime; “unspotted from the world.” Sin always defiles the soul; but from every such pollution the Lord Jesus was free.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Separate from sinners - </b>That is, he did not associate with them as such. He did not partake of their feelings, plans, pleasures. Though he mingled with them, yet it was merely to do them good, and in all his life there was an entire separation from the feelings, principles, and views of a sinful world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And made higher than the heavens - </b>Exalted above the visible heavens; that is, at the right hand of God; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span> note. We needed a high priest who is thus exalted that he may manage our cause before the throne of God.</p>
