<p style=" "><b>But he whose descent is not counted from them - </b>Melchizedek. The word “descent” is “pedigree” in the margin. The meaning is, that he was not “in the same genealogy” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μὴ γενεαλογούμενος</span></span> mē genealogoumenos - he was not of the order of Levitical priests. That Melchizedek is meant there can be no doubt; at the same time, also, the thought is presented with prominence on which Paul so much insists, that he was of a different order from the Levitical priesthood.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And blessed him - </b>Blessed him as a priest of God; blessed him in such a manner as to imply acknowledged superiority; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:1">Hebrews 7:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That had the promises - </b>The promise that he should have a numerous posterity; that in him all the nations of the earth should be blessed; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12-16">Hebrews 6:12-16</span>.</p>
