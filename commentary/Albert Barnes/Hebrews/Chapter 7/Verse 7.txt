<p style=" "><b>And without all contradiction - </b>It is an admitted principle; a point about which there can be no dispute.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The less is blessed of the better - </b>The act of pronouncing a blessing is understood to imply superiority of rank, age, or station. So when a father lays his hand on his children and blesses them, it is understood to be the act of one superior in age, venerableness, and authority; when a prophet pronounced a blessing on the people, the same thing was understood, and the same is true also when a minister of religion pronounces a blessing on a congregation. It is the act of one who is understood to sustain an office above the people on whom the blessing is pronounced. This was understood of the Saviour when parents brought their children to him to lay his hands on them and bless them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13">Matthew 19:13</span>; and the same was true of Jacob when dying he blessed the sons of Joseph; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:21">Hebrews 11:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:5-20">Genesis 48:5-20</span>. The word “less” here means the one of inferior rank; who is less in office, honor, or age. It does not imply inferiority of moral or religious character, for this is not the point under consideration. The word “better” means one who is of superior office or rank, not one who has necessarily a purer or holier character. That Melchizedek was thus superior to Abraham, Paul says, is implied by the very declaration that he “blessed him.” It is also seen to be true by the whole comparison. Abraham was a petty prince; an “Emir” - the head of a company of Nomades, or migratory shepherds, having, it is true, a large number of dependants, but still not having the rank here given to Melchizedek. Though called “a prophet” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:7">Genesis 20:7</span>, yet he is nowhere called either a priest or a king. In these respects, it was undoubted that he was inferior to Melchizedek.</p>
