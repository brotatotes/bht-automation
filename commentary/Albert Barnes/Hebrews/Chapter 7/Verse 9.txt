<p style=" "><b>And as I may so say - </b>So to speak - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν</span></span> hōs epos eipein. For numerous examples in the classic writers of this expression, see Wetstein in loc. It is used precisely as it is with us when we say “so to speak,” or “if I may be allowed the expression.” It is employed when what is said is not strictly and literally true, but when it amounts to the same thing, or when about the same idea is conveyed. “It is a “softening down” of an expression which a writer supposes his readers may deem too strong, or which may have the appearance of excess or severity. It amounts to an indirect apology for employing an unusual or unexpected assertion or phrase.” “Prof. Stuart.” Here Paul could not mean that Levi had actually paid tithes in Abraham - for he had not then an existence; or that Abraham was his representative - for there had been no appointment of Abraham to act in that capacity by Levi; or that the act of Abraham was imputed or reckoned to Levi, for that was not true, and would not have been pertinent to the case if it were so. But it means, that in the circumstances of the case, the same thing occurred in regard to the superiority of Melchizedek, and the inferiority of the Levitical priesthood, as if Levi had been present with Abraham, and had himself actually paid tithes on that occasion. This was so because Abraham was the distinguished ancestor of Levi, and when an ancestor has done an act implying inferiority of rank to another, we feel as if the whole family or all the descendants, by that act recognized the inferiority, unless something occurs to change the relative rank of the persons. Here nothing indicating any such change had occurred. Melchizedek had no descendants of which mention is made, and the act of Abraham, as the head of the Hebrew race, stood therefore as if it were the act of all who descended from him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Levi - </b>The ancestor of the whole Levitical priesthood, and from whom they received their name. He was the third son of Jacob and Leah, and was born in Mesopotamia. On account of the conduct of Simeon and Levi toward Shechem, for the manner in which he had treated their sister Dinah <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+34:25">Genesis 34:25</span>, and which Jacob characterized as “cruelty” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:5-6">Genesis 49:5-6</span>, Jacob said that they should be “scattered in Israel.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:7">Genesis 49:7</span>. Afterward the whole tribe of Levi was chosen by God to execute the various functions of the priesthood, and were “scattered” over the land, having no inheritance of their own, but deriving their subsistence from the offerings of the people; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:6">Numbers 3:6</span> ff. Levi is here spoken of as the ancestor of the tribe, or collectively to denote the entire Jewish priesthood.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who receiveth tithes - </b>That is, his descendants, the priests and Levites, receive tithes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Payed tithes in Abraham - </b>It is the same as if he had payed tithes in or by Abraham.</p>
