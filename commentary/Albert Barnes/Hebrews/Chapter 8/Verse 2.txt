<p style=" "><b>A minister of the sanctuary - </b>Margin, “or holy things.” Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τῶν ἁγίων</span></span> tōn hagiōn. The Greek may either mean “the sanctuary” - denoting the Holy of Holies; or “holy things.” The word “sanctuary” - <span class="_800000">קדשׁ</span> qodesh - was given to the tabernacle or temple as a “holy place,” and the plural form which is used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὰ ἅγια</span></span> ta hagia - was given to the most holy place by way of eminence - the full form of the name being - <span class="_800000">קדשׁ</span> qodesh <span class="_800000"><span lang="he-IL"> </span>קדשׁ קדּשׁים</span> qodesh qodâshiym, or, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἅγια ἅγιων</span></span> hagia hagiōn - “hagia hagion,” (Jahn’s <i>Arche</i>. section 328), or as it is used here simply as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὰ ἅγια</span></span> ta hagia. The connection seems to require us to understand it of the “most holy place,” and not of holy things. The idea is, that the Lord Jesus the Great High Priest, has entered into the Holy of Holies in heaven, of which that in the tabernacle was an emblem. For a description of the Most Holy place in the temple, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of the true tabernacle - </b>The “real” tabernacle in heaven, of which that among the Hebrews was but the type. The word “tabernacle” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνὴ</span></span> skēnē - means properly a “booth, hut, or tent,” and was applied to the “tent” which Moses was directed to build as the place for the worship of God. That tabernacle, as the temple was afterward, was regarded as the special abode of God on earth. Here the reference is to heaven, as the dwelling place of God, of which that tabernacle was the emblem or symbol. It is called the “true tabernacle,” as it is the real dwelling of God, of which the one made by Moses was but the “emblem.” It is not moveable and perishable like that made by man, but is unchanging and eternal.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which the Lord pitched, and not man - </b>The word “pitched” is adapted to express the setting up of a “tent.” When it is said that “the Lord pitched the true tabernacle,” that is, the permanent dwelling in heaven; the meaning is, that heaven has been prepared by God himself, and that whatever is necessary to constitute that an appropriate abode for the divine majesty has been done by him. To that glorious dwelling the Redeemer has been received, and there he performs the office of high priest in behalf of man. In what way he does this, the apostle specifies in the remainder of this chapter, and in Heb. 9–10:</p>
