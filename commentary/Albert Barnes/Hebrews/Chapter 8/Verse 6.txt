<p style=" "><b>But now hath he obtained - </b>That is, Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A more excellent ministry - </b>A service of a higher order, or of a more exalted nature. It was the real and substantial service of which the other was but the emblem; it pertained to things in heaven, while that was concerned with the earthly tabernacle; it was enduring, while that was to vanish away; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6-9">2 Corinthians 3:6-9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By how much - </b>By as much as the new covenant is more important than the old, by so much does his ministry exceed in dignity that under the ancient dispensation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He is the mediator - </b>see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19-20">Galatians 3:19-20</span>, where the word “mediator” is explained. It means here that Christ officiates between God and man according to the arrangements of the new covenant.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of a better covenant - </b>Margin, “Or testament.” This word properly denotes a “disposition, arrangement, or ordering” of things; and in the Scriptures is employed to describe the arrangement which God has made to secure the maintenance of his worship on earth, and the salvation of people. It is uniformly used in the Septuagint and in the New Testament to denote the covenant which God makes with people. The word which “properly” denotes a “covenant or compact” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνθήκη</span></span> sunthēkē - “suntheke” is never used. The writers of the New Testament evidently derived its use from the Septuagint, but why the authors of that version employed it as denoting a “will” rather than the proper one denoting a “compact,” is unknown. It has been supposed by some, and the conjecture is not wholly improbable, that it was because they were unwilling to represent God as making a “compact” or “agreement” with people, but chose rather to represent him as making a mere “arrangement or ordering of things;” compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8">Hebrews 8:8</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:16-17">Hebrews 9:16-17</span>. This is a better covenant than the old, inasmuch as it relates mainly to the pardon of sin; to a spiritual and holy religion; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span>. The former related more to external rites and observances, and was destined to vanish away; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:13">Hebrews 8:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which was established upon better promises - </b>The promises in the first covenant pertained mainly to the present life. They were promises of length of days; of increase of numbers; of seed time and harvest; of national privileges, and of extraordinary peace, abunance, and prosperity. That there was also the promise of eternal life, it would be wrong to doubt; but this was not the main thing. In the new covenant, however, the promise of spiritual blessings becomes the principal thing. The mind is directed to heaven; the heart is cheered with the hopes of immortal life, the favor of God and the anticipation of heaven are secured in the most ample and solemn manner.</p>
