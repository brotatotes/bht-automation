<p style=" "><b>For if that first covenant had been faultless - </b>see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span>. It is implied here that God had said that that covenant was not perfect or faultless. The meaning is not that that first covenant made under Moses had any real faults - or inculcated what was wrong, but that it did not contain the ample provision for the pardon of sin and the salvation of the soul which was desirable. It was merely “preparatory” to the gospel.</p>
