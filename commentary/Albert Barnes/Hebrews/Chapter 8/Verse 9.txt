<p style=" "><b>Not according to the covenant ... - </b>An arrangement or dispensation relating mainly to outward observances, and to temporal blessings. The meaning is, that the new dispensation would be different from what was made with them when they came out of Egypt. In what respects it would differ is specified in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10-12">Hebrews 8:10-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because they continued not in my covenant - </b>In Jeremiah, in the Hebrew, this is, “while my covenant they brake.” That is, they failed to comply with the conditions on which I promised to bestow blessings upon them. In Jeremiah this is stated as a simple fact; in the manner in which the apostle quotes it, it is given as a reason why he would give a new arrangement. The apostle has quoted it literally from the Septuagint, and the sense is not materially varied. The word rendered “because” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὅτι</span></span> hoti - may mean “since” - “since they did not obey that covenant, and it was ineffectual in keeping them from sin, showing that it was not perfect or complete in regard to what was needful to be done for man, a new arrangement shall be made that will be without defect.” This accords with the reasoning of the apostle; and the idea is, simply, that an arrangement may be made for man adapted to produce important ends in one state of society or one age of the world, which would not be well adapted to him in another, and which would not accomplish all which it would be desirable to accomplish for the race. So an arrangement may be made for teaching children which would not answer the purpose of instructing those of mature years, and which at that time of life may be superseded by another. A system of measures may be adapted to the infancy of society, or to a comparatively rude period of the world, which would be ill adapted to a more advanced state of society. Such was the Hebrew system. It was well adapted to the Jewish community in their circumstances, and answered the end then in view. It served to keep them separate from other people; to preserve the knowledge and the worship of the true God, and to introduce the gospel dispensation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I regarded them not - </b>In Jeremiah this is, “Although I was an husband unto them.” The Septuagint is as it is quoted here by Paul. The Hebrew is, <span class="_800000">ואנכי בצלתי בם</span> wa'aanokiy baa‛altiy baam - which may be rendered, “although I was their Lord;” or as it is translated by Gesenius, “and I rejected them.” The word <span class="_800000">בּצל</span> bàal - means:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)To be lord or master over anything <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+26:13">Isaiah 26:13</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)To become the husband of anyone <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:13">Deuteronomy 21:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)With b<sup>a</sup>-, “to disdain, to reject”; so <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:14">Jeremiah 3:14</span>. It is very probable that this is the meaning here, for it is not only adopted by the Septuagint, but by the Syriac. So Abulwalid, Kimchi, and Rabbi Tanchum understood it.</p>
<p style=" ">The Arabic word means “to reject, to loath, to disdain.” All that is necessary to observe here is, that it cannot be demonstrated that the apostle has not given the true sense of the prophet. The probability is, that the Septuagint translators would give the meaning which was commonly understood to be correct, and there is still more probability that the Syriac translator would adopt the true sense, for.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)The Syriac and Hebrew languages strongly resemble each other; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)The old Syriac version - the Peshito - is incomparably a better translation than the Septuagint.</p>
<p style=" ">If this, therefore, be the correct translation, the meaning is, that since they did not regard and obey the laws which he gave them, God would reject them as his people, and give new laws better adapted to save people. Instead of regarding and treating them as his friends, he would punish them for their offences, and visit them with calamities.</p>
