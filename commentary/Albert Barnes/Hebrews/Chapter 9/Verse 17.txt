<p style=" "><b>For a testament - </b>Such an arrangement as God enters into with man; see the remarks on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:16">Hebrews 9:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is of force - </b>Is ratified, or confirmed - in the same way as a deed or compact is confirmed by affixing a seal.</p>
<p style=" "><b>After men are dead - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπὶ νεκροῖς</span></span> epi nekrois. “Over the dead.” That is, in accordance with the view given above, after the animal is dead; or over the body of the animal slain for sacrifice, and to confirm the covenant. “For a covenant is completed or confirmed over dead sacrifices, seeing it is never of force as long as the victim set apart for its ratification is still living.” ms. notes of Dr. JohnP. Wilson. To this interpretation it is objected, that “<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεκροῖς</span></span> nekrois - “nekrois” - means only “dead men;” but human beings surely were not sacrificed by the Jews, as a mediating sacrifice in order to confirm a covenant.” Prof. Stuart in loc. In regard to this objection, and to the proper meaning of the passage, we may remark:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That the word “men” is not in the Greek, nor is it necessarily implied, unless it be in the use of the Greek word rendered “dead.” The proper translation is, “upon, or over the dead.” The use of the word “men” here by our translators would seem to limit it to the making of a will.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It is to be presumed, unless there is positive proof to the contrary, that the Greeks and Hebrews used the word “dead” as it is used by other people, and that it “might” refer to deceased animals, or vegetables, as well as to human beings. A sacrifice that had been offered was dead; a tree that had fallen was dead; an animal that had been torn by other wild animals was dead. It is “possible” that a people might have one word to refer to “dead men,” and another to “dead animals,” and another to “dead vegetables:” but what is the evidence that the Hebrews or the Greeks had such words?</p>
<p style=" ">(3) What is the meaning of this very word - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεκρός</span></span> nekros - “nekros” - in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:1">Hebrews 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>, of this very Epistle when it is applied to works - “dead works” - if it never refers to anything but people? compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:20">James 2:20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:26">James 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ec+9:4">Ecclesiastes 9:4</span>, it is applied to a dead lion. I suppose, therefore, that the Greek phrase here will admit of the interpretation which the “exigency of the place” seems to demand, and that the idea is, that a covenant with God was ratified over the animals slain in sacrifice, and was not considered as confirmed until the sacrifice was killed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Otherwise - </b>Since - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπεί</span></span> epei. That is, unless this takes place it will be of no force.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is of no strength - </b>It is not “strong” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἰσχύει</span></span> ischuei - it is not confirmed or ratified. “While the testator liveth.” Or while the animal selected to confirm the covenant is alive. It can be confirmed only by its being slain.
