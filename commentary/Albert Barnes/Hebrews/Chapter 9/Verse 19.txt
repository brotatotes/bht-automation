<p style=" "><b>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people - </b>When he had recited all the Law, and had given all the commandments entrusted him to deliver; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3">Exodus 24:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He took the blood of calves and of goats - </b>This passage has given great perplexity to commentators from the fact that Moses in his account of the transactions connected with the ratification of the covenant with the people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:0">Exodus 24:0</span>, mentions only a part of the circumstances here referred to. He says nothing of the blood of calves and of goats; nothing of water, and scarletwool, and hyssop; nothing of sprinkling the book, the tabernacle, or the vessels of the ministry. It has been made a question, therefore, whence Paul obtained a knowledge of these circumstances? Since the account is not contained in the Old Testament, it must have been either by tradition, or by direct inspiration. The latter supposition is hardly probable, because:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The information here can hardly be regarded as of sufficient importance to have required an original revelation; for the illustration would have had sufficient force to sustain his conclusion if the literal account in Exodus only had been given, that Moses sprinkled the people, but</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Such an original act of inspiration here would not have been consistent with the object of the apostle. In that argument it was essential that he should state only the facts about the ancient dispensation which were admitted by the Hebrews themselves. Any statement of his own about things which they did not concede to be true, or which was not well understood as a custom, might have been called in question, and would have done much to invalidate the entire force of the argument. It is to be presumed, therefore, that the facts here referred to had been preserved by tradition; and in regard to this, and the authority due to such a tradition, we may remark:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That it is well known that the Jews had a great number of traditions which they carefully preserved;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That there is no improbability in the supposition that many events in their history would be preserved in this manner, since in the small compass of a volume like the Old Testament it cannot be presumed that all the events of their nation had been recorded;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Though they had many traditions of a trifling nature, and many which were false (compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:2">Matthew 15:2</span>), yet they doubtless had many that were true;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)In referring to those traditions, there is no impropriety in supposing that Paul may have been guided by the Spirit of inspiration in selecting only those which were true; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)Nothing is more probable than what is here stated. If Moses sprinkled “the people;” if he read “the book of the law” then <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:7">Exodus 24:7</span>, and if this was regarded as a solemn act of ratifying a covenant with God, nothing would be more natural than that he should sprinkle the book of the covenant, and even the tabernacle and its various sacred utensils.</p>
<p style=" ">We are to remember also, that it was common among the Hebrews to sprinkle blood for the purpose of consecrating, or as an emblem of purifying. Thus, Aaron and his sons and their garments were sprinkled with blood when they were consecrated to the office of priests, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:19-21">Exodus 29:19-21</span>; the blood of sacrifices was sprinkled on the altar, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+1:5">Leviticus 1:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+1:11">Leviticus 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+3:2">Leviticus 3:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+3:13">Leviticus 3:13</span>; and blood was sprinkled before the veil of the sanctuary, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:10">Leviticus 4:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:17">Leviticus 4:17</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+6:27">Leviticus 6:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+7:14">Leviticus 7:14</span>. So Josephus speaks of the garments of Aaron and of his sons being sprinkled with “the blood of the slain beasts, and with spring water.” “Having consecrated them and their garments,” he says, “for seven days together, he did the same to the tabernacle, and the vessels thereto belonging, both with oil and with the blood of bulls and of rams.” <i>Ant</i>. book iii, chapter 8, section 6. These circumstances show the strong “probability” of the truth of what is here affirmed by Paul, while it is impossible to prove that Moses did not sprinkle the book and the tabernacle in the manner stated. The mere omission by Moses cannot demonstrate that it was not done. On the phrase “the blood of calves and of goats,” see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With water - </b>Agreeably to the declaration of Josephus that “spring water was used.” In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+14:49-51">Leviticus 14:49-51</span>, it is expressly mentioned that the blood of the bird that was killed to cleanse a house from the plague of leprosy should be shed over running water, and that the blood and the water should be sprinkled on the walls. It has been suggested also (see Bloomfield), that the use of water was necessary in order to prevent the blood from coagulating, or so as to make it possible to sprinkle it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And scarlet wool - </b>Margin, “Purple.” The word used here denotes crimson, or deep-scarlet. The colour was obtained from a small insect which was found adhering to the shoots of a species of oak in Spain and in Western Asia, of about the size of a pea. It was regarded as the most valuable of the colours for dyeing, and was very expensive. Why the wool used by Moses was of this colour is not known, unless it be because it was the most expensive of colours, and thus accorded with everything employed in the construction of the tabernacle and its utensils. Wool appears to have been used in order to absorb and retain the blood.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And hyssop - </b>That is, a bunch of hyssop intermingled with the wool, or so connected with it as to constitute a convenient instrument for sprinkling; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+14:51">Leviticus 14:51</span>. Hyssop is a low shrub, regarded as one of the smallest of the plants, and hence, put in contrast with the cedar of Lebanon. It sprung out of the rocks or walls, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+4:33">1 Kings 4:33</span>, and was used for purposes of purification. The term seems to have comprised not only the common hyssop, but also lavender and other aromatic plants. Its fragrance, as well as its size, may have suggested the idea of using it in the sacred services of the tabernacle.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And sprinkled both the book - </b>This circumstance is not mentioned by Moses, but it has been shown above not to be improbable. Some expositors, however, in order to avoid the difficulty in the passage, have taken this in connection with the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβὼν</span></span> labōn - rendered “he took” - meaning “taking the blood, and the book itself;” but the more natural and proper construction is, that the book was sprinkled with the blood.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And all the people - </b>Moses says, “and sprinkled it on the people;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:8">Exodus 24:8</span>. We are not to suppose that either Moses or Paul designs to say that the blood was actually sprinkled on each one of the three millions of people in the wilderness, but the meaning doubtless is that the blood was sprinkled over the people, though in fact it might have fallen on a few. So a man now standing on an elevated place, and surrounded by a large assembly, if he should sprinkle water over them from the place where he stood, might be said to sprinkle it on the people, though in fact but few might have been touched by it. The act would be equally significant whether the emblem fell on few or many.</p>
