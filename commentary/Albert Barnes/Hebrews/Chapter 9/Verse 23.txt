<p style=" "><b>The patterns of things in the heavens - </b>The tabernacle and its various utensils; see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be purified with these - </b>With water and blood, and by these ceremonies.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But the heavenly things themselves - </b>The heavenly tabernacle or sanctuary into which Christ has entered, and where he performs the functions of his ministry. The use of the word “purified” here applied to heaven, does not imply that heaven was before “unholy,” but it denotes that it is now made accessible to sinners; or that they may come and worship there in an acceptable manner. The ancient tabernacle was purified or consecrated by the blood of the victims slain, so that people might approach with acceptance and worship; the heavens by purer blood are rendered accessible to the guilty. The necessity for “better sacrifices” in regard to the latter was, that it was designed to make the conscience pure, and because the service in heaven is more holy than any rendered on earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With better sacrifices than these - </b>To wit, the sacrifice made by the offering of the Lord Jesus on the cross. This infinitely surpassed in value all that had been offered under the Jewish dispensation.</p>
