<p style=" ">This chapter seems to comprise two general classes of subjects; the statement in regard to the first of which is complete, but the second is only commenced in this chapter, and is continued in the second. The first is the general subject of temptation and trial <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1-15">James 1:1-15</span>; the second is the nature of true religion: the statement that all true religion has its origin in God, the source of purity and truth, and that it requires us to be docile and meek; to be doers of the word; to bridle the tongue, and to be the friends of the fatherless and the widow, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:16-27">James 1:16-27</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">I. The general subject of temptation or trial, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1-15">James 1:1-15</span>. It is evident that those to whom the Epistle was directed were, at that time, suffering in some form, or that they were called to pass through temptations, and that they needed counsel and support. They were in danger of sinking in despondency; of murmuring and complaining, and of charging God as the author of temptation and of sin. This part of the chapter comprises the following topics:</p>
<p style=" ">1. The salutation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">2. The subject of temptations or trials. They were to regard it, not as a subject of sorrow, but of gladness and joy, that they were called to pass through trials; for if borne in a proper manner, they would produce the grace of patience, and this was to be regarded as an object worth being secured, even by much suffering, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2-4">James 1:2-4</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">3. If in their trials they felt that they had lacked the wisdom which they needed to enable them to bear them in a proper manner, they had the privilege of looking to God, and seeking it at his hand. This was a privilege conceded to all, and if it were asked in faith, without any wavering, it would certainly be granted, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:5-7">James 1:5-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">4. The importance and value of stability, especially in trials; of being firm in principle, and of having one single great aim in life. A man who wavered in his faith would waver in everything, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:8">James 1:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">5. An encouragement to those who, in the trials which they experienced, passed through rapid changes of circumstances. Whatever those changes were, they were to rejoice in them as ordered by the Lord. They were to remember the essential instability of all earthly things. The rich especially, who were most disposed to murmur and complain when their circumstances were changed, were to remember how the burning heat blasts the beauty of the flower, and that in like manner all worldly splendor must fade away, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:9-11">James 1:9-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">6. Every person is blessed who endures trials in a proper manner, for such an endurance of trial will be connected with a rich reward - the crown of life, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">7. In their trials, however, in the allurements to sin which might be set before them; in the temptations to apostatize, or to do anything wrong, which might be connected with their suffering condition, they were to be careful never to charge temptation as such on God. They were never to allow their minds to feel for a moment that he allured them to sin, or placed an inducement of any kind before them to do wrong. Everything of that kind, every disposition to commit sin, originated in their own hearts, and they should never allow themselves to charge it on God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13-15">James 1:13-15</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">II. The nature of true religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:16-27">James 1:16-27</span>.</p>
