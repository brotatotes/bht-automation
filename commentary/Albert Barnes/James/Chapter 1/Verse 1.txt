<p style=" "><b>James, a servant of God - </b>On the meaning of the word “servant” in this connection, see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>. Compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:16">Philemon 1:16</span>. It is remarkable that James does not call himself an apostle; but this does not prove that the writer of the Epistle was not an apostle, for the same omission occurs in the Epistle of John, and in the Epistle of Paul to the Philippians, the Thessalonians, and to Philemon. It is remarkable, also, considering the relation which James is supposed to have borne to the Lord Jesus as his “brother” (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span>; Introduction, 1). That he did not refer to that as constituting a ground of claim to his right to address others; but this is only one instance out of many, in the New Testament, in which it is regarded as a higher honor to be the “servant of God,” and to belong to his family, than to sustain any relations of blood or kindred. Compare <span class="_0000ff"><u>Mat 11:50</u></span>. It may be observed also (Compare the introduction, Section 1), that this term is one which was especially appropriate to James, as a man eminent for his integrity. His claim to respect and deference was not primarily founded on any relationship which he sustained; any honor of birth or blood; or even any external office, but on the fact that he was a “servant of God.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of the Lord Jesus Christ - </b>The “servant of the Lord Jesus,” is an appellation which is often given to Christians, and particularly to the ministers of religion. They are his servants, not in the sense that they are slaves, but in the sense that they voluntarily obey his will, and labor for him, and not for themselves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad - </b>Greek “The twelve tribes which are in the dispersion,” or of the dispersion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ</span></span> en tē diaspora). This word occurs only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:35">John 7:35</span>. It refers properly to those who lived out of Palestine, or who were scattered among the Gentiles. There were two great “dispersions;” the Eastern and the Western. The first had its origin about the time when the ten tribes were carried away to Assyria, and in the time of the Babylonian captivity. In consequence of these events, and of the fact that large numbers of the Jews went to Babylon, and other Eastern countries, for purposes of travel, commerce, etc., there were many Jews in the East in the times of the apostles. The other was the Western “dispersion,” which commenced about the time of Alexander the Great, and which was promoted by various causes, until there were large numbers of Jews in Egypt and along Northern Africa, in Asia Minor, in Greece proper, and even in Rome. To which of these classes this Epistle was directed is not known; but most probably the writer had particular reference to those in the East. See the introduction, Section 2. The phrase “the twelve tribes,” was the common term by which the Jewish people were designated, and was in use long after the ten tribes were carried away, leaving, in fact, only two of the twelve in Palestine. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span>. Many have supposed that James here addressed them as Jews, and that the Epistle was sent to them as such. But this opinion has no probability; because:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)And, if he had spoken of himself as a Christian, and had addressed his countrymen as himself a believer in Jesus as the Messiah, though regarding them as Jews, it is incredible that he did not make a more distinct reference to the principles of the Christian religion; that he used no arguments to convince them that Jesus was the Messiah; that he did not attempt to convert them to the Christian faith.</p>
<p style=" ">It should be added, that at first most converts were made from those who had been trained in the Jewish faith, and it is not improbable that one in Jerusalem, addressing those who were Christians out of Palestine, would naturally think of them as of Jewish origin, and would be likely to address them as appertaining to the “twelve tribes.” The phrase “the twelve tribes” became also a sort of technical expression to denote the people of God - the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Greeting - </b>A customary form of salutation, meaning, in Greek, to joy, to rejoice; and implying that he wished their welfare. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>.</p>
