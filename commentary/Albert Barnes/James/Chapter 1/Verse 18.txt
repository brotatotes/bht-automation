<p style=" "><b>Of his own will - </b>Greek “willing.” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουληθεὶς</span></span> boulētheis. The idea is, that the fact that we are “begotten” to be his children is to be traced solely to his will. He purposed it, and it was done. The antecedent in the case on which all depended was the sovereign will of God. See this sentiment explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:13">John 1:13</span>. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>. When it is said, however, that he has done this by his mere will, it is not to be inferred that there was no reason why it should be done, or that the exercise of his will was arbitrary, but only that his will determined the matter, and that is the cause of our conversion. It is not to be inferred that there are not in all cases good reasons why God wills as he does, though those reasons are not often stated to us, and perhaps we could not comprehend them if they were. The object of the statement here seems to be to direct the mind up to God as the source of good and not evil; and among the most eminent illustrations of his goodness is this, that by his mere will, without any external power to control him, and where there could be nothing but benevolence, he has adopted us into his family, and given us a most exalted condition, as renovated beings, among his creatures.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Begat he us - </b>The Greek word here is the same which in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15">James 1:15</span> is rendered “bringeth forth,” - “sin bringeth forth death.” The word is perhaps designedly used here in contrast with that, and the object is to refer to a different kind of production, or bringing forth, under the agency of sin, and the agency of God. The meaning here is, that we owe the beginning of our spiritual life to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With the word of truth - </b>By the instrumentality of truth. It was not a mere creative act, but it was by truth as the seed or germ. There is no effect produced in our minds in regeneration which the truth is not fitted to produce, and the agency of God in the case is to secure its fair and full influence on the soul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>. For the meaning of the word rendered “first-fruits,” see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 15:20</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament It denotes, properly, that which is first taken from anything; the portion which was usually offered to God. The phrase here does not primarily denote eminence in honor or degree, but refers rather to time - the first in time; and in a secondary sense it is then used to denote the honor attached to that circumstance. The meaning here is, either.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That, under the gospel, those who were addressed by the apostles had the honor of being first called into his kingdom as a part of that glorious harvest which it was designed to gather in this world, and that the goodness of God was manifested in thus furnishing the first-fruits of a most glorious harvest; or,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)The reference may be to the rank and dignity which all who are born again would have among the creatures of God in virtue of the new birth.</p>
