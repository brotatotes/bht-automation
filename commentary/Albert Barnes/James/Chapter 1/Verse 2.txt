<p style=" "><b>My brethren - </b>Not brethren as Jews, but as Christians. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Count it all joy - </b>Regard it as a thing to rejoice in; a matter which should afford you happiness. You are not to consider it as a punishment, a curse, or a calamity, but as a fit subject of felicitation.

<p style=" "><b>When ye fall into divers temptations - </b>Oh the meaning of the word “temptations,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>. It is now commonly used in the sense of placing allurements before others to induce them to sin, and in this sense the word seems to be used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13-14">James 1:13-14</span> of this chapter. Here, however, the word is used in the sense of trials, to wit, by persecution, poverty, calamity of any kind. These cannot be said to be direct inducements or allurements to sin, but they try the faith, and they show whether he who is tried is disposed to adhere to his faith in God, or whether he will apostatize. They so far coincide with temptations, properly so called, as to test the religion of men. They differ from temptations, properly so called, in that they are not brought before the mind for the express purpose of inducing people to sin. In this sense it is true that God never tempts men, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13-14">James 1:13-14</span>. On the sentiment in the passage before us, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:6-7">1 Peter 1:6-7</span>. The word “divers” here refers to the various kinds of trials which they might experience - sickness, poverty, bereavement, persecution, etc. They were to count it a matter of joy that their religion was subjected to anything that tried it. It is well for us to have the reality of our religion tested, in whatever way it may be done.</p>
