<p style=" "><b>If any of you lack wisdom - </b>Probably this refers particularly to the kind of wisdom which they would need in their trials, to enable them to bear them in a proper manner, for there is nothing in which Christians more feel the need of heavenly wisdom than in regard to the manner in which they should bear trials, and what they should do in the perplexities, and disappointments, and bereavements that come upon them; but the language employed is so general, that what is here said may be applied to the need of wisdom in all respects. The particular kind of wisdom which we need in trials is to enable us to understand their design and tendency; to perform our duty under them, or the new duties which may grow out of them; to learn the lessons which God designs to teach, for he always designs to teach us some valuable lessons by affliction; and to cultivate such views and feelings as are appropriate under the peculiar forms of trial which are brought upon us; to find out the sins for which we have been afflicted, and to learn how we may avoid them in time to come. We are in great danger of going wrong when we are afflicted; of complaining and murmuring; of evincing a spirit of rebellion, and of losing the benefits which we might have obtained if we had submitted to the trial in a proper manner. So in all things we “lack wisdom.” We are short-sighted; we have hearts prone to sin; and there are great and important matters pertaining to duty and salvation on which we cannot but feel that we need heavenly guidance.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let him ask of God - </b>That is, for the specific wisdom which he needs; the very wisdom which is necessary for him in the particular case. It is proper to bear the very case before God; to make mention of the specific want; to ask of God to guide us in the very matter where we feel so much embarrassment. It is one of the privileges of Christians, that they may not only go to God and ask him for that general wisdom which is needful for them in life, but that whenever a particular emergency arises, a case of perplexity and difficulty in regard to duty, they may bring that particular thing before his throne, with the assurance that he will guide them. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+25:9">Psalms 25:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+37:14">Isaiah 37:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:17">Joel 2:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That giveth to all men liberally - </b>The word men here is supplied by the translators, but not improperly, though the promise should be regarded as restricted to those who ask. The object of the writer was to encourage those who felt their need of wisdom, to go and ask it of God; and it would not contribute anything to furnish such a specific encouragement to say of God that he gives to all men liberally whether they ask or not. In the Scriptures, the promise of divine aid is always limited to the desire. No blessing is promised to man that is not sought; no man can feel that he has a right to hope for the favor of God, who does not value it enough to pray for it; no one ought to obtain it, who does not prize it enough to ask for it. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7-8">Matthew 7:7-8</span>. The word rendered “liberally” <b>haploos - </b>means, properly, “simply;” that is, in simplicity, sincerity, reality. It occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though the corresponding noun occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span>, rendered simplicity; in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:13">2 Corinthians 9:13</span>, rendered “liberality,” and “liberal;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:11">2 Corinthians 9:11</span>, rendered “bountifulness;” and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22">Colossians 3:22</span>, rendered “singleness,” of the heart. The idea seems to be that of openness, frankness, generosity; the absence of all that is sordid and contracted; where there is the manifestation of generous feeling, and liberal conduct. In a higher sense than in the case of any man, all that is excellent in these things is to be found in God; and we may therefore come to him feeling that in his heart there is more that is noble and generous in bestowing favors than in any other being. There is nothing that is stinted and close; there is no partiality; there is no withholding of his favor because we are poor, and unlettered, and unknown.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And upbraideth not - </b>Does not reproach, rebuke, or treat harshly. He does not coldly repel us, if we come and ask what we need, though we do it often and with importunity. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:1-7">Luke 18:1-7</span>. The proper meaning of the Greek word is to rail at, reproach, revile, chide; and the object here is probably to place the manner in which God bestows his favors in contrast with what sometimes occurs among men. He does not reproach or chide us for our past conduct; for our foolishness; for our importunity in asking. He permits us to come in the most free manner, and meets us with a Spirit of entire kindness, and with promptness in granting our requests. We are not always sure, when we ask a favor of a man, that we shall not encounter something that will be repulsive, or that will mortify us; we are certain, however, when we ask a favor of God, that we shall never be reproached in an unfeeling manner, or meet with a harsh response.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And it shall be given him - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+29:12-13">Jeremiah 29:12-13</span>; “Then shall ye call upon me, and go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with your whole heart.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7-8">Matthew 7:7-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:22">Matthew 21:22</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Mar 11:24</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:22">1 John 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:14">1 John 5:14</span>. This promise in regard to the wisdom that may be necessary for us, is absolute; and we may be sure that if it be asked in a proper manner it will be granted us. There can be no doubt that it is one of the things which God is able to impart; which will be for our own good; and which, therefore, he is ever ready to bestow. About many things there might be doubt whether, if they were granted, they would be for our real welfare, and therefore there may be a doubt whether it would be consistent for God to bestow them; but there can be no such doubt about wisdom. That is always for our good; and we may be sure, therefore, that we shall obtain that, if the request be made with a right spirit. If it be asked in what way we may expect he will bestow it on us, it may be replied:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a) Suggesting to us the way in which we should go, and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (b) Inclining us to do that which is prudent and wise; and,</p>
