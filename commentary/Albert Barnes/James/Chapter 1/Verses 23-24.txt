<p style=" "><b>For he beholdeth himself - </b>While he looks in the mirror he sees his true appearance.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth - </b>As soon as he goes away, he forgets it. The apostle does not refer to any intention on his part, but to what is known to occur as a matter of fact.</p>
<p style=" "><b>What manner of than he was - </b>How he looked; and especially if there was anything in his appearance that required correction.</p>
