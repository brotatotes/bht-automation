For he beholdeth himself - While he looks in the mirror he sees his true appearance.And goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth - As soon as he goes away, he forgets it. The apostle does not refer to any intention on his part, but to what is known to occur as a matter of fact.What manner of than he was - How he looked; and especially if there was anything in his appearance that required correction.
