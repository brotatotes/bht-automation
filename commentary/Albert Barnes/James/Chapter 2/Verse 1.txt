<p style=" "><b>My brethren - </b>Perhaps meaning brethren in two respects - as Jews, and as Christians. In both respects the form of address would be proper.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ - </b>Faith is the distinguishing thing in the Christian religion, for it is this by which man is justified, and hence, it comes to be put for religion itself. Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>. The meaning here is, “do not hold such views of the religion of Christ, as to lead you to manifest partiality to others on account of their difference of rank or outward circumstances.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Lord of glory - </b>The glorious Lord; he who is glorious himself, and who is encompassed with glory. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>. The design here seems to be to show that the religion of such a Lord should be in no way dishonored.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With respect of persons - </b>That is, you are not to show respect of persons, or to evince partiality to others on account of their rank, wealth, apparel, etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+24:23">Proverbs 24:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+28:21">Proverbs 28:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:15">Leviticus 19:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+1:17">Deuteronomy 1:17</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Deu 10:17</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+19:7">2 Chronicles 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:4">Psalms 40:4</span>. See the subject explained in the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:11">Romans 2:11</span> note.</p>
