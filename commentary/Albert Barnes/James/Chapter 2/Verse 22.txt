<p style=" "><b>Seest thou - </b>Margin, “Thou seest.” Either rendering is correct, and the sense is the same. The apostle means to say that this was so plain that they could not but see it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How faith wrought with his works - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνήργει</span></span> sunērgei. Cooperated with. The meaning of the word is, “to work together with anyone; to co operate,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:16">1 Corinthians 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>; then to aid, or help, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:20">Mark 16:20</span>; to contribute to the production of any result, where two or more persons or agents are united. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>. The idea here is, that the result in the case of Abraham, that is, his salvation, or his religion, was secured, not by one of these things alone, but that both contributed to it. The result which was reached, to wit, his acceptance with God, could not have been obtained by either one of them separately, but both, in some sense, entered into it. The apostle does not say that, in regard to the merit which justifies, they came in for an equal share, for he makes no affirmation on that point; he does not deny that in the sight of God, who foresees and knows all things, he was regarded as a justified man the moment he believed, but he looks at the result as it was, at Abraham as he appeared under the trial of his faith, and says that in that result there was to be seen the co-operation of faith and good works. Both contributed to the end, as they do now in all cases where there is true religion.</p>
<p style=" ">(By the somewhat unhappy term “merit,” the author clearly means nothing more than “principle,” as is obvious from his acute and evangelical comment on the verse; as well as from the admirable reconciliation of Paul and James below.)</p>
<p style=" "><b>And by works was faith made perfect - </b>Made complete, finished, or entire. It was so carried out as to show its legitimate and fair results. This does not mean that the faith in itself was defective before this, and that the defect was remedied by good works; or that there is any deficiency in what the right kind of faith can do in the matter of justification, which is to be helped out by good works; but that there was that kind of completion which a thing has when it is fully developed, or is fairly carried out.</p>
