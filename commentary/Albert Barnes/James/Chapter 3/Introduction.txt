<p style=" ">The evil which the apostle seems to have referred to in this chapter, was a desire, which appears to have prevailed among those to whom he wrote, to be public teachers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδάσκαλοι</span></span> didaskaloi) <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>), and to be such even where there was no proper qualification. It is not easy to see any connection between what is said in this chapter, and what is found in other parts of the Epistle; and indeed the plan of the Epistle seems to have been to notice such things as the apostle supposed claimed their attention, without particular regard to a logical connection. Some of the errors and improprieties which existed among them had been noticed in the previous chapters, and others are referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:0">James 4:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:0">James 5:0</span>. Those which are noticed in this chapter grew out of the desire of being public teachers of religion. It seems probable that he had this subject in his eye in the whole of this chapter, and this will give a clue to the course of thought which he pursues. Let it be supposed that there was a prevailing desire among those to whom he wrote to become public teachers, without much regard for the proper qualifications for that office, and the interpretation of the chapter will become easy. Its design and drift then may be thus expressed:</p>
<p style=" ">I. The general subject of the chapter, a caution against the desire prevailing among many to be ranked among public teachers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>, first clause.</p>
<p style=" ">II. Considerations to check and modify that desire, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span> (last clause), <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:18">James 3:18</span>. These considerations are the following:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The fact that public teachers must give a more solemn account than other men, and that they expose themselves to the danger of a deeper condemnation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>, last clause.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The evils which grow out of an improper use of the tongue; evils to which those are particularly liable whose business is speaking, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2-12">James 3:2-12</span>. This leads the apostle into a general statement of the importance of the tongue as a member of the human body; of the fact that we are peculiarly liable to offend in that <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span>; of the fact that if that is regulated aright, the whole man is - as a horse is managed by the bit, and a ship is steered by the rudder <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2-4">James 3:2-4</span>; of the fact that the tongue, though a little member, is capable of accomplishing great things, and is peculiarly liable, when not under proper regulations, to do mischief, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:5-6">James 3:5-6</span>; of the fact that, while everything else has been tamed, it has been found impossible to bring the tongue under proper restraints, and that it performs the most discordant and opposite functions, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:7-9">James 3:7-9</span>; and of the impropriety and absurdity of this, as if the same fountain should bring forth sweet water and bitter, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:10-12">James 3:10-12</span>. By these considerations, the apostle seems to have designed to repress the prevailing desire of leaving other employments, and of becoming public instructors without suitable qualifications.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The apostle adverts to the importance of wisdom, with reference to the same end; that is, of suitable qualifications to give public instruction, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13-18">James 3:13-18</span>. He shows <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13">James 3:13</span> that if there was a truly wise man among them, he should show this by his works, with “meekness,” and not by obtruding himself upon the attention of others; that if there was a want of it evinced in a spirit of rivalry and contention, there would be confusion and every evil work, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14-16">James 3:14-16</span>; and that where there was true wisdom, it was unambitious and unostentatious; it was modest, retiring, and pure. It would lead to a peaceful life of virtue, and its existence would be seen in the “fruits of righteousness sown in peace,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:17-18">James 3:17-18</span>. It might be inferred that they who had this spirit would not be ambitious of becoming public teachers; they would not place themselves at the head of parties; they would show the true spirit of religion in an unobtrusive and humble life. We are not to suppose, in the interpretation of this chapter, that the apostle argued against a desire to enter the ministry, in itself considered, and where there are proper qualifications; but he endeavored to suppress a spirit which has not been uncommon in the world, to become public teachers as a means of more influence and power, and without any suitable regard to the proper endowments for such an office.</p>
