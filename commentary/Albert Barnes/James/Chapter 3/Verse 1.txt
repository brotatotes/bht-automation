<p style=" "><b>My brethren, be not many masters - </b>“Be not many of you teachers.” The evil referred to is that where many desired to be teachers, though but few could be qualified for the office, and though, in fact, comparatively few were required. A small number, well qualified, would better discharge the duties of the office, and do more good, than many would; and there would be great evil in having many crowding themselves unqualified into the office. The word here rendered “masters” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδάσκαλοι</span></span> didaskaloi) should have been rendered “teachers.” It is so rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:20">Romans 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28-29">1 Corinthians 12:28-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>; though it is elsewhere frequently rendered master. It has, however, in it primarily the notion of “teaching” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδάσκω</span></span> didaskō), even when rendered “master;” and the word “master” is often used in the New Testament, as it is with us, to denote an instructor - as the “school-master.”</p>
<p style=" ">Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:24-25">Matthew 10:24-25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:17">Mark 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:19">Mark 12:19</span>, et al. The word is not properly used in the sense of master, as distinguished from a servant, but as distinguished from a disciple or learner. Such a position, indeed, implies authority, but it is authority based not on power, but on superior qualifications. The connection implies that the word is used in that sense in this place; and the evil reprehended is that of seeking the office of public instructor, especially the sacred office. It would seem that this was a prevailing fault among those to whom the apostle wrote. This desire was common among the Jewish people, who coveted the name and the office of “Rabbi,” equivalent to that here used, (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:7">Matthew 23:7</span>), and who were ambitious to be doctors and teachers. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:19">Romans 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:7">1 Timothy 1:7</span>. This fondness for the office of teachers they naturally carried with them into the Christian church when they were converted, and it is this which the apostle here rebukes. The same spirit the passage before us would rebuke now and for the same reasons; for although a man should be willing to become a public instructor in religion when called to it by the Spirit and Providence of God, and should esteem it a privilege when so called, yet there would be scarcely anything more injurious to the cause of true religion, or that would tend more to produce disorder and confusion, than a prevailing desire of the prominence and importance which a man has in virtue of being a public instructor. If there is anything which ought to be managed with extreme prudence and caution, it is that of introducing men into the Christian ministry. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15-26">Acts 1:15-26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2-3">Acts 13:2-3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεῖζον κρὶμα</span></span> meizon krima. Or rather, “a severer judgment;” that is, we shall have a severer trial, and give a stricter account. The word here used does not necessarily mean “condemnation,” but “judgment, trial, account;” and the consideration which the apostle suggests is not that those who were public teacher would be condemned, but that there would be a much more solemn account to be rendered by them than by other men, and that they ought duly to reflect on this in seeking the office of the ministry. He would carry them in anticipation before the judgment-seat, and have them determine the question of entering the ministry there. No better “stand-point” can be taken in making up the mind in regard to this work; and if that had been the position assumed in order to estimate the work, and to make up the mind in regard to the choice of this profession, many a one who has sought the office would have been deterred from it; and it may be added, also, that many a pious and educated youth would have sought the office, who has devoted his life to other pursuits. A young man, when about to make choice of a calling in life, should place himself by anticipation at the judgment-bar of Christ, and ask himself how human pursuits and plans will appear there. If that were the point of view taken, how many would have been deterred from the ministry who have sought it with a view to honor or emolument! How many, too, who have devoted themselves to the profession of the law, to the army or navy, or to the pursuits of elegant literature, would have felt that it was their duty to serve God in the ministry of reconciliation? How many at the close of life, in the ministry and out of it, feel, when too late to make a change, that they have wholly mistaken the purpose for which they should have lived!</p>
