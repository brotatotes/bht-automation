<p style=" "><b>This wisdom descendeth not from above - </b>Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:3">1 Corinthians 3:3</span>. The wisdom here referred to is that carnal or worldly wisdom which produces strife and contention; that kind of knowledge which leads to self-conceit, and which prompts a man to defend his opinions with over-heated zeal. In the contentions which are in the world, in church and state, in neighborhoods and families, at the bar, in political life, and in theological disputes, even where there is the manifestation of enraged and irascible feeling, there is often much of a certain kind of wisdom. There is learning, shrewdness, tact, logical skill, subtle and skilful argumentation - “making the worse appear the better reason;” but all this is often connected with a spirit so narrow, bigoted, and contentious, as to show clearly that it has not its origin in heaven. The spirit which is originated there is always connected with gentleness, calmness, and a love of truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But is earthly - </b>Has its origin in this world, and partakes of its spirit. It is such as men exhibit who are governed only by worldly maxims and principles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sensual - </b>Margin, “natural.” The meaning is, that it has its origin in our sensual rather than in our intellectual and moral nature. It is that which takes counsel of our natural appetites and propensities, and not of high and spiritual influences.</p>
<p style=" "><b>devilish - </b>Demoniacal (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιώδης</span></span> daimoniōdēs). Such as the demons exhibit. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:19">James 2:19</span>. There may be indeed talent in it, but there is the intermingling of malignant passions, and it leads to contentions, strifes, divisions, and “every evil work.”</p>
