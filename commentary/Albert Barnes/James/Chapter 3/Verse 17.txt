<p style=" "><b>But the wisdom that is from above - </b>Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6-7">1 Corinthians 2:6-7</span>. The wisdom which has a heavenly origin, or which is from God. The man who is characterised by that wisdom will be pure, peaceable, etc. This does not refer to the doctrines of religion, but to its spirit.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is first pure - </b>That is, the first effect of it on the mind is to make it pure. The influence on the man is to make him upright, sincere, candid, holy. The word here used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἁγνη</span></span> hagnē) is that which would be applied to one who is innocent, or flee from crime or blame. Compare <span class="_0000ff"><u>Phi 4:8</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>; where the word is rendered, as here, “pure”; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>; where it is rendered clear, (in this matter); <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Tit 2:5</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:2">1 Peter 3:2</span>, where it is rendered chaste. The meaning here is, that the first and immediate effect of religion is not on the intellect, to make it more enlightened; or on the imagination, to make it more discursive and brilliant; or on the memory and judgment, to make them clearer and stronger; but it is to purify the heart, to make the man upright, inoffensive, and good. This passage should not be applied, as it often is, to the doctrines of religion, as if it were the first duty of a church to keep itself free from errors in doctrine, and that this ought to be sought even in preference to the maintenance of peace - as if it meant that in doctrine a church should be “first pure, then peaceable;” but it should be applied to the individual consciences of men, as showing the effect of religion on the heart and life.</p>
<p style=" ">The first thing which it produces is to make the man himself pure and good; then follows the train of blessings which the apostle enumerates as flowing from that. It is true that a church should be pure in doctrinal belief, but that is not the truth taught here. It is not true that the scripture teaches, here or elsewhere, that purity of doctrine is to be preferred to a peaceful spirit; or that it always leads to a peaceful spirit; or that it is proper for professed Christians and Christian ministers to sacrifice, as is often done, a peaceful spirit, in an attempt to preserve purity of doctrine. Most of the persecutions in the church have grown out of this maxim. This led to the establishment of the Inquisition; this kindled the fires of Smithfield; this inspirited Laud and his friends; this has been the origin of no small part of the schisms in the church. A pure spirit is the best promoter of peace, and will do more than anything else to secure the prevalence of truth.</p>
<p style=" ">(It is but too true that much unseemly strife has had the aegis of this text thrown over it. The “wrath of man” accounts itself zeal for God, and strange fire usurps the place of the true fire of the sanctuary. Yet the author’s statement here seems somewhat overcharged; possibly his own personal history may have contributed a little to this result. Although the Greek word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἁγνη</span></span> hagnē, here qualifying the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφια</span></span> sophia, or wisdom, refers to purity of heart, still it remains true that a pure heart will never relinquish its hold on God’s truth for the sake of a peace that at such a price would be too dearly purchased. A pure heart cannot but be faithful to the truth; it could not otherwise be pure, provided conscientiousness and love of truth form any part of moral purity. Surely, then, an individual solicited to yield up what he believed to be truth, or what were cherished convictions, might properly assign this text as a reason why he could not, and ought not; and if an individual might, why not any number associated into a church?</p>
<p style=" ">It is true the Scriptures do not teach that “doctrinal purity” is to be preferred to a “peaceful spirit.” However pure a man’s doctrine may be, if he has not the peaceful spirit he is none of Christ’s. But the common view of this passage is not chargeable with any such absurdity. It supposes only that there may be circumstances in which the spirit of peace, though possessed, cannot be exercised, except in meek submission to wrong for conscience sake; never can it turn traitor to truth, or make any compromise with error. The “first” of the apostle does not indicate even preference of the pure spirit to the peaceful spirit, but only the order in which they are to be exercised. There must be no attempts to reach peace by overleaping purity. The maxim that a pure heart ought not to sacrifice truth on any consideration whatever, never gave rise to persecution: it has made many martyrs, but never one persecutor; it has pined in the dungeon, but never immured any there; it has burned amid the flames, but never lighted the faggot; it has ascended scaffolds, but never erected them; it has preserved and bequeathed civil and religious liberty, but never assaulted them; it is a divine principle - the principle by which Christianity became strong, and will ultimately command the homage of the world. There is another principle, with which this has no brotherhood, that denies the right of private judgment, and enforces uniformity by the sword: its progeny are inquisitors, and Lauds and Sharpes; and let it have the credit of its own offspring.)</p>
<p style=" "><b>Then peaceable - </b>The effect of true religion - the wisdom which is from above - will be to dispose a man to live in peace with all others. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:19">Romans 14:19</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Gentle - </b>Mild, inoffensive, clement. The word here used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπιεικὴς</span></span> epieikēs) is rendered “moderation” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:5">Philippians 4:5</span>; patient in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>; and gentle in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2">Titus 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:17">James 3:17</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>. It does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. Every one has a clear idea of the virtue of gentleness - gentleness of spirit, of deportment, and of manners; and every one can see that that is the appropriate spirit of religion. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span>. It is from this word that we have derived the word “gentleman”; and the effect of true religion is to make everyone, in the proper and best sense of the term, a gentleman. How can a man have evidence that he is a true Christian, who is not such? The highest title which can be given to a man is, that he is a Christian gentleman.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And easy to be entreated - </b>The word here used does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means easily persuaded, compliant. Of course, this refers only to cases where it is right and proper to be easily persuaded and complying. It cannot refer to things which are in themselves wrong. The sense is, that he who is under the influence of the wisdom which is from above, is not a stiff, stern, obstinate, unyielding man. He does not take a position, and then hold it whether right or wrong; he is not a man on whom no arguments or persuasions can have any influence. He is not one who cannot be affected by any appeals which may be made to him on the grounds of patriotism, justice, or benevolence; but is one who is ready to yield when truth requires him to do it, and who is willing to sacrifice his own convenience for the good of others. See this illustrated in the case of the apostle Paul, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:20-22">1 Corinthians 9:20-22</span>. Compare the notes at that passage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Full of mercy - </b>Merciful; disposed to show compassion to others. This is one of the results of the wisdom that is from above, for it makes us like God, the “Father of mercies.” See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:7">Matthew 5:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And good fruits - </b>The fruits of good living; just, benevolent, and kind actions. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:11">Philippians 1:11</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span> note. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14-26">James 2:14-26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Without partiality - </b>Margin, “or wrangling.” The word here used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀδιάκριτος</span></span> adiakritos) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, “not to be distinguished.” Here it may mean either of the following things:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)Not open to distinction or doubt; that is, unambiguous, so that there shall be no doubt about its origin or nature;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)Making no distinction, that is, in the treatment of others, or impartial towards them; or,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (c)Without strife, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακρίνω</span></span> diakrinō, to contend.</p>
<p style=" ">The second meaning here suggested seems best to accord with the sense of the passage; and according to this the idea is, that the wisdom which is from above, or true religion, makes us impartial in our treatment of others: that is, we are not influenced by a regard to dress, rank, or station, but we are disposed to do equal justice to all, according to their moral worth, and to show kindness to all, according to their wants. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1-4">James 2:1-4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And without hypocrisy - </b>What it professes to be; sincere. There is no disguise or mask assumed. What the man pretends to be, he is. This is everywhere the nature of true religion. It has nothing of its own of which to be ashamed, and which needs to be concealed; its office is not to hide or conceal anything that is wrong. It neither is a mask, nor does it need a mask. If such is the nature of the “wisdom which is from above,” who is there that should be ashamed of it? Who is there that should not desire that its blessed influence should spread around the world?</p>
