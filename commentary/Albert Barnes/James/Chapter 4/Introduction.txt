<p style=" ">In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13-18">James 3:13-18</span> the apostle had contrasted the wisdom which is from above with that which is from beneath. The former is peaceable, pure, and gentle, leading to universal kindness and order; the latter earthly, sensual, and devilish. The points suggested in this chapter grow directly out of the remarks made there, and are designed to show the effect of the “wisdom which descendeth not from above,” as evinced in the spirit of this world, and thus by contrast to show the value of true wisdom, or of the spirit of religion. Accordingly, the apostle illustrates the effects of the wisdom of this world, or the spirit of this world, by showing what it produces, or what they do who are under its influence. We are not to suppose that the persons to whom the apostle addressed this Epistle were actually guilty of the things here referred to themselves, but such things had an existence in the world, and it gave more life and spirit to the discussion to represent them as existing “among them.” In illustrating the subject, he refers to the following things as resulting from the spirit that is opposite to the wisdom which is from above, namely:</p>
<p style=" ">In view of these things, and of the danger to which they were exposed of acting under their influence, the apostle proceeds to give them some solemn cautions and admonitions. He tells them that God resists all who are proud, but gives grace to all who are humble, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:6">James 4:6</span>; he counsels them to submit to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:7">James 4:7</span>, to resist the devil, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:7">James 4:7</span>, to draw nigh to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span>, to cleanse their hands and their hearts, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span>, to be afflicted and mourn over their sins, and to become serious and devout, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:9">James 4:9</span>, and to humble themselves before God that he might lift them up <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:10">James 4:10</span>; he commands them not to speak evil one of another, since by so doing they in fact set themselves up to be judges, and in the circumstances became judges of the law as well as of their brethren, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:11-12">James 4:11-12</span>. He then rebukes the confident spirit which lays its plans for the future with no just view of the frailty and uncertainty of human life, and shows them that all their plans for the future should be formed with a distinct recognition of their dependence on God for success, and even for the continuance of life, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:13-16">James 4:13-16</span>. The chapter closes with an affirmation that to him that knows how to do good and does it not, to him it is sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:17">James 4:17</span>, implying that all he had said in the chapter might indeed be obvious, and that they would be ready to admit that these things were true, and that if they knew this, and did not do right, they must be regarded as guilty.</p>
