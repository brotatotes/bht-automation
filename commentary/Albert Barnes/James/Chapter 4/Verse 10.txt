<p style=" "><b>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:12">Matthew 23:12</span>. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:6">James 4:6</span>. That is, be willing to take your appropriate place in the dust on account of your transgressions. This is to be “in the sight of the Lord,” or before him. Our sins have been committed against him; and their principal aggravation, whoever may have been wronged by them, and great as is their criminality in other respects, arises from that consideration. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:4">Psalms 51:4</span>, “against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:18">Luke 15:18</span>, “I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee.” As the Being against whom we have sinned is the only one who can pardon, it is proper that we should humble ourselves before him with penitent confession.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he shall lift you up - </b>He will exalt you from the condition of a broken-hearted penitent to that of a forgiven child; will wipe away your tears, remove the sadness of your heart, fill you with joy, and clothe you with the garments of salvation. This declaration is in accordance with all the promises in the Bible, and with all the facts which occur on the earth, that God is willing to show mercy to the humble and contrite, and to receive those who are truly penitent into his favor.
