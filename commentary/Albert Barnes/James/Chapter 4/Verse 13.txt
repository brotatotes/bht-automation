<p style=" "><b>Go to now - </b>The apostle here introduces a new subject, and refers to another fault which was doubtless prevalent among them, as it is everywhere, that of a presumptuous confidence respecting the future, or of forming plans stretching into the future, without any proper sense of the uncertainty of life, and of our absolute dependence on God. The phrase “go to now,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄγε νῦν</span></span> age nun,) is a phrase designed to arrest attention, as if there were something that demanded their notice, and especially, as in this case, with the implied thought that that to which the attention is called is wrong. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:1">James 5:1</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:7">Genesis 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:18">Isaiah 1:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye that say - </b>You that form your plans in this manner or that speak thus confidently of what you will do in the future. The word say here probably refers to what was in their thoughts, rather than to what was openly expressed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city - </b>That is, they say this without any proper sense of the uncertainty of life, and of their absolute dependence on God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And continue there a year - </b>Fixing a definite time; designating the exact period during which they would remain, and when they would leave, without any reference to the will of God. The apostle undoubtedly means to refer here to this as a mere specimen of what he would reprove. It cannot be supposed that he refers to this single case alone as wrong. All plans are wrong that are formed in the same spirit. “The practice to which the apostle here alludes,” says the editor of the Pictorial Bible, “is very common in the East to this day, among a very respectable and intelligent class of merchants. They convey the products of one place to some distant city, where they remain until they have disposed of their own goods and have purchased others suitable for another distant market; and thus the operation is repeated, until, after a number of years, the trader is enabled to return prosperously to his home. Or again, a shopkeeper or a merchant takes only the first step in this process - conveying to a distant town, where the best purchases of his own line are to be made, such goods as are likely to realise a profit, and returning, without any farther stop, with a stock for his own concern. These operations are seldom very rapid, as the adventurer likes to wait opportunities for making advantageous bargains; and sometimes opens a shop in the place to which he comes, to sell by retail the goods which he has bought.” The practice is common in India.

<p style=" "><b>And buy and sell, and get gain - </b>It is not improbable that there is an allusion here to the commercial habits of the Jews at the time when the apostle wrote. Many of them were engaged in foreign traffic, and for this purpose made long journeys to distant trading cities, as Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, etc. - Bloomfield.</p>
