<p style=" "><b>Be ye also patient - </b>As the farmer is. In due time, as he expects the return of the rain, so you may anticipate deliverance from your trials.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Stablish your hearts - </b>Let your purposes and your faith be firm and unwavering. Do not become weary and fretful; but bear with constancy all that is laid upon you, until the time of your deliverance shall come.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the coming of the Lord draweth nigh - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:10">Revelation 22:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span>; the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>. It is clear, I think, from this place, that the apostle expected that that which he understood by “the coming of the Lord” was soon to occur; for it was to be that by which they would obtain deliverance from the trials which they then endured. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span>. Whether it means that he was soon to come to judgment, or to bring to an end the Jewish policy and to set up his kingdom on the earth, or that they would soon be removed by death, cannot be determined from the mere use of the language. The most natural interpretation of the passage, and one which will accord well with the time when the Epistle was written, is, that the predicted time of the destruction of Jerusalem <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span> was at hand; that there were already indications that that would soon occur; and that there was a prevalent expectation among Christians that that event would be a release from many trials of persecution, and would be followed by the setting up of the Redeemer’s kingdom.</p>
<p style=" ">Perhaps many expected that the judgment would occur at that time, and that the Saviour would set up a personal reign on the earth. But the expectation of others might have been merely - what is indeed all that is necessarily implied in the predictions on the subject - that there would be after that a rapid and extensive spread of the principles of the Christian religion in the world. The destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple would contribute to that by bringing to an end the whole system of Jewish types and sacrifices; by convincing Christians that there was not to be one central rallying-point, thus destroying their lingering prejudices in favor of the Jewish mode of worship; and by scattering them abroad through the world to propagate the new religion. The Epistle was written, it is supposed, some ten or twelve years before the destruction of Jerusalem, (Introduction, Section 3,) and it is not improbable that there were already some indications of that approaching event.</p>
