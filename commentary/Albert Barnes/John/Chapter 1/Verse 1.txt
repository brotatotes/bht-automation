<p style=" "><b>In the beginning - </b>This expression is used also in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>. John evidently has allusion here to that place, and he means to apply to “the Word” an expression which is there applied “to God.” In both places it clearly means before creation, before the world was made, when as yet there was nothing. The meaning is: that the “Word” had an existence before the world was created. This is not spoken of the man Jesus, but of that which “became” a man, or was incarnate, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. The Hebrews, by expressions like this, commonly denoted eternity. Thus. the eternity of God is described <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+90:2">Psalms 90:2</span>; “Before the mountains were brought forth, etc.;” and eternity is commonly expressed by the phrase, before the foundation of the world.” Whatever is meant by the term “Word,” it is clear that it had an existence before “creation.” It is not, then, a “creature” or created being, and must be, therefore, uncreated and eternal. There is only one Being that is uncreated, and Jesus must be therefore divine. Compare the Saviour’s own declarations respecting himself in the following places: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:46">John 6:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was the Word - </b>Greek, “was the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λόγος</span></span> Logos.” This name is given to him who afterward became “flesh,” or was incarnate (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> - that is, to the Messiah. Whatever is meant by it, therefore, is applicable to the Lord Jesus Christ. There have been many opinions about the reason why this name was given to the Son of God. It is unnecessary to repeat those opinions. The opinion which seems most plausible may be expressed as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1. A “word” is that by which we communicate our will; by which we convey our thoughts; or by which we issue commands the medium of communication with others.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2. The Son of God may be called “the Word,” because he is the medium by which God promulgates His will and issues His commandments. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-3">Hebrews 1:1-3</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3. This term was in use before the time of John.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was with God - </b>This expression denotes friendship or intimacy. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:19">Mark 9:19</span>. John affirms that he was “with God” in the beginning - that is, before the world was made. It implies, therefore, that he was partaker of the divine glory; that he was blessed and happy with God. It proves that he was intimately united with the Father, so as to partake of his glory and to be appropriately called by the name God. He has himself explained it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; “And now, O Father, glorify thou we with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; “No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>; “The Son of man, which is in heaven.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6-7">Philippians 2:6-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was God - </b>In the previous phrase John had said that the Word was “with God.” Lest it should be supposed that he was a different and inferior being, here John states that “he was God.” There is no more unequivocal declaration in the Bible than this, and there could be no stronger proof that the sacred writer meant to affirm that the Son of God was equal with the Father; because:</p>
<p style=" ">The meaning of this important verse may then be thus summed up:</p>
<p style=" ">This is the foundation of the doctrine of the Trinity:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That the second person is in some sense “distinct” from the first.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That he is intimately united with the first person in essence, so that there are not two or more Gods.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That the second person may be called by the same name; has the same attributes; performs the same works; and is entitled to the same honors with the first, and that therefore he is “the same in substance, and equal in power and glory,” with God.</p>
