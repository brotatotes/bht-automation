<p style=" "><b>He was in the world - </b>This refers, probably, not to his pre-existence, but to the fact that he became incarnate; that he dwelt among human beings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the world was made by him - </b>This is a repetition of what is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>. Not only “men,” but all material things, were made by him. These facts are mentioned here to make what is said immediately after more striking, to wit, that men did not receive him. The proofs which he furnished that they ought to receive him were:</p>
<p style=" "><b>The world knew him not - </b>The word “knew” is sometimes used in the sense of “approving” or “loving,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:6">Psalms 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>. In this sense it may be used here. The world did not love or approve him, but rejected him and put him to death. Or it may mean that they did not understand or know that he was the Messiah; for had the Jews known and believed that he was the Messiah, they would not have put him to death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>; “Had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.” Yet they might have known it, and therefore they were not the less to blame.</p>
