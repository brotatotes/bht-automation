<p style=" "><b>He came unto his own - </b>His own “land” or “country.” It was called his land because it was the place of his birth, and also because it was the chosen land where God delighted to dwell and to manifest his favor. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:1-7">Isaiah 5:1-7</span>. Over that land the laws of God had been extended, and that land had been regarded as especially his, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+147:19-20">Psalms 147:19-20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His own - </b>His own “people.” There is a distinction here in the original words which is not preserved in the translation. It may be thus expressed: “He came to his own land, and his own people received him not.” They were his people, because God had chosen them to be his above all other nations; had given to them his laws; and had signally protected and favored them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:6">Deuteronomy 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+14:2">Deuteronomy 14:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Received him not - </b>Did not acknowledge him to be the Messiah. They rejected him and put him to death, agreeably to the prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:3-4">Isaiah 53:3-4</span>. From this we learn,</p>
