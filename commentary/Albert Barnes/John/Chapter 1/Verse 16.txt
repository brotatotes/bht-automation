<p style=" "><b>Of his fulness - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> the evangelist has said that Christ was “full of grace and truth.” Of that “fullness” he now says that all the disciples had received; that is, they derived from his abundant truth and mercy grace to understand the plan of salvation, to preach the gospel, to live lives of holiness; they “partook” of the numerous blessings which he came to impart by his instructions and his death. These are undoubtedly not the words of John the Baptist, but of the evangelist John, the writer of this gospel. They are a continuation of what he was saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span> being evidently thrown in as a parenthesis. The declaration had not exclusive reference, probably, to the apostles, but it is extended to all Christians, for all believers have received of the “fulness of grace and truth” that is in Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>. In all these places our Saviour is represented as the fulness of God - as “abounding” in mercy, as exhibiting the divine attributes, and as possessing in himself all that is necessary to fill his people with truth, and grace, and love.</p>
