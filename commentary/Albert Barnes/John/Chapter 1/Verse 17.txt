<p style=" "><b>The law was given - </b>The Old Testament economy. The institutions under which the Jews lived.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By Moses - </b>By Moses, as the servant of God. He was the great legislator of the Jews, by whom, under God, their polity was formed. The law worketh wrath <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>; it was attended with many burdensome rites and ceremonies <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>; it was preparatory to another state of things. The gospel succeeded that and took its place, and thus showed the greatness of the gospel economy, as well as its grace and truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ - </b>A system of religion full of favors, and the “true” system, was revealed by him. The old system was one of “law,” and “shadows,” and “burdensome rites;” “this” was full of mercy to mankind, and was true in all things. We may learn from these verses:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That all our mercies come from Jesus Christ.</p>
