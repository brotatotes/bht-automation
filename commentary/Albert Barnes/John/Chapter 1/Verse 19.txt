<p style=" "><b>This is the record - </b>The word “record” here means “testimony,” in whatever way given. The word “record” now commonly refers to “written” evidence. This is not its meaning here. John’s testimony was given without writing.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When the Jews sent - </b>John’s fame was great. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:5">Matthew 3:5</span>. It spread from the region of Galilee to Jerusalem, and the nation seemed to suppose, from the character of his preaching, that he was the Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</span>. The great council of the nation, or the Sanhedrin, had, among other things, the charge of religion. They felt it to be their duty, therefore, to inquire into the character and claims of John, and to learn whether he was the Messiah. It is not improbable that they wished that he might be the long-expected Christ, and were prepared to regard him as such.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When the Jews sent priests and Levites - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:31-32">Luke 10:31-32</span>. These were probably members of the Sanhedrin.</p>
