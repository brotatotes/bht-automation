<p style=" "><b>The same - </b>The Word, or the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λόγος</span></span> Logos.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was in the beginning with God - </b>This seems to be a repetition of what was said in the first verse; but it is stated over again to “guard the doctrine,” and to prevent the possibility of a mistake. John had said that he existed before the creation, and that he was “with God;” but he had not said in the first verse “that the union with God existed in the beginning.” He now expresses that idea, and assures us that that union was not one which was commenced in time, and which might be, therefore, a mere union of feeling, or a compact, like that between any other beings, but was one which existed in eternity, and which was therefore a union of nature or essence.</p>
