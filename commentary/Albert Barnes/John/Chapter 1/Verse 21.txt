<p style=" "><b>Art thou Elias? - </b>This is the Greek way of writing Elijah. The Jews expected that Elijah would appear before the Messiah came. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:14">Matthew 11:14</span>. They supposed that it would be the real Elijah returned from heaven. In this sense John denied that he was Elijah; but he did not deny that he was the Elias or Elijah which the prophet intended <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:3">Matthew 3:3</span>, for he immediately proceeds to state <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:23">John 1:23</span> that he was sent, as it was predicted that Elijah would be, to prepare the way of the Lord; so that, while he corrected their false notions about Elijah, he so clearly stated to them his true character that they might understand that he was really the one predicted as Elijah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That prophet - </b>It is possible that the Jews supposed that not only “Elijah” would reappear before the coming of the Messiah, but also “Jeremiah.” See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:14">Matthew 16:14</span>. Some have supposed, however, that this question has reference to the prediction of Moses in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>.</p>
