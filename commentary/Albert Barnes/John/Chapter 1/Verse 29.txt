<p style=" "><b>The next day - </b>The day after the Jews made inquiry whether he was the Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Behold the Lamb of God - </b>A “lamb,” among the Jews, was killed and eaten at the Passover to commemorate their deliverance from Egypt, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:3-11">Exodus 12:3-11</span>. A lamb was offered in the tabernacle, and afterward in the temple, every morning and evening, as a part of the daily worship, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:38-39">Exodus 29:38-39</span>. The Messiah was predicted as a lamb led to the slaughter, to show his patience in his sufferings, and readiness to die for man, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:7">Isaiah 53:7</span>. A lamb, among the Jews, was also an emblem of patience, meekness, gentleness. On “all” these accounts, rather than on any one of them alone, Jesus was called “the Lamb.” He was innocent <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:23-25">1 Peter 2:23-25</span>; he was a sacrifice for sin the substance represented by the daily offering of the lamb, and slain at the usual time of the evening sacrifice <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:44-46">Luke 23:44-46</span>; and he was what was represented by the Passover, turning away the anger of God, and saving sinners by his blood from vengeance and eternal death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of God - </b>Appointed by God, approved by God, and most dear to him; the sacrifice which he chose, and which he approves to save people from death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which taketh away - </b>This denotes his “bearing” the sins of the world, or the sufferings which made an atonement for sin. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:4">Isaiah 53:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>. He takes away sin by “bearing” in his own body the sufferings which God appointed to show his sense of the evil of sin, thus magnifying the law, and rendering it consistent for him to pardon. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24-25">Romans 3:24-25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the world - </b>Of all mankind, Jew and Gentile. His work was not to be confined to the Jew, but was also to benefit the Gentile; it was not confined to any one part of the world, but was designed to open the way of pardon to all men. He was the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:15">2 Corinthians 5:15</span>.</p>
