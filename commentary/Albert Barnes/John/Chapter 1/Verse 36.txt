<p style=" "><b>Looking upon Jesus ... - </b>Fixing his eyes intently upon him. Singling him out and regarding him with special attention. Contemplating him as the long-expected Messiah and Deliverer of the world. In this way all ministers should fix the eye upon the Son of God, and direct all others to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As he walked - </b>While Jesus was walking.</p>
