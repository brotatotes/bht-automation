<p style=" "><b>In him was life - </b>The evangelist had just affirmed <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:3">John 5:3</span> that by the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λόγος</span></span> Logos or “Word” the world was originally created. One part of that creation consisted “in breathing into man the breath of life,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:7">Genesis 2:7</span>. God is declared to be “life,” or the “living” God, because he is the source or fountain of life. This attribute is here ascribed to Jesus Christ. He not merely made the material worlds, but he also gave “life.” He was the agent by which the vegetable world became animated; by which brutes live; and by which man became a living soul, or was endowed with immortality. This was a “higher” proof that the “Word was God,” than the creation of the material worlds; but there is another sense in which he was “life.” The “new creation,” or the renovation of man and his restoration from a state of sin, is often compared with the “first creation;” and as the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λόγος</span></span> Logos was the source of “life” then, so, in a similar but higher sense, he is the source of “life” to the soul dead in trespasses and sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>. And it is probably in reference to this that he is so often called “life” in the writings of John. “For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in him self,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>; “He giveth life unto the world,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>; “I am the resurrection and the life,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>; “This is the true God and eternal life,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1-2">1 John 1:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:11">1 John 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>. The meaning is: that he is the source or the fountain of both natural and spiritual life. Of course he has the attributes of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The life was the light of men - </b>“Light” is that by which we see objects distinctly. The light of the sun enables us to discern the form, the distance, the magnitude, and the relation of objects, and prevents the perplexities and dangers which result from a state of darkness. Light is in all languages, therefore, put for “knowledge” - for whatever enables us to discern our duty, and that saves us from the evils of ignorance and error. “Whatsoever doth make manifest is light,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13">Ephesians 5:13</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:20">Isaiah 8:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span>. The Messiah was predicted as the “light” of the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:15-16">Matthew 4:15-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>.

This was done before his advent by his direct agency in giving man reason or understanding, and in giving his law, for the “law was ordained by angels ‘in the hand of a mediator’” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>; after his advent by his personal ministry when on earth, by his Spirit <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>, and by his ministers since, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>.</p>
