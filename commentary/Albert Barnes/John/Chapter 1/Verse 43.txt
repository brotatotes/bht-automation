He was now about to return to his native country.Findeth Philip - This does not refer to his calling these disciples to be “apostles,” for that took place at the Sea of Tiberias Matthew 4:18, but it refers to their being. convinced that he was the Christ. This is the object of this evangelist, to show how and when they were convinced of this.
