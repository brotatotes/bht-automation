<p style=" "><b>Verily, verily - </b>In the Greek, “Amen, amen.” The word “amen” means “truly, certainly, so be it” - from the Hebrew verb to confirm, to establish, to be true. It is often used in this gospel. When repeated it expresses the speaker’s sense of the importance of what he is saying, and the “certainty” that it is as he affirms.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye shall see - </b>Not, perhaps, with the bodily eyes, but you shall have “evidence” that it is so. The thing shall take place, and you shall be a witness of it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Heaven open - </b>This is a figurative expression, denoting “the conferring of favors.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:23-24">Psalms 78:23-24</span>; “he opened the doors of heaven, and had rained down manna.” It also denotes that God was about to work a miracle in attestation of a particular thing. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>. In the language, here, there is an evident allusion to the ladder that Jacob saw in a dream, and to the angels ascending and descending on it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+28:12">Genesis 28:12</span>. It is not probable that Jesus referred to any particular instance in which Nathanael should literally see the heavens opened. The baptism of Jesus had taken place, and no other instance occurred in his life in which it is said that the “heavens were” opened.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Angels of God - </b>Those pure and holy beings that dwell in heaven, and that are employed as ministering spirits to our world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>. Good men are represented in the Scriptures as being under their protection, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+91:11-12">Psalms 91:11-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+28:12">Genesis 28:12</span>. They are the agents by which God often expressed his will to men, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>. They are represented as strengthening the Lord Jesus, and ministering unto him. Thus they aided him in the wilderness <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:13">Mark 1:13</span>, and in the garden <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:43">Luke 22:43</span>, and they were present when he rose from the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:2-4">Matthew 28:2-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:12-13">John 20:12-13</span>. By their ascending and descending upon him it is probable that he meant that Nathanael would have evidence that they came to his aid, and that he would have “the” kind of protection and assistance from God which would show “more fully that he was the Messiah.” Thus his life, his many deliverances from dangers, his wisdom to confute his skilled and cunning adversaries, the scenes of his death, and the attendance of angels at his resurrection, may all be represented by the angels descending upon him, and all would show to Nathanael and the other disciples most clearly that he was the Son of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Son of man - </b>A term by which lie often describes himself. It shows his humility, his love for man, his willingness to be esteemed “as a man,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6-7">Philippians 2:6-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">From this interview with Nathanael we may learn:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That Jesus searches the heart.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That he was truly the Messiah.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That he was under the protection of God.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 4.That if we have faith in Jesus, it will be continually strengthened the evidence will grow brighter and brighter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 5.That if we believe his word, we shall yet see full proof that his word is true.</p>
<p style=" ">So we should not be ambitious of titles and honors. Ministers of the gospel most resemble him when they seek for the fewest titles, and do not aim at distinctions from each other or their brethren. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:8">Matthew 23:8</span>.</p>
