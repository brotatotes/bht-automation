<p style=" "><b>A man sent from God - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:0">Matthew 3:0</span>. The evangelist proceeds now to show that John the Baptist was not the Messiah and to state the true nature of his office. Many had supposed that he was the Christ, but this opinion he corrects; yet he admits that he was “sent from God” - that he was divinely commissioned. Though he denied that he was “the Messiah,” yet he did not deny that he was sent from or by heaven on an important errand to human beings. Some have supposed that the sole design of this gospel was to show that John the Baptist was not the Messiah. Though there is no foundation for this opinion, yet there is no doubt that one object was to show this. The main design was to show that “Jesus was the Christ,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31">John 20:31</span>. To do this, it was proper, in the beginning, to prove that “John” was not the Messiah; and this might have been at that time an important object. John made many disciples, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:5">Matthew 3:5</span>. Many persons supposed that he might be the Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>. “Many of these disciples of John remained” at Ephesus, “the very place where John is supposed to have written this gospel, long after the ascension of Jesus,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:1-3">Acts 19:1-3</span>. It is not improbable that there might have been many others who adhered to John, and perhaps many who supposed that he was the Messiah. On these accounts it was important for the evangelist to show that John “was not the Christ,” and to show, also, that he, who was extensively admitted to be a prophet, was an important “witness” to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ. The evangelist in the first four verses stated that “the Word” was divine; he now proceeds to state the proof that he was a “man,” and was the Messiah. The first evidence adduced is the testimony of John the Baptist.</p>
