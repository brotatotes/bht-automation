It does not follow, however, that he had no intimation before this that Jesus was the Christ, but it means that by this he should know it infallibly. From <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:13-14">Matthew 3:13-14</span>, it seems that John supposed, before the baptism of Jesus, that he claimed to be the Messiah, and, that he believed it; but the infallible, certain testimony in the case was the descent of the Holy Spirit on him at his baptism.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That this is the Son of God - </b>This was distinctly declared by a voice from heaven at his baptism, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>. This John heard, and he testified that he had heard it.</p>
