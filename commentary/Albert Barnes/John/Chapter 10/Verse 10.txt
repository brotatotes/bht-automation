<p style=" "><b>The thief cometh not ... - </b>The thief has no other design in coming but to plunder. So false teachers have no other end in view but to enrich or aggrandize themselves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am come that they might have life - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Might have it more abundantly - </b>Literally, that they may have abundance, or that which abounds. The word denotes that which is not absolutely essential to life, but which is superadded to make life happy. They shall not merely have life - simple, bare existence - but they shall have all those superadded things which are needful to make that life eminently blessed and happy. It would be vast mercy to keep men merely from annihilation or hell; but Jesus will give them eternal joy, peace, the society of the blessed, and all those exalted means of felicity which are prepared for them in the world of glory.</p>
