<p style=" "><b>The good shepherd - </b>The faithful and true shepherd, willing to do all that is necessary to defend and save the flock.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Giveth his life - </b>A shepherd that regarded his flock would hazard his own life to defend them. When the wolf comes, he would still remain to protect them. To give his life, here, means the same as not to fly, or to forsake his flock; to be willing to expose his life, if necessary, to defend them.
