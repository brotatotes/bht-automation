<p style=" "><b>Know my sheep - </b>Know my people, or my church. The word “know” here is used in the sense of affectionate regard or love. It implies such a knowledge of their wants, their dangers, and their characters, as to result in a deep interest in their welfare. Thus the word “knoweth,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:15">John 10:15</span>, is in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span> explained by the word “loveth.” Jesus knows the hearts, the dangers, and the wants of his people, and his kindness as their shepherd prompts him to defend and aid them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Am known of mine - </b>That is, he is known and loved as their Saviour and Friend. They have seen their sins, and dangers: and wants; they have felt their need of a Saviour; they have come to him, and they have found him and his doctrines to be such as they need, and they have loved him. And as a flock follows and obeys its kind shepherd, so they follow and obey him who leads them beside the still waters, and makes them to lie down in green pastures.</p>
