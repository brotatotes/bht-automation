<p style=" "><b>I lay down my life - </b>I give myself to die for my people, in Jewish and pagan lands. I offer myself a sacrifice to show the willingness of my Father to save them; to provide an atonement, and thus to open the way for their salvation. This proves that the salvation of man was an object dear to God, and that it was a source of special gratification to him that his Son was willing to lay down his life to accomplish his great purposes of benevolence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That I might take it again - </b>Be raised up from the dead, and glorified, and still carry on the work of redemption. See this same sentiment sublimely expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5-11">Philippians 2:5-11</span>.</p>
