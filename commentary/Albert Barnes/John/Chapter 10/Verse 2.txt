<p style=" "><b>He that entereth by the door - </b>This was the way in which a shepherd had access to his flock. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span> Jesus says he is the door. In this place he refers to those who by him - that is, in accordance with his spirit and law become ministers of religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is the shepherd of the sheep - </b>Christ does not here refer to himself, for he is the way or door by which others enter; but he refers to all the ministers of the gospel who have access to the church by him. In the original, the article “the” is missing before the word shepherd - “is a shepherd.” By his entering in this manner he shows that he is a shepherd one who cares for his flock, and does not come to kill and destroy.</p>
