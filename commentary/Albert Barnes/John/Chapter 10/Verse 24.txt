<p style=" "><b>Tell us plainly - </b>The Messiah was predicted as a shepherd. Jesus had applied that prediction to himself. They supposed that that was an evidence that he claimed to be the Messiah. He also performed miracles, which they considered as evidence that he was the Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:31">John 7:31</span>. Yet the rulers made a difficulty. They alleged that he was from Galilee, and that the Messiah could not come from thence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:52">John 7:52</span>. He was poor and despised. He came contrary to the common expectation. A splendid prince and conqueror had been expected. In this perplexity they came to him for a plain and positive declaration that he was the Messiah.</p>
