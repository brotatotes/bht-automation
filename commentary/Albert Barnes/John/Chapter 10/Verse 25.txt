<p style=" "><b>I told you - </b>It is not recorded that Jesus had told them in so many words that he was the Christ, but he had used expressions designed to convey the same truth, and which many of them understood as claiming to be the Messiah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>. The expression “the Son of God” they understood to be equivalent to the Messiah. This he had often used of himself in a sense not to be mistaken.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The works - </b>The miracles, such as restoring the blind, curing the sick, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In my Father’s name - </b>By the power and command of God. Jesus was either the Messiah or an impostor. The Pharisees charged him with being the latter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:60-61">Matthew 26:60-61</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:63">Matthew 27:63</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36">John 18:36</span>; but God would not give such power to an impostor. The power of working miracles is an attestation of God to what is taught. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>.</p>
