I give unto them eternal life - See John 5:24.Shall never perish - To perish here means to be destroyed, or to be punished in hell. Matthew 10:28; “which is able to destroy (the same word) both soul and body in hell.” Matthew 18:14; “it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.” John 3:15; “that whosoever believeth in him should not perish” Romans 2:12; They who have sinned without law shall also perish without law” Joh 17:12; 1 Corinthians 1:18. In all these places the word refers to future punishment, and the declaration of the Saviour is that his followers, his true disciples, shall never be cast away. The original is expressed with remarkable strength: “They shall not be destroyed forever.” Syriac: “They shall not perish to eternity.” This is spoken of all Christians - that is, of all who ever possess the character of true followers of Christ, and who can be called his flock.Shall any - The word “any” refers to any power that might attempt it. It will apply either to men or to devils. It is an affirmation that no man, however eloquent in error, or persuasive in infidelity, or cunning: in argument, or mighty in rank; and that no devil with all his malice, power, cunning, or allurements, shall be able to pluck them from his hand,Pluck them - In the original to rob; to seize and bear away as a robber does his prey. Jesus holds them so secure and so certainly that no foe can surprise him as a robber does, or overcome him by force.My hand - The hand is that by which we hold or secure an object. It means that Jesus has them safely in his own care and keeping. Compare Romans 8:38-39.
