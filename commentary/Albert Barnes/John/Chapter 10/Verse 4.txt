<p style=" "><b>He putteth forth - </b>Or leads them out of the fold.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He goeth before them - </b>He leads them, and guides them, and does not leave them. A shepherd spent his time with his flocks. He went before them to seek the best pastures and watering-places, and to defend them from danger. In this is beautifully represented the tender care of him who watches for souls as one that must give account.</p>
