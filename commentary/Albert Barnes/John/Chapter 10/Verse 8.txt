<p style=" "><b>All that ever came before me - </b>This does not refer to the prophets, but to those who came pretending to be the pastors or guides of the people. Some have supposed that he referred to those who pretended to be the Messiah before him; but there is not evidence that any such person appeared before the coming of Jesus. It is probable that he rather refers to the scribes and Pharisees, who claimed to be instructors of the people, who claimed the right to regulate the affairs of religion, and whose only aim was to aggrandize themselves and to oppress the people. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>. When the Saviour says that “all” were thieves, he speaks in a popular sense, using the word “all” as it is often used in the New Testament, to denote the great mass or the majority.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thieves and robbers - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>; also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:1">Jeremiah 23:1</span>; “Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:2-3">Ezekiel 34:2-3</span>; “Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the flock.” This had been the general character of the Pharisees and scribes. They sought wealth, office, ease at the expense of the people, and thus deserved the character of thieves and robbers. They insinuated themselves slyly as a thief, and they oppressed and spared not, like a robber.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The sheep - </b>The people of God - the pious and humble portion of the Jewish nation. Though the great mass of the people were corrupted, yet there were always some who were the humble and devoted people of God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:3-4">Romans 11:3-4</span>. So it will be always. Though the great mass of teachers may be corrupt, yet the true friends of God will mourn in secret places, and refuse to “listen to the instruction that causeth to err.”</p>
