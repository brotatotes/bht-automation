<p style=" "><b>Whom the Father hath sanctified - </b>The word “sanctify” with us means to make holy; but this is not its meaning here, for the Son of God was always holy. The original word means to set apart from a common to a sacred use; to devote to a sacred purpose, and to designate or consecrate to a holy office. This is the meaning here. God has consecrated or appointed his Son to be his Messenger or Messiah to mankind. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:41">Exodus 28:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:1">Exodus 29:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:44">Exodus 29:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+8:30">Leviticus 8:30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And sent into the world - </b>As the Messiah, an office far more exalted than that of magistrates.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am the Son of God - </b>This the Jews evidently understood as the same as saying that he was equal with God. This expression he had often applied to himself. The meaning of this place may be thus expressed: “You charge me with blasphemy. The foundation of that charge is the use of the name God, or the Son of God, applied to myself; yet that same term is applied in the Scriptures to magistrates. The use of it there shows that it is right to apply it to those who sustain important offices (see the notes of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34-35">John 10:34-35</span>). And especially you, Jews, ought not to attempt to found a charge of blasphemy on the application of a word to the Messiah which in your own Scriptures is applied to all magistrates. And we may remark here:</p>

<p style=" "><b>Believe the works - </b>Though you do not credit me, yet consider my works, for they prove that I came from God. No one could do them unless he was sent of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Father is in me ... - </b>Most intimately connected. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>. This expression denotes most intimate union - such as can exist in no other case. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>.</p>
