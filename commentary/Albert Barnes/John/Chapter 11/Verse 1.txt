<p style=" "><b>A certain man was sick - </b>The resurrection of Lazarus has been recorded only by John. Various reasons have been conjectured why the other evangelists did not mention so signal a miracle. The most probable is, that at the time they wrote Lazarus was still living. The miracle was well known, and yet to have recorded it might have exposed Lazarus to opposition and persecution from the Jews. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:10-11">John 12:10-11</span>. Besides, John wrote for Christians who were out of Palestine. The other gospels were written chiefly for those who were in Judea. There was the more need, therefore, that he should enter minutely into the account of the miracle, while the others did not deem it necessary or proper to record an event so well known.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Bethany - </b>A village on the eastern declivity of the Mount of Olives. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:1">Matthew 21:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The town of Mary - </b>The place where she lived. At that place also lived Simon the leper <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</span>, and there our Lord spent considerable part of his time when he was in Judea. The transaction recorded in this chapter occurred nearly four months after those mentioned in the previous chapter. Those occurred in December, and these at the approach of the Passover in April.</p>
