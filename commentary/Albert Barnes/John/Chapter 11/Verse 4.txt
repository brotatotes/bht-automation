<p style=" "><b>This sickness is not unto death - </b>The word “death” here is equivalent to remaining under death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>. “The wages of sin is death” - permanent or unchanging death, opposed to eternal life. Jesus evidently did not intend to deny that he would die. The words which he immediately adds show that he would expire, and that he would raise him up to show forth the power and glory of God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span>. Those words cannot be understood on any other supposition than that he expected to raise him up. The Saviour often used expressions similar to this to fix the attention on what he was about to say in explanation. The sense may be thus expressed: “His sickness is not fatal. It is not designed for his death, but to furnish an opportunity for a signal display of the glory of God, and to furnish a standing proof of the truth of religion. It is intended to exhibit the power of the Son of God, and to be a proof at once of the truth of his mission; of his friendship for this family; of his mild, tender, special love as a man; of his power and glory as the Messiah; and of the great doctrine that the dead will rise.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the glory of God - </b>That God may be honored. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:3">John 9:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That the Son of God ... - </b>The glory of God and of his Son is the same. That which promotes the one promotes also the other. Few things could do it more than the miracle which follows, evincing at once the lovely and tender character of Jesus as a man and a friend, and his power as the equal with God.</p>
