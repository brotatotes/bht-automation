<p style=" "><b>A loud voice - </b>Greek, “A great voice.” Syriac: “A high voice.” This was distinctly asserting his power. He uttered a distinct, audible voice, that there might be no suspicion of charm or incantation. The ancient magicians and jugglers performed their wonders by whispering and muttering. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:19">Isaiah 8:19</span>. Jesus spake openly and audibly, and asserted thus his power. So, also, in the day of judgment he will call the dead with a great sound of a trumpet, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lazarus, come forth! - </b>Here we may remark:</p>
<p style=" ">1. That Jesus did this by his own power.</p>
<p style=" ">2. The power of raising the dead is the highest of which we can conceive. The ancient pagan declared it to be even beyond the power of God. It implies not merely giving life to the deceased body, but the power of entering the world of spirits, of recalling the departed soul, and of reuniting it with the body. He that could do this must be omniscient as well as omnipotent; and if Jesus did it by his own power, it proves that he was divine.</p>
<p style=" ">3. This is a striking illustration of the general resurrection. In the same manner Jesus will raise all the dead. This miracle shows that it is possible; shows the way in which it will be done by the voice of the Son of God; and demonstrates the certainty that he will do it. Oh how important it is that we be prepared for that moment when his voice shall be heard in our silent tombs, and he shall call us forth again to life!</p>
