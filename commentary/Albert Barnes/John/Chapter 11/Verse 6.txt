<p style=" "><b>He abode two days - </b>Probably Lazarus died soon after the messengers left him. Jesus knew that (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span>), and did not hasten to Judea, but remained two days longer where he was, that there might not be the possibility of doubt that he was dead, so that when he came there he had been dead four days, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:39">John 11:39</span>. This shows, moreover, that he intended to raise him up. If he had not, it could hardly be reconciled with friendship thus to remain, without any reason, away from an afflicted family.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Where he was - </b>At Bethabara <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:28">John 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:40">John 10:40</span>, about 30 miles from Bethany. This was about a dayâ€™s journey, and it renders it probable that Lazarus died soon after the message was sent. One day would be occupied before the message came to him; two days he remained; one day would be occupied by him in going to Bethany; so that Lazarus had been dead four days <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:39">John 11:39</span> when he arrived.</p>
