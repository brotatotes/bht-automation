<p style=" "><b>Glorify thy name - </b>The meaning of this expression in this connection is this: “I am willing to bear any trials; I will not shrink from any sufferings. Let thy name be honored. Let thy character, wisdom, goodness, and plans of mercy be manifested and promoted, whatever sufferings it may cost me.” Thus Jesus showed us that God’s glory is to be the great end of our conduct, and that we are to seek that, whatever sufferings it may cost us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I have both glorified it - </b>The word “it” is not here in the original, but it is not improperly supplied by the translators. There can be no doubt that when God says here that he had glorified his name, he refers to what had been done by Christ, and that this was to be understood as an attestation that he attended him and approved his work. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:30">John 12:30</span>. He had honored his name, or had glorified him, by the pure instructions which he had given to man through him; by the power displayed in his miracles; by proclaiming his mercy through him; by appointing him to be the Messiah, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Will glorify it again - </b>By the death, the resurrection, and ascension of his Son, and by extending the blessings of the gospel among all nations. It was thus that he sustained his Son in view of approaching trials; and we may learn:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That God will minister grace to us in the prospect of suffering.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That the fact that God will be honored by our afflictions should make us willing to hear them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That whatever was done by Christ tended to honor the name of God. This was what he had in view. He lived and suffered, not for himself, but to glorify God in the salvation of men.</p>
