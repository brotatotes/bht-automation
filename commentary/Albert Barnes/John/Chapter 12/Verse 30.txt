<p style=" "><b>Came not because of me - </b>Not to strengthen or confirm me; not that I had any doubts about my course, or any apprehension that God would not approve me and glorify his name.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For your sakes - </b>To give you a striking and indubitable proof that I am the Messiah; that you may remember it when I am departed, and be yourselves comforted, supported, and saved.</p>
