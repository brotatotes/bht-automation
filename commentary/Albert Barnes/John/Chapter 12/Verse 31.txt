<p style=" "><b>Now is the judgment of this world - </b>Greek: “crisis.” This expression, doubtless, has reference to his approaching death, and whatever he means by judgment here relates to something that was to be accomplished by that death. It cannot mean that then was to be the time in which the world was to be finally judged, for he says that he did not come then to judge the world <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:47">John 12:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:15">John 8:15</span>, and he has clearly declared that there shall be a future day when he will judge all mankind. The meaning of it may be thus expressed: “Now is approaching the decisive scene, the eventful period - the crisis - when it shall be determined who shall rule this world. There has been a long conflict between the powers of light and darkness between God and the devil. Satan has so effectually ruled that he may be said to be the prince of this world; but my approaching death will destroy his kingdom, will break down his power, and will be the means of setting up the kingdom of God over man.” The death of Christ was to be the most grand and effectual of all means that could be used to establish the authority of the law and the government of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3-4">Romans 8:3-4</span>. This it did by showing the regard which God had for his law; by showing his hatred of sin, and presenting the strongest motives to induce man to leave the service of Satan; by securing the influences of the Holy Spirit, and by his putting forth his own direct power in the cause of virtue and of God. The death of Jesus was the determining cause, the grand crisis, the concentration of all that God had ever done, or ever will do, to break down the kingdom of Satan, and set up his power over man. Thus was fulfilled the prediction <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, “I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Now shall the prince of this world - </b>Satan, or the devil, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span>. He is also called the god of this world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>; “The rulers of the darkness of this world” - that is, the rulers of this dark world a well-known Hebraism. He is also called “the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>. All these names are given him from the influence or power which he has over the men of this world, because the great mass of men have been under his control and subject to his will.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be cast out - </b>His kingdom shall be destroyed; his empire shall come to an end. It does not mean that his reign over all men would entirely cease then, but that then would be the crisis, the grand conflict in which he would be vanquished, and from that time his kingdom begin to decline, until it would finally cease, and then be free altogether from his dominion. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18-20">Colossians 1:18-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:25-26">1 Corinthians 15:25-26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>.</p>
