<p style=" "><b>We have heard out of the law - </b>Out of the Old Testament; or rather we have been so taught by those who have interpreted the law to us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That Christ - </b>That the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Abideth for ever - </b>Will remain forever, or will live forever. The doctrine of many of them certainly was that the Messiah would not die; that he would reign as a prince forever over the people. This opinion was founded on such passages of Scripture as these: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>, “Thou art a priest forever;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:44">Daniel 2:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:13-14">Daniel 8:13-14</span>. In the interpretation of these passages they had overlooked such places as <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1-12">Isaiah 53:1-12</span>; nor did they understand how the fact that he would reign for ever could be reconciled with the idea of his death. To us, who understand that his reign does not refer to a temporal, an earthly kingdom, it is easy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How sayest thou ... - </b>We have understood by the title “the Son of man” the same as the Messiah, and that he is to reign forever. How can he be put to death?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who is this Son of man? - </b>“The Son of man we understand to be the Messiah spoken of by Daniel, who is to reign forever. To him, therefore, you cannot refer when you say that he must be lifted up, or must die. Who is it - what other Son of man is referred to but the Messiah?” Either ignorantly or willfully, they supposed he referred to some one else than the Messiah.</p>
