<p style=" "><b>He that rejecteth me - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:16">Luke 10:16</span>. The word “reject” means to despise, or to refuse to receive him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath one - </b>That is, he needs not my voice to condemn him. He will carry his own condemnation with him, even should I be silent. His own conscience will condemn him. The words which I have spoken will be remembered and will condemn him, if there were nothing further. From this we learn:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That a guilty conscience needs no accuser.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That the words of Christ, and the messages of mercy which the sinner has rejected, will be remembered by him.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That this will be the source of his condemnation. This will make him miserable, and there will be no possibility of his being happy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 4.That the conscience of the sinner will concur with the sentence of Christ in the great day, and that he will go to eternity self-condemned. It is this which will make the pains of hell so intolerable to the sinner.</p>
