He that rejecteth me - Luke 10:16. The word “reject” means to despise, or to refuse to receive him.Hath one - That is, he needs not my voice to condemn him. He will carry his own condemnation with him, even should I be silent. His own conscience will condemn him. The words which I have spoken will be remembered and will condemn him, if there were nothing further. From this we learn: 1.That a guilty conscience needs no accuser. 2.That the words of Christ, and the messages of mercy which the sinner has rejected, will be remembered by him. 3.That this will be the source of his condemnation. This will make him miserable, and there will be no possibility of his being happy. 4.That the conscience of the sinner will concur with the sentence of Christ in the great day, and that he will go to eternity self-condemned. It is this which will make the pains of hell so intolerable to the sinner.
