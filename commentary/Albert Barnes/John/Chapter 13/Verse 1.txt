<p style=" "><b>Having loved his own - </b>Having given to them decisive and constant proofs of his love. This was done by his calling them to follow him; by patiently teaching them; by bearing with their errors and weaknesses; and by making them the heralds of his truth and the heirs of eternal life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He loved them unto the end - </b>That is, he continued the proofs of his love until he was taken away from them by death. Instances of that love John proceeds immediately to record in his washing their feet and in the institution of the Lord’s Supper. We may remark that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He does not change; he always loves the same traits of character; nor does he withdraw his love from the soul. If his people walk in darkness and wander from him, the fault is theirs, not his. His is the character of a friend that never leaves or forsakes us; a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:28">Psalms 37:28</span>; “the Lord ...forsaketh not his saints.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:14-17">Isaiah 49:14-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+18:24">Proverbs 18:24</span>.</p>
