<p style=" "><b>He that is washed - </b>This is a difficult passage, and interpreters have been divided about its meaning. Some have supposed that it was customary to bathe before eating the paschal supper, and that the apostles did it; Jesus having said, “he that hath bathed his body is clean except in regard to his feet - to the dirt contracted in returning from the bath, and that there was need only that the feet should be washed in order to prepare them properly to receive the supper.” They suppose, also, that the lesson which Jesus meant to teach was that they were really pure <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:3">John 15:3</span>; that they were qualified to partake of the ordinances of religion, and needed only to be purified from occasional blemishes and impurities (Grotius). Others say that there is not evidence that the Jews bathed before partaking of the Paschal Supper, but that reference is made to the custom of washing their hands and their face. It is known that this was practiced. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:2">Matthew 15:2</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3-4">Mark 7:3-4</span> notes. Peter had requested him to wash his hands and his head. Jesus told him that as that had been done, it was unnecessary to repeat it; but to wash the feet was an act of hospitality, the office of a servant, and that all that was needed now was for him to show this condescension and humility. Probably reference is had here to internal purity, as Jesus was fond of drawing illustrations from every quarter to teach them spiritual doctrine; as if he had said, “You are clean by my word and ministry <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:3">John 15:3</span>; you are my followers, and are prepared for the scene before you. But one thing remains. And as, when we come to this rite, having washed, there remains no need of washing except to wash the feet, so there is now nothing remaining but for me to show you an example that you will always remember, and that shall complete my public instructions to you.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is clean - </b>This word may apply to the body or the soul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Every whit - </b>Altogether, wholly.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye are clean - </b>Here the word has doubtless reference to the mind and heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But not all - </b>You are not all my true followers, and fitted for the ordinance before us.</p>
