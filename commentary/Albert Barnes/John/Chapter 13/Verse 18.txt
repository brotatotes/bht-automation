<p style=" "><b>I speak not of you all - </b>That is, in addressing you as clean, I do not mean to say that you all possess this character.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I know whom I have chosen - </b>He here means evidently to say that he had not chosen them all, implying that Judas had not been chosen. As, however, this word is applied to Judas in one place <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>, “Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?” it must have a different meaning here from that which it has there. There it evidently refers to the apostleship. Jesus had chosen him to be an apostle, and had treated him as such. Here it refers to purity of heart, and Jesus implies that, though Judas had been chosen to the office of apostleship, yet he had not been chosen to purity of heart and life. The remaining eleven had been, and would be saved. It was not, however, the fault of Jesus that Judas was not saved, for he was admitted to the same teaching, the same familiarity, and the same office; but his execrable love of gold gained the ascendency, and rendered vain all the means used for his conversion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But that the scripture ... - </b>These things have occurred in order that the prophecies may receive their completion. It does not mean that Judas was compelled to this course in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, but that this was foretold, and that by this the prophecy did receive a completion. “The scripture.” This is written in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9">Psalms 41:9</span>. It is commonly understood of Ahithophel, and of the enemies of David who had been admitted to his friendship, and who had now proved ungrateful to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>May be fulfilled - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22">Matthew 1:22</span>. It is difficult to tell whether this prophecy had a primary reference to Judas, or whether it be meant that it received a more complete fulfillment in his case than in the time of David. The cases were similar; the same words would describe both events, for there was an exhibition of similar ingratitude and baseness in both cases, so that the same words would fitly describe both events.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He that eateth bread with me - </b>To eat with one was a proof of friendship. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+9:11">2 Samuel 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:11">Matthew 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+43:32">Genesis 43:32</span>. This means that Judas had been admitted to all the privileges of friendship, and had partaken of the usual evidences of affection. It was this which greatly aggravated his offence. It was base ingratitude as well as murder.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath lifted up his heel - </b>Suidas says that this figure is taken from those who are running in a race, when one attempts to trip the other up and make him fall. It was a base and ungrateful return for kindness to which the Lord Jesus referred, and it means that he who had been admitted to the intimacies of friendship had ungratefully and maliciously injured him. Some suppose the expression means to lay snares for one others, to kick or injure a man after he is cast down (Calvin on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9">Psalms 41:9</span>). It is clear that it denotes great injury, and injury aggravated by the fact of professed friendship. It was not merely the common people, the open enemies, the Jewish nation that did it, but one who had received all the usual proofs of kindness. It was this which greatly aggravated our Saviour’s sufferings.</p>
