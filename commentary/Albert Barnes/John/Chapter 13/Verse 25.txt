<p style=" "><b>He then lying on Jesusâ€™ breast - </b>This is a different word from the one rendered <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:23">John 13:23</span> leaning. It means falling back or reclining on the bosom of Jesus. When Peter spake, John laid his head back on the bosom of Jesus, so that he could speak to him privately without being heard by others.</p>
