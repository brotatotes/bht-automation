<p style=" "><b>After the sop - </b>After he had taken and probably eaten it. By this Judas saw that Jesus knew his design, and that he could not conceal his plan. He saw, also, that the other disciples would be acquainted with it; and, aroused by sudden anger, or with the apprehension that he should lose his reward, or that Jesus might escape, he resolved on executing his plan at once.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Satan entered into him - </b>The devil had before this put it into his heart to betray Jesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:2">John 13:2</span>, but he now excited him to a more decided purpose. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3">Luke 22:3</span>; also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span>; “Why hath Satan filled thine heart,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>What thou doest, do quickly - </b>This showed to Judas that Jesus was acquainted with his design. He did not command him to betray him, but he left him to his own purpose. He had used means enough to reclaim him and lead him to a holy life, and now he brought him to a decision. He gave him to understand that he was acquainted with his plan, and submitted it to the conscience of Judas to do quickly what he would do. If he relented, he called on him to do it at once. If he could still pursue his wicked plan, could go forward when he was conscious that the Saviour knew his design, he was to do it at once. God adopts all means to bring men to a decision. He calls upon them to act decisively, firmly, immediately. He does not allow them the privilege to deliberate about wicked deeds, but calls on them to act at once, and to show whether they will obey or disobey him; whether they will serve him, or whether they will betray fits cause. He knows all their plans, as Jesus did that of Judas, and he calls on men to act under the full conviction that he knows all their soul. Sin thus is a vast evil. When men can sin knowing that God sees it all, it shows that the heart is fully set in them to do evil, and that there is nothing that will restrain them.</p>
