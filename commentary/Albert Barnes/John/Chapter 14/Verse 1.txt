<p style=" "><b>Let not your heart be troubled - </b>The disciples had been greatly distressed at what Jesus had said about leaving them. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:6">John 16:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>. Perhaps they had indicated their distress to him in some manner by their countenance or their expressions, and he proceeds new to administer to them such consolations as their circumstances made proper. The discourse in this chapter was delivered, doubtless, while they were sitting at the table partaking of the Lord’s Supper (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span>); that in John 15–16, and the prayer in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:0">John 17:0</span>, were while they were on their way to the Mount of Olives. There is nowhere to be found a discourse so beautiful, so tender, so full of weighty thoughts, and so adapted to produce comfort, as that which occurs in these three chapters of John. It is the consolatory part of our religion, where Christ brings to bear on the mind full of anxiety, and perplexity, and care, the tender and inimitably beautiful truths of his gospel - truths fitted to allay every fear, silence every complaint, and give every needed consolation to the soul. In the case of the disciples there was much to trouble them. They were about to part with their beloved, tender friend. They were to be left alone to meet persecutions and trials. They were without wealth, without friends, without honors. And it is not improbable that they felt that his death would demolish all their schemes, for they had not yet fully learned the doctrine that the Messiah must suffer and die, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:21">Luke 24:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye believe in God - </b>This may be read either in the indicative mood or the imperative. Probably it should be read in the imperative - “Believe on God, and believe on me.” If there were no other reason for it, this is sufficient, that there was no more evidence that they did believe in God than that they believed in Jesus. All the ancient versions except the Latin read it thus. The Saviour told them that their consolation was to be found at this time in confidence in God and in him; and he intimated what he had so often told them and the Jews, that there was an indissoluble union between him and the Father. This union he takes occasion to explain to them more fully, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:7-12">John 14:7-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Believe in - </b>Put confidence in, rely on for support and consolation.</p>
