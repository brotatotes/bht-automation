I am in the Father - See the notes at John 10:38.The words that I speak ... - See the notes at John 7:16-17.The Father that dwelleth in me - Literally, “The Father remaining in me.” This denotes most intimate union, so that the works which Jesus did might be said to be done by the Father. It implies a more intimate union than can subsist between a mere man and God. Had Jesus been a mere man, like the prophets, he would have said, “The Father who sent or commissioned me doeth the works;” but here there is reference, doubtless, to that mysterious and special union which subsists between the Father and the Son.He doeth the works - The miracles which had been performed by Jesus. The Father could be said to do them on account of the intimate union between him and the Son. See John 5:17, John 5:19, John 5:36; John 10:30.
