<p style=" "><b>Whatsoever ye shall ask - </b>This promise referred particularly to the apostles in their work of spreading the gospel; it is, however, true of all Christians, if what they ask is in faith, and according to the will of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:6">James 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:14">1 John 5:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In my name - </b>This is equivalent to saying on my account, or for my sake. If a man who has money in a bank authorizes us to draw it, we are said to do it in his name. If a son authorizes us to apply to his father for aid because we are his friends, we do it in the name of the son, and the favor will be bestowed on us from the regard which the parent has to his son, and through him to all his friends. So we are permitted to apply to God in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, because God is in him well pleased <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>, and because we are the friends of his Son he answers our requests. Though we are undeserving, yet he loves us on account of his Son, and because he sees in us his image. No privilege is greater than that of approaching God in the name of his Son; no blessings of salvation can be conferred on any who do not come in his name.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That will I do - </b>Being exalted, he will be possessed of all power in heaven and earth <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>, and he therefore could fulfill all their desires.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That the Father may be glorified in the Son - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>.</p>
