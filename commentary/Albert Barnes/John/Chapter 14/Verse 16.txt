<p style=" "><b>I will pray the Father - </b>This refers to his intercession after his death and ascension to heaven, for this prayer was to be connected with their keeping his commandments. In what way he makes intercession in heaven for his people we do not know. The fact, however, is clearly made known, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14-15">Hebrews 4:14-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>. It is as the result of his intercession in heaven that we obtain all our blessings, and it is through him that our prayers are to be presented and made efficacious before God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Another Comforter - </b>Jesus had been to them a counsellor, a guide, a friend, while he was with them. He had instructed them, had borne with their prejudices and ignorance, and had administered consolation to them in the times of despondency. But he was about to leave them now to go alone into an unfriendly world. The other Comforter was to be given as a compensation for his absence, or to perform the offices toward them which he would have done if he had remained personally with them. And from this we may learn, in part, what is the office of the Spirit. It is to furnish to all Christians the instruction and consolation which would be given by the personal presence of Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14">John 16:14</span>. To the apostles it was particularly to inspire them with the knowledge of all truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>. Besides this, he came to convince men of sin. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8-11">John 16:8-11</span>. It was proper that such an agent should be sent into the world:</p>
<p style=" ">The word translated “Comforter” is used in the New Testament five times. In four instances it is applied to the Holy Spirit - <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>. In the other instance it is applied to the Lord Jesus - <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>; “We have an advocate (Paraclete - Comforter) with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” It is used, therefore, only by John. The verb from which it is taken has many significations. Its proper meaning is to call one to us <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:20">Acts 27:20</span>; then to call one to aid us, as an advocate in a court; then to exhort or entreat, to pray or implore, as an advocate does, and to comfort or console, by suggesting reasons or arguments for consolation. The word “comforter” is frequently used by Greek writers to denote an advocate in a court; one who intercedes; a monitor, a teacher, an assistant, a helper. It is somewhat difficult, therefore, to fix the precise meaning of the word. It may be translated either advocate, monitor, teacher, or helper. What the office of the Holy Spirit in this respect is, is to be learned from what we are elsewhere told he does. We learn particularly from the accounts that our Saviour gives of his work that that office was:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.To comfort the disciples; to be with them in his absence and to supply his place; and this is properly expressed by the word Comforter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.To teach them, or remind them of truth; and this might be expressed by the word monitor or teacher, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26-27">John 15:26-27</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.To aid them in their work; to advocate their cause, or to assist them in advocating the cause of religion in the world, and in bringing sinners to repentance; and this may be expressed by the word advocate, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7-13">John 16:7-13</span>. It was also by the Spirit that they were enabled to stand before kings and magistrates, and boldly to speak in the name of Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:20">Matthew 10:20</span>. These seem to comprise all the meanings of the word in the New Testament, but no single word in our language expresses fully the sense of the original.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That he may abide with you for ever - </b>Not that he should remain with you for a few years, as I have done, and then leave you, but be with you in all places to the close of your life. He shall be your constant guide and attendant.</p>
