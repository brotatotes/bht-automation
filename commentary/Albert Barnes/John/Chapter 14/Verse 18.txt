<p style=" "><b>Comfortless - </b>Greek, “orphans.” Jesus here addresses them as children, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:33">John 13:33</span>. He says that he would show them the kindness of a parent, and, though he was going away, he would provide for their future welfare. And even while he was absent, yet they would sustain to him still the relation of children. Though he was to die, yet he would live again; though absent in body, yet he would be present with them by his Spirit; though he was to go away to heaven, yet he would return again to them.
