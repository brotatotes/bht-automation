<p style=" "><b>Judas saith unto him - </b>This was the same as Lebbeus or Thaddeus. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>. He was the brother of James, and the author of the Epistle of Jude.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How is it ... - </b>Probably Judas thought that he spake only of his resurrection, and he did not readily see how it could be that he could show himself to them, and not be seen also by others.</p>
