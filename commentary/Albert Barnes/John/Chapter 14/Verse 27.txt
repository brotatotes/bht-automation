<p style=" "><b>Peace I leave with you - </b>This was a common form of benediction among the Jews. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:13">Matthew 10:13</span>. It is the invocation of the blessings of peace and happiness. In this place it was, however, much more than a mere form or an empty wish. It came from Him who had power to make peace and to confer it on all, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>. It refers here particularly to the consolations which he gave to his disciples in view of his approaching death. He had exhorted them not to be troubled <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>, and he had stated reasons why they should not be. He explained to them why he was about to leave them; he promised them that he would return; he assured them that the Holy Spirit would come to comfort, teach, and guide them. By all these truths and promises he provided for their peace in the time of his approaching departure. But the expression refers also, doubtless. to the peace which is given to all who love the Saviour. They are by nature enmity against God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span>. Their minds are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, whose waters east up mire and dirt, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:20">Isaiah 57:20</span>. They were at war with conscience, with the law and perfections of God, and with all the truths of religion. Their state after conversion is described as a state of peace. They are reconciled to God; they acquiesce in all his claims; and they have a joy which the world knows not in the word, the promises, the law, and the perfections of God, in the plan of salvation, and in the hopes of eternal life. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7">Romans 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:15">Ephesians 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15">Colossians 3:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My peace - </b>Such as I only can impart. The special peace which my religion is fitted to impart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not as the world - </b> </p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither let it be afraid - </b>Of any pain, persecutions, or trials. You have a Friend who will never leave you; a peace that shall always attend you. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>.</p>
