<p style=" "><b>Will not talk much - </b>The time of my death draws near. It occurred the next day.</p>

<p style=" "><b>Cometh - </b>Satan is represented as approaching him to try him in his sufferings, and it is commonly supposed that no small part of the pain endured in the garden of Gethsemane was from some dreadful conflict with the great enemy of man. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span>; “This is your hour and the power of darkness.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:13">Luke 4:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath nothing in me - </b>There is in me no principle or feeling that accords with his, and nothing, therefore, by which he can prevail. Temptation has only power because there are some principles in us which accord with the designs of the tempter, and which may be excited by presenting corresponding objects until our virtue be overcome. Where there is no such propensity, temptation has no power. As the principles of Jesus were wholly on the side of virtue, the meaning here may be that, though he had the natural appetites of man, his virtue was so supreme that Satan “had nothing in him” which could constitute any danger that he would be led into sin, and that there was no fear of the result of the conflict before him.</p>
