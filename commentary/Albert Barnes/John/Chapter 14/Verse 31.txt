<p style=" "><b>That the world may know that I love the Father - </b>That it might not be alleged that his virtue had not been subjected to trial. It was subjected. He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>. He passed through the severest forms of temptation, that it might be seen and known that his holiness was proof to all trial, and that human nature might be so pure as to resist all forms of temptation. This will be the case with all the saints in heaven, and it was the case with Jesus on earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even so I do - </b>In all things he obeyed; and he showed that, in the face of calamities, persecutions, and temptations, he was still disposed to obey his Father. This he did that the world might know that he loved the Father. So should we bear trials and resist temptation; and so, through. persecution and calamity, should we show that we are actuated by the love of God. “Arise, let us go hence.” It has been commonly supposed that Jesus and the apostles now rose from the paschal supper and went to the Mount of Olives, and that the remainder of the discourse in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:0">John 15:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:0">John 16:0</span>, together with the prayer in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:0">John 17:0</span>, was delivered while on the way to the garden of Gethsemane; but some have supposed that they merely rose from the table, and that the discourse was finished before they left the room. The former is the more correct opinion. It was now probably toward midnight, and the moon was at the full, and the scene was one, therefore, of great interest and tenderness. Jesus, with a little band, was himself about to die, and he went forth in the stillness of the night, counselling his little company in regard to their duties and dangers, and invoking the protection and blessing of God his Father to attend, to sanctify, and guide them in the arduous labors, the toils, and the persecutions they were yet to endure, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:0">John 17:0</span>.</p>
