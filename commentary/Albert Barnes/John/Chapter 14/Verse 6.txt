<p style=" "><b>I am the way - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:8">Isaiah 35:8</span>. By this is meant, doubtless, that they and all others were to have access to God only by obeying the instructions, imitating the example, and depending on the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was the leader in the road, the guide to the wandering, the teacher of the ignorant, and the example to all. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:68">John 6:68</span>; “Thou hast the words of eternal life;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:21">1 Peter 2:21</span>; “Christ - suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:8-9">Hebrews 9:8-9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The truth - </b>The source of truth, or he who originates and communicates truth for the salvation of men. Truth is a representation of things as they are. The life, the purity, and the teaching of Jesus Christ was the most complete and perfect representation of the things of the eternal world that has been or can be presented to man. The ceremonies of the Jews were shadows; the life of Jesus was the truth. The opinions of men are fancy, but the doctrines of Jesus were nothing more than a representation of facts as they exist in the government of God. It is implied in this, also, that Jesus was the fountain of all truth; that by his inspiration the prophets spoke, and that by him all truth is communicated to men. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The life - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>, and the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>No man cometh to the Father but by me - </b>To come to the Father is to obtain his favor, to have access to his throne by prayer, and finally to enter his kingdom. No man can obtain any of these things except by the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ. By coming by him is meant coming in his name and depending on his merits. We are ignorant, and he alone can guide us. We are sinful, and it is only by his merits that we can be pardoned. We are blind, and he only can enlighten us. God has appointed him as the Mediator, and has ordained that all blessings shall descend to this world through him. Hence he has put the world under his control; has given the affairs of men into his hand, and has appointed him to dispense whatever may be necessary for our peace, pardon, and salvation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:12">Acts 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>.</p>
