<p style=" "><b>If ye had known me - </b>By this Jesus does not intend to say that they were not truly his disciples, but that they had not a full and accurate knowledge of his character and designs. They still retained, to a large extent, the Jewish notions respecting a temporal Messiah, and did not fully understand that he was to die and be raised from the dead.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye should have known my Father also - </b>You would have known the counsels and designs of my Father respecting my death and resurrection. If you had been divested of your Jewish prejudices about the Messiah, if you had understood that it was proper for me to die, you would also have understood the purposes and plans of God in my death; and, knowing that, you would have seen that it was wise and best. We see here that a correct knowledge of the character and work of Christ is the same as a correct knowledge of the counsels and plans of God; and we see, also, that the reasons why we have not such a knowledge are our previous prejudices and erroneous views.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From henceforth - </b>From this time. From my death and resurrection you shall understand the plans and counsels of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye know him - </b>You shall have just views of his plans and designs.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have seen him - </b>That is, they had seen Jesus Christ, his image, and the brightness of his glory <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>, which was the same as having seen the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>.</p>
