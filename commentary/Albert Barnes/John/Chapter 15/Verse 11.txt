<p style=" "><b>These things - </b>The discourse in this and the previous chapter. This discourse was designed to comfort them by the promise of the Holy Spirit and of eternal life, and to direct them in the discharge of their duty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My joy - </b>This expression probably denotes the happiness which Jesus had, and would continue to have, by their obedience, love, and fidelity. Their obedience was to him a source of joy. It was that which he sought and for which he had labored. He now clearly taught them the path of duty, and encouraged them to persevere, notwithstanding he was about to leave them. If they obeyed him, it would continue to him to be a source of joy. Christ rejoices in the obedience of all his friends; and, though his happiness is not dependent on them, yet their fidelity is an object which he desires and in which he finds delight. The same sentiment is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:13">John 17:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Your joy might be full - </b>That you might be delivered from your despondency and grief at my departure; that you might see the reason why I leave you, be comforted by the Holy Spirit, and be sustained in the arduous trials of your ministry. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:4">1 John 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:12">2 John 1:12</span>. This promise of the Saviour was abundantly fulfilled. The apostles with great frequency speak of the fulness of their joy - joy produced in just the manner promised by the Saviour - by the presence of the Holy Spirit. And it showed his great love, that he promised such joy; his infinite knowledge, that, in the midst of their many trials and persecutions, he knew that they would possess it; and the glorious power and loveliness of his gospel, that it could impart such joy amid so many tribulations. See instances of this joy in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:52">Acts 13:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:3">2 Corinthians 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Th 2:19-20</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:9">1 Thessalonians 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:11">Romans 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span>.</p>
