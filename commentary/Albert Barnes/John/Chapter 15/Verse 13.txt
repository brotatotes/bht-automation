<p style=" "><b>Greater love hath ... - </b>No higher expression of love could be given. Life is the most valuable object we possess; and when a man is willing to lay that down for his friends or his country, it shows the utmost extent of love. Even this love for friends has been rarely witnessed. A very few cases like that of Damon and Pythias have occurred where a man was willing to save the life of his friend by giving his own. It greatly enhances the love of Christ, that while the instances of those who have been willing to die for friends have been so rare, he was willing to die for enemies - bitter foes, who rejected his reign, persecuted him, reviled him, scorned him, and sought his life, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>. It also shows us the extent of his love that he gave himself up, not to common sufferings, but to the most bitter, painful, and protracted sorrows, not for himself, not for friends, but for a thoughtless and unbelieving world. “O Lamb of God, was ever pain was ever love like thine!”</p>
