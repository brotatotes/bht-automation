<p style=" "><b>If the world hate you - </b>The friendship of the world they were not to expect, but they were not to be deterred from their work by its hatred. They had seen the example of Jesus. No opposition of the proud, the wealthy, the learned, or the men of power, no persecution or gibes, had deterred him from his work. Remembering this, and having his example steadily in the eye, they were to labor not less because wicked men should oppose and deride them. It is enough for the disciple to be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:25">Matthew 10:25</span>.</p>
