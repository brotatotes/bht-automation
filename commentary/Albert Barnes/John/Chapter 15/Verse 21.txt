<p style=" "><b>My nameâ€™s sake - </b>On my account. Because you are my followers and possess my spirit. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:13">John 14:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because they know not him that sent me - </b>They will not believe that God has sent me. They do not so understand his character, his justice, or his law, as to see that it was fit that he should send his Son to die. They are so opposed to it, so filled with pride and opposition to a plan of salvation that is so humbling to people, as to be resolved not to believe it, and thus they persecute me, and will also you.</p>
