I am the vine - John 15:1.Without me ye can do nothing - The expression “without me” denotes the same as separate from me. As the branches, if separated from the parent stock, could produce no fruit, but would immediately wither and die, so Christians, if separate from Christ, could do nothing. The expression is one, therefore, strongly implying dependence. The Son of God was the original source of life, John 1:4. He also, by his work as Mediator, gives life to the world John 6:33, and it is by the same grace and agency that it is continued in the Christian. We see hence: 1.That to him is due all the praise for all the good works the Christian performs. 2.That they will perform good works just in proportion as they feel their dependence on him and look to him. And, 3.That the reason why others fail of being holy is because they are unwilling to look to him, and seek grace and strength from him who alone is able to give it.
