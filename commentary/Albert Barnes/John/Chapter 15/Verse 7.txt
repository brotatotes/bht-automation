<p style=" "><b>My words - </b>My doctrine; my commandments.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Abide in you - </b>Not only are remembered, but are suffered to remain in you as a living principle, to regulate your affections and life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye shall ask ... - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:13">John 14:13</span>. This promise had particular reference to the apostles. It is applicable to other Christians only so far as they are in circumstances similar to the apostles, and only so far as they possess their spirit. We learn from it that it is only when we keep the commandments of Christ - only when we live by faith in him, and his words are suffered to control our conduct and affections, that our prayers will be heard. Were we perfect in all things, he would always hear us, and we should be kept from making an improper petition; but just so far as men regard iniquity in their heart, the Lord will not hear them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+66:18">Psalms 66:18</span>.</p>
