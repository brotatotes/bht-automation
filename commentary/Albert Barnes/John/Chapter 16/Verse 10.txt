<p style=" "><b>Of righteousness - </b>This seems clearly to refer to the righteousness or innocence of Jesus himself. He was now persecuted. He was soon to be arraigned on heavy charges, and condemned by the highest authority of the nation as guilty. Yet, though condemned, he says that the Holy Spirit would descend and convince the world that he was innocent.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because I go to my Father - </b>That is, the amazing miracle of his resurrection and ascension to God would be a demonstration of his innocence that would satisfy the Jews and Gentiles. God would not raise up an impostor. If he had been truly guilty, as the Jews who condemned him pretended, God would not have set his seal to the imposture by raising him from the dead; but when he did raise him up and exalt him to his own right hand, he gave his attestation to his innocence; he showed that he approved his work, and gave evidence conclusive that Jesus was sent from God. To this proof of the innocence of Jesus the apostles often refer, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22-24">Acts 2:22-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:14">1 Corinthians 15:14</span>, etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>. This same proof of the innocence or righteousness of the Savior is as satisfactory now as it was then. One of the deepest feelings which an awakened sinner has, is his conviction of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He sees that he is holy; that his own opposition to him has been unprovoked, unjust, and base; and it is this which so often overwhelms his soul with the conviction of his own unworthiness, and with earnest desires to obtain a better righteousness than his own.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And ye see me no more - </b>That is, he was to be taken away from them, and they would not see him until his return to judgment; yet this source of grief to them would be the means of establishing his religion and greatly blessing others.</p>
