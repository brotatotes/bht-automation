<p style=" "><b>Shall glorify me - </b>Shall honor me. The nature of his influence shall be such as to exalt my character and work in view of the mind.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall receive of mine - </b>Literally, “shall take of or from me.” He shall receive his commission and instructions as an ambassador from me, to do my will and complete my work.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall show it - </b>Shall announce or communicate it to you. This is always the work of the Spirit. All serious impressions produced by him lead to the Lord Jesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>, and by this we may easily test our feelings. If we have been truly convicted of sin and renewed by the Holy Spirit, the tendency of all his influences has been to lead us to the Saviour; to show us our need of him; to reveal to us the loveliness of his character, and the fitness of his work to our needs; and to incline us to cast our eternal interests on his almighty arm, and commit all to his hands.</p>
