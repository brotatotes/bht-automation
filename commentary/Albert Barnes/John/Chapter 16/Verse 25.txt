<p style=" "><b>In proverbs - </b>In a manner that appears obscure, enigmatical, and difficult to be understood. It is worthy of remark, that though his declarations in these chapters about his death and resurrection appear to us to be plain, yet to the apostles, filled with Jewish prejudices, and unwilling to believe that he was about to die, they would appear exceedingly obscure and perplexed. The plainest declarations to them on the subject would appear to be involved in mystery.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The time cometh - </b>This refers, doubtless, to the time after his ascension to heaven, when he would send the Holy Spirit to teach them the great truths of religion. It does not appear that he himself, after his resurrection, gave them any more clear or full instruction than he had done before.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I shall show you plainly - </b>As Jesus said that he would send the Holy Spirit <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>, and as he came to carry forward the work of Christ, so it may be said that the teachings of the Holy Spirit were the teachings of Christ himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the Father - </b>Concerning the will and plan of the Father; particularly his plan in the establishment and spread of the Christian religion, and in organizing the church. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:0">Acts 10:0</span>.</p>
