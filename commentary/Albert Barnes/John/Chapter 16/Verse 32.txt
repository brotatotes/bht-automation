<p style=" "><b>The hour cometh - </b>To wit, on the next day, when he was crucified.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye shall be scattered - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Every man to his own - </b>That is, as in the margin, to his own home. You shall see me die, and suppose that my work is defeated, and return to your own dwellings. It is probable that the two disciples going to Emmaus were on their way to their dwellings, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:0">Luke 24:0</span>. After his death all the disciples retired into Galilee, and were engaged in their common employment of fishing, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:1-14">John 21:1-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:7">Matthew 28:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Leave me alone - </b>Leave me to die without human sympathy or compassion. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:56">Matthew 26:56</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because the Father is with me - </b>His Father was his friend. He had all along trusted in God. In the prospect of his sufferings he could still look to him for support. And though in his dying moments he suffered so much as to use the language, “Why hast thou forsaken me?” yet it was language addressed to him still as his God - “My God, my God.” Even then he had confidence in God - confidence so strong and unwavering that he could say, “Into thy hands I commend my spirit,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>. In all these sufferings he had the assurance that God was his friend, that he was doing his will, that he was promoting his glory, and that he looked on him with approbation. It matters little who else forsakes us if God be with us in the hour of pain and of death; and though poor, forsaken, or despised, yet, if we have the consciousness of his presence and his favor, then we may fear no evil. His rod and his staff, they will comfort us. Without his favor then, death will be full of horrors, though we be surrounded by weeping relatives, and by all the honor, and splendor, and wealth which the world can bestow. The Christian can die saying, I am not alone, because the Father is with me. The sinner dies without a friend that can alleviate his sufferings - without one source of real joy.</p>
