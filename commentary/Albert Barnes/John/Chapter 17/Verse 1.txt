<p style=" "><b>These words - </b>The words addressed to them in the preceding chapters. They were proceeding to the garden of Gethsemane. It adds much to the interest of this prayer that it was offered in the stillness of the night, in the open air, and in the especially tender circumstances in which Jesus and his apostles were. It is the longest prayer recorded in the New Testament. It was offered on the most tender and solemn occasion that has ever occurred in our world, and it is perhaps the most sublime composition to be found anywhere. Jesus was about to die. Having expressed his love to his disciples, and made known to them his last desires, he now commends them to the protection and blessing of the God of grace. This prayer is moreover a specimen of the manner of his intercession, and evinces the interest which he felt in behalf of all who should become his followers in all ages of the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lifted up his eyes - </b>This was the common attitude of prayer. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The hour is come - </b>That is, the appointed time for his sufferings and death. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:27">John 12:27</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Glorify thy Son - </b>Honor thy Son. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span>. Give to the world demonstration that I am thy Son. So sustain me, and so manifest thy power in my death, resurrection, and ascension, as to afford indubitable evidence that I am the Son of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That thy Son also may glorify thee - </b>This refers clearly to the manifestation of the honor of God which would be made by the spread of the gospel among men, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>. Jesus prayed that God would so honor him in his death that striking proof might be furnished that he was the Messiah, and men thus be brought to honor God. By his death the law, the truth, and the mercy of God were honored. By the spread of his gospel and the conversion of sinners; by all that Christ will do, now that he is glorified, to spread his gospel, God will be honored. The conversion of a single sinner honors God; a revival of religion is an eminent means of promoting his honor; and the spread of the gospel among all nations shall yet do more than all other things to promote the honor of God among men. Whatever honors the Saviour honors God. Just as he is exalted in view of the mind, so will God be honored and obeyed.</p>
