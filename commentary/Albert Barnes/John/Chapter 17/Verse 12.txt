<p style=" "><b>While I was with them in the world - </b>While I was engaged with them among other men - surrounded by the people and the temptations of the world. Jesus had now finished his work among the men of the world, and was performing his last offices with his disciples.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I kept them - </b>By my example, instructions, and miracles. I preserved them from apostasy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In thy name - </b>In the knowledge and worship of thee. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6-11">John 17:6-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Those that thou gavest me ... - </b>The word “gavest” is evidently used by the Saviour to denote not only to give to him to be his real followers, but also as apostles. It is used here, probably, in the sense of giving as apostles. God had so ordered it by his providence that they had been given to him to be his apostles and followers; but the terms “thou gavest me” do not of necessity prove that they were true believers. Of Judas Jesus knew that he was a deceiver and a devil, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>; “Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?” Judas is there represented as having been chosen by the Saviour to the apostleship, and this is equivalent to saying that he was given to him for this work; yet at the same time he knew his character, and understood that he had never been renewed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>None of them - </b>None of those chosen to the apostolic office.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But the son of perdition - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. The term son was given by the Hebrews to those who possessed the character described by the word or name following. Thus, sons of Belial - those who possessed his character; children of wisdom those who were wise, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>. Thus Judas is called a son of perdition because he had the character of a destroyer. He was a traitor and a murderer. And this shows that he who knew the heart regarded his character as that of a wicked man one whose appropriate name was that of a son of perdition.</p>
