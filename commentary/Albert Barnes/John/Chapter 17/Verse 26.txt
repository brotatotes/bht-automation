<p style=" ">The discourse in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:0">John 14:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:0">John 15:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:0">John 16:0</span> is the most tender and sublime that was ever pronounced in our world. No composition can be found anywhere so fitted to sustain the soul in trial or to support it in death. This sublime and beautiful discourse is appropriately closed by a solemn and most affecting prayer - a prayer at once expressive of the profoundest reverence for God and the tenderest love for men - simple, grave, tender, sublime, and full of consolation. It is the model for our prayers, and with like reverence, faith, and love we should come before God. This prayer for the church will yet be fully answered; and he who loves the church and the world cannot but cast his eyes onward to that time when all believers shall be one; when contentions, bigotry, strife, and anger shall cease; and when, in perpetual union and love, Christians shall show forth the power and purity of that holy gospel with which the Saviour came to bless mankind. Soon may that happy day arise!</p>
