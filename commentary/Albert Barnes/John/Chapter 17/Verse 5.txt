<p style=" "><b>With thine own self - </b>In heaven, granting me a participation of the same honor which the Father has. He had just said that he had glorified God on the earth, he now prays that God would glorify him in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With the glory - </b>With the honor. This word also includes the notion of happiness, or everything which could render the condition blessed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before the world was - </b>There could not be a more distinct and clear declaration of the pre-existence of Christ than this. It means before the creation of the world; before there was any world. Of course, the speaker here must have existed then, and this is equivalent to saying that he existed from eternity. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-2">John 1:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>. The glory which he had then was that which was proper to the Son of God, represented by the expression “being in the bosom of the Father” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>, denoting intimacy, friendship, united felicity. The Son of God, by becoming incarnate, is represented as “humbling himself” (Greek: he “emptied himself”), <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8">Philippians 2:8</span>. He laid aside for a time the external aspect of honor, and consented to become despised, and to assume the form of a servant. He now prays that God would raise him up to the dignity and honor which he had before his incarnation. This is the state to which he is now exalted, with the additional honor of having made atonement for sin, and having opened the way to save a race of rebels from eternal death. The lowest condition on earth is frequently connected with the highest honors of heaven. Man looks on the outward appearance. God looks to him that is humble and of a contrite spirit.</p>
