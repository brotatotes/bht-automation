<p style=" "><b>Have manifested thy name - </b>The word “name” here includes the attributes or character of God. Jesus had made known his character, his law, his will, his plan of mercy - or, in other words, he had revealed God to them. The word “name” is often used to designate the person, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:21">John 15:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22">Matthew 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:24">Romans 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which thou gavest me - </b>God gave them to him in his purpose. He gave them by his providence. He so ordered affairs that they heard him preach and saw his miracles; and he gave them by disposing them to follow him when he called them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thine they were - </b>All men are God’s by creation and by preservation, and he has a right to do with them as seemeth good in his sight. These men he chose to designate to be the apostles of the Saviour; and he committed them to him to be taught, and then commissioned them to carry his gospel, though amid persecutions, to the ends of the world. God has a right to the services of all; and he has a right to appoint us to any labor, however humble, or hazardous, or wearisome, where we may promote his glory and honor his name.</p>
