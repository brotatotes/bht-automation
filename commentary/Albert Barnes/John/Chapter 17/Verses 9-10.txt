<p style=" "><b>I pray for them - </b>In view of their dangers and trials, he sought the protection and blessing of God on them. His prayer was always answered.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not for the world - </b>The term world here, as elsewhere, refers to wicked, rebellious, vicious men. The meaning of this expression here seems to be this: Jesus is praying for his disciples. As a reason why God should bless them, he says that they were not of the world; that they had been taken out of the world; that they belonged unto God. The petition was not offered for wicked, perverse, rebellious men, but for those who were the friends of God and were disposed to receive his favors. This passage, then, settles nothing about the question whether Christ prayed for sinners. He then prayed for his disciples, who were not those who hated him and disregarded his favors. He afterward extended the prayer for all who should become Christians, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span>. When on the cross he prayed for his crucifiers and murderers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For they are thine - </b>This is urged as a reason why God should protect and guide them. His honor was concerned in keeping them; and we may always “fill our mouths with” such “arguments” when we come before God, and plead that his honor will be advanced by keeping us from evil, and granting us all needful grace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am glorified in them - </b>I am honored by their preaching and lives. The sense of this passage is, “Those who are my disciples are thine. That which promotes my honor will also promote thine. I pray, therefore, that they may have needful grace to honor my gospel, and to proclaim it among men.”</p>
