<p style=" "><b>The brook Cedron - </b>This was a small stream that flowed to the east of Jerusalem, through the valley of Jehoshaphat, and divided the city from the Mount of Olives. It was also called Kidron and Kedron. In summer it is almost dry. The word used here by the evangelist - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειμάῤῥου</span></span> cheimarrou - denotes properly a water-stream (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χεῖρμα</span></span> cheimōn, shower or water, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ῥέω</span></span> reō, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ῥόος</span></span> roos, to flow, flowing), and the idea is that of a stream that was swollen by rain or by the melting of the snow (Passow, Lexicon). This small rivulet runs along on the east of Jerusalem until it is joined by the water of the pool of Siloam, and the water that flows down on the west side of the city through the valley of Jehoshaphat, and then goes off in a southeast direction to the Dead Sea. (See the map of the environs of Jerusalem.) Over this brook David passed when he fled from Absalom, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+15:23">2 Samuel 15:23</span>. It is often mentioned in the Old Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+15:13">1 Kings 15:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+15:16">2 Chronicles 15:16</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Ch 30:14</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:6">2 Kings 23:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:12">2 Kings 23:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Where was a garden - </b>On the west side of the Mount of Olives. This was called Gethsemane. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:36">Matthew 26:36</span>. It is probable that this was the property of some wealthy man in Jerusalem - perhaps some friend of the Saviour. It was customary for the rich in great cities to have country-seats in the vicinity. This, it seems, was so accessible that Jesus was accustomed to visit it, and yet so retired as to be a suitable place for devotion.</p>
