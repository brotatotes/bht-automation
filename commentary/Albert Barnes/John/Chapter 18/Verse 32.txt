<p style=" "><b>That the saying of Jesus ... - </b>To wit, that he would be delivered into the hands of the Gentiles and be crucified, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:19">Matthew 20:19</span>. Neither of these things would have happened if he had been put to death in the way that the Jews first contemplated, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:4">Matthew 26:4</span>. Though it should be admitted that they had the power, in religious cases, to do this, yet in such a case it would not have been done, as Jesus predicted, by the Gentiles; and even if it should be admitted that they had the right to take life, yet they had not the right to do it by crucifixion. This was particularly a Roman punishment. And thus it was ordered, in the providence of God, that the prediction of Jesus in both these respects was fulfilled.</p>
