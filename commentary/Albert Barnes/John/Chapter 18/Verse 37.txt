<p style=" "><b>Art thou a king then? - </b>Dost thou admit the charge in any sense, or dost thou lay claim to a kingdom of any kind?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou sayest ... - </b>This is a form of expression denoting affirmation. It is equivalent to yes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That I am a king - </b>This does not mean simply that Pilate affirmed that he was a king; it does not appear that he had done this; but it means, “Thou affirmest the truth; thou declarest what is correct, for I am a king.” I am a king in a certain sense, and do not deny it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To this end ... - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11-12">John 3:11-12</span>, etc. Jesus does not here affirm that he was born to reign, or that this was the design of his coming; but it was to bear witness to and to exhibit the truth. By this he showed what was the nature of his kingdom. It was not to assert power; not to collect armies; not to subdue nations in battle. It was simply to present truth to men, and to exercise dominion only by the truth. Hence, the only power put forth in restraining the wicked, in convincing the sinner, in converting the heart, in guiding and leading his people, and in sanctifying them, is that which is produced by applying truth to the mind. Men are not forced or compelled to be Christians. They are made to see that they are stoners, that God is merciful, that they need a Redeemer, and that the Lord Jesus is fitted to their case, and yield themselves then wholly to his reign. This is all the power ever used in the kingdom of Christ, and no men in his church have a right to use any other. Alas! how little have persecutors remembered this! And how often, under the pretence of great regard for the kingdom of Jesus, have bigots attempted by force and flames to make all men think as they do! We see here the importance which Jesus attached to truth. It was his sole business in coming into the world. He had no other end than to establish it. We therefore should value it, and seek for it as for hid treasures, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+23:23">Proverbs 23:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Every one ... - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span>.</p>
