<p style=" "><b>That the scripture should be fulfilled - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:46">Exodus 12:46</span>. John here regards the paschal lamb as an emblem of Christ; and as in the law it was commanded that a bone of that lamb should not be broken, so, in the providence of God, it was ordered that a bone of the Saviour should not be broken. The Scripture thus received a complete fulfillment respecting both the type and the antitype. Some have supposed, however, that John referred to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+34:20">Psalms 34:20</span>.</p>
