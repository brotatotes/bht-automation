<p style=" "><b>Behold, I bring him forth ... - </b>Pilate, after examining Jesus, had gone forth and declared to the Jews that he found no fault in him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>. At that time Jesus remained in the judgment hall. The Jews were not satisfied with that, but demanded still that he should be put to death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39-40">John 19:39-40</span>. Pilate, disposed to gratify the Jews, returned to Jesus and ordered him to be scourged, as if preparatory to death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:1">John 19:1</span>. The patience and meekness with which Jesus bore this seem to have convinced him still more that he was innocent, and he again went forth to declare his conviction of this; and, to do it more effectually, he said, “Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know,” etc. - that they might themselves see, and be satisfied, as he had been, of his innocence. All this shows his anxiety to release him, and also shows that the meekness, purity, and sincerity of Jesus had power to convince a Roman governor that he was not guilty. Thus, the highest evidence was given that the charges were false, even when he was condemned to die.</p>
