<p style=" "><b>We have a law - </b>The law respecting blasphemy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+24:16">Leviticus 24:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+13:1-5">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</span>. They had arraigned Jesus on that charge before the Sanhedrin, and condemned him for it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63-65">Matthew 26:63-65</span>. But this was not the charge on which they had arraigned him before Pilate. They had accused him of sedition, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span>. On this charge they were now convinced that they could not get Pilate to condemn him. He declared him innocent. Still bent on his ruin, and resolved to gain their purpose, they now, contrary to their first intention, adduced the original accusation on which they had already pronounced him guilty. If they could not obtain his condemnation as a rebel, they now sought it as a blasphemer, and they appealed to Pilate to sanction what they believed was required in their law. Thus, to Pilate himself it became more manifest that he was innocent, that they had attempted to deceive him, and that the charge on which they had arraigned him was a mere pretence to obtain his sanction to their wicked design.</p>
