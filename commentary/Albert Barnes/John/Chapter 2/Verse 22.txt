<p style=" "><b>When he was risen from the dead ... - </b>This saying of our Saviour at that time seemed obscure and difficult. The disciples did not understand it, but they treasured it up in their memory, and the event showed what was its true meaning. Many prophecies are obscure when spoken which are perfectly plain when the event takes place. We learn from this, also, the importance of treasuring up the truths of the Bible now, though we may not perfectly understand them. Hereafter they may be plain to us. It is therefore important that “children,” should learn the truths of the sacred Scriptures. Treasured up in their memory, they may not be understood “now,” but hereafter they may be clear to them. Every one engaged in teaching a Sunday school, therefore, may be imparting instruction which may be understood, and may impart comfort, long after the teacher has gone to eternity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They believed - </b>That is, “after” he rose from the dead.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The scripture - </b>The Old Testament, which predicted his resurrection. Reference here must be made to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:10">Psalms 16:10</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:27-32">Acts 2:27-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:35-37">Acts 13:35-37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>.

<p style=" "><b>The word which Jesus had said - </b>The prediction which he had made respecting his resurrection in this place and on other occasions.
