<p style=" "><b>Did not commit himself - </b>The word translated “commit” here is the same which in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span> is translated “believed.” It means to put “trust” or “confidence in.” Jesus did not put “trust” or “reliance” in them. He did not leave himself in their hands. He acted cautiously and prudently. The proper time for him to die had not come, and he secured his own safety. The reason why he did not commit himself to them is “that he knew all men.” He knew the “inconstancy” and “fickleness” of the multitude. He knew how easily they might be turned against him by the Jewish leaders, and how unsafe he would be if they should be moved to sedition and tumult.</p>
