<p style=" "><b>The sea of Tiberias - </b>Called also the Sea of Galilee, being situated in Galilee. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>. In this place Jesus had promised to meet them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:28">Mark 14:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:7">Mark 16:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:32">Matthew 26:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:10">Matthew 28:10</span>. This interview of Jesus is but just mentioned by Matthew <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16">Matthew 28:16</span>, and is omitted by both Mark and Luke. This is the reason why John relates so particularly what occurred there. Galilee was a retired place where they would be free from danger, and was therefore a safe and convenient situation for Jesus to meet them, in order to give them his last instructions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>On this wise - </b>Thus. In this manner.</p>
