The sea of Tiberias - Called also the Sea of Galilee, being situated in Galilee. See the notes at Matthew 4:18. In this place Jesus had promised to meet them, Mark 14:28; Mark 16:7; Matthew 26:32; Matthew 28:10. This interview of Jesus is but just mentioned by Matthew Matthew 28:16, and is omitted by both Mark and Luke. This is the reason why John relates so particularly what occurred there. Galilee was a retired place where they would be free from danger, and was therefore a safe and convenient situation for Jesus to meet them, in order to give them his last instructions.On this wise - Thus. In this manner.
