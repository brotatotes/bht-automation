<p style=" "><b>Many other things - </b>Many miracles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30">John 20:30</span>. Many discourses delivered, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I suppose ... - </b>This is evidently the figure of speech called a hyperbole. It is a mode of speech where the words express more or less than is literally true. It is common among all writers; and as the sacred writers, in recording a revelation to men, used human language, it was proper that they should express themselves as men ordinarily do if they wished to be understood. This figure of speech is commonly the effect of surprise, or having the mind full of some object, and not having words to express the ideas: at the same time, the words convey no falsehood. The statement is to be taken as it would be understood among the persons to whom it is addressed; and as no one supposes that the author means to be understood literally, so there is no deception in the case, and consequently no impeachment of his veracity or inspiration. Thus, when Longinus said of a man that “he was the owner of a piece of ground not larger than a Lacedaemonian letter,” no one understood him literally. He meant, evidently, a very small piece of land, and no one would be deceived. So Virgil says of a man, “he was so tall as to reach the stars,” and means only that he was very tall. So when John says that the world could not contain the books that would be written if all the deeds and sayings of Jesus were recorded, he clearly intends nothing more than that a great many books would be required, or that it would be extremely difficult to record them all; intimating that his life was active, that his discourses were numerous, and that he had not pretended to give them all, but only such as would go to establish the main point for which he wrote that he was the Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30-31">John 20:30-31</span>. The figure which John uses here is not uncommon in the Scriptures, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:4">Genesis 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:5">Genesis 15:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+13:33">Numbers 13:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+4:20">Daniel 4:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">This gospel contains in itself the clearest proof of inspiration. It is the work of a fisherman of Galilee, without any proof that he had any unusual advantages. It is a connected, clear, and satisfactory argument to establish the great truth that Jesus was the Messiah. It was written many years after the ascension of Jesus. It contains the record of the Saviour’s profoundest discourses, of his most convincing arguments with the Jews, and of his declarations respecting himself and God. It contains the purest and most elevated views of God to be found anywhere, as far exceeding all the speculations of philosophers as the sun does the blaze of a taper. It is in the highest degree absurd to suppose that an unlettered fisherman could have originated this book. Anyone may be convinced of this by comparing it with what would be the production of a man in that rank of life now. But if John has preserved the record of what has occurred so many years before, then it shows that he was under the divine guidance, and is himself a proof, a full and standing proof, of the fulfillment of the promise which he has recorded that the Holy Spirit would guide the apostles into all truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>. Of this book we may, in conclusion, apply the words spoken by John respecting his vision of the future events of the church: “Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this” book, “and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>.</p>
