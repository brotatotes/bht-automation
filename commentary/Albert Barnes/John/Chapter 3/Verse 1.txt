<p style=" "><b>A man of the Pharisees - </b>A Pharisee. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews - </b>One of the “Sanhedrin,” or great council of the nation. He is twice mentioned after this as being friendly to our Saviour; in the first instance as advocating his cause, and defending him against the unjust suspicion of the Jews <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:50">John 7:50</span>, and in the second instance as one who came to aid in embalming his body, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span>. It will be recollected that the design of John in writing this gospel was to show that Jesus was the Messiah. To do this he here adduces the testimony of one of the rulers of the Jews, who early became convinced of it, and who retained the belief of it until the death of Jesus.</p>
