<p style=" "><b>A master of Israel - </b>A “teacher” of Israel; the same word that in the second verse is translated “teacher.” As such a teacher he ought to have understood this doctrine. It was not new,” but was clearly taught in the Old Testament. See particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:10">Psalms 51:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:16-17">Psalms 51:16-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:19">Ezekiel 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:26">Ezekiel 36:26</span>. It may seem surprising that a man whose business it was to teach the people should be a stranger to so plain and important a doctrine; but when worldly-minded men are placed in offices of religion when they seek those offices for the sake of ease or reputation, it is no wonder that they are strangers to the plain truths of the Bible; and there have been many, and there are still, who are in the ministry itself, to whom the plainest doctrines of the gospel are obscure. No man can understand the Bible fully unless he is a humble Christian, and the easiest way to comprehend the truths of religion is to give the heart to God and live to his glory. A child thus may have more real knowledge of the way of salvation than many who are pretended masters and teachers of Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:2">Psalms 8:2</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:16">Matthew 21:16</span>.</p>
