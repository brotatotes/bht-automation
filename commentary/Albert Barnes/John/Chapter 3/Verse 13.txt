<p style=" "><b>And no man hath ascended into heavens - </b>No man, therefore, is qualified to speak of heavenly things, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:12">John 3:12</span>. To speak of those things requires intimate acquaintance with them - demands that we have seen them; and as no one has ascended into heaven and returned, so no one is qualified to speak of them but He who came down from heaven. This does not mean that no one had Gone to heaven or had been saved, for Enoch and Elijah had been borne there (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:24">Genesis 5:24</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:11">2 Kings 2:11</span>); and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and others were there: but it means that no one had ascended and “returned,” so as to be qualified to speak of the things there.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But he that came down ... - </b>The Lord Jesus. He is represented as coming down, because, being equal with God, he took upon himself our nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6-7">Philippians 2:6-7</span>. He is represented as “sent” by the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Gal 4:4</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9-10">1 John 4:9-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Son of man - </b>Called thus from his being “a man;” from his interest in man; and as expressive of his regard for man. It is a favorite title which the Lord Jesus gives to himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is in Heaven - </b>This is a very remarkable expression. Jesus, the Son of man, was then bodily on earth conversing with Nicodemus; yet he declares that he is “at the same time” in heaven. This can be understood only as referring to the fact that he had two natures that his “divine nature” was in heaven, and his “human nature” on earth. Our Saviour is frequently spoken of in this manner. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Joh 17:5</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>. Since Jesus was “in” heaven - as his proper abode was there - he was fitted to speak of heavenly things, and to declare the will of God to man And we may learn:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That the truth about the deep things of God is not to be learned from “men.” No one has ascended to heaven and returned to tell us what is there; and no infidel, no mere man, no prophet, is qualified of himself to speak of them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That all the light which we are to expect on those subjects is to be sought in the Scriptures. It is only Jesus and his inspired apostles and evangelists that can speak of those things.</p>
