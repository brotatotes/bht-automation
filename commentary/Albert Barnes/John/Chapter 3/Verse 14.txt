<p style=" "><b>And as Moses - </b>Jesus proceeds in this and the following verses to state the reason why he came into the world and, in order to this, he illustrates His design, and the efficacy of his coming, by a reference to the case of the brass serpent, recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:8-9">Numbers 21:8-9</span>. The people were bitten by flying fiery serpents. There was no cure for the bite. Moses was directed to make an image of the serpent, and place it in sight of the people, that they might look on it and be healed. There is no evidence that this was intended to be a type of the Messiah, but it is used by Jesus as strikingly illustrating his work. Men are sinners. There is no cure by human means for the maladies of the soul; and as the people who were bitten might look on the image of the serpent and be healed, so may sinners look to the Saviour and be cured of the moral maladies of our nature.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lifted up - </b>Erected on a pole. Placed on high, So that it might be seen by the people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The serpent - </b>The image of a serpent made of brass.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the wilderness - </b>Near the land of Edom. In the desert and desolate country to the south of Mount Hor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:4">Numbers 21:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even so - </b>In a similar manner and with a similar design. He here refers, doubtless, to his own death. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:28">John 8:28</span>. The points of resemblance between his being lifted up and that of the brass serpent seem to be these:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Must - </b>It is proper; necessary; indispensable, if men are saved. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:26">Luke 24:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:42">Luke 22:42</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Son of man - </b>The Messiah.</p>
