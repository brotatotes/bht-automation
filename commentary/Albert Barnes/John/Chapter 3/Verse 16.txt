<p style=" "><b>For God so loved - </b>This does not mean that God approved the conduct of men, but that he had benevolent feelings toward them, or was “earnestly desirous” of their happiness. God hates wickedness, but he still desires the Happiness of those who are sinful. “He hates the sin, but loves the sinner.” A parent may love his child and desire his welfare, and yet be strongly opposed to the conduct of that child. When we approve the conduct of another, this is the love of complacency; when we desire simply their happiness, this is the love of benevolence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The world - </b>All mankind. It does not mean any particular part of the world, but man as man - the race that had rebelled and that deserved to die. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>. His love for the world, or for all mankind, in giving his Son, was shown by these circumstances:</p>
<p style=" "><b>That he gave - </b>It was a free and unmerited gift. Man had no claim: and when there was no eye to pity or arm to save, it pleased God to give his Son into the hands of men to die in their stead, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>. It was the mere movement of love; the expression of eternal compassion, and of a desire, that sinners should not perish forever.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His only-begotten Son - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. This is the highest expression of love of which we can conceive. A parent who should give up his only son to die for others who are guilty if this could or might be done - would show higher love than could be manifested in any other way. So it shows the depth of the love of God, that he was willing. to give his only Son into the hands of sinful men that he might be slain, and thus redeem them from eternal sorrow.</p>
