<p style=" "><b>To condemn the world - </b>Not to judge, or pronounce sentence on mankind. God might justly have sent him for this. Man deserved condemnation, and it would have been right to have pronounced it; but God was willing that there should be an offer of pardon, and the sentence of condemnation was delayed. But, although Jesus did not come then to condemn mankind, yet the time is coming when he will return to judge the living and the dead, <span class="_0000ff"><u>Act 17:31</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</span>.</p>
