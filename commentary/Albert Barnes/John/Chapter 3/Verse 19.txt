<p style=" "><b>This is the condemnation - </b>This is the cause of condemnation; or this is the reason why men are punished.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That light is come - </b>Light often denotes instruction, teaching, doctrine, as that by which we see clearly the path of duty. all the instruction that God gives us by conscience, reason, or revelation may thus be called light; but this word is used especially to denote the Messiah or the Christ, who is often spoken of as “the light.” See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:16">Matthew 4:16</span>; also the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>. It was doubtless this light to which Jesus had particular reference here.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Men loved darkness - </b>Darkness is the emblem of ignorance, iniquity, error, superstition - whatever is opposite to truth and piety. Men are said to love darkness more than they do light when they are better pleased with error than truth, with sin than holiness, with Belial than Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because their deeds are evil - </b>Men who commit crime commonly choose to do it in the night, so as to escape detection. So men who are wicked prefer false doctrine and error to the truth. Thus the Pharisees cloaked their crimes under the errors of their system; and, amid their false doctrines and superstitions, they attempted to convince others that they had great zeal for God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Deeds - </b>Works; actions.</p>
