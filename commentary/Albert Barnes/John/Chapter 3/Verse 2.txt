<p style=" "><b>The same came to Jesus - </b>The design of his coming seems to have been to inquire more fully of Jesus what was the doctrine which he came to teach. He seems to have been convinced that he was the Messiah, and desired to be further instructed in private respecting his doctrine, It was not usual for a man of rank, power, and riches to come to inquire of Jesus in this manner; yet we may learn that the most favorable opportunity for teaching such men the nature of personal religion is when they are alone. Scarcely any man, of any rank, will refuse to converse on this subject when addressed respectfully and tenderly in private. In the midst of their companions, or engaged in business, they may refuse to listen or may cavil. When alone, they will hear the voice of entreaty and persuasion, and be willing to converse on the great subjects of judgment and eternity. Thus Paul says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>, “privately to them which are of reputation,” evincing his consummate prudence, and his profound knowledge of human nature.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By night - </b>It is not mentioned why he came by night. It might have been that, being a member of the Sanhedrin, he was engaged all the day; or it may have been because the Lord Jesus was occupied all the day in teaching publicly and in working miracles, and that there was no opportunity for conversing with him as freely as he desired; or it may have been that he was afraid of the ridicule and contempt of those in power, and fearful that it might involve him in danger if publicly known; or it may have been that he was afraid that if it were publicly known that he was disposed to favor the Lord Jesus, it might provoke more opposition against him and endanger his life. Since no bad motive is imputed to him, it is most in accordance with Christian charity to suppose that his motives were such as God would approve, especially as the Saviour did not reprove him. We should not be disposed to blame men where Jesus did not, and we should desire to find goodness in every man rather than be ever on the search for evil motives. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:4-7">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</span>. We may learn here:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rabbi - </b>This was a title of respect conferred on distinguished Jewish teachers, somewhat in the way that the title “Doctor of Divinity” is now conferred. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>. Our Saviour forbade his disciples to wear that title (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:8">Matthew 23:8</span>), though it was proper for Him to do it, as being the great Teacher of mankind. It literally signifies great, and was given by Nicodemus, doubtless, because Jesus gave distinguished proofs that he came as a teacher from God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We know - </b>I know, and those with whom I am connected. Perhaps he was acquainted with some of the Pharisees who entertained the same opinion about Jesus that he did, and he came to be more fully confirmed in the belief.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Come from God - </b>Sent by God. This implies his readiness to hear him, and his desire to be instructed. He acknowledges the divine mission of Jesus, and delicately asks him to instruct him in the truth of religion. When we read the words of Jesus in the Bible, it should be with a belief that he came from God, and was therefore qualified and authorized to teach us the way of life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>These miracles - </b>The miracles which he performed in the Temple and at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Except God be with him - </b>Except God aid him, and except his instructions are approved by God. Miracles show that a prophet or religious teacher comes from God, because God would nor work a miracle in attestation of a falsehood or to give countenance to a false teacher. If God gives a man power to work a miracle, it is proof that he approves the teaching of that man, and the miracle is the proof or the credential that he came from God.</p>
