<p style=" "><b>That doeth evil - </b>Every wicked person.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hateth the light - </b>This is true of all wicked men. They choose to practice their deeds of wickedness in darkness. They are afraid of the light, because they could be easily detected. Hence, most crimes are committed in the night. So with the sinner against God. He hates the gospel, for it condemns his conduct, and his conscience would trouble him if it were enlightened.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His deeds should be reproved - </b>To “reprove” here means not only to “detect” or make manifest, but also includes the idea of “condemnation” when his deeds are detected. The gospel would make his wickedness manifest, and his conscience would condemn him. We learn from this verse:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That one design of the gospel is “to reprove” men. It convicts them of sin in order that it may afford consolation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That men by nature “hate” the gospel. No man who is a sinner loves it; and no man by nature is disposed to come to it, any more than an adulterer or thief is disposed to come to the daylight, and do his deeds of wickedness there.</p>
