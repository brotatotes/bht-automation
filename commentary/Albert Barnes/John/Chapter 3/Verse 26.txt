<p style=" "><b>Came unto John - </b>Came to him with their complaint; envious and jealous at the success of Jesus, and evidently irritated from the discussion, as if their master was about to lose his popularity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rabbi - </b>Master. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:7">Matthew 23:7</span>. Acknowledging him as their master and teacher.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That was with thee - </b>Who was baptized by thee.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou barest witness - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29-35">John 1:29-35</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All men come to him - </b>This was the source of their difficulty. It was that Jesus was gaining popularity; that the people flocked to him; that they feared that John would be forsaken, and his followers be diminished in numbers and influence. Thus many love their sect more than they do Christ, and would be more rejoiced that a man became a Presbyterian, a Methodist, a Baptist, than that he became a sincere and humble Christian. This is not the spirit of the gospel. True piety teaches us to rejoice that sinners turn to Christ and become holy, whether they follow us or not. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:38-39">Mark 9:38-39</span>. Let Jesus be exalted, and let men turn to Him, is the language of religion, whatever denomination they may feel it their duty to follow.</p>
