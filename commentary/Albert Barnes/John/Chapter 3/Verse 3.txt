<p style=" "><b>Verily, verily - </b>An expression of strong affirmation, denoting the certainty and the importance of what he was about to say. Jesus proceeds to state one of the fundamental and indispensable doctrines of his religion. It may seem remarkable that he should introduce this subject in this manner; but it should be remembered that Nicodemus acknowledged that he was a teacher come from God; that he implied by that his readiness and desire to receive instruction; and that it is not wonderful, therefore, that Jesus should commence with one of the fundamental truths of his religion. It is no part of Christianity to conceal anything. Jesus declared to every man, high or low, rich or poor, the most humbling truths of the gospel. Nothing was kept back for fear of offending men of wealth or power; and for them, as well as the most poor and lowly, it was declared to be indispensable to experience, as the first thing in religion, a change of heart and of life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Except a man - </b>This is a universal form of expression designed to include all mankind. Of “each and every man” it is certain that unless he is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. It includes, therefore, men of every character and rank, and nation, moral and immoral, rich and poor, in office and out of office, old and young, bond and free, the slave and his master, Jew and Gentile. It is clear that our Saviour intended to convey to Nicodemus the idea, also, that “he” must be born again. It was not sufficient to be a Jew, or to acknowledge him to be a teacher sent by God that is, the Messiah; it was necessary, in addition to this, to experience in his own soul that great change called the “new birth” or regeneration.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be born again - </b>The word translated here “again” means also “from above,” and is so rendered in the margin. It is evident, however, that Nicodemus understood, it not as referring to a birth “from above,” for if he had he would not have asked the question in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span>. It is probable that in the language which he used there was not the same ambiguity that there is in the Greek. The ancient versions all understood it as meaning “again,” or the “second time.” Our natural birth introduces us to light, is the commencement of life, throws us amid the works of God, and is the beginning of our existence; but it also introduces us to a world of sin. We early go astray. All men transgress. The imagination of the thoughts of the heart is evil from the youth up. We are conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity, and there is none that doeth good, no, not one. The carnal mind is enmity against God, and by nature we are dead in trespasses and sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:21">Genesis 8:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:2-3">Psalms 14:2-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:5">Psalms 51:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:29-32">Romans 1:29-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-20">Romans 3:10-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">All sin exposes men to misery here and hereafter. To escape from sin, to be happy in the world to come, it is necessary that man should be changed in his principles, his feelings, and his manner of life. This change, or the beginning of this new life, is called the “new birth,” or “regeneration.” It is so called because in many respects it has a striking analogy to the natural birth. It is the beginning of spiritual life. It introduces us to the light of the gospel. It is the moment when we really begin to live to any purpose. It is the moment when God reveals himself to us as our reconciled Father, and we are adopted into his family as his sons. And as every man is a sinner, it is necessary that each one should experience this change, or he cannot be happy or saved. This doctrine was not unknown to the Jews, and was particularly predicted as a doctrine that would be taught in the times of the Messiah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:16">Deuteronomy 10:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:4">Jeremiah 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:33">Jeremiah 31:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:19">Ezekiel 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:25">Ezekiel 36:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:12">Psalms 51:12</span>. The change in the New Testament is elsewhere called the “new creation” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:15">Galatians 6:15</span>, and “life from the dead,” or a resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He cannot see - </b>To “see,” here, is put evidently for enjoying - or he cannot be fitted for it and partake of it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The kingdom of God - </b>Either in this world or in that which is to come - that is, heaven. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. The meaning is, that the kingdom which Jesus was about to set up was so pure and holy that it was indispensable that every man should experience this change, or he could not partake of its blessings. This is solemnly declared by the Son of God by an affirmation equivalent to an oath, and there can be no possibility, therefore, of entering heaven without experiencing the change which the Saviour contemplated by the “new birth.” And it becomes every man, as in the presence of a holy God before whom he must soon appear, to ask himself whether he has experienced this change, and if he has not, to give no rest to his eyes until he has sought the mercy of God, and implored the aid of his Spirit that his heart may be renewed.</p>
