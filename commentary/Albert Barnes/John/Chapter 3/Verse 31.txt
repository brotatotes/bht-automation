<p style=" "><b>He that cometh from above - </b>The Messiah, represented as coming down from heaven. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:23">John 8:23</span>. It has been doubted whether the remainder of this chapter contains the words of “John the Baptist” or of “the evangelist.” The former is the more probable opinion, but it is difficult to decide it, and it is of very little consequence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is above all - </b>In nature, rank, and authority. “Is superior to all prophets” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-2">Hebrews 1:1-2</span>; “to all angels” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4-14">Hebrews 1:4-14</span>, “and is over all the universe as its sovereign Lord,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21-22">Ephesians 1:21-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15-19">Colossians 1:15-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:25">1 Corinthians 15:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He that is of the earth - </b>He who has no higher nature than the human nature. The prophets, apostles, and John were men like others, born in the same way, and sinking, like others, to the dust. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>. Jesus had a nature superior to man, and “ought,” therefore, to be exalted above all.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is earthly - </b>Is human. Is inferior to him who comes from heaven. Partakes of his origin, which is inferior and corrupt.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Speaketh of the earth - </b>His teaching is inferior to that of him who comes from heaven. It is comparatively obscure and imperfect, not full and clear, like the teaching of him who is from above. This was the case with all the prophets; and even with John the Baptist, as compared with the teaching of Christ.</p>
