He that hath received his testimony - Hath received and fully believed his doctrine. Hath yielded his heart to its influence.Hath set to his seal - To “seal” an instrument is to make it sure; to acknowledge it as ours; to pledge our varacity that it is true and binding, as when a man seals a bond, a deed, or a will. Believing a doctrine, therefore, in the heart, is expressed by “sealing it,” or by believing it we express our firm conviction that it is true, and that God who has spoken it is true. We vouch for the veracity of God, and assume as our own the proposition that it is the truth of God.God is true - Is faithful; is the author of the system of doctrines, and will fulfill all that he has promised. We learn here: 1.That to be a true believer is something more than to hold a mere speculative belief of the truth. 2.That to be a believer is to “pledge ourselves” for the truth, to seal it as our own, to adopt it, to choose it, and solemnly assent to it, as a man does in regard to an instrument of writing that is to convey his property, or that is to dispose of it when he dies.
