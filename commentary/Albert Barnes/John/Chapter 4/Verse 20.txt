<p style=" "><b>Our fathers - </b>The Samaritans; perhaps also meaning to intimate that the patriarchs had done it also. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:6">Genesis 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:20">Genesis 33:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Worshipped - </b>Had a place of worship.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In this mountain - </b>Mount Gerizim, only a little way from Sychar. On this mountain they had built a temple somewhat similar to the one in Jerusalem. This was one of the main subjects of controversy between them and the Jews. The old Samaritan Pentateuch, or five books of Moses, has the word “Gerizim” instead of “Ebal” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+27:4">Deuteronomy 27:4</span>. On this account, as well as because the patriarchs are mentioned as having worshipped in Shechem, they supposed that that was the proper place on which to erect the temple.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye say - </b>Ye Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Jerusalem - </b>The place where the temple was built. This was built in accordance with the promise and command of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+12:5">Deuteronomy 12:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+12:11">Deuteronomy 12:11</span>. In building this, David and Solomon were under the divine direction, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:2-3">2 Samuel 7:2-3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:13">2 Samuel 7:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+5:5">1 Kings 5:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+5:12">1 Kings 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:15-22">1 Kings 8:15-22</span>. As it was contemplated in the law of Moses that there should be but one place to offer sacrifice and to hold the great feasts, so it followed that the Samaritans were in error in supposing that their temple was the place. Accordingly, our Saviour decided in favor of the Jews, yet in such a manner as to show the woman that the question was of much less consequence than they supposed it to be.</p>
