<p style=" "><b>He left Judea - </b>The envy and malice of the Pharisees he might have known were growing so rapidly as to endanger his life. As his time to die had not yet come, he retired to Galilee, a country farther from Jerusalem, and much less under their control than Judea. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:22">Mark 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1">Luke 3:1</span>. Though he feared not death and did not shrink from suffering, yet he did not needlessly throw himself into danger or provoke opposition. He could do as much good in Galilee, probably, as in Judea, and he therefore withdrew himself from immediate danger.</p>
