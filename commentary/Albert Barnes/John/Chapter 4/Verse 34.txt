<p style=" "><b>My meat ... - </b>Jesus here explains what he said in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:32">John 4:32</span>. His great object - the great design of his life - was to do the will of God. He came to that place weary and thirsty, and at the usual time of meals, probably hungry; yet an opportunity of doing good presented itself, and he forgot his fatigue and hunger, and found comfort and joy in doing good - in seeking to save a soul. This one great object absorbed all his powers, and made him forget his weariness and the wants of nature. The mind may be so absorbed in doing the will of God as to forget all other things. Intent on this, we may rise above fatigue, and hardship, and want, and bear all with pleasure in seeing the work of God advance. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+23:12">Job 23:12</span>; “I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necesary food.” We may learn, also, that the main business of life is not to avoid fatigue or to seek the supply of our temporal wants, but to do the will of God. The mere supply of our temporal necessities, though most people make it an object of their chief solicitude, is a small consideration in the sight of him who has just views of the great design of human life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The will of him that sent me - </b>The will of God in regard to the salvation of men. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To finish his work - </b>To “complete” or fully to do the work which he has commanded in regard to the salvation of men. It is his work to provide salvation, and his to redeem, and his to apply the salvation to the heart. Jesus came to do it by teaching, by his example, and by his death as an expiation for sin. And he shows us that “we” should be diligent. If he was so diligent for our welfare, if he bore fatigue and want to benefit us, then we should be diligent, also, in regard to our own salvation, and also in seeking the salvation of others.</p>
