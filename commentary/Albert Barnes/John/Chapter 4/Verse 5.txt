<p style=" "><b>Sychar - </b>This city stood about eight miles southeast of the city called Samaria, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim. It was one of the oldest cities of Palestine, and was formerly known by the name of “Shechem,” or Sichem, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:18">Genesis 33:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:6">Genesis 12:6</span>. The city was in the tribe of Ephraim, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+21:21">Joshua 21:21</span>. It was at this place that Joshua assembled the people before his death, and here they renewed their covenant with the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+24:0">Joshua 24:0</span>. After the death of Gideon it became a place of idolatrous worship, the people worshipping Baal-berith, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+9:46">Judges 9:46</span>. It was destroyed by Abimelech, who beat down the city and sowed it with salt, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+9:45">Judges 9:45</span>. It was afterward rebuilt, and became the residence of Jeroboam, the King of Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+12:25">1 Kings 12:25</span>. It was called by the Romans “Flavia Neapolis,” and this has been corrupted by the Arabs into “Nablus,” its present name. It is still a considerable place, and its site is remarkably pleasant and productive.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The parcel of ground - </b>The piece of ground; or the land, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That Jacob gave ... - </b>Jacob bought one piece of ground near to Shalem, a city of Shechem, of the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for an hundred pieces of silver, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:19">Genesis 33:19</span>. In this place the bones of Joseph were buried when they were brought up from Egypt, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+24:32">Joshua 24:32</span>. He also gave to Joseph an additional piece of ground which he took from the hand of the Amorite by his own valor, “with his sword and his bow,” as a portion above that which was given to his brethren, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:22">Genesis 48:22</span>. Possibly these pieces of ground lay near together, and were a part of the homestead of Jacob. The well was near to this. There is now, E. Smith mentioned to me in conversation, a place near this well called Shalem.</p>
