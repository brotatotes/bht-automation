<p style=" "><b>Himself believed - </b>This miracle removed all his doubts, and he became a real disciple and friend of Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His whole house - </b>His whole family. We may learn from this,</p>
<p style=" ">1. That sickness or any deep affliction is often the means of great good. Here the sickness of the son resulted in the faith of all the family. God often takes away earthly blessings that he may impart rich spiritual mercies.</p>
<p style=" ">2. The father of a family may be the means of the salvation of his children. Here the effort of a parent resulted in their conversion to Christ.</p>
<p style=" ">3. There is great beauty and propriety when sickness thus results in piety. For that it is sent. God does not willingly grieve or afflict the children of men; and when afflictions thus terminate, it will be cause of eternal joy, of ceaseless praise.</p>
<p style=" ">4. There is a special charm when piety thus comes into the families of the rich. and the noble. It is so unusual: their example and influence go so far; it overcomes so many temptations, and affords opportunities of doing so much good, that there is no wonder that the evangelist selected this instance as one of the effects of the power and of the preaching of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
