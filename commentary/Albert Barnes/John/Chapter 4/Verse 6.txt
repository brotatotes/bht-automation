<p style=" "><b>Jacob’s well - </b>This is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was called “Jacob’s well,” probably, either because it was handed down by tradition that he dug it, or because it was near to the land which he gave to Joseph. There is still a well a few miles to the east of Nablus, which is said by the people there to be the same. Eli Smith, missionary to Syria, stated to me that he had visited this well. It is about 100 feet deep. It is cut through solid rock of limestone. It is now dry, probably from having been partly filled with rubbish, or perhaps because the water has been diverted by earthquakes. The well is covered with a large stone, which has a hole in the center large enough to admit a man. It is at the foot of Mount Gerizim, and has a plain on the east.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sat thus - </b>Jesus was weary, and, being thus weary, sat down on the well. The word translated “on” here may denote also by - he sat down “by” the well, or near it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The sixth hour - </b>About twelve o’clock noon. This was the common time of the Jewish meal, and this was the reason why his disciples were gone away to buy food.</p>
