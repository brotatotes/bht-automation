<p style=" "><b>As the Father raiseth up the dead - </b>God has power to raise the dead. By his power it had been done in at least two instances - by the prophet Elijah, in the case of the son of the widow of Sarepta <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:22">1 Kings 17:22</span>, and by the prophet Elisha, in the case of the Shunamite’s son, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:32-35">2 Kings 4:32-35</span>. The Jews did not doubt that God had power to raise the dead. Jesus here expressly affirms it, and says he has the same power.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Quickeneth them - </b>Gives them “life.” This is the sense of the word “quickeneth” throughout the Bible.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even so - </b>In the same manner. By the same authority and power. The power of raising the dead must be one of the highest attributes of the divinity. As Jesus affirms that he has the power to do this “in the same manner” as the Father, so it follows that he must be equal with God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Son quickeneth - </b>Gives life to. This may either refer to his raising the dead from their graves, or to his giving spiritual life to those who are dead in trespasses and sins. The former he did in the case of Lazarus and the widow’s son at Nain, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:43-44">John 11:43-44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:14-15">Luke 7:14-15</span>. The latter he did in the case of all those who were converted by his power, and still does it in any instance of conversion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whom he will - </b>It was in the power of Jesus to raise up any of the dead as well as Lazarus. It depended on his will whether Lazarus and the widow’s son should come to life. So it depends on his will whether sinners shall live. He has power to renew them, and the renewing of the heart is as much the result of his “will” as the raising of the dead.</p>
