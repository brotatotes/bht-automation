<p style=" "><b>He that heareth my word - </b>To “hear,” in this place, evidently denotes not the outward act of hearing, but to receive in a proper manner; to suffer it to make its proper impression on the mind; to obey. The word “hear” is often used in this sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:15">Matthew 11:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:23">Acts 3:23</span>. Many persons outwardly hear the gospel who neither understand nor obey it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My word - </b>My doctrine, my teaching. All that Jesus taught about Himself, as well as about the Father.</p>
<p style=" "><b>On him that sent me - </b>On the Father, who, in the plan of redemption, is represented as “sending” his Son to save men. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>. Faith in God, who sent his Son, is here represented as being connected with everlasting life; but there can be no faith in him who “sent” his Son, without faith also in him who is “sent.” The belief of one of the true doctrines of religion is connected with, and will lead to, the belief of all.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath everlasting life - </b>The state of man by nature is represented as death in sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>. Religion is the opposite of this, or is “life.” The “dead” regard not anything. They are unaffected by the cares, pleasures, amusements of the world. They hear neither the voice of merriment nor the tread of the living over their graves. So with sinners. They are unmoved with the, things of religion. They hear not the voice of God; they see not his loveliness; they care not for his threatenings. But religion is “life.” The Christian lives with God, and feels and acts as if there was a God. Religion, and its blessings here and hereafter, are one and the same. The happiness of heaven is living for God - being sensible of his presence, and glory, and power - and rejoicing in that. There shall be no more “death” there, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:4">Revelation 21:4</span>. This “life,” or this religion, whether on earth or in heaven, is the same - the same joys extended and expanded forever. Hence, when a man is converted, it is said that he “has” everlasting life; not merely shall have but is already in possession of that life or happiness which shall be everlasting. It is life begun, expanded, ripening for the skies. He has already entered on his inheritance - that inheritance which is everlasting.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall not come into condemnation - </b>He was by nature under condemnation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span>. Here it is declared that he shall not return to that state, or he will not be again condemned. This promise is sure; it is made by the Son of God, and there is no one that can pluck them out of his hand, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:28">John 10:28</span>. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But is passed from death unto life - </b>Has “passed over” from a state of spiritual death to the life of the Christian. The word translated “is passed” would be better expressed by “has passed.” It implies that he has done it voluntarily; that none compelled him; and that the passage is made unto “everlasting” life. Because Christ is the author of this life in the soul, he is called the “Life” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>; and as he has “always” existed, and is the Source of “all life,” he is called the “eternal life,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>.</p>
