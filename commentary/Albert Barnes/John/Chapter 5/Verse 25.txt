<p style=" "><b>The hour - </b>The time.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is coming - </b>Under the preaching of the gospel, as well as in the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Now is - </b>It is now taking place. Sinners were converted under his ministry and brought to spiritual life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The dead - </b>Either the dead in sins, or those that are in their graves. The words of the Saviour will apply to either. Language, in the Scriptures, is often so used as to describe two similar events. Thus the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world are described by Jesus in the same language, Matt. 24–25. The return of the Jews from Babylon, and the coming of the Messiah, and the spread of his gospel, are described in the same language by Isaiah, Isa. 40–61. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span>. The renewal of the heart, and the raising of the dead at the judgment, are here also described in similar language, because they so far resemble each other that the same language will apply to both.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The voice of the Son of God - </b>The voice is that by which we give command. Jesus raised up the dead by his command, or by his authority. When he did it he spoke, or commanded it to be done. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:41">Mark 5:41</span>; “he took the damsel by the hand, and said, Talitha cumi.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:14">Luke 7:14</span>; “and he came and touched the bier, and said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:43">John 11:43</span>; “he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.” So it is by his command that those who are dead in sins are quickened or made alive, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>. And so at the day of judgment the dead will be raised by his command or voice, though there is no reason to think that his voice will be audibly heard, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall live - </b>Shall be restored to life.”</p>
