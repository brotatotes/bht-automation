<p style=" "><b>Ye sent unto John - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He bare witness ... - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:36">John 1:36</span>. This testimony of John ought to have satisfied them. John was an eminent man; many of the Pharisees believed on him; he was candid, unambitious, sincere, and his evidence was impartial. On this Jesus might have rested the proof that he was the Messiah, but he was willing, also, to adduce evidence of a higher order.</p>
