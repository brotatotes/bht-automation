It was clear, full, explicited You ‘sent’ to make inquiry, and he gave you a candid and satisfactory answer. Had you believed that, you would have believed in the Messiah and been saved.” Men are often dissatisfied with the very evidence of the truth of religion which they sought, and on which they professed themselves willing to rely.</p>
