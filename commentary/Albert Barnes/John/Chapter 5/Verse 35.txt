<p style=" "><b>He was - </b>It is probable that John had been cast into prison before this. Hence, his public ministry had ceased, and our Saviour says he was such a light.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Light - </b>The word in the original properly means a “lamp,” and is not the same which in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4-5">John 1:4-5</span> is translated “light.” That is a word commonly applied to the sun, the fountain of light; this means a lamp, or a light that is lit up or kindled artificially from oil or tallow. A teacher is often called a “light,” because he guides or illuminates the minds of others. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:19">Romans 2:19</span>; “thou art confident that thou art a guide of the blind, a light of them that sit in darkness;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A burning - </b>A lamp lit up that burns with a steady luster.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shining - </b>Not dim, not indistinct. The expression means that he was an eminent teacher; that his doctrines were clear, distinct, consistent.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye were willing - </b>You willed, or you chose; you went out voluntarily. This shows that some of those whom Jesus was now addressing were among the great multitudes of Pharisees that came unto John in the wilderness, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>. As they had at one time admitted John to be a prophet, so Jesus might with great propriety adduce his testimony in his favor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For a season - </b>In the original, for an “hour” - denoting only a short time. They did it, as many others do, while he was popular, and it was the “fashion” to follow him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To rejoice in his light - </b>To rejoice in his doctrines, and in admitting that he was a distinguished prophet; perhaps, also, to rejoice that he professed to be sent to introduce the Messiah, until they found that he bore testimony to Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
