<p style=" "><b>The Father himself ...hath borne witness of me - </b>This God had done,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye have neither heard his voice - </b>This difficult passage has been interpreted in various ways. The main design of it seems to be clear - to reprove the Jews for not believing the evidence that he was the Messiah. In doing this he says that they were indisposed to listen to the testimony of God. He affirmed that God had given sufficient evidence of his divine mission, but they had disregarded it. The first thing that he notices is that they had not heard his voice. The word “hear,” in this place, is to be understood in the sense of “obey” or listen to. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>. The voice of God means his commands or his declarations, however made; and the Saviour said that it had been the “characteristic” of the Jews that they had not listened to the voice or command of God. As this had been their general characteristic, it was not wonderful that they disregarded now his testimony in regard to the Messiah. The voice of God had been literally heard on the mount. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+4:12">Deuteronomy 4:12</span>; “Ye heard the voice of the words.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>At any time - </b>This has been the uniform characteristic of the nation that they have disregarded and perverted the testimony of God, and it was as true of that generation as of their fathers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor seen his shape - </b>No man hath seen God at any time, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>. But the word “shape,” here, does not mean “God himself.” It refers to the visible “manifestation” of himself; to the “appearance” which he assumed. It is applied in the Septuagint to his manifesting himself to Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8">Numbers 12:8</span>; “With him will I speak mouth to mouth, ‘even apparently;’” in Greek, “in a form” or “shape” the word used here. It is applied to the visible symbol of God that appeared in the cloud and that rested on the tabernacle, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+9:15-16">Numbers 9:15-16</span>. It is the same word that is applied to the Holy Spirit appearing in bodily shape like a dove, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>. Jesus does not here deny that God had “appeared” in this manner, but he says they had not seen - that is, had not “paid attention to,” or “regarded,” the appearance of God. He had manifested himself, but they disregarded it, and, in particular, they had disregarded his manifestations in attestation of the Messiah. As the word “hear” means to obey, to listen to, so the word “see” means “to pay attention to, to regard” <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Jo 1:8</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:6">1 John 3:6</span>, and thus throws light on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>; “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.” “I am a ‘manifestation’ of God - God appearing in human flesh, as he appeared formerly in the symbol of the cloud; and he that ‘regards me,’ or attends to me, regards the Father.”</p>
