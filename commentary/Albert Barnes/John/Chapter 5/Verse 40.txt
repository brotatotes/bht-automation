<p style=" "><b>And ye will not come ... - </b>Though the Old Testament bears evidence that I am the Messiah; though you professedly search it to learn the way to life, and though my works prove it, yet you will not come to me to obtain life. From this we may learn:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That life is to be obtained in Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life, and he only can save us.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That, in order to do that, we must “come to him” - that is, must come in the way appointed, as lost sinners, and be willing to be saved by him alone.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That the reason why sinners are not saved lies in the will. “The only reason why sinners die is because ‘they will not come’ to Christ for life and happiness: it is not because they ‘cannot,’ but because they ‘will not’” (Henry).</p>
