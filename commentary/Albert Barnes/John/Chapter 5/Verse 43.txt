<p style=" "><b>I am come in my Fatherâ€™s name - </b>By the authority of God; or giving proof that I am sent by him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If another shall come in his own name - </b>A false teacher setting up himself, and not even pretending to have a divine commission. The Jews were much accustomed to receive and follow particular teachers. In the time of Christ they were greatly divided between the schools of Hillel and Shammai, two famous teachers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye will receive - </b>You will follow, or obey him as a teacher.</p>
