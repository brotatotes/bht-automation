<p style=" "><b>I receive not honour ... - </b>“I do not say these things because I am desirous of human applause, but to account for the fact that you do not believe on me. The reason is, that you have not the love of God in you.” In this passage we see:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Love of God - </b>Love to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In you - </b>In your hearts. You do not love God.</p>
