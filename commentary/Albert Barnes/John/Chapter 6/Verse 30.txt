<p style=" "><b>What sign showest thou? - </b>On the word sign, compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span>. What miracle dost thou work to prove that thou art the Messiah? They had just seen the miracle of the loaves in the desert, which was sufficient to show that he was the Messiah, and it would seem from the preceding narrative that those who crossed the lake to see him supposed that he was the Christ. It seems wonderful that they should so soon ask for further evidence that he was sent from God; but it is not improbable that this question was put by other Jews, rulers of the synagogue, who happened to be present, and who had not witnessed his miracles. Those men were continually asking for signs and proofs that he was the Messiah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38-39">Matthew 12:38-39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:11">Mark 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:29">Luke 11:29</span>.
