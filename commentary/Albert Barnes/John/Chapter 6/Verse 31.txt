<p style=" "><b>Our fathers - </b>The Jews who were led by Moses through the wilderness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Did eat manna - </b>This was the name given by the Jews to the food which was furnished to them by God in their journey. It means literally, “What is this?” and was the question which they asked when they first saw it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:14-15">Exodus 16:14-15</span>. It was small like frost, and of the size of coriander-seed, and had a sweetish taste like honey. It fell in great quantities, and was regarded by the Jews as proof of a continued miracle during forty years, and was incontestable evidence of the interposition of God in favor of their fathers. The manna which is sold in the shops of druggists is a different substance from this. It is obtained from the bark of certain trees in Armenia, Georgia, Persia, and Arabia. It is procured, as resin is, by making an incision in the bark, and it flows out or distils from the tree.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As it is written - </b>The substance of this is written in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:24-25">Psalms 78:24-25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He gave them - </b>This was regarded as a miraculous interference in their behalf, and an attestation of the divine mission of Moses, and hence they said familiarly that Moses gave it to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Bread from heaven - </b>The word “heaven,” in the Scriptures, denotes often the region of the air, the atmosphere, or that region in which the clouds are. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:3">Matthew 16:3</span>; “The sky (heaven) is red and lowering.” Also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:15">Luke 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:18">Luke 5:18</span>. The Jews, as appears from their writings (see Lightfoot), expected that the Messiah would provide his followers with plenty of delicious food; and as Moses had provided for the Jews in the wilderness, so they supposed that Christ would make provision for the temporal wants of his friends. This was the sign, probably, which they were now desirous of seeing.</p>
