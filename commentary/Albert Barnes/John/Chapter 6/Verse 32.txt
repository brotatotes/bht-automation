<p style=" "><b>Moses gave you not that bread from heaven - </b>This might be translated, “Moses gave you not the bread of heaven.” The word “that,” which makes some difference in the sense, is not necessary to express the meaning of the original. It does not appear that Jesus intended to call in question the fact that their fathers were fed by the instrumentality of Moses, but to state that he did not give them the true bread that was adapted to the wants of the soul. He fed the Body, although his food did not keep the body alive <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:49">John 6:49</span> but he did not give that which would preserve the soul from death. God gave, in his Son Jesus, the true bread from heaven which was fitted to man, and of far more value than any supply of their temporal wants. He tells them, therefore, that they are not to seek from him any such supply of their temporal wants as they had supposed. A better gift had been furnished in his being given for the life of the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My father giveth you - </b>In the gospel; in the gift of his Son.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The true bread - </b>The trite or real support which is needed to keep the soul from death. It is not false, deceitful, or perishing. Christ is called bread, because, as bread supports life, so his doctrine supports, preserves, and saves the soul from death. He is the true support, not only in opposition to the mere supply of temporal wants such as Moses furnished, but also in opposition to all false religion which deceives and destroys the soul.</p>
