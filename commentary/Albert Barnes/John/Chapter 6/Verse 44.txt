<p style=" "><b>No man can come to me - </b>This was spoken by Jesus to reprove their complaints - “Murmur not among yourselves.” They objected to his doctrine, or complained against it, because he claimed to be greater than Moses, and because they supposed him to be a mere man, and that what he said was impossible. Jesus does not deny that these things appeared difficult, and hence he said that if any man believed, it was proof that God had inclined him. It was not to be expected that of themselves they would embrace the doctrine. If any man believed, it would be because he had been influenced by God. When we inquire what the reasons were why they did not believe, they appear to have been:</p>
<p style=" ">1. Their improper regard for Moses, as if no one could be superior to him.</p>
<p style=" ">2. Their unwillingness to believe that Jesus, whom they knew to be the reputed son of a carpenter, should be superior to Moses.</p>
<p style=" ">3. The difficulty was explained by Jesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span> as consisting in the opposition of their will; and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span> when he said that their love of honor prevented their believing on him. The difficulty in the case was not, therefore, a want of natural faculties, or of power to do their duty, but erroneous opinions, pride, obstinacy, self-conceit, and a deep-felt contempt for Jesus. The word cannot is often used to denote a strong and violent opposition of the will. Thus we say a man is so great a liar that he cannot speak the truth, or he is so profane that he cannot but swear. We mean by it that he is so wicked that while he has that disposition the other effects will follow, but we do not mean to say that he could not break off from the habit. Thus it is said <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:4">Genesis 37:4</span> of the brethren of Joseph that they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:34">Matthew 12:34</span>, “How can ye, being evil, speak good things?” See <span class="_0000ff"><u>Luk 14:33</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:2">1 Samuel 16:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Come to me - </b>The same as believe on me.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Draw him - </b>This word is used here, evidently, to denote such an influence from God as to secure the result, or as to incline the mind to believe; yet the manner in which this is done is not determined by the use of the word. It is used in the New Testament six times. Once it is applied to a compulsory drawing of Paul and Silas to the market-place, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>. Twice it is used to denote the drawing of a net, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:6">John 21:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:11">John 21:11</span>. Once to the drawing of a sword <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>; and once in a sense similar to its use here <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>; “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.” What is its meaning here must be determined by the facts about the sinner’s conversion. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:40">John 6:40</span>. In the conversion of the sinner God enlightens the mind <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:45">John 6:45</span>, he inclines the will <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:3">Psalms 110:3</span>, and he influences the soul by motives, by just views of his law, by his love, his commands, and his threatenings; by a desire of happiness, and a consciousness of danger; by the Holy Spirit applying truth to the mind, and urging him to yield himself to the Saviour. So that, while God inclines him, and will have all the glory, man yields without compulsion; the obstacles are removed, and he becomes a willing servant of God.</p>
