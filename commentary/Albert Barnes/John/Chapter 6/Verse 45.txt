<p style=" "><b>In the prophets - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:13">Isaiah 54:13</span>. A similar sentiment is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mic+4:1-4">Micah 4:1-4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:34">Jeremiah 31:34</span>; but by the prophets, here, is meant the book of the prophets, and it is probable that Jesus had reference only to the place in Isaiah, as this was the usual way of quoting the prophets.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be all taught of God - </b>This explains the preceding verse. It is by the teaching of his Word and Spirit that men are drawn to God. This shows that it is not compulsory, and that there is no obstacle in the way but a strong voluntary ignorance and unwillingness.</p>
