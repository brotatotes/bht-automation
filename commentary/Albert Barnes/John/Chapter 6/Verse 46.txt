<p style=" "><b>Not that any man hath seen the Father - </b>Jesus added this, evidently, to guard against mistake. He had said that all who came to him were taught of God. The teacher was commonly seen and heard by the pupil; but, lest it should be supposed that he meant to say that a man to come to him must see and hear God, visibly and audibly, he adds that he did not intend to affirm this. It was still true that no man had seen God at any time. They were not, therefore, to expect to see God, and his words were not to be perverted as if he meant to teach that.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Save he which is of God - </b>Jesus here evidently refers to himself as the Son of God. He had just said that no man had seen the Father. When he affirms that he has seen the Father, it implies that he is more than man. He is the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>; God over all, blessed forever, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>. By his being of God is meant that he is the only-begotten Son of God, and sent as the Messiah into the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath seen - </b>Hath intimately known or perceived him. He knows his nature, character, plans. This is a claim to knowledge superior to what man possesses, and it cannot be understood except by supposing that Jesus is equal with God.</p>
