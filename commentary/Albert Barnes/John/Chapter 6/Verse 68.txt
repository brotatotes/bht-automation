<p style=" "><b>Simon Peter answered him - </b>With characteristic ardor and promptness. Peter was probably one of the oldest of the apostles, and it was his character to be first and most ardent in his professions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To whom shall we go - </b>This implied their firm conviction that Jesus was the Messiah, and that he alone was able to save them. It is one of Peterâ€™s noble confessions - the instinctive promptings of a pious heart and of ardent love. There was no one else who could teach them. The Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the scribes were corrupt, and unable to guide them aright; and, though the doctrines of Jesus were mysterious, yet they were the only doctrines that could instruct and save them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou hast ... - </b>The meaning of this is, thou teachest the doctrines which lead to eternal life. And from this we may learn:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That we are to expect that some of the doctrines of the Bible will be mysterious.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That, though they are difficult to be understood, yet we should not therefore reject them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That nothing would be gained by rejecting them. The atheist, the infidel - nay, the philosopher, believes, or professes to believe, propositions quite as mysterious as any in the Bible.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 4.That poor, lost, sinful man has nowhere else to go but to Jesus. He is the way, the truth, and the life, and if the sinner betakes himself to any other way he will wander and die.</p>
