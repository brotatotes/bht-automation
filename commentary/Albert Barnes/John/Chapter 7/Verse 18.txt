<p style=" "><b>That speaketh of himself - </b>This does not mean about or concerning himself, but he that speaks by his own authority, without being sent by God, as mere human teachers do.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Seeketh his own glory - </b>His own praise, or seeks for reputation and applause. This is the case with mere human teachers, and as Jesus in his discourses manifestly sought to honor God, they ought to have supposed that he was sent by him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>No unrighteousness - </b>This word here means, evidently, there is no falsehood, no deception in him. He is not an impostor. It is used in the same sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:10-12">2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</span>. It is true that there was no unrighteousness, no sin in Jesus Christ, but that is not the truth taught here. It is that he was not an impostor, and the evidence of this was that he sought not his own glory, but the honor of God. This evidence was furnished:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.In his teaching such doctrines as tended to exalt God and humble man;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.In his ascribing all glory and praise to God;</p>
