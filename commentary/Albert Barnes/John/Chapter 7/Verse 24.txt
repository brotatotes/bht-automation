<p style=" "><b>Judge not according to the appearance - </b>Not as a thing first offers itself to you, without reflection or candor. In appearance, to circumcise a child on the Sabbath might be a violation of the law; yet you do it, and it is right. So, to appearance, it might be a violation of the Sabbath to heal a man, yet it is right to do works of necessity and mercy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Judge righteous judgment - </b>Candidly; looking at the law, and inquiring what its spirit really requires.</p>
