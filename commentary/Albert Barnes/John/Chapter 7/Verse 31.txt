Will he do more miracles? - It was a common expectation that the Messiah would work many miracles. This opinion was founded on such passages as Isaiah 35:5-6, etc.: “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped; then shall the lame man leap as an hart,” etc. Jesus had given abundant evidence of his power to work such miracles, and they therefore believed that he was the Messiah.
