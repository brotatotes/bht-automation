<p style=" "><b>Ye shall seek me - </b>This probably means simply, Ye shall seek the Messiah. Such will be your troubles, such the calamities that will come on the nation, that you will earnestly desire the coming of the Messiah. You will seek for a Deliverer, and will look for feign that he may bring deliverance. This does not mean that they would seek for Jesus and not be able to find him, but that they would desire the aid and comfort of the Messiah, and would be disappointed. Jesus speaks of himself as the Messiah, and his own name as synonymous with the Messiah. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:39">Matthew 23:39</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall not find me - </b>Shall not find the Messiah. He will not come, according to your expectations, to aid you. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Where I am - </b>This whole clause is to be understood as future, though the words AM and cannot are both in the present tense. The meaning is, Where I shall be you will not be able to come. That is, he, the Messiah, would be in heaven; and though they would earnestly desire his presence and aid to save the city and nation from the Romans, yet they would not be able to obtain it - represented here by their not being able to come to him. This does not refer to their individual salvation, but to the deliverance of their nation. It is not true of individual sinners that they seek Christ in a proper manner and are not able to find him; but it was true of the Jewish nation that they looked for the Messiah, and sought his coming to deliver them, but he did not do it.</p>
