<p style=" "><b>He that believeth on me - </b>He that acknowledges me as the Messiah, and trusts in me for salvation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As the scripture hath said - </b>This is a difficult expression, from the fact that no such expression as follows is to be found literally in the Old Testament. Some have proposed to connect it with what precedes - “He that believeth on me, as the Old Testament has commanded or required” - but to this there are many objections. The natural and obvious meaning here is, doubtless, the true one; and Jesus probably intended to say, not that there was any particular place in the Old Testament that affirmed this in so many words, but that this was the substance of what the Scriptures taught, or this was the spirit of their declarations. Hence, the Syriac translates it in the plural - the Scriptures. Probably there is a reference more particularly to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:11">Isaiah 58:11</span>, than to any other single passage: “Thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters fail not.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:3-4">Isaiah 44:3-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:18">Joel 3:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Out of his belly - </b>Out of his midst, or out of his heart. The word “belly” is often put for the midst of a thing, the center, and the heart, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:40">Matthew 12:40</span>. It means here that from the man shall flow; that is, his piety shall be of such a nature that it will extend its blessings to others. It shall be like a running fountain - perhaps in allusion to statues or ornamented reservoirs in gardens. in which pipes were placed from which water was continually flowing. The Jews used the same figure: “His two reins are like fountains of water, from which the law flows.” And again: “When a man turns himself to the Lord, he shall be as a fountain filled with living water, and his streams shall flow to all the nations and tribes of men” (Kuinoel).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Rivers - </b>This word is used to express abundance, or a full supply. It means here that those who are Christians shall diffuse large, and liberal, and constant blessings on their fellow-men; or, as Jesus immediately explains it, that they shall be the instruments by which the Holy Spirit shall be poured down on the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Living water - </b>Fountains, ever-flowing streams. That is, the gospel shall be constant and life-giving in its blessings. We learn here:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That it is the nature of Christian piety to be diffusive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That no man can believe on Jesus who does not desire that others should also, and who will not seek it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That the desire is large and liberal - that the Christian desires the salvation of all the world.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 4.That the faith of the believer is to be connected with the influence of the Holy Spirit, and in that way Christians are to be like rivers of living water.</p>
