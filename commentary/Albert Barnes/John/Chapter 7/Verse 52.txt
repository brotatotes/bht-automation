<p style=" "><b>Art thou also of Galilee? - </b>Here is another expression of contempt. To be a Galilean was a term of the highest reproach. They knew well that he was not of Galilee, but they meant to ask whether he also had become a follower of the despised Galilean. Ridicule is not argument, and there is no demonstration in a gibe; but, unhappily, this is the only weapon which the proud and haughty often use in opposing religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ariseth no prophet - </b>That is, there is no prediction that any prophet should come out of Galilee, and especially no prophet that was to attend or precede the Messiah. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:46">John 1:46</span>. They assumed, therefore, that Jesus could not be the Christ.</p>
