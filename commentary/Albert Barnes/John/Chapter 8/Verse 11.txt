<p style=" "><b>Neither do I condemn thee - </b>This is evidently to be taken in the sense of judicial condemnation, or of passing sentence as a magistrate, for this was what they had arraigned her for. It was not to obtain his opinion about adultery, but to obtain the condemnation of the woman. As he claimed no civil authority, he said that he did not exercise it, and should not condemn her to die. In this sense the word is used in the previous verse, and this is the only sense which the passage demands. Besides, what follows shows that this was his meaning.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Go, and sin no more - </b>You have sinned. You have been detected and accused. The sin is great. But I do not claim power to condemn you to die, and, as your accusers have left you, my direction to you is that you sin no more. This passage therefore teaches us:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That Jesus claimed no civil authority.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That he regarded the action of which they accused her as sin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That he knew the hearts and lives of men.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 4.That men are often very zealous in accusing others of that of which they themselves are guilty. And,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 5.That Jesus was endowed with wonderful wisdom in meeting the devices of his enemies, and eluding their deep-laid plans to involve him in ruin.</p>
<p style=" ">It should be added that this passage, together with the last verse of the preceding chapter, has been by many critics thought to be spurious. It is wanting in many of the ancient manuscripts and versions, and has been rejected by Erasmus, Calvin, Beza, Grotius, Wetstein, Tittman, Knapp, and many others. It is not easy to decide the question whether it be a genuine part of the New Testament or not. Some have supposed that it was not written by the evangelists, but was often related by them, and that after a time it was recorded and introduced by Papias into the sacred text.</p>
