<p style=" "><b>Jesus answered ... - </b>To this objection Jesus replied by saying, first, that the case was such that his testimony alone ought to be received; and, secondly, that he had the evidence given him by his Father. Though, in common life, in courts, and in mere human transactions, it was true that a man ought not to give evidence in his own case, yet in this instance, such was the nature of the case that his word was worthy to be believed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My record - </b>My evidence, my testimony.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is true - </b>Is worthy to be believed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For I know whence I came ...but ye ... - </b>I know by what authority I act; I know by whom I am sent, and what commands were given me; but you cannot determine this, for you do not know these unless I bear witness of them to you. We are to remember that Jesus came not of himself <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span>; that he came not to do his own will, but the will of his Father. He came as a witness of those things which he had seen and known <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11">John 3:11</span>, and no man could judge of those things for no man had seen them. As he came from heaven; as he knew his Fatherâ€™s will; as he had seen the eternal world, and known the counsels of his Father, so his testimony was worthy of confidence. As they had not seen and known these things, they were not qualified to judge. An ambassador from a foreign court knows the will and purposes of the sovereign who sent him, and is competent to bear witness of it. The court to which he is sent has no way of judging but by his testimony, and he is therefore competent to testify in the case. All that can be demanded is that he give his credentials that he is appointed, and this Jesus had done both by the nature of his doctrine and his miracles.</p>
