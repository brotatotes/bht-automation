Is with me - In working miracles, etc.Hath not left me alone - Though men had forsaken and rejected him, yet God attended him.Those things that please him - See Matthew 3:17; “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,” Philippians 2:8; Isaiah 53:10-12; 2 Peter 1:17; Luke 3:22; Matthew 17:5. His undertaking the work of redemption was pleasing to God, and he had the consciousness that in executing it he did those things which God approved. It is a small matter to have men opposed to us, if we have a conscience void of offence, and evidence that we please God. Compare Hebrews 11:5; “Enoch - before his translation had this testimony that he pleased God.” See also 1 Corinthians 4:3.
