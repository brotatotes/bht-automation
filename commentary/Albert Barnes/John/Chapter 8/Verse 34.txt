<p style=" "><b>Whosoever committeth sin ... - </b>In this passage Jesus shows them that he did not refer to political bondage, but to the slavery of the soul to evil passions and desires.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is the servant - </b>Is the slave of sin. He is bound to it as a slave is to his master.</p>
