<p style=" "><b>If the Son ... - </b>The Son of God - heir of all things - who is forever with God, and who has therefore the right and power to liberate men from their thraldom.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall make you free - </b>Shall deliver you from the bondage and dominion of sin.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Free indeed - </b>Truly and really free. You shall be blessed with the most valuable freedom; not from the chains and oppressions of earthly masters and monarchs, but from the bondage of sin.</p>
