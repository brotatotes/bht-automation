<p style=" "><b>I know ... - </b>I admit that you are the descendants of Abraham. Jesus did not wish to call that in question, but he endeavored to show them that they might be his descendants and still lack entirely his spirit. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye seek to kill me - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:32">John 7:32</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because my word - </b>My doctrine; the principles of my religion. You have not the spirit of my doctrine; you hate it, and you therefore seek to kill me.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath no place - </b>That is, you do not embrace my doctrine, or it exerts no influence over you. The original word conveys the notion that there was no room for his doctrine in their minds. It met with obstructions, and did not penetrate into their hearts. They were so filled with pride, and prejudice, and false notions, that they would not receive his truth; and as they had not his truth or spirit, and could not bear it, they sought to kill him.</p>
