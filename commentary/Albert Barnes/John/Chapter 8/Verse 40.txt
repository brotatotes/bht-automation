<p style=" "><b>Ye seek to kill me - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37">John 8:37</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>This did not Abraham - </b>Or such things Abraham did not do. There are two things noted here in which they differed from Abraham:</p>
<p style=" ">1. In seeking to kill him, or in possessing a murderous and bloody purpose.</p>
<p style=" ">2. In rejecting the truth as God revealed it. Abraham was distinguished for love to man as well as God. He liberated the captives <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:14-16">Genesis 14:14-16</span>; was distinguished for hospitality to strangers <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:1-8">Genesis 18:1-8</span>; and received the revelations of God to him, however mysterious, or however trying their observance, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1-4">Genesis 12:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:4-6">Genesis 15:4-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:0">Genesis 22:0</span>. It was for these things that he is so much commended in the New Testament <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:9">Romans 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:9">Romans 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:6">Galatians 3:6</span>; and, as the Jews sought to kill Jesus instead of treating him hospitably and kindly, they showed that they had none of the spirit of Abraham.</p>
