<p style=" "><b>The deeds of your father - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:38">John 8:38</span>. Jesus repeats the charge, and yet repeats it as if unwilling to name Satan as their father. He chose that they should infer whom he meant, rather than bring a charge so direct and repelling. When the Saviour delivered an awful or an offensive truth, he always approached the mind so that the truth might make the deepest impression.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We be not born of fornication - </b>The people still professed not to understand him; and since Jesus had denied that they were the children of Abraham, they affected to suppose that he meant they were a mixed, spurious race; that they had no right to the covenant privileges of the Jews; that they were not worshippers of the true God. Hence, they said, We are not thus descended. We have the evidence of our genealogy. We are worshippers of the true God, descended from those who acknowledged him, and we acknowledge no other God and Father than him. To be children of fornication is an expression denoting in the Scriptures idolatry, or the worship of other gods than the true God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:21">Isaiah 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:3">Isaiah 57:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>. This they denied. They affirmed that they acknowledged no God for their Father but the true God.</p>
