<p style=" "><b>If God were your Father - </b>If you had the spirit of God, or love to him, or were worthy to be called his children.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye would love me - </b>Jesus was “the brightness of the Father’s glory and the express image of his person,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>. “Everyone that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>. From this we see:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That all who truly love God, love his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That men that pretend that they love God, and reject his Son, have no evidence that they are the friends of God.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That those who reject the Bible cannot be the friends of God. If they loved God, they would love Him who came from him, and who bears his image.</p>
