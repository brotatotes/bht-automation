If God were your Father - If you had the spirit of God, or love to him, or were worthy to be called his children.Ye would love me - Jesus was “the brightness of the Father’s glory and the express image of his person,” Hebrews 1:3. “Everyone that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him,” 1 John 5:1. From this we see: 1.That all who truly love God, love his Son Jesus Christ. 2.That men that pretend that they love God, and reject his Son, have no evidence that they are the friends of God. 3.That those who reject the Bible cannot be the friends of God. If they loved God, they would love Him who came from him, and who bears his image.
