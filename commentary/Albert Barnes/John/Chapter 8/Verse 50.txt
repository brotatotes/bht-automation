<p style=" "><b>Mine own glory - </b>My own praise or honor. In all his teaching this was true. He did not seek to exalt or to vindicate himself. He was willing to lie under reproach and to be despised. He regarded little, therefore, their taunts and accusations; and even now, he says, he would not seek to vindicate himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>There is one that seeketh and judgeth - </b>God will take care of my reputation. He seeks my welfare and honor, and I may commit my cause into his hands without attempting my own vindication. From these verses <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:46-50">John 8:46-50</span> we may learn:</p>
<p style=" ">1. That where men have no sound arguments, they attempt to overwhelm their adversaries by calling odious and reproachful names. Accusations of heresy and schism, and the use of reproachful terms, are commonly proof that men are not only under the influence of unchristian feeling, but that they have no sound reasons to support their cause.</p>
<p style=" ">2. It is right to vindicate ourselves from such charges, but it should not be done by rendering railing for railing. “In meekness we should instruct those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">3. We should not regard it as necessarily dishonorable if we lie under reproach. If we have a good conscience, if we have examined for ourselves, if we are conscious that we are seeking the glory of God, we should be willing, as Jesus was, to bear reproach, believing that God will in due time avenge us, and bring forth our righteousness as the light, and our judgment as the noonday, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:6">Psalms 37:6</span>.</p>
