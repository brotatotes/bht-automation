If a man keep my saying - If he believes on me and obeys my commandments.He shall never see death - To see death, or to taste of death, is the same as to die, Luke 2:26; Matthew 16:28; Mark 9:1. The sense of this passage is, “He shall obtain eternal life, or he shall be raised up to that life where there shall be no death.” See John 6:49-50; John 3:36; John 5:24; John 11:25-26.
