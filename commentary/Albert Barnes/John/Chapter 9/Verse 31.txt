Now we know - That is, it is an admitted or conceded point. No one calls it into question.God heareth not - When a miracle was performed it was customary to invoke the aid of God. Jesus often did this himself, and it was by his power only that prophets and apostles could perform miracles. The word “heareth” in this place is to be understood as referring to such cases. God will not hear - that is, answer.Sinners - Impostors. False prophets and pretenders to divine revelation. See John 9:24. The meaning of this verse is, therefore, “It is well understood that God will not give miraculous aid to impostors and false prophets.” We may remark here:A worshipper - A sincere worshipper; one who fears, loves, and adores him.Doeth his will - Obeys his commandments. This is infallibly true. The Scripture abounds with promises to such that God will hear their prayer. See Psalms 34:15; Matthew 7:7-8.
