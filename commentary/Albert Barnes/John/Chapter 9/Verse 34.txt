<p style=" "><b>Wast born in sins - </b>That is, thou wast born in a state of blindness a state which proved that either thou or thy parents had sinned, and that this was the punishment for it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:2">John 9:2</span>. Thou wast cursed by God with blindness for crime, and yet thou dost set up for a religious teacher! When people have no arguments, they attempt to supply their place by revilings. When they are pressed by argument, they reproach their adversaries with crime, and especially with being blind, perverse, heretical, disposed to speculation, and regardless of the authority of God. And especially do they consider it great presumption that one of an inferior age or rank should presume to advance an argument in opposition to prevailing opinions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They cast him out - </b>Out of the synagogue. They excommunicated him. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:22">John 9:22</span>.</p>
