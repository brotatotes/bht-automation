<p style=" "><b>Wash in the pool - </b>In the fountains.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of Siloam - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:4">Luke 13:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By interpretation, Sent - </b>From the Hebrew verb to send perhaps because it was regarded as a blessing sent or given by God. Why Jesus sent him to wash there is not known. It is clear that the waters had no efficacy themselves to open the eyes of a blind man, but it is probable that he directed him to go there to test his obedience, and to see whether he was disposed to obey him in a case where he could not see the reason of it. An instance somewhat similar occurs in the case of Naaman, the Syrian leper, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:10">2 Kings 5:10</span>. The proud Syrian despised the direction; the tremble blind man obeyed and was healed. This case shows us that we should obey the commands of God, however unmeaning or mysterious they may appear. God has always a reason for all that he directs us to do, and our faith and willingness to obey him are often tried when we can see little of the reason of his requirements. In the first edition of these notes it was remarked that the word Siloam is from the same verb as Shiloh in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>. “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah - until Shiloh (that is, the Sent of God: the Messiah) come,” and that John in this remark probably had reference to this prophecy. This was incorrect: and there is no evidence that John in this passage had reference to that prophecy, or that this fountain was emblematic of the Messiah. The original words Siloam and Shiloh are from different roots and mean different things. The former, Siloam <span class="_800000">שׁלח</span> Shiloach, is derived from <span class="_800000">שׁלה</span> shaalach (to send); the latter, Shiloh <span class="_800000">שׁילה</span> Shiyloh, means rest or quiet, and was given to the Messiah, probably, because he would bring rest that is, he would be the “prince of peace.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>.</p>
