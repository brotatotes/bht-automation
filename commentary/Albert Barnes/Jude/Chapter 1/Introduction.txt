<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) The inscription and salutation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:1-2">Jude 1:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) A statement of the reasons why the Epistle was written, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:3-4">Jude 1:3-4</span>. The author felt it to be necessary to write to them, because certain plausible errorists had crept in among them, and there was danger that their faith would be subverted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) A reference to past facts, showing that men who embraced error, and who followed corrupt and licentious practices, would be punished, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:5-7">Jude 1:5-7</span>. He refers particularly to the unbelieving Hebrews whom God had delivered out of Egypt; to the apostate angels; and to the corrupt inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. The object in this is to warn them from following the examples of those who would certainly lead them to destruction.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4) He describes particularly the characteristics of these persons, agreeing substantially in the description with the statement of Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:8-16">Jude 1:8-16</span>. For these characteristics, compare Introduction to 2 Peter, Section 4. In general, they were corrupt, sensual, lewd, proud, arrogant, disorganizing, covetous, murmurers, complainers, wordy, windy, spots in their feasts of love. They had been and were professors of religion; they were professed reformers; they made great pretensions to uncommon knowledge of religious things. In the course of this description, the apostle contrasts their spirit with that of the archangel Michael <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>, and declares that it was with reference to such a class of men that Enoch long ago uttered a solemn prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:14-15">Jude 1:14-15</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5) He calls to their remembrance the fact that it had been predicted that there would be such mockers in the last periods of the world; and the faith of true Christians, therefore, was not to be shaken, but rather confirmed by the fact of their appearance, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:17-19">Jude 1:17-19</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (6) In view of these facts and dangers, the apostle addresses to them two exhortations:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a)To adhere steadfastly to the truths which they had embraced, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:20-21">Jude 1:20-21</span>; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (b)To endeavor to recall and save those who were led astray - carefully guarding themselves from the same contamination while they sought to save others, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:22-23">Jude 1:22-23</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (7) The Epistle closes with an appropriate ascription of praise to him who was able to keep them from falling, and to present them faultless before his throne, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:24-25">Jude 1:24-25</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> <br/><br/> </p>
