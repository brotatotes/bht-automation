<p style=" "><b>To execute judgment upon all - </b>That is, he shall come to judge all the dwellers upon the earth, good and bad.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to convince all - </b>The word “convince we now use commonly in a somewhat limited sense, as meaning “to satisfy” a man’s own mind” either of the truth of some proposition, or of the fact that he has done wrong, as being in this latter sense synonymous with the word “convict.” This “conviction” is commonly produced by argument or truth, and is not necessarily followed by any sentence of disapprobation, or by any judicial condemnation. But this is clearly not the sense in which the word is used here. The purpose of the coming of the Lord will not be to convince men in that sense, though it is undoubtedly true that the wicked will see that their lives have been wrong; but it will be to pronounce a sentence on them as the result of the evidence of their guilt. The Greek word which is here used occurs nowhere else in the New Testament.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All that are ungodly among them - </b>All that are not pious; all that have no religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of all their ungodly deeds ... - </b>Of their wicked actions and words. This is the common doctrine of the Bible, that all the wicked actions and words of men will be called into judgment. In regard to this passage, thus quoted from an ancient prophecy, we may remark:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That the style bears the marks of its being a quotation, or of its being preserved by Jude in the language in which it had been handed down by tradition. It is not the style of Jude. It is not so terse, pointed, energetic.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It has every probable mark of its having been actually delivered by Enoch. The age in which he lived was corrupt. The world was ripening for the deluge. He was himself a good man, and, as would seem perhaps, almost the only good man of his generation. Nothing would be more natural than that he should be reproached by hard words and speeches, and nothing more natural than that he should have pointed the men of his own age to the future judgment.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The doctrine of the final judgment, if this was uttered by Enoch, was an early doctrine in the world. It was held even in the first generations of the race. It was one of those great truths early communicated to man to restrain him from sin, and to lead him to prepare for the great events which are to occur on the earth. The same doctrine has been transmitted from age to age, and is now one of the most important and the most affecting that refers to the final destiny of men.</p>
