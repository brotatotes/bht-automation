<p style=" "><b>Keep yourselves in the love of God - </b>Still adverting to their own agency. On the duty here enjoined, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:9">John 15:9</span>. The phrase “the love of God” may mean either God’s love to us, or our love to him. The latter appears, however, to be the sense here, because it is not a subject which could be enjoined, that we should keep up “God’s love to us.” That is a point over which we can have no control, except so far as it may be the result of our obedience; but we may be commanded to love him, and to “keep” ourselves in that love.</p>
