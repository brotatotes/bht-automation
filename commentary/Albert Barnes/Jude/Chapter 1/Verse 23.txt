<p style=" "><b>And others - </b>Another class; those who were of such a character, or in such circumstances, that a more bold, earnest, and determined manner would be better adapted to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Save with fear - </b>That is, by appeals adapted to produce fear. The idea seems to be that the arguments on which they relied were to be drawn from the dangers of the persons referred to, or from the dread of future wrath. It is undoubtedly true, that while there is a class of persons who can be won to embrace religion by mild and gentle persuasion, there is another class who can be aroused only by the terrors of the law. Every method is to be employed, in its proper place, that we “by all means may save some.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Pulling them out of the fire - </b>As you would snatch persons out of the fire; or as you would seize on a person that was walking into a volcano. Then, a man would not use the mild and gentle language of persuasion, but by word and gesture show that he was deeply in earnest.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh - </b>The allusion here is not quite certain, though the idea which the apostle meant to convey is not difficult to be understood. By “the garment spotted by the flesh” there may be an allusion to a garment worn by one who had had the plague, or some offensive disease which might be communicated to others by touching even the clothing which they had worn. Or there may be an allusion to the ceremonial law of Moses, by which all those who came in contact with dead bodies were regarded as unclean, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+21:11">Leviticus 21:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:6">Numbers 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+9:6">Numbers 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:11">Numbers 19:11</span>. Or there may be an allusion to the case mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+15:4">Leviticus 15:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+15:10">Leviticus 15:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+15:17">Leviticus 15:17</span>; or perhaps to a case of leprosy. In all such instances, there would be the idea that the thing referred to by which the garment had been spotted was polluting, contagious, or loathsome, and that it was proper not even to touch such a garment, or to come in contact with it in any way. To something of this kind the apostle compares the sins of the persons here referred to. While the utmost effort was to be made to save them, they were in no way to partake of their sins; their conduct was to be regarded as loathsome and contagious; and those who attempted to save them were to take every precaution to preserve their own purity. There is much wisdom in this counsel. While we endeavor to save the “sinner,” we cannot too deeply loathe his “sins;” and in approaching some classes of sinners there is need of as much care to avoid being defiled by them, as there would be to escape the plague if we had any transaction with one who had it. Not a few have been deeply corrupted in their attempts to reform the polluted. There never could be, for example, too much circumspection and prayer for personal safety from pollution, in attempting to reform licentious and abandoned females.</p>
