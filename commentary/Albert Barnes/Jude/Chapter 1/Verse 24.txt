<p style=" "><b>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling - </b>This ascription to one who was able to keep them from falling is made in view of the facts adverted to in the Epistle - the dangers of being led away by the arts and the example of these teachers of error. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:3">Jude 1:3</span>. On the ascription itself, compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25-27">Romans 16:25-27</span>. The phrase “to keep from falling” means here to preserve from falling into sin, from yielding to temptation, and dishonoring their religion. The word used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀπταιστους</span></span> aptaistous) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means properly, “not stumbling” as of a horse; then “without falling into sin, blameless.” It is God only who, amidst the temptations of the world, can keep us from falling; but, blessed be his name, he can do it, and if we trust in him he will.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to present you faultless - </b>The word here rendered “faultless” is the same which is rendered “unblamable” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>. See the sentiment here expressed explained in the notes at that passage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before the presence of his glory - </b>In his own glorious presence; before himself encompassed with glory in heaven. The saints are to be presented there as redeemed and sanctified, and as made worthy by grace to dwell there forever.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With exceeding joy - </b>With the abounding joy that they are redeemed; that they are rescued from sorrow, sin, and death, and that heaven is to be their eternal home. Who now can form an adequate idea of the happiness of that hour?</p>
