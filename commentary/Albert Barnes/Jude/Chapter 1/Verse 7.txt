<p style=" "><b>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha - </b>Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the cities about them - </b>Admah and Zeboim, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:2">Genesis 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+29:23">Deuteronomy 29:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+11:8">Hosea 11:8</span>. There may have been other towns, also, that perished at the same time, but these are particularly mentioned. They seem to have partaken of the same general characteristics, as neighboring towns and cities generally do.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In like manner - </b>“In a manner like to these,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὸν ὅμοιον τούτοις τρόπον</span></span> ton homoion toutois tropon.) The Greek word “these,” is in the plural number. There has been much diversity in interpreting this clause. Some refer it to the angels, as if it meant that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah committed sin in a way similar to the angels; some suppose that it refers to the wicked teachers about whom Jude was discoursing, meaning that Sodom and Gomorrah committed the same kind of sins which they did; some that the meaning is, that “the cities round about Sodom and Gomorrah” sinned in the same way as those cities; and some that they were punished in the same manner, and were set forth like them as an example. I see no evidence that it refers to the angels, and if it did, it would not prove, as some have supposed, that their sin was of the same kind as that of Sodom, since there might have been a resemblance in some respects, though not in all. I see no reason to believe, as Macknight holds, that it refers to “false teachers,” since that would be to suppose that the inhabitants of Sodom copied their example long “before” the example was set. It seems to me, therefore, that the reference is to the cities round about Sodom; and that the sense is, that they committed iniquity in the same manner as the inhabitants of Sodom did, and were set forth in the same way as an example.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Going after strange flesh - </b>Margin: “other.” The reference seems to be to the unusual sin which, from the name Sodom, has been called “sodomy.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:27">Romans 1:27</span>. The meaning of the phrase “going after” is, that they were greatly addicted to this vice. The word “strange, or other,” refers to that which is contrary to nature. Doddridge, however, explains it, “going after strange and detestable gratifications of their pampered and indulged flesh.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are set forth for an example - </b>They furnish a warning against all such conduct, and a demonstration that punishment shall come upon the ungodly. The condemnation of any sinner, or of any class of sinners, always furnishes such a warning. See the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire - </b>The word rendered “suffering” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὑπέχουσαι</span></span> hupechousai) means, properly, “holding under” - as, for example, the hand; then to hold toward any one, as the ear - to give attention; then it is used as denoting to hold a discourse toward or with any one, or to hold satisfaction to any one, to make atonement; and then as “undergoing, paying, or suffering punishment,” when united, as it is here, with the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δίκην</span></span> dikēn (punishment, or vengeance). See “Rob. Lex.” Here it expresses the idea of undergoing punishment. The word properly agrees in the construction with “cities,” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πόλεις</span></span> poleis,) referring to Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them; but the things affirmed relate to the “inhabitants” of those cities. The word “vengeance” means punishment; that is, such vengeance as the Lord takes on the guilty; not vengeance for the gratification of private and personal feeling, but like that which a magistrate appoints for the maintenance of the laws; such as justice demands. The phrase “eternal fire” is one that is often used to denote future punishment - as expressing the severity and intensity of the suffering. See the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>. As here used, it cannot mean that the fires which consumed Sodom and Gomorrah were literally eternal, or were kept always burning, for that was not true. The expression seems to denote, in this connection, two things:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That, in its nature and duration, this was a striking emblem of the destruction which will come upon the ungodly. I do not see that the apostle here means to affirm that those particular sinners who dwelt in Sodom would be punished forever, for his expressions do not directly affirm that, and his argument does not demand it; but still the “image” in his mind, in the destruction of those cities, was clearly that of the utter desolation and ruin of which this was the emblem; of the perpetual destruction of the wicked, like that of the cities of the plain. If this had not been the case, there was no reason why he should have used the word “eternal” - meaning here “perpetual” - since, if in his mind there was no image of future punishment, all that the argument would have demanded was the simple statement that they were cut off by fire.</p>
<p style=" ">The passage, then, cannot be used to prove that the particular dwellers in Sodom will be punished forever - whatever may be the truth on that point; but that there is a place of eternal punishment, of which that was a striking emblem. The meaning is, that the case was one which furnished a demonstration of the fact that God will punish sin; that this was an example of the punishment which God sometimes inflicts on sinners in this world, and a type of that eternal punishment which will be inflicted in the next.</p>
