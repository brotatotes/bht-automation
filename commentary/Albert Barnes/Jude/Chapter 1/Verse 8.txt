<p style=" "><b>Likewise also - </b>In the same way do these persons defile the flesh, or resemble the inhabitants of Sodom; that is, they practice the same kind of vices. What the apostle says is, that their character resembled that of the inhabitants of Sodom; the example which he adduces of the punishment which was brought on those sinners, leaves it to be clearly inferred that the persons of whom he was speaking would be punished in a similar manner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>These filthy dreamers - </b>The word “filthy” has been supplied by our translators, but there is no good reason why it should have been introduced. The Greek word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐνυπνιάζω</span></span> enupniazō) means to dream; and is applied to these persons as holding doctrines and opinions which sustained the same relation to truth which dreams do to good sense. Their doctrines were the fruits of mere imagination, foolish vagaries and fancies. The word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>, where it is applied to visions in dreams.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Defile the flesh - </b>Pollute themselves; give indulgence to corrupt passions and appetites. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Despise dominion - </b>The same Greek word is used here which occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>. See the notes at that verse.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And speak evil of dignities - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>.</p>
