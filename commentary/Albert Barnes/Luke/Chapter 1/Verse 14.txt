<p style=" "><b>Many shall rejoice at his birth - </b>This does not refer so much to the time of his birth as to the subsequent rejoicing. Such will be his “character,” that he will be an honor to the family, and many will rejoice that he lived: or, in other words, he will be a blessing to mankind.</p>
