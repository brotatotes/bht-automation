<p style=" "><b>Shall be great - </b>Shall be eminent, or distinguished as a preacher.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the sight of the Lord - </b>Greek, “before the Lord.” That is, shall be “really” or “truly” great. God shall regard him as such.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall drink neither wine - </b>The kind of wine commonly used in Judea was a light wine, often not stronger than cider in this country. It was the common drink of all classes of the people. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>.
