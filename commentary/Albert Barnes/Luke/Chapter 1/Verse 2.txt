<p style=" "><b>As they delivered them - </b>As they narrated them. As they gave an account of them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From the beginning - </b>From the commencement of these things - that is, from the birth of John, or perhaps from the beginning of the ministry of Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Eye-witnesses - </b>Who had seen those things themselves, and who were therefore proper witnesses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ministers of the word - </b>The term “word” here means the “gospel.” Luke never uses it, as John does, to denote the second Person of the Trinity. These eye-witnesses and ministers refer, doubtless, to the seventy disciples, to the apostles, and perhaps to other preachers who had gone forth to proclaim the same things.</p>
