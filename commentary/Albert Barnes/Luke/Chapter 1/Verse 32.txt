<p style=" "><b>He shall be great - </b>There is undoubted reference in this passage to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6-7">Isaiah 9:6-7</span>. By his being “great” is meant he shall be distinguished or illustrious; great in power, in wisdom, in dominion on earth and in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be called - </b>This is the same as to say he “shall be” the Son, etc. The Hebrews often used this form of speech. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:13">Matthew 21:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Highest - </b>God, who is infinitely exalted; called the Highest, because He is exalted over all his creatures on earth and in heaven. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:7">Mark 5:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The throne - </b>The kingdom; or shall appoint him as the lineal successor of David in the kingdom.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His father David - </b>David is called his father because Jesus was lineally descended from him. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. The promise to David was, that there should “not fail” a man to sit on his throne, or that his throne should be perpetual <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ki 2:4</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:25">1 Kings 8:25</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ki 9:5</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+6:16">2 Chronicles 6:16</span>, and the promise was fulfilled by exalting Jesus to be a Prince and a Saviour, and the perpetual King of his people.</p>
