<p style=" "><b>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The power of the Highest ... - </b>This evidently means that the body of Jesus would be created by the direct power of God. It was not by ordinary generation; but, as the Messiah came to redeem sinners - to make atonement for “others,” and not for himself it was necessary that his human nature should be pure, and free from the corruption of the fall. God therefore prepared him a body by direct creation that should be pure and holy. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That holy thing ... - </b>That holy progeny or child.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be called the Son of God - </b>This is spoken in reference to the human nature of Christ, and this passage proves, beyond controversy, that “one” reason why Jesus was called the Son of God was because he was begotten in a supernatural manner. He is also called the “Son of God” on account of his resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>, compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>.</p>
