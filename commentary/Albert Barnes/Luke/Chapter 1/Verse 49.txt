He that is mighty - God.Hath done to me great things - Hath conferred on me great favors and distinguished mercies.And holy is his name - This is an expression of Mary’s feelings, desiring to bestow on God all honor and praise. As the highest honor, she declared that his “name” was “holy” - that is, that God was free from sin, injustice, and impurity. The “name” of God is often put for God Himself. The proper name of God is יהוה Yahweh, a word expressive of His “essential being,” derived from the word “to be,” Exodus 3:14; Exodus 6:3; Psalms 83:18. That name is holy; is to be regarded as holy; and to make a common or profane use of it is solemnly forbidden, Exodus 20:7.
