<p style=" "><b>He that is mighty - </b>God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath done to me great things - </b>Hath conferred on me great favors and distinguished mercies.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And holy is his name - </b>This is an expression of Mary’s feelings, desiring to bestow on God all honor and praise. As the highest honor, she declared that his “name” was “holy” - that is, that God was free from sin, injustice, and impurity. The “name” of God is often put for God Himself. The proper name of God is <span class="_800000">יהוה</span> Yahweh, a word expressive of His “essential being,” derived from the word “to be,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:14">Exodus 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:3">Exodus 6:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+83:18">Psalms 83:18</span>. That name is holy; is to be regarded as holy; and to make a common or profane use of it is solemnly forbidden, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:7">Exodus 20:7</span>.</p>
