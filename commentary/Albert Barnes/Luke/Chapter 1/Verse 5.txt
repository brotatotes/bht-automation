<p style=" "><b>Of the course of Abia - </b>When the priests became so numerous that they could not at once minister at the altar, David divided them into 24 classes or courses, each one of which officiated for a week, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+24:0">1 Chronicles 24:0</span>. The class or course (shift) of Abia was the “eighth” in order, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+24:10">1 Chronicles 24:10</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+8:14">2 Chronicles 8:14</span>. The word “course” means the same as “class,” or order. The Greek-based word “Abia” is the same as the Hebrew-based word “Abijah.”</p>

Our Saviour was not on either side. John would have been legally entitled to a place among the priests; our Saviour, being of the tribe of Judah, would not.</p>
