<p style=" "><b>He hath filled the hungry with good things - </b>This is a celebration of the general mercy of God. He hath daily fed the poor, the needy, and those who came to Him with humble hearts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The rich he hath sent ... - </b>While the poor come to him for a supply of their daily wants, the rich come not that their necessities should be supplied, but come with lofty hearts, and insatiable desires that their riches may be increased. When this is the case, God not unfrequently not only “withholds” what they ask, but he takes their riches away by fire, or flood, or disappointments, and sends them away empty, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+23:5">Proverbs 23:5</span>. It is better to be poor and go to God for our daily bread, than to be rich and forget our dependence on Him, and to seek only a great increase of our property.</p>
