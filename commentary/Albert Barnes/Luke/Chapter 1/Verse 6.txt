Both righteous - Both “just” or holy. This means here more than external conformity to the law. It is an honorable testimonial of their “piety” toward God.Walking in ... - Keeping the commandments. To walk in the way that God commands is “to obey.”Ordinances - Rites and customs which God had ordained or appointed. These words refer to all the duties of religion which were made known to them.Blameless - That is, no fault or deficiency could be found in them. They were strict, exact, punctual. Yet this, if it had been mere “external” observance, might have been no proof of piety. Paul, before his conversion, also kept the law “externally” blameless, Philippians 3:6. But in the case of Zechariah and Elizabeth it was real love to God and sincere regard for his law.
