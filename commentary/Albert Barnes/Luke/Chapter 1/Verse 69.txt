<p style=" "><b>And hath raised up a horn - </b>A horn is a symbol of strength. The figure is taken from the fact that in horned animals the strength lies in the “horn.” Particularly, the great power of the rhinoceros or unicorn is manifested by the use of a single horn of great “strength,” placed on the head near the end of the nose. When the sacred writers, therefore, speak of great strength they often use the word “horn,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+148:14">Psalms 148:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:17">Deuteronomy 33:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:7-8">Daniel 7:7-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:21">Daniel 7:21</span>. The word salvation, connected here with the word “horn,” means that this “strength,” or this mighty Redeemer, was able to save. It is possible that this whole figure may be taken from the Jewish “altar.” On each of the four corners of the altar there was an eminence or small projection called a “horn.” To this persons might flee for safety when in danger, and be safe, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+1:50">1 Kings 1:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:28">1 Kings 2:28</span>. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:11">Luke 1:11</span>. So the Redeemer “may be” called the “horn of salvation,” because those who flee to him are safe.</p>
