<p style=" "><b>His holy prophets ... - </b>All the prophets are said to have referred to the Messiah, from the beginning of the world. The most striking of these were Jacob <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>; Moses <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>; Isaiah <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6-7">Isaiah 9:6-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1-12">Isaiah 53:1-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Since the world began - </b>This is not to be taken literally, for there were no prophets “immediately after” the creation. It is merely a general expression, designed to denote that all the prophets had predicted the coming of the Messiah. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:27">Luke 24:27</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span> note.</p>
