<p style=" "><b>In holiness ... - </b>In piety and strict justice.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before him - </b>In the presence of God. Performed as in his presence, and with the full consciousness that he sees the heart. The “holiness” was not to be merely external, but spiritual, internal, pure, such as “God” would see and approve.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All the days of our life - </b>To death. True religion increases and expands until death.</p>
