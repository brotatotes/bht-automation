<p style=" "><b>Whereby the dayspring ... - </b>The word “dayspring” means the morning light, the aurora, the rising of the sun. It is called the dayspring “from on high” because the light of the gospel shines forth from heaven. God is its Author, and through His mercy it shines upon people. There is here, doubtless, a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1-2">Isaiah 60:1-2</span>; indeed, almost the very words of that place are quoted. Compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>.</p>
