<p style=" "><b>According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was. - </b>The Jewish writers inform us that it was customary for the priests to divide their daily task by “lot.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>To burn incense - </b>Incense is an aromatic or white rosin procured from trees, chiefly in Arabia. It is obtained by making incisions in the tree, and the gum flows out. It is distinguished for an especially pleasant “smell” when burned, and was therefore used in ancient worship. It was burned by the priest twice a day <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:7">Exodus 30:7</span>, and it seems to have been emblematic of prayer and praise, or of the grateful offerings of the heart wafted toward heaven. The incense used in the temple was made of stacte, onycha, and galbanum <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:34">Exodus 30:34</span>, with pure frankincense, and it was not lawful for this compound to be used elsewhere than in the house of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into the temple - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>. The part of the temple where incense was burned was the “holy place.”</p>
