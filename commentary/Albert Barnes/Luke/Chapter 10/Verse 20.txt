<p style=" "><b>Rather rejoice ... - </b>Though it was an honor to work miracles, though it is an honor to be endowed with talents, and influence, and learning, yet it is a subject of “chief” joy that we are numbered among the people of God, and have a title to everlasting life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Names are written in heaven - </b>The names of citizens of a city or state were accustomed to be written in a book or register, from which they were blotted out when they became unworthy, or forfeited the favor of their country. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:28">Psalms 69:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:32">Exodus 32:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+9:14">Deuteronomy 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>. That their “names were written in heaven,” means that they were “citizens” of heaven; that they were friends of God and “approved” by him, and would be permitted to dwell with him. This was of far more value than all “earthly” honor, power, or wealth, and “in” this people should rejoice more than in eminent endowments of influence, learning, talents, or possessions.</p>
