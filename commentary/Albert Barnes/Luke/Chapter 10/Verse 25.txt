<p style=" "><b>Stood up - </b>Rose - came forward to address him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Tempted him - </b>Feigned a desire to be instructed, but did it to perplex him, or to lead him, if possible, to contradict some of the maxims of the law.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Inherit eternal life - </b>Be saved. This was the common inquiry among the Jews. “They” had said that man must keep the commandments - the written and oral law.</p>
