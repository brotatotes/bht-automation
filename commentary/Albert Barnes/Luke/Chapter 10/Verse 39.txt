Sat at Jesus’ feet - This was the ancient posture of disciples or learners. They sat at the “feet” of their teachers - that is, beneath them, in a humble place. Hence, Paul is represented as having been brought up at the “feet” of Gamaliel, Acts 22:3. When it is said that Mary sat at Jesus’ feet, it means that she was “a disciple” of his; that she listened attentively to his instructions, and was anxious to learn his doctrine.
