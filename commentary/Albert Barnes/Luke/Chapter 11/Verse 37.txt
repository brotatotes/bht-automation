And as he spake - While he was addressing the people, and particularly while he was reproving that generation and declaring its crimes.A certain Pharisee - The Pharisees had been particularly referred to in the discourse of the Saviour recorded in the previous verses. This one, perhaps, having felt particularly the force of the remarks of Jesus, and being desirous of being alone with him, invited him to go home with him. There is little doubt that this was for the purpose of drawing him away from the people; that he did it with a malignant intention, perhaps with a design to confute Jesus in private, or to reprove him for thus condemning the whole nation as he did. He might have seen that those who attacked Jesus “publicly” were commonly unsuccessful, and he desired. probably, to encounter him more privately.Besought him - Asked him.To dine with him - The Jews, as well as the Greeks and Romans, had but two principal meals. The first was a slight repast, and was taken about ten or eleven o’clock of our time, and consisted chiefly of fruit, milk, cheese, etc. The second meal was partaken of about three o’clock P. M., and was their principal meal. The “first” is the one here intended.He went in - Though he knew the evil design of the Pharisee, yet he did not decline the invitation. He knew that it might afford him an opportunity to do good. These two things are to be observed in regard to our Saviour’s conduct in such matters:Sat down - Reclined at the table. See the notes at Matthew 23:6.
