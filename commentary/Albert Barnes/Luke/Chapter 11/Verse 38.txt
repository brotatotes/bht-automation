<p style=" "><b>Saw it - </b>Saw that he sat immediately down without washing.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Marvelled - </b>Wondered. Was amazed. It was so unusual, and in his view so improper.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had not first washed - </b>He wondered particularly, as he had been among a mixed multitude, and they esteemed the “touch” of such persons polluting. They never ate, therefore, without such washing. The origin of the custom of washing with so much formality “before” they partook of their meals was that they did not use, as we do, knives and forks, but used their hands only. Hence, as their hands would be often in a dish on the table, it was esteemed proper that they should be washed clean before eating. Nor was their impropriety in the thing itself, but the Pharisees made it a matter of ceremony; they placed no small part of their religion in such ceremonies; and it was right, therefore, that our Lord should take occasion to reprove them for it.
