<p style=" "><b>Ye fools - </b>How unwise and wicked is your conduct! The word denotes not only “want of wisdom,” but also wickedness. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1">Psalms 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:19">Proverbs 13:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+14:9">Proverbs 14:9</span>. Your conduct is not merely “foolish,” but it is a cloak for sin - designed to countenance wickedness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Did not he ... - </b>Did not God, who made the “body,” make also the “soul?” You Pharisees take great pains to cleanse the “body,” under a pretence of pleasing “God.” Did “he”” not also make the “mind?” and is it not of as much importance that “that” should be pure, as that the body should?</p>
