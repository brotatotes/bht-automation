Ye fools - How unwise and wicked is your conduct! The word denotes not only “want of wisdom,” but also wickedness. Compare Psalms 14:1; Proverbs 13:19; Proverbs 14:9. Your conduct is not merely “foolish,” but it is a cloak for sin - designed to countenance wickedness.Did not he ... - Did not God, who made the “body,” make also the “soul?” You Pharisees take great pains to cleanse the “body,” under a pretence of pleasing “God.” Did “he”” not also make the “mind?” and is it not of as much importance that “that” should be pure, as that the body should?
