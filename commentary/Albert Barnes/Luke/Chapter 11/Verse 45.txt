Lawyers - Men learned in the law; but it is not known in what way the lawyers differed from the “scribes,” or whether they were Pharisees or Sadducees.Thus saying, thou ... - He felt that the remarks of Jesus about loving the chief seats, etc., applied to them as well as to the Pharisees. His conscience told him that if “they” were to blame, “he” was also, and he therefore applied the discourse to himself.Reproachest - Accusest. Dost calumniate or blame us, for we do the same things. Sinners often consider “faithfulness” as “reproach” - they know not how to separate them. Jesus did “not” reproach or abuse them. He dealt faithfully with them; reproved them; told them the unvarnished truth. Such faithfulness is rare; but when it “is” used, we must expect that people will flinch, perhaps be enraged. Though their consciences tell them they are “guilty,” still they will consider it as abuse.
