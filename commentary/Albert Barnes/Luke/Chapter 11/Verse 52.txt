<p style=" "><b>Woe unto you, lawyers! - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The key of knowledge - </b>A key is made to open a lock or door. By their false interpretation of the Old Testament they had taken away the true key or method of understanding it. They had hindered the people from understanding it aright. “You endeavor to prevent the people also from understanding the Scriptures respecting the Messiah, and those who were coming to “me” ye hindered.” If there is any sin of special magnitude, it is that of keeping the people in ignorance; and few people are so guilty as they who by false instructions prevent them from coming to a knowledge of the truth, and embracing it as it is in Jesus.</p>
