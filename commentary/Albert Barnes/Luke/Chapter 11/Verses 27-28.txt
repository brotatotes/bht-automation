<p style=" "><b>A certain woman - </b>One of the crowd.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Blessed is the womb ... - </b>She thought that the “mother” of such a person must be especially happy in having such a son.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yea, rather blessed ... - </b>Jesus admits that she was happy - that it was an honor to be his mother, but he says that the chief happiness, the highest honor, was to obey the word of God. Compared with this, all earthly distinctions and honors are as nothing. Man’s greatest dignity is in keeping the holy commandments of God, and in being prepared for heaven.
