<p style=" ">“A scorpion” See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:19">Luke 10:19</span>. Dr. Thomson (<i>The Land and the Book</i>, vol. i. p. 379) says: “There is no imaginable likeness between an egg and the ordinary black scorpion of this country, neither in color nor size, nor, when the tail is extended, in shape; but old writers speak of a “white” scorpion, and such a one, with the tail folded up, as in specimens of fossil trilobites, would not look unlike a small egg. Perhaps the contrast, however, refers only to the different properties of the egg and the scorpion, which is sufficiently emphatic.”</p>
<p style=" ">Pliny (“N. H.,” xi. 25) says that in Judea the scorpions are about the size of an egg, and not unlike one in shape.</p>
