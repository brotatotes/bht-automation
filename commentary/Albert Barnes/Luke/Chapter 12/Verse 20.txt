<p style=" "><b>Thou fool - </b>If there is any supreme folly, it is this. As though riches could prolong life, or avert for a moment the approach of pain and death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>This night ... - </b>What an awful sentence to a man who, as he thought, had got just ready to live and enjoy himself! In a single moment all his hopes were blasted, and his soul summoned to the bar of his long-forgotten God. So, many are surprised as suddenly and as unprepared. They are snatched from their pleasures, and hurried to a world where there is no pleasure, and where all their wealth cannot purchase one moment’s ease from the gnawings of the worm that never dies.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be required of thee - </b>Thou shalt be required to die, to go to God, and to give up your account.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Then whose ... - </b>Whose they may be is of little consequence to the man that lost his soul to gain them; but they are often left to heirs that dissipate them much sooner than the father procured them, and thus they secure “their” ruin as well as his own.
