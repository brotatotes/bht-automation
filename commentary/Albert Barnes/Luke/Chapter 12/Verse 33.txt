<p style=" "><b>Bags which wax not old - </b>The word “bags,” here, means “purses,” or the bags attached to their girdles, in which they carried their money. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:38">Matthew 5:38</span>. By bags which wax not old Jesus means that we should lay up treasure in heaven; that our aim should be to be prepared to enter there, where all our wants will be forever provided for. Purses, here, grow old and useless. Wealth takes to itself wings. Riches are easily scattered, or we must soon leave them; but that wealth which is in heaven abides forever. It never is corrupted; never flies away; never is to be left.</p>
