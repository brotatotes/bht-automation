<p style=" "><b>Few stripes - </b>The Jews never inflicted more than forty stripes for one offence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+25:3">Deuteronomy 25:3</span>. For smaller offences they inflicted only four, five, six, etc., according to the nature of the crime. In allusion to this, our Lord says that he “that knew not” - that is, he who had comparatively little knowledge - would suffer a punishment proportionally light. He refers, doubtless, to those who have fewer opportunities, smaller gifts, or fewer teachers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Much is given - </b>They who have much committed to their disposal, as stewards, etc. See the parable of the talents in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:14-30">Matthew 25:14-30</span>.</p>
