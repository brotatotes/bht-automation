<p style=" "><b>Thou hypocrite! - </b>You condemn “me” for an action, and yet you perform one exactly similar. You condemn “me” for doing to a woman what you do to a beast. To her I have done good on the Sabbath; you provide for your cattle, and yet blame me for working a miracle to relieve a sufferer on that day.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Stall - </b>A place where cattle are kept to be fed, and sheltered from the weather.</p>
