Cities and villages - Chiefly of Galilee, and those which were between Galilee and Jerusalem.Teaching and journeying - This evinces the diligence of our Lord. Though on a journey, yet he remembered his work. He did not excuse himself on the plea that he was in haste. Christians and Christian ministers should remember that when their Master traveled he did not “conceal” his character, or think that he was then freed from obligation to do good.
