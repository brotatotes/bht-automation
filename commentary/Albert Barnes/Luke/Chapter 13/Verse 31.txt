<p style=" "><b>Came certain of thee Pharisees - </b>Their coming to him in this manner would have the appearance of friendship, as if they had conjectured or secretly learned that it was Herodâ€™s intention to kill him. Their suggestion had much appearance of probability. Herod had killed John. He knew that Jesus made many disciples, and was drawing away many of the people. He was a wicked man, and he might be supposed to fear the presence of one who had so strong a resemblance to John, whom he had slain. It might seem probable, therefore, that he intended to take the life of Jesus, and this might appear as a friendly hint to escape him. Yet it is more than possible that Herod might have sent these Pharisees to Jesus. Jesus was eminently popular, and Herod might not dare openly to put him to death; yet he desired his removal, and for this purpose he sent these people, as if in a friendly way, to advise him to retire. This was probably the reason why Jesus called him a fox.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Herod - </b>Herod Antipas, a son of Herod the Great. He ruled over Galilee and Perea, and wished Jesus to retire beyond these regions. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1">Luke 3:1</span>.</p>
