<p style=" "><b>Or those eighteen - </b>Jesus himself adds another similar case, to warn them - a case which had probably occurred not long before, and which it is likely they judged in the same manner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Upon whom the tower in Siloam fell - </b>The name Siloah or Siloam is found only three times in the Bible as applied to water - once in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:6">Isaiah 8:6</span>, who speaks of it as running water; once as a pool near to the king’s garden in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ne+3:15">Nehemiah 3:15</span>; and once as a pool, in the account of the Saviour’s healing the man born blind, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:7-11">John 9:7-11</span>. Josephus mentions the fountain of Siloam frequently as situated at the mouth of the Valley of Tyropoeon, or the Valley of Cheesemongers, where the fountain long indicated as that fountain is still found. It is on the south side of Mount Moriah, and between that and the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The water at present flows out of a small artificial basin under the cliff, and is received into a large reservoir 53 feet in length by 18 feet in breadth. The small upper basin or fountain excavated in the rock is merely the entrance, or rather the termination of a long and narrow subterranean passage beyond, by which the water comes from the Fountain of the Virgin. For what purpose the “tower” here referred to was erected is not known; nor is it known at what time the event here referred to occurred. It is probable that it was not far from the time when the Saviour made use of the illustration, for the manner in which he refers to it implies that it was fresh in the recollection of those to whom he spoke.</p>
