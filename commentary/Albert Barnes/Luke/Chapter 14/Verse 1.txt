<p style=" "><b>It came to pass - </b>It so happened or occurred.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As he went ... - </b>It is probable that he was invited to go, being in the neighborhood <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:12">Luke 14:12</span>; and it is also probable that the Pharisee invited him for the purpose of getting him to say something that would involve him in difficulty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>One of the chief Pharisees - </b>One of the Pharisees who were “rulers,” or members of the great council or the Sanhedrin. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>. It does not mean that he was the head of the “sect” of the Pharisees, but one of those who happened to be a member of the Sanhedrin. He was, therefore, a man of influence and reputation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To eat bread - </b>To dine. To partake of the hospitalities of his house.</p>
<p style=" "><b>On the sabbath-day - </b>It may seem strange that our Saviour should have gone to dine with a man who was a stranger on the Sabbath; but we are to remember:</p>
<p style=" ">If, therefore, the example of Jesus should be pled to authorize accepting an invitation to dine on the Sabbath, it should be pled just as it was. If we can go “just as he did,” it is right. If when away from home; if we go to do good; if we make it an occasion to discourse on the subject of religion and to persuade people to repent, then it is not improper. Farther than this we cannot plead the example of Christ. And surely this should be the last instance in the world to be adduced to justify dinner-parties, and scenes of riot and gluttony on the Sabbath.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They watched him - </b>They malignantly fixed their eyes on him, to see if he did anything on which they could lay hold to accuse him.</p>
