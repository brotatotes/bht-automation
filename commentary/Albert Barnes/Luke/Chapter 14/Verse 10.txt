<p style=" "><b>The lowest room - </b>The lowest seat at the table; showing that you are not desirous of distinctions, or greedy of that honor which may properly belong to you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shalt have worship - </b>The word “worship” here means “honor.” They who are sitting with you shall treat you with respect. They will learn your rank by your being invited nearer to the head of the table, and it will be better to learn it thus than by putting yourself forward. They will do you honor because you have shown a humble spirit.</p>
