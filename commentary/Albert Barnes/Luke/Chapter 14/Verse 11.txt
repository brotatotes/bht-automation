Whosoever exalteth ... - This is universal among people, and it is also the way in which God will deal with people. “Men” will perpetually endeavor to bring down those who endeavor to exalt themselves; and it is a part of God’s regular plan to abase the proud, to bring down the lofty, to raise up those that be bowed down, and show “his” favors to those who are poor and needy.
