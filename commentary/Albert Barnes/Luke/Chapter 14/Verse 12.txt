<p style=" "><b>Call not thy friends ... - </b>This is not to be understood as commanding us not to entertain “at all” our relatives and friends; but we are to remember the “design” with which our Lord spoke. He intended, doubtless, to reprove those who sought the society of the wealthy, and particularly rich relatives, and those who claimed to be intimate with the great and honorable, and who, to show their intimacy, were in the habit of “seeking” their society, and making for them expensive entertainments. He meant, also, to commend charity shown to the poor. The passage means, therefore, call “not only” your friends, but call also the poor, etc. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:8">Exodus 16:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:22">1 Samuel 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:22-23">Jeremiah 7:22-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>.</p>
