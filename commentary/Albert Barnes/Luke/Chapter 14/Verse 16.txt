<p style=" "><b>A great supper - </b>Or great feast. It is said to be “great” on account of the number who were invited.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Bade many - </b>Invited many beforehand. There is little difficulty in understanding this parable. The man who made the supper is, without doubt, designed to represent God; the supper, the provisions which he has made for the salvation of people; and the invitation, the offers which he made to people, particularly to the Jews, of salvation. See a similar parable explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:1-14">Matthew 22:1-14</span>.</p>
