<p style=" "><b>For I say unto you - </b>These may be considered as the words of Jesus, making an application of the parable to the Pharisees before him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>None of those men - </b>This cannot be understood as meaning that no “Jews” would be saved, but that none of those who had “treated him, in that manner” - none who had so decidedly rejected the offer of the gospel - would be saved. We may here see how dangerous it is “once” to reject the gospel; how dangerous to grieve away the Holy Spirit. How often God forsakes forever the sinner who has been once awakened, and who grieves the Holy Spirit. The invitation is full and free; but when it is rejected, and people turn willfully away from it, God leaves them to their chosen way, and they are drowned in destruction and perdition. How important, then, is it to embrace the gospel “at once;” to accept the gracious invitation, and enter without delay the path that conducts to heaven!</p>
