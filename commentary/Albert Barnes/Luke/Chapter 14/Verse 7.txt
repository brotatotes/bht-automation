<p style=" "><b>A parable - </b>The word parable, here, means rather a “precept, an injunction.” He gave a “rule or precept” about the proper manner of attending a feast, or about the humility which ought to be manifested on such occasions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That were bidden - </b>That were invited by the Pharisee. It seems that he had invited his friends to dine with him on that day.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When he marked - </b>When he observed or saw.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Chief rooms - </b>The word “rooms” here does not express the meaning of the original. It does not mean “apartments,” but “the higher places” at the table; those which were nearest the head of the table and to him who had invited them. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span>. That this was the common character of the Pharisees appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span>.</p>
