<p style=" "><b>Gathered all together - </b>Collected his property. If he had received flocks or grain, he sold them and converted them into money. As soon as this arrangement had been made he left his father’s house.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Took his journey - </b>Went, or traveled.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into a far country - </b>A country far off from his father’s house. He went probably to trade or to seek his fortune, and in his wanderings came at last to this dissipated place, where his property was soon expended.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Wasted his substance - </b>Spent his property.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In riotous living - </b>Literally, “Living without saving anything.” He lived extravagantly, and in the most dissolute company. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:30">Luke 15:30</span>. By his wandering away we may understand that sinners wander far away from God; that they fall into dissolute and wicked company; and that their wandering so far off is the reason why they fall into such company, and are so soon and so easily destroyed.</p>
