<p style=" "><b>He arose, and came - </b>Was coming. But here is no indication of “haste.” He did not “run,” but came driven by his wants, and, as we may suppose, filled with shame, and even with some doubts whether his father would receive him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A great way off - </b>This is a beautiful description - the image of his father’s happening to see him clad in rags, poor, and emaciated, and yet he recognized “his son,” and all the feelings of a father prompted him to go and embrace him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had compassion - </b>Pitied him. Saw his condition - his poverty and his wretched appearance - and was moved with compassion and love.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And ran - </b>This is opposed to the manner in which the son came. The beauty of the picture is greatly heightened by these circumstances. The son came slowly - the father “ran.” The love and joy of the old man were so great that he hastened to meet him and welcome him to his home.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fell on his neck - </b>Threw his arms around his neck and embraced him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And kissed him - </b>This was a sign at once of affection and reconciliation. This must at once have dissipated every doubt of the son about the willingness of his father to forgive and receive him. A kiss is a sign of affection, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+10:1">1 Samuel 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:13">Genesis 29:13</span>. This is evidently designed to denote the “readiness of God” to pity and pardon returning sinners. In this verse of inimitable beauty is contained the point of the parable, which was uttered by the Saviour to vindicate “his own conduct” in receiving sinners kindly. Who could “blame” this father for thus receiving his repenting son? Not even a Pharisee could blame him; and our Saviour thus showed them, so that “they” could not resist it, that “God” received returning sinners, and that it was right for “him” also to receive them and treat them with attention.</p>
