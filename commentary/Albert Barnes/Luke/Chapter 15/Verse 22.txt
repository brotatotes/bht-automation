<p style=" "><b>The best robe - </b>The son was probably in rags. The joy of the father is expressed by clothing him in the best raiment, that he might appear well. The “robe” here mentioned is probably the outer garment; and the father told them to put on him the best one that was in the house - one reserved for festival occasions. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:15">Genesis 27:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A ring on his hand - </b>To wear a ring on the hand was one mark of wealth and dignity. The rich and those in office commonly wore them. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>. To “give” a ring was a mark of favor, or of affection, or of conferring office. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:42">Genesis 41:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="es+8:2">Esther 8:2</span>. Here it was expressive of the “favor” and affection of the father.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shoes on his feet - </b>Servants, probably, did not usually wear shoes. The son returned, doubtless, without shoes a condition very unlike that in which he was when he left home. When, therefore, the father commanded them to put shoes on him, it expressed his wish that he should not be treated “as a servant,” but “as a son.” The word “shoes” here, however, means no more than “sandals,” such as were commonly worn. And the meaning of all these images is the same - “that God will treat those who return to him with kindness and affection.” These images should not be attempted to be “spiritualized.” They are beautifully thrown in to fill up the narrative, and to express with more force the “general” truth that “God” will treat returning penitents with mercy and with love. To dress up the son in this manner was a proof of the father’s affection. So God will bestow on sinners the marks of his confidence and regard.</p>
