<p style=" "><b>In the field - </b>At work. This eldest son is designed to represent the Pharisees who had found fault with the Saviour. Their conduct is likened to that of this envious and unnatural brother.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Music and dancing - </b>Dancing was not uncommon among the Hebrews, and was used on various occasions. Thus Miriam celebrated the deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt in dances as well as songs, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:20">Exodus 15:20</span>. David danced before the ark, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+6:14">2 Samuel 6:14</span>. It was common at Jewish feasts <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+21:19-21">Judges 21:19-21</span> and in public triumphs <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+11:34">Judges 11:34</span>, and at all seasons of mirth and rejoicings, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+30:11">Psalms 30:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:4">Jeremiah 31:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:13">Jeremiah 31:13</span>. It was also used in religious services by the idolaters <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:19">Exodus 32:19</span>, and also by the Jews, at times, in their religious services, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+149:3">Psalms 149:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+150:4">Psalms 150:4</span>. In this case it was an expression of rejoicing. Our Lord expresses no opinion about its “propriety.” He simply states “the fact,” nor was there occasion for comment on it. His “mentioning it” cannot be pleaded for its lawfulness or propriety, any more than his mentioning the vice of the younger son, or the wickedness of the Pharisees, can be pleaded to justify their conduct. It is an expressive image, used in accordance with the known customs of the country, to express joy. It is farther to be remarked, that if the example of persons in Scripture be pleaded for dancing, it can be “only for just such dances as they practiced” - for sacred or triumphal occasions.</p>
