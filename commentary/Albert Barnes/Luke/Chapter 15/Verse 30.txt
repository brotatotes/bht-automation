<p style=" "><b>This thy son - </b>This son of “thine.” This is an expression of great contempt. He did not call him “his brother,” but “his father’s son,” to show at once his contempt for his younger brother, and for his father for having received him as he did. Never was there a more striking instance of petty malice, or more unjustifiable disregard of a father’s conduct and will.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thy living - </b>Thy property. This is still designed to irritate the father, and set him against his younger son. It was true that the younger son had been guilty, and foolish, and ungrateful; but he was penitent, and “that” was of more consequence to the father than all his property; and in the joy that he was penitent and was safe, he forgot his ingratitude and folly. So should the older son have done.</p>
