<p style=" ">See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>. These verses occur in Matthew in a different order, and it is not improbable that they were spoken by our Saviour at different times. The design, here, seems to be to reprove the Pharisees for not observing the law of Moses, notwithstanding their great pretensions to external righteousness, and to show them that they had “really” departed from the law.</p>
