<p style=" "><b>There was a certain rich man - </b>Many have supposed that our Lord here refers to a “real history,” and gives an account of some man who had lived in this manner; but of this there is no evidence. The probability is that this narrative is to be considered as a parable, referring not to any particular case which “had” actually happened, but teaching that such cases “might” happen. The “design” of the narrative is to be collected from the previous conversation. He had taught the danger of the love of money <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1-2">Luke 16:1-2</span>; the deceitful and treacherous nature of riches <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:9-11">Luke 16:9-11</span>; that what was in high esteem on earth was hateful to God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15">Luke 16:15</span>; that people who did not use their property aright could not be received into heaven <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:11-12">Luke 16:11-12</span>; that they ought to listen to Moses and the prophets <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16-17">Luke 16:16-17</span>; and that it was the duty of people to show kindness to the poor. The design of the parable was to impress all these truths more vividly on the mind, and to show the Pharisees that, with all their boasted righteousness and their external correctness of character, they might be lost. Accordingly he speaks of no great fault in the rich man - no external, degrading vice - no open breach of the law; and leaves us to infer that the “mere possession of wealth” may be dangerous to the soul, and that a man surrounded with every temporal blessing may perish forever. It is remarkable that he gave no “name” to this rich man, though the poor man is mentioned by name. If this was a parable, it shows us how unwilling he was to fix suspicion on anyone. If it was not a parable, it shows also that he would not drag out wicked people before the public, but would conceal as much as possible all that had any connection with them. The “good” he would speak well of by name; the evil he would not “injure” by exposing them to public view.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Clothed in purple - </b>A purple robe or garment. This color was expensive as well as splendid, and was chiefly worn by princes, nobles, and those who were very wealthy. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:28">Matthew 27:28</span>. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:18">Isaiah 1:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fine linen - </b>This linen was chiefly produced of the flax that grew on the banks of the Nile, in Egypt, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+7:16">Proverbs 7:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+27:7">Ezekiel 27:7</span>. It was especially soft and white, and was, therefore, much sought as an article of luxury, and was so expensive that it could be worn only by princes, by priests, or by those who were very rich, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:42">Genesis 41:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+15:27">1 Chronicles 15:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:5">Exodus 28:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fared sumptuously - </b>Feasted or lived in a splendid manner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Every day - </b>Not merely occasionally, but constantly. This was a mark of great wealth, and, in the view of the world, evidence of great happiness. It is worthy of remark that Jesus did not charge on him any crime. He did not say that he had acquired this property by dishonesty, or even that he was unkind or uncharitable; but simply that he “was a rich man,” and that his riches did not secure him from death and perdition.</p>
