<p style=" "><b>Was carried by the angels - </b>The Jews held the opinion that the spirits of the righteous were conveyed by angels to heaven at their death. Our Saviour speaks in accordance with this opinion; and as he expressly affirms the fact, it seems as proper that it should be taken literally, as when it is said the rich man died and was buried. Angels are ministering spirits sent forth to minister to those who are heirs of salvation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>, and there is no more improbability in the supposition that they attend departing spirits to heaven, than that they attend them while on earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Abraham’s bosom - </b>This is a phrase taken from the practice of reclining at meals, where the head of one lay on the bosom of another, and the phrase, therefore, denotes intimacy and friendship. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span>. Also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:23">John 13:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:20">John 21:20</span>. The Jews had no doubt that Abraham was in paradise. To say that Lazarus was in his bosom was, therefore, the same as to say that he was admitted to heaven and made happy there. The Jews, moreover, boasted very much of being the friends of Abraham and of being his descendants, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>. To be his friend was, in their view, the highest honor and happiness. Our Saviour, therefore, showed them that this poor and afflicted man might be raised to the highest happiness, while the rich, who prided themselves on their being descended from Abraham, might be cast away and lost forever.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was buried - </b>This is not said of the poor man. Burial was thought to be an honor, and funerals were, as they are now, often expensive, splendid, and ostentatious. This is said of the rich man to show that he had “every” earthly honor, and all that the world calls happy and desirable.</p>
