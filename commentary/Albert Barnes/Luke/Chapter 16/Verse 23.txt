<p style=" "><b>In hell - </b>The word here translated hell (“Hades”) means literally a dark, obscure place; the place where departed spirits go, but especially the place where “wicked” spirits go. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+10:21-22">Job 10:21-22</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:9">Isaiah 14:9</span> note. The following circumstances are related of it in this parable:</p>
<p style=" ">The word “hell” here means, therefore, that dark, obscure, and miserable place, far from heaven, where the wicked shall be punished forever.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He lifted up his eyes - </b>A phrase in common use among the Hebrews, meaning “he looked,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:10">Genesis 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:2">Genesis 18:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:10">Genesis 31:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+8:3">Deuteronomy 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:20">Luke 6:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being in torment - </b>The word “torment” means “pain, anguish” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>; particularly the pain inflicted by the ancients in order to induce people to make confession of their crimes. These “torments” or tortures were the keenest that they could inflict, such as the rack, or scourging, or burning; and the use of the word here denotes that the sufferings of the wicked can be represented only by the extremest forms of human suffering.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And seeth Abraham ... - </b>This was an aggravation of his misery. One of the first things that occurred in hell was to look up, and see the poor man that lay at his gate completely happy. What a contrast! Just now he was rolling in wealth, and the poor man was at his gate. He had no expectation of these sufferings: now they have come upon him, and Lazarus is happy and forever fixed in the paradise of God. It is more, perhaps, than we are authorized to infer, that the wicked will “see” those who are in paradise. That they will “know” that they are there is certain; but we are not to suppose that they will be so near together as to be seen, or as to make conversation possible. These circumstances mean that there will be “a separation,” and that the wicked in hell will be conscious that the righteous, though on earth they were poor or despised, will be in heaven. Heaven and hell will be far from each other, and it will be no small part of the misery of the one that it is far and forever removed from the other.</p>
