<p style=" "><b>Said within himself - </b>Thought, or considered.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My lord - </b>My master, my employer.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I cannot dig - </b>This may mean either that his employment had been such that he could not engage in agriculture, not having been acquainted with the business, or that he was “unwilling” to stoop to so low an employment as to work daily for his support. “To dig,” here, is the same as to till the earth, to work at daily labor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To beg - </b>These were the only two ways that presented themselves for a living - either to work for it, or to beg.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am ashamed - </b>He was too proud for that. Besides, he was in good health and strength, and there was no good reason “why” he should beg - nothing which he could give as a cause for it. It is proper for the sick, the lame, and the feeble to beg; but it is “not” well for the able-bodied to do it, nor is it well to aid them, except by giving them employment, and compelling them to work for a living. He does a beggar who is able to work the most real kindness who sets him to work, and, as a general rule, we should not aid an able-bodied man or woman in any other way. Set them to work, and pay them a fair compensation, and you do them good in two ways, for the habit of labor may be of more value to them than the price you pay them.</p>
