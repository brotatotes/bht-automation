Be persuaded - Be convinced of the truth; of the danger and folly of their way; of the certainty of their suffering hereafter, and be induced to turn from sin to holiness, and from Satan unto God.From this impressive and instructive parable we may learn: “How vain are riches to secure Their haughty owners from the grave!”The rich, the beautiful, the happy, as well as the poor, go down to the grave. All their pomp and apparel, all their honors, their palaces, and their gold cannot save them. Death can as easily find his way into the splendid mansions of the rich as into the cottages of the poor; and the rich shall turn to the same corruption, and soon, like the poor, be undistinguished from common dust and be unknown. “On slippery rocks I see them stand, And fiery billows rollI below. “Now let them boast how tall they rise, I’ll never envy them again; There they may stand with haughty eyes, Till they plunge deep in endless pain. “Their fancied joys how fast they flee! Like dreams, as fleeting and as vain; Their songs of softest harmony. Are but a prelude to their pain.” “Now I esteem their mirth and wine. Too dear to purchase with my blood: Lord, ’tis enough that thou art mine -  My life, my portion, and my God.”
