<p style=" "><b>A hundred measures - </b>The measure here mentioned is the “bath” which contained, according to Dr. Arbuthnot’s tables, 7 12 gallons, or, according to the marginal note, about 9 gallons and 3 quarts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Oil - </b>Oil of olives, or sweet oil. It was much used for lamps, as an article of food <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:2">Exodus 29:2</span>, and also for anointing, and, of course, as an article of commerce, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+5:11">1 Kings 5:11</span>. These were persons, doubtless, who had “rented” land of the rich man, and who were to give him a certain proportion of the produce.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thy bill - </b>The contract, obligation, or “lease.” It was probably written as a “promise” by the debtor and signed by the steward, and thus became binding. Thus he had power to alter it, without supposing that his master would detect it. The bill or contract was in the hands of the steward, and he gave it back to him to write a new one.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Quickly - </b>He supposed that his master would soon remove him, and he was, therefore, in haste to have all things secure beforehand. It is worthy of remark, also, that “all” this was wrong. His master had called for the account: but, instead of rendering it, he engaged in other business, disobeyed his lord still, and, in contempt of his commands, sought his own interest. All sinners would be slow to give in their account to God if they could do it; and it is only because, when God calls them by death, they “cannot but go,” that they do not engage still in their own business and disobey him.</p>
