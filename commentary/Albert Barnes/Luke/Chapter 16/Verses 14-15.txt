<p style=" "><b>They derided him - </b>The fact that they were “covetous” is here stated as the reason why they derided him, or, as it is literally, “they turned up the nose at him.” They contemned or despised the doctrine which he had laid down, probably because it showed them that with their love of money they could not be the true friends of God, or that their profession of religion was really false and hollow. They were “attempting” to serve God and mammon, and they, therefore, looked upon his doctrine with contempt and scorn.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Justify yourselves - </b>“Attempt” to appear just; or; you aim to appear righteous in the sight of people, and do not regard the heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That which is highly esteemed - </b>That is, mere external works, or actions performed merely to “appear” to be righteous.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is abomination - </b>Is abominable, or hateful. The word used here is the one that in the Old Testament is commonly given to “idols,” and denotes God’s “abhorrence” of such conduct. These words are to be applied “chiefly” to what Jesus was discoursing about. There are many things esteemed among people which are “not” abomination in the sight of God; as, for example, truth, parental and filial affection, industry, etc. But many things, much sought and admired, “are” hateful in his sight. The love of wealth and show, ambition and pride, frivolous and splendid vices, and all the wickedness that people contrive to “gild” and to make appear like virtue - external acts that “appear” well while the heart is evil - are abominable in the sight of God, and “should be” in the sight of people.
