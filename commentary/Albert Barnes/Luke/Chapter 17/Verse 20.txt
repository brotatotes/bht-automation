<p style=" "><b>Was demanded - </b>Was asked.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the Pharisees - </b>This was a matter of much importance to them, and they had taught that it would come with parade and pomp. It is not unlikely that they asked this merely in “contempt,” and for the purpose of drawing out something that would expose him to ridicule.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The kingdom of God - </b>The “reign” of God; or the dispensation under the Messiah. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With observation - </b>With scrupulous and attentive looking for it, or with such an appearance as to “attract” observation - that is, with pomp, majesty, splendor. He did not deny that, according to their views, the time was drawing near; but he denied that his kingdom would come in the “manner” in which they expected. The Messiah would “not” come with pomp like an earthly prince; perhaps not in such a manner as to be “discerned” by the eyes of sagacious and artful people, who were expecting him in a way agreeable to their own feelings. The kingdom of God is “within” people, and it makes its way, not by pomp and noise, but by silence, decency, and order, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:40">1 Corinthians 14:40</span>.</p>
