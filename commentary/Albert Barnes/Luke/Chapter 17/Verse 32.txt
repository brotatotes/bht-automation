<p style=" "><b>Remember Lot’s wife - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:26">Genesis 19:26</span>. “She” looked back - she delayed - perhaps she “desired” to take something with her, and God made her a monument of his displeasure. Jesus directed his disciples, when they saw the calamities coming upon the Jews, to flee to the mountains, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:16">Matthew 24:16</span>. He here charges them to be in haste - not to look back - not to delay - but to escape quickly, and to remember that by delaying the wife of Lot lost her life.</p>
