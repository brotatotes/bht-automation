<p style=" "><b>I fast twice ... - </b>This was probably the Jewish custom. The Pharisees are said to have fasted regularly on the second and fifth days of every week in private. This was “in addition” to the public days of fasting required in the law of Moses, and they, therefore, made more a matter of “merit” of it because it was voluntary.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I give tithes - </b>A tithe means the tenth part of a thing. A tenth part of the possessions of the Jews was required for the support of the Levites, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:21">Numbers 18:21</span>. In addition to the tithes required strictly by law, the Pharisees had tithed everything which they possessed even the smallest matters - as mint, anise, cummin, etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:42">Luke 11:42</span>. It was “this,” probably, on which he so particularly prided himself. As this could not be proved to be strictly “required” in the law, it had more the “appearance” of great piety, and, therefore, he particularly dwelt on it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I possess - </b>This may mean either all which I “have,” or all which I “gain” or acquire. It is not material which meaning be considered the true one.</p>
<p style=" ">The religion of the Pharisee, therefore, consisted in:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.Abstaining from injustice to others; in pretending to live a harmless, innocent, and upright life; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.A regular observance of all the external duties of religion.</p>
<p style=" ">His “fault” consisted in relying on this kind of righteousness; in not feeling and acknowledging that he was a sinner; in not seeking a religion that should dwell in the “heart” and regulate the feelings; and in making public and ostentatious professions of his own goodness. Most of all was this abominable in the sight of God, who “looks into the heart,” and who sees wickedness there when the external actions may be blameless. We may learn from the case of the Pharisee:</p>
