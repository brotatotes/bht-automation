<p style=" "><b>A judge which feared not God - </b>One appointed by law to determine causes brought before him. This judge had no reverence for God, and consequently no regard for the rights of man. These two things go together. He that has no regard for God can be expected to have none for man; and our Lord has here indirectly taught us what ought to be the character of a judge that he “should” fear God and regard the rights of man. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+1:16-17">Deuteronomy 1:16-17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Regarded man - </b>cared not for man. Had no respect for the opinions or the rights of man.</p>
