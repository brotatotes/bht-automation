They expected that he would be a temporal prince and a conqueror, and they were not “willing” to believe that he would be delivered into the hands of his enemies. They did not see how that could be consistent with the prophecies. To us now these things appear plain, and we may, hence, learn that those things which to us appear most mysterious may yet appear perfectly plain; and we should learn to trust in God, and “believe” just what he has spoken.
