<p style=" "><b>A man named Zacchaeus - </b>The name Zacchaeus is Hebrew, and shows that this man was a “Jew.” The Hebrew name properly means “pure,” and is the same as Zacchai in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+2:9">Ezra 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ne+7:14">Nehemiah 7:14</span>. The publicans, therefore, were not all foreigners.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Chief among the publicans - </b>Who presided over other tax-gatherers, or who “received” their collections and transmitted them to the Roman government.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He was rich - </b>Though this class of people was despised and often infamous, yet it seems that they were sometimes wealthy. They sustained, however, the general character of “sinners,” because they were particularly odious in the eyes of the Jews. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:7">Luke 19:7</span>. The evangelist has thought it worthy of record that he was rich, perhaps, because it was so unlikely that a “rich man” should follow so poor and despised a personage as Jesus of Nazareth, and because it was so unusual a thing during his personal ministry. Not many rich were called, but God chiefly chose the poor of this world Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26-29">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</span>.</p>
