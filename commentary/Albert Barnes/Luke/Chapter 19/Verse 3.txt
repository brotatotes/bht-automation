<p style=" "><b>Who he was - </b>Rather “what sort of person,” he was, or how he appeared. He had that curiosity which is natural to people to see one of whom they have heard much. It would seem, also, that in this case mere “curiosity” led to his conversion and that of his family. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23-25">1 Corinthians 14:23-25</span>. God makes use of every principle - of curiosity, or sympathy, or affection, or hope, or fear - to lead people in the way of salvation, and to impress truth on the minds of sinners.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The press - </b>The crowd; the multitude that surrounded Jesus. Earthly princes are often borne in splendid equipages, or even carried, as in Eastern nations, in palanquins on the shoulders of people. Jesus mingled with the multitude, not seeking distinctions of that sort, and perhaps, “in appearance,” not distinguished from thousands that followed him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Little of stature - </b>Short. Not a tall man.</p>
