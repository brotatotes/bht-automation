<p style=" "><b>Could not find ... - </b>Were not able to accomplish their purpose; they did not know “how” to bring it about.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Very attentive - </b>literally, “hung upon him” to hear him. The word denotes an anxious desire, a fixed attention, a cleaving to him, and an unwillingness to “leave” him, so that they might hear his words. This is always the case when people become anxious about their salvation. They manifest it by hanging on the preaching of the gospel; by fixed attention; and by an unwillingness to leave the place where the word of God is preached. In view of the fact that the Lord Jesus wept over Jerusalem, we may remark:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)There was “occasion” for weeping. Jesus would not have wept had there been no cause for it. If they were in no danger, if there was no punishment in the future world, why should he have wept? When the Lord Jesus weeps over sinners, it is the fullest proof that they are in danger.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Sinners are in the same danger now. They reject Christ as sinners did then. They despise the gospel as they did then. They refuse now to come to him as the inhabitants of Jerusalem did. Why are they not then in the same danger?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)Deep feeling, gushing emotions, lively affections, are proper in religion. If the Saviour wept, it is not improper for us to weep - it is right. Nay, can it be right “not” to weep over the condition of lost man.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Did Christ o’er sinners weep?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> And shall our cheeks be dry?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Let floods of penitential grief.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> Burst forth from every eye.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “The Son of God in tears.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> Angels with wonder see!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Be thou astonished, O my soul;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> He shed those tears for thee.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “He wept that we might weep;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> Each sin demands a tear:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> In heaven alone no sin is found.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> And there’s no weeping there.”</p>
