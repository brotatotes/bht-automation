<p style=" "><b>Thy father - </b>Joseph was not the “real” father of Jesus, but he was “legally” so; and as the secret of his birth was not commonly known, he was called his father. Mary, in accordance with that usage, also called him so.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sorrowing - </b>Anxious, lest in the multitude he might not be found, or lest some accident might have happened to him.</p>
