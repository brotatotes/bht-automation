<p style=" "><b>The glory of the Lord - </b>This is the same as a “great” glory - that is, a splendid appearance or “light.” The word “glory” is often the same as light, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:41">1 Corinthians 15:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:31">Luke 9:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:11">Acts 22:11</span>. The words “Lord” and “God” are often used to denote “greatness” or “intensity.” Thus, “trees of God” mean great trees; “hills of God,” high or lofty hills, etc. So “the glory of the Lord” here means an exceedingly great or bright luminous appearance perhaps not unlike what Paul saw on the way to Damascus.</p>
