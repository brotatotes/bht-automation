<p style=" "><b>Shall fall ... - </b>No less than one million one hundred thousand perished in the siege of Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be led away captive - </b>More than 90,000 were led into captivity. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be trodden down by the Gentiles - </b>Shall be in possession of the Gentiles, or be subject to them. The expression also implies that it would be an “oppressive” subjection, as when a captive in war is trodden down under the feet of the conqueror. Anciently conquerors “trod on” the necks of those who were subdued by them, <span class="_0000ff"><u>Jos 10:24</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+22:41">2 Samuel 22:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+21:29">Ezekiel 21:29</span>. The bondage of Jerusalem has been long and very oppressive. It was for a long time under the dominion of the Romans, then of the Saracens, and is now of the Turks, and is aptly represented by a captive stretched on the ground whose neck is “trodden” by the foot of the conqueror.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled - </b>This passage has been understood very differently by different expositors. Some refer it to the time which the Romans who conquered it had dominion over it, as signifying that “they” should keep possession of it until a part of the pagans should be converged, when it should be rebuilt. Thus it was rebuilt by the Emperor Adrian. Others suppose that it refers to the end of the world, when all the Gentiles shall be converted, and they shall “cease” to be Gentiles by becoming Christians, meaning that it should “always” be desolate. Others, that Christ meant to say that in the times of the millennium, when the gospel should spread universally, he would reign personally on the earth, and that the “Jews” would return and rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. This is the opinion of the Jews and of many Christians. The meaning of the passage clearly is,</p>
<p style=" "><b>To stand before the Son of man - </b>These approaching calamities are represented as the “coming of the Son of man” to judge Jerusalem for its crimes. Its inhabitants were so wicked that they were not worthy to stand before him and would be condemned, and the city would be overthrown. To “stand before him” here denotes approbation, acquittal, favor, and is equivalent to saying that “they” would be free from these calamities, while they should come upon others. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:5">Psalms 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+130:3">Psalms 130:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:17">Revelation 6:17</span>. Perhaps, also, there is a reference here to the day of judgment. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>.</p>
