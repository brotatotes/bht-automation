<p style=" "><b>A strife - </b>A contention or debate.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which of them should be the greatest - </b>The apostles, in common with the Jews generally, had supposed that the Messiah would come as a temporal prince, and in the manner of other princes of the earth - of course, that he would have officers of his government, ministers of state, etc. Their contention was founded on this expectation, and they were disputing which of them should be raised to the highest office. They had before had a similar contention. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:1">Matthew 18:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:20-28">Matthew 20:20-28</span>. Nothing can be more humiliating than that the disciples should have had “such” contentions, and in such a time and place. That just as Jesus was contemplating his own death, and laboring to prepare them for it, they should strive and contend about office and rank, shows how deeply seated is the love of power; how ambition will find its way into the most secret and sacred places; and how even the disciples of the meek and lowly Jesus are sometimes actuated by this most base and wicked feeling.</p>
