<p style=" "><b>The kings of the Gentiles - </b>The kings of the “nations,” or of the earth. They do this, and it is to be expected of them, and it is right. Our Lord does not mean to say that it was wrong that there should be such authority, but that “his” kingdom was to be of a different character, and they were not to expect it there.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Over them - </b>That is, over the “nations.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are called benefactors - </b>The word “benefactor” is applied to one who bestows “favor” on another. It was applied to kings by way of “compliment or flattery.” Some of them might have been truly benefactors of their people, but this was by no means true of “all.” Yet it was applied to all, and especially to the Roman emperors. It is found applied to them often in the writings of Josephus and Philo.</p>
