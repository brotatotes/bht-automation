<p style=" "><b>And I appoint unto you a kingdom - </b>He assures them here that they should “have” a kingdom - their expectations would be realized. They had continued with him; they had seen how “he” had lived, and to what trials he had been subjected; they had all along expected a kingdom, and he assures them that they should not be disappointed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As my Father ... - </b>They had seen how God had appointed a kingdom to “him.” It was not with pomp, and splendor, and external glory, but it was in poverty, want, persecution, and trial. So would “he” appoint to them a kingdom. They should “surely” possess it; but it would be not with external splendor, but by poverty and toil. The original word “appoint” has the force of a “covenant” or compact, and means that it should be “surely” or certainly done, or that he pledged himself to do it. All Christians must enter into the kingdom of heaven after the manner of their Lord - through much tribulation; but, though it must be, as it was with him, by many tears and sorrows, yet they shall surely reach the place of their rest and the reward of heaven, for it is secured to them by the covenant pledge and faithfulness of their Lord and King.</p>
