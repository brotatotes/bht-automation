This that is written - See the notes at Isaiah 53:12.Was reckoned among the transgressors - Not reckoned as a transgressor, but “among or with” them - that is, he was treated as transgressors are. He was put to death in their company, and as he “would have been” if he had been a transgressor. He was innocent, holy, harmless, and undefiled, Hebrews 7:26. God knew this always, and could not “think” of him, or make him “to be” otherwise than he was; yet it pleased him to bruise him, and to give him into the hands of people who did reckon him as a transgressor, and who treated him accordingly.Have an end - This may either mean, “shall be surely accomplished,” or “they are about to be fulfilled,” or “are now fulfilled.” The former is probably the meaning, denoting that “every” prophecy in regard to him would certainly be accomplished.
