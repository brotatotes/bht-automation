<p style=" "><b>Herod with his men of war - </b>With his soldiers, or his body-guard. It is probable that in traveling he had “a guard” to attend him constantly.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Set him at nought - </b>Treated him with contempt and ridicule.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A gorgeous robe - </b>A white or shining robe, for this is the meaning of the original. The Roman princes wore “purple” robes, and “Pilate,” therefore, put such a robe on Jesus. The Jewish kings wore a “white” robe, which was often rendered very shining or gorgeous by much tinsel or silver interwoven. Josephus says that the robe which Agrippa wore was so bright with silver that when the sun shone on it, it so dazzled the eyes that it was difficult to look on it. The Jews and Romans, therefore, decked him in the manner appropriate to their own country, for purposes of mockery. All this was unlawful and malicious, as there was not the least evidence of his guilt.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sent him to Pilate - </b>It was by the interchange of these civilities that they were made friends. It would seem that Pilate sent him to Herod as a token of civility and respect, and with a design, perhaps, of putting an end to their quarrel. Herod returned the civility, and it resulted in their reconciliation.</p>
