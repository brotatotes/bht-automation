<p style=" "><b>To the mountains, Fall on us ... - </b>This is an image of great calamities and judgments. So great will be the calamities that they will seek for shelter from the storm, and will call on the hills to protect them. The same figure is used respecting the wicked in the day of judgment in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:16-17">Revelation 6:16-17</span>. Compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:21">Isaiah 2:21</span>.</p>
