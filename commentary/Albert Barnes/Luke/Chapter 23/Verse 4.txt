I find no fault - I see no evidence that he is guilty of what you charge him with. This was after Pilate had taken Jesus into the judgment-hall by himself and examined him “privately,” and had been satisfied in regard to the nature of his kingdom. See John 18:33-38. He was “then” satisfied that though he claimed to be “a king,” yet his kingdom was not of this world, and that “his” claims did not interfere with those of Caesar.
