<p style=" "><b>The things which were done - </b>The earthquake, the darkness, and the sufferings of Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Smote their breasts - </b>In token of alarm, fear, and anguish. They saw the judgments of God; they saw the guilt of the rulers; and they feared the farther displeasure of the Almighty.</p>
