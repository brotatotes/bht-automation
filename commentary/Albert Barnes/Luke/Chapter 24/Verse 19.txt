<p style=" "><b>A prophet - </b>A teacher sent from God. They did not now call him the “Messiah,” for his “death” had led them to doubt that, but they had no doubt that he was a distinguished “prophet.” The evidence of that was so clear that they “could” not call it in question.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Mighty in deed - </b>Powerful in working miracles, in raising the dead, healing the sick, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In word - </b>In teaching.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before God and all the people - </b>Manifestly; publicly. So that “God” owned him, and the people regarded him as a distinguished teacher.</p>
