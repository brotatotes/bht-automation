Ought not Christ ... - Ought not the “Messiah.” Was there not evidence that he would do it? and was it not indispensable that he should, in order to fulfil the prophecies? The “necessity” of his suffering these things referred to “here” was that it was foretold that he “would.” The reason why it was predicted, and why it was necessary that it should occur, was that it was proper that God should manifest his justice, and do honor to his law, and secure the due regard for his government, while he pardoned the guilty.
