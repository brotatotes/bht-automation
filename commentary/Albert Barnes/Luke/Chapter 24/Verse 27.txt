<p style=" "><b>Beginning at Moses - </b>At the “writings” of Moses, or at the beginning of the Old Testament; or rather the word “beginning” should be separated from what follows, denoting simply that he “commenced” his discourse, and not that he began at the prophets as well as at Moses; thus, “And commencing his discourse, or replying to them, he expounded from Moses and the prophets,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All the prophets - </b>The books of the Old Testament generally.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He expounded - </b>He explained or interpreted it to them. Probably He showed them that their notions of the Messiah were not according to the Scriptures. “They” expected a temporal prince; they were perplexed because Jesus had not assumed the regal power, but had been put to death. He showed them that according to the prophecies he ought to suffer, and that his “death,” therefore, was no argument that he was not the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In all the scriptures - </b>In all the “writings” of the Old Testament. They were called “scriptures” because they were “written,” the art of printing being then unknown.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The things concerning himself - </b>Concerning the Messiah. It does not appear that he “applied” them to himself, but left them, probably, to make the application. He showed what the Scriptures foretold, and “they” saw that these things applied to Jesus of Nazareth, and began to be satisfied that he was the Messiah. The most striking passages foretelling the character and sufferings of Christ are the following, which we may suppose it possible our Saviour dwelt upon to convince them that, though he was crucified, yet he was the Christ: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:8-9">Numbers 21:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1-12">Isaiah 53:1-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:25-27">Daniel 9:25-27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6-7">Isaiah 9:6-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1-7">Psalms 110:1-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:1-11">Psalms 16:1-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:0">Psalms 22:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2-6">Malachi 4:2-6</span>.</p>
