<p style=" "><b>Sat at meat - </b>Reclined at the table, or while he was at supper.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He took bread and blessed it ... - </b>This was the office of the master of a feast, and perhaps this first attracted particularly their attention. Though he was in “their” house, yet he acted as “master” of the feast, as he used to do with them before his death. Perhaps, also, as he “gave” them the bread, they observed the “prints” in his hands, and they knew that it was Jesus. This was not a “sacramental,” but a common supper; yet our Saviour sought a blessing on the food, and thus set an example to all his followers to acknowledge God in their daily gifts, and to seek his benediction in all their enjoyments.</p>
