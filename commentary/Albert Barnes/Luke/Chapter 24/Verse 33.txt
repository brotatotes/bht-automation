This was natural and proper, and it shows how quick and ready they who have found the Saviour are to tell it to others. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41-45">John 1:41-45</span>. Young converts to Christ “should hasten” to tell their joy, and should not shrink at self-denial to proclaim to others what God hath done for the soul, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+66:16">Psalms 66:16</span>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> To make his mercies known:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Come, ye that fear my God, and hear.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> The wonders he hath done.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “When on my head huge sorrows fell,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> I sought his heavenly aid;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> He saved my sinking soul from hell,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> And death’s eternal shade.”</p>
