The same hour - Though it was late, and they had stopped, as they thought, for the night, yet such was their joy that they hastened to tell it to their companions and friends. This was natural and proper, and it shows how quick and ready they who have found the Saviour are to tell it to others. Compare John 1:41-45. Young converts to Christ “should hasten” to tell their joy, and should not shrink at self-denial to proclaim to others what God hath done for the soul, Psalms 66:16. “My lips and cheerful heart, prepare. To make his mercies known: Come, ye that fear my God, and hear. The wonders he hath done. “When on my head huge sorrows fell, I sought his heavenly aid; He saved my sinking soul from hell, And death’s eternal shade.”The eleven - The eleven apostles. Judas was now dead. This shows that the two that went to Emmaus were not apostles.
