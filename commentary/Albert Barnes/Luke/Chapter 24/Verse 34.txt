Saying - The eleven said this.Hath appeared to Simon - To Peter. It is not known precisely when this happened, as the time and place are not mentioned. Paul has referred to it in 1 Corinthians 15:5, from which it appears that he appeared to “Cephas or Peter” before he did to any other of the apostles. This was a mark of special love and favor, and particularly, after Peter’s denial, it showed how ready he was to pardon, and how willing to impart comfort to those who are penitent, though their sins are great.
