<p style=" "><b>These are the words - </b>Or this is the “fulfillment” of what I before told you respecting my death. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:33">Luke 18:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:33">Mark 10:33</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>While I was yet with you - </b>Before my death. While I was with you as a teacher and guide.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the law of Moses - </b>The five books of Moses - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. Among the Jews this was the first division of the Old Testament, and was called the “law.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>The prophets - </b>This was the second and largest part of the Hebrew Scriptures. It comprehended the books of Joshua, Judges, 1st and 2nd Samuel, 1st and 2nd Kings, which were called the “former prophets;” and Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve smaller books from Daniel, to Malachi, which were called the “latter prophets.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>The psalms - </b>The word here used probably means what were comprehended under the name of “Hagiographa,” or holy writings. This consisted of the Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and the two books of Chronicles. This division of the Old Testament was in use long before the time of Christ, and was what he referred to here; and he meant to say that in “each of” these divisions of the Old Testament there were prophecies respecting himself. The “particular” subject before them was his “resurrection from the dead.” A most striking prediction of this is contained in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:9-11">Psalms 16:9-11</span>. Compare it with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24-32">Acts 2:24-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:35-37">Acts 13:35-37</span>.</p>
