<p style=" "><b>Are witnesses of these things - </b>Of my life, my sufferings, my death, and my resurrection. How solemn was their office - to “testify” these things to the world, and, in the face of suffering and death, to go and proclaim them to all nations! In like manner, “all” Christians are witnesses for Christ. They are the “evidences” of his mercy and his love, and they should so live that others may be brought to see and love the Saviour.</p>
