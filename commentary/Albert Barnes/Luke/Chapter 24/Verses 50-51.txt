<p style=" "><b>To Bethany - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span>. Bethany was on the eastern declivity of the Mount of Olives, from which our Lord was taken up to heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12">Acts 1:12</span>. Bethany was a favored place. It was the abode of Martha, and Mary, and Lazarus, and our Saviour delighted to be there. From this place, also, he ascended to his Father and our Father, and to his God and our God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>While he blessed them - </b>While he commanded his benediction to rest upon them; while he assured them of his favor, and commended them to the protection and guidance of God, in the dangers, trials, and conflicts which they were to meet in a sinful and miserable world.</p>
