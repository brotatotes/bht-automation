<p style=" "><b>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me - </b>Or, I speak by divine appointment. I am divinely inspired to speak. There can be no doubt that the passage in Isaiah had a principal reference to the Messiah. Our Saviour directly applies it to himself, and it is not easily applicable to any other prophet. Its first application might have been to the restoration of the Jews from Babylon; but the language of prophecy is often applicable to two similar events, and the secondary event is often the most important. In this case the prophet uses most striking poetic images to depict the return from Babylon, but the same images also describe the appropriate work of the Son of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath anointed me - </b>Anciently kings and prophets and the high priest were set apart to their work by anointing with oil, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:15-16">1 Kings 19:15-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:7">Exodus 29:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:16">1 Samuel 9:16</span>, etc. This oil or ointment was made of various substances, and it was forbidden to imitate it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:34-38">Exodus 30:34-38</span>. Hence, those who were set apart to the work of God as king, prophet, or priest, were called the Lord’s anointed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:6">1 Samuel 16:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+84:9">Psalms 84:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:1">Isaiah 45:1</span>. Hence, the Son of God is called the “Messiah,” a Hebrew word signifying the “Anointed,” or the “Christ,” a Greek word signifying the same thing. And by his being “anointed” is not meant that he was literally anointed, for he was never set apart in that manner, but that “God had set him apart” for this work; that “he” had constituted or appointed him to be the prophet, priest, and king of his people.

<p style=" "><b>To preach the gospel to the poor - </b>The English word “gospel” is derived from two words - “God” or “good,” and “spell,” an old Saxon word meaning “history, relation, narration, word, or speech,” and the word therefore means “a good communication” or “message.” This corresponds exactly with the meaning of the Greek word - “a good or joyful message - glad tidings.” By the “poor” are meant all those who are destitute of the comforts of this life, and who therefore may be more readily disposed to seek treasures in heaven; all those who are sensible of their sins, or are poor in spirit <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>; and all the “miserable” and the afflicted, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:7">Isaiah 58:7</span>. Our Saviour gave it as one proof that he was the Messiah, or was from God, that he preached to “the poor,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span>. The Pharisees and Sadducees despised the poor; ancient philosophers neglected them; but the gospel seeks to bless them - to give comfort where it is felt to be needed, and where it will be received with gratitude. Riches fill the mind with pride, with self-complacency, and with a feeling that the gospel is not needed. The poor “feel” their need of some sources of comfort that the world cannot give, and accordingly our Saviour met with his greatest success the gospel among the poor; and there also, “since,” the gospel has shed its richest blessings and its purest joys. It is also one proof that the gospel is true. If it had been of “men,” it would have sought the rich and mighty; but it pours contempt on all human greatness, and seeks, like God, to do good to those whom the world overlooks or despises. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To heal the brokenhearted - </b>To console those who are deeply afflicted, or whose hearts are “broken” by external calamities or by a sense of their sinfulness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Deliverance to the captives - </b>This is a figure originally applicable to those who were in captivity in Babylon. They were miserable. To grant deliverance to “them” and restore them to their country - to grant deliverance to those who are in prison and restore them to their families - to give liberty to the slave and restore him to freedom, was to confer the highest benefit and impart the richest favor. In this manner the gospel imparts favor. It does not, indeed, “literally” open the doors of prisons, but it releases the mind captive under sin; it gives comfort to the prisoner, and it will finally open all prison doors and break off all the chains of slavery, and, by preventing “crime,” prevent also the sufferings that are the consequence of crime.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sight to the blind - </b>This was often literally fulfilled, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:11">John 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:30">Matthew 9:30</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To set at liberty them that are bruised - </b>The word “bruised,” here, evidently has the same “general” signification as “brokenhearted” or the contrite. It means those who are “pressed down” by great calamity, or whose hearts are “pressed” or “bruised” by the consciousness of sin. To set them “at liberty” is the same as to free them from this pressure, or to give them consolation.</p>
