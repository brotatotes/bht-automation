<p style=" "><b>Forsook all - </b>It was not “much” that they left - a couple of small boats and their nets; but it was all they had, even all their living. But this showed their love of Jesus, and their willingness to deny themselves, as “really” as if they had forsaken palaces and gold. All that Jesus asks is that we should leave “all” we have for him; that we should love him “more” than we do whatever friends or property we may possess, and be willing to give them all up when he requires it.</p>
