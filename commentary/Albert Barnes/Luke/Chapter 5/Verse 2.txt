<p style=" "><b>Two ships - </b>The ships used on so small a lake were probably no more than fishing-boats without decks, and easily drawn up on the beach. Josephus says there were 230 of them on the lake, attended by four or five men each. That they were small is also clear from the account commonly given of them. A single large draught of fishes endangered them and came near sinking them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Standing by the lake - </b>Anchored by the lake, or drawn up upon the beach.</p>
