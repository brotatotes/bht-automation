<p style=" "><b>Their net brake - </b>Or their net “began” to break, or was “about” to break. This is all that is implied in the Greek word. If their nets had actually “broken,” as our English word seems to suppose, the fish would have escaped; but no more is meant than that there was such a multitude of fishes that their net was “on the point” of being torn asunder.</p>
