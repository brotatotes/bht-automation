<p style=" "><b>And stood in the plain - </b>It is not affirmed, however, that he stood in the plain when he delivered the following discourse. There has been some doubt whether the following discourse is the same as that recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:0">Matthew 5:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:0">Matthew 6:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:0">Matthew 7:0</span>, or whether the Saviour “repeated” the substance of that discourse, and that Luke recorded it as he repeated it. The reasons which have led many to suppose that they refer to the same are:</p>
<p style=" ">On the other hand, “Matthew” says that the sermon was delivered on the “mountain” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>; it is thought to be implied that “Luke” affirms that it was in the “plain.” Matthew says that he “sat;” Luke, that he “stood.” Yet there is no reason to suppose that there is a difference in the evangelists. Jesus spent the night on the mountain in prayer. In the morning he descended into the open plain and healed many. While there, as Luke says, he “stood” and received those who came to him, and healed their diseases. There is no impropriety in supposing that, being pressed by multitudes, he retired into the mountain again, or to an eminence in the plain, or to the side of the mountain, where the people might be more conveniently arranged and seated to hear him. There he “sat,” as recorded by Matthew, and delivered the discourse; for it is to be observed that Luke does “not” say that he delivered the sermon “on the plain,” but only that he “healed the sick there.”</p>
