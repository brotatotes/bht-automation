<p style=" "><b>One of the Pharisees - </b>His name was Simon, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:10">Luke 7:10</span>. Nothing more is known of him. It is not improbable, however, from what follows <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:40-47">Luke 7:40-47</span>, that he had been healed by the Saviour of some afflictive disease, and made this feast to show his gratitude.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sat down to meat - </b>The original word here means only that he placed himself or reclined at the table. The notion of “sitting” at meals is taken from modern customs, and was not practiced by the Jews. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Meat - </b>Supper. Food of any kind. Sat down to eat.</p>
