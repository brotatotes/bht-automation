<p style=" "><b>He spake within himself - </b>Thought.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If he were a prophet - </b>The word “prophet” here means, not one who predicts future events, but one who knows the hearts of people. If Jesus had been sent from God as a prophet, he supposed that he would have known the character of the woman and would have rebuked her.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Would have known ... - </b>Because Jesus did not rebuke her and drive her from his presence, he inferred that he could not be acquainted with her character. The Pharisees considered it improper to hold communion with those who were notorious sinners. They judged our Saviour by their own rules, and supposed that “he” would act in the same way; and Simon therefore concluded that he did not know her character and could not be a prophet. Jesus did not refuse the society of the guilty. He came to save the lost; and no person ever came to him so sure of finding a “friend,” as those who came conscious that they were deeply depraved, and mourning on account of their crimes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That toucheth him - </b>The “touch” of a Gentile, or a person singularly wicked, they supposed to be polluting, and the Pharisees avoided it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:11">Matthew 9:11</span>.</p>
