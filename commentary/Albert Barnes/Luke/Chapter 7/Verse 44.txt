<p style=" "><b>Seest thou this woman? - </b>You see what this woman has done to me, compared with what you have done. She has shown me expressions of regard which you, in your own house, have not shown.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I entered into thine house - </b>I came at your invitation, where I might expect all the usual rites of hospitality.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou gavest me no water for my feet - </b>Among Eastern people it was customary, before eating, to wash the feet; and to do this, or to bring water for it, was one of the rites of hospitality. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:4">Genesis 18:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+19:21">Judges 19:21</span>. The reasons for this were, that they wore “sandals,” which covered only the bottom of the feet, and that when they ate they reclined on couches or sofas. It became therefore necessary that the feet should be often washed.</p>
