<p style=" "><b>Thou gavest me no kiss - </b>The kiss was a token of affection or a common mode of salutation, and Simon had even neglected this mark of welcoming him to his house. It was often used among “men” as a sign of salutation. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:4">Genesis 33:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+18:7">Exodus 18:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:49">Matthew 26:49</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath not ceased to kiss my feet - </b>How striking the difference between the conduct of Simon and this woman! He, with all the richness of a splendid preparation, had omitted the common marks of regard and affection. She, in humility, had bowed at his feet, had watered them with tears, and had not ceased to kiss them. The most splendid entertainments do not always express the greatest welcome. There may be in such entertainments much insincerity - much seeking of popularity or some other motive; but no such motive could have operated in inducing a broken-hearted sinner to wash the Saviour’s “feet” with tears.</p>
