<p style=" "><b>Mary called Magdalene - </b>So called from “Magdula,” the place of her residence. It was situated on the Sea of Galilee, south of Capernaum. To this place Jesus retired after feeding the 4,000. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:39">Matthew 15:39</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Out of whom went - </b>By the power of Jesus.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Seven devils - </b>The word “seven” is often used for an indefinite number, and “may” signify merely “many” devils. The expression is used to signify that she was grievously tormented, and rendered, doubtless, insane by the power of evil spirits. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>. It has been commonly supposed that Mary Magdalene was a woman of abandoned character, but of this there is not the least evidence. All that we know of her is that she was formerly grievously afflicted by the presence of those evil spirits, that she was perfectly cured by Jesus, and that afterward she became one of his most faithful and humble followers. She was at his crucifixion <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span> and burial <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:47">Mark 15:47</span>, and she was among those who had prepared the materials to embalm him <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span>, and who first went to the sepulchre after the resurrection; and what is particularly interesting in her history, she was the first to whom the risen Redeemer appeared <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:9">Mark 16:9</span>, and his conversation with her is exceeded in interest and pathos by no passage of history, sacred or profane, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span>.</p>
