For the Son of man ... - You should imitate, in your spirit, the Son of man. “He” came not to destroy. If he had come for that purpose, he would have destroyed these Samaritans; but he came to save. He is not soon angry. “He” bears patiently opposition to himself, and “you” should bear opposition to “him.” You should catch his spirit; temper your zeal like his; seek to do good to those who injure you and him; be mild, kind, patient, and forgiving.
