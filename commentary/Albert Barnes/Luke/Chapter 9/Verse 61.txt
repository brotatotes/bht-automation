Jesus did not suffer this, because he probably saw that he would be influenced by a love of his friends, or by their persuasions, not to return to him. The purpose to be a Christian requires “decision.” Men should not tamper with the world. They should not consult earthly friends about it. They should not even allow worldly friends to give them “advice” whether to be Christians or not. God is to be obeyed rather than man, and they should come forth boldly, and resolve at once to give themselves to his service.
