<p style=" "><b>Now after that John was put in prison - </b>John was imprisoned by Herod, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3">Matthew 14:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Jesus came into Galilee - </b>He left Judea and went into the more retired country of Galilee. He supposed that if he remained in Judea, Herod would also persecute him and attempt to take his life. His time of death had not come, and he therefore prudently sought safety in retirement. Hence, we may learn that when we have great duties to perform for the church of God, we are not to endanger our lives wantonly. When we can secure them without a sacrifice of principle, we are to do it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:16">Matthew 24:16</span>.</p>
