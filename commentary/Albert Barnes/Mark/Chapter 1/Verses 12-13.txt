<p style=" ">Here Mark relates concisely what Matthew has recorded more at length in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:0">Mark 4:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Spirit driveth - </b>The word “driveth” does not mean that he was compelled forcibly against his will to go there, but that he was inclined to go there by the Spirit, or was led there. The Spirit of God, for important purposes, caused him to go. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:25">Matthew 9:25</span>, where the same word is used in the original: “And when they were all put forth” in Greek, “all driven out.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And was with the wild beasts - </b>This is added to show the desolation and danger of his dwelling there. In this place, surrounded by such dangers, the temptations offered by Satan were the stronger. Amid want and perils, Satan might suppose that he would be more easily seduced from God. But he trusted in his Father, and was alike delivered from dangers, from the wild beasts, and from the power of temptation, thus teaching us what to do in the day of danger and trial.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the angels ministered unto him - </b>From <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:2">Luke 4:2</span> we learn that in those days he did eat nothing. When Mark says, therefore, that the angels ministered to him, it means after the days of temptation had expired, as is said by <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:11">Matthew 4:11</span>.</p>
