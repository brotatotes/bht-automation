<p style=" "><b>Let us alone - </b>Though only one impure spirit is mentioned as possessing this man, yet that spirit speaks also in the name of others.</p>
<p style=" ">They were leagued together in the work of evil, and this one knew that if he was punished, others would also share the same fate.</p>
<p style=" "><b>What have we to do with thee? - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>. By this the spirit meant to say that, if Jesus cast him out, he would use an improper interference. But this was untrue. The possession of the man was a direct assault upon God and his works. Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil, and Jesus had a right, therefore, to liberate the captive, and to punish him who had possessed him. So Satan still considers it an infringement of his rights when God frees a “sinner” from bondage and destroys his influence over the soul. So he still asks to be let alone, and to be suffered to lead people captive at his will.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Art thou come to destroy us? - </b>Implying that this could not be the intention of the “benevolent” Messiah; that to be cast out of that man would, in fact, be his destruction, and that therefore he might be suffered still to remain. Or it may imply, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>, that the time of their destruction had not come, and that he ought not to destroy them before that.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I know thee who thou art - </b>Evil spirits seem to have been acquainted at once with the Messiah. Besides, they had learned from his miracles that he was the Messiah, and had power over them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Holy One of God - </b>The Messiah. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>. Jesus is called “the Holy One of God” because:</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:25">Mark 1:25</span></p>
<p style=" "><b>And they were all amazed ... - </b>The power of casting out devils was new to them.</p>
<p style=" ">It was done by a word. Jesus did it in his own name and by his own authority. This proved that he was superior to all the unclean spirits. In consequence, Jesus’ fame spread throughout all the country, and the impression became prevalent that he was the Messiah.</p>
