<p style=" "><b>Jesus went before him - </b>In the manner of an intrepid, fearless leader and guide, exposing “himself” to danger and death rather than his followers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they rather amazed ... - </b>They were afraid that evil would befall him in the city; that the scribes and Pharisees, who had so often sought to kill him, would then do it. Their fear and amazement were increased when he told them what would befall him there. They were amazed that, when he knew so well what would happen, he should still persevere in going up to the city.</p>
