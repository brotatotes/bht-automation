<p style=" "><b>Casting away his garment - </b>That is, his outer garment - the one that was thrown loosely over him. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>. He threw it off, full of joy at the prospect of being healed, and that he might run without impediment to Jesus. This may be used to illustrate - though it had no such original reference - the manner in which a sinner should come to Jesus. He should throw away the garments of his own righteousness - he should rise speedily - should run with joy - should have full faith in the power of Jesus, and cast himself entirely upon his mercy.</p>
