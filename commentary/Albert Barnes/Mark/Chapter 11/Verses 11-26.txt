<p style=" "><b>And when ye stand praying - </b>When ye pray. It seems that the posture in prayer was sometimes standing and sometimes kneeling. God looks upon “the heart” rather than upon our position in worship; and if the heart be right, any posture may be proper. It cannot be doubted, however, that in private, in the family, and wherever it can be conveniently done, the kneeling posture is more proper, as expressing more humility and reverence, and more in accordance with Scripture examples. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:6">Psalms 95:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+6:13">2 Chronicles 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+6:10">Daniel 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:41">Luke 22:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:40">Acts 9:40</span>. Yet a subject like this may be made of too much consequence, and we should be careful that anxiety about a mere form should not exclude anxiety about a far more important matter - the state of the soul.</p>
