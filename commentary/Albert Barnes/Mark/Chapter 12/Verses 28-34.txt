<p style=" ">This answer of the scribe is not found in Matthew.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is more than all - </b>Is of more importance and value.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Discreetly - </b>Wisely, according to truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not far from the kingdom of God - </b>Thou who dost prefer the “internal” to the “external” worship of God - who hast so just a view of the requirements of the law - canst easily become a follower of me, and art almost fit to be numbered among my disciples. This shows that a proper understanding of the Old Testament, of its laws and requirements, would prepare the mind for Christianity, and suit a person at once to embrace it when presented. One system is grafted on the other, agreeably to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And no man after that durst ask him any question - </b>That is, no one of the scribes, the Pharisees, or the Sadducees durst ask him a question for the purpose of “tempting” him or entangling him. He had completely silenced them. It does not appear, however, but that his “disciples” dared to ask him questions for the purpose of information.</p>
