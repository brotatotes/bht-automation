And the scripture was fulfilled ... - This passage of Scripture is found in Isaiah 53:12. This does not mean that he “was” a transgressor, but simply that in dying he “had a place” with transgressors. Nor does it mean that God regarded him as a sinner; but that at his death, in popular estimation. or by the sentence of the judge, he was “regarded as” a transgressor, and was treated in the same manner as the others who were put to death for their transgressions. Jesus died, the “just” for the “unjust,” and in his death, as well as in his life, he was “holy, harmless, undefiled.”
