Afterward he appeared unto the eleven - Judas was dead, and the apostles were then called “the eleven.” This was done even when one of them was absent, as Thomas was on this occasion. See the “Harmony of the Accounts of the Resurrection, Appearances, and Ascension of Christ,” at the close of the notes on Matthew.As they sat at meat - The word meat here means food, or meals. As they were reclining at their meals.And upbraided them ... - Rebuked them, or reproached them. This was done because, after all the evidence they had had of his resurrection, still they did not believe. This is a most important circumstance in the history of our Lord’s resurrection. Never were people more difficult to be convinced of anything than they were of that fact. And this shows conclusively that they had not conspired to impose on the world; that they had given up all for lost when he died; that they did not expect his resurrection; and all this is the strongest proof that he truly rose. They were not convinced until it was impossible for them longer to deny it. Had they expected it, they would have caught easily at the slightest evidence, and would have turned every circumstance in favor of such an event. It may be added that it was impossible that eleven men of good natural understanding should have been deceived in so plain a case. They had been with Jesus three years; they perfectly knew his features, voice, manner; and it is not credible that they should have been deceived by anyone who might have pretended to have been the Lord Jesus.
