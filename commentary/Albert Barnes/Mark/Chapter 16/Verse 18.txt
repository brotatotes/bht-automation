<p style=" "><b>They shall take up serpents - </b>When it is necessary for the sake of establishing religion, they shall handle poisonous reptiles without injury, thus showing that God was with them to keep them from harm. This was literally fulfilled when Paul shook the viper from his hand. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:5-6">Acts 28:5-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Any deadly thing - </b>Any poison usually causing death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall not hurt them - </b>There is a similar promise in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:2">Isaiah 43:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They shall lay hands on the sick ... - </b>See instances of this in the Acts of the Apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6-7">Acts 3:6-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span>, etc.</p>
