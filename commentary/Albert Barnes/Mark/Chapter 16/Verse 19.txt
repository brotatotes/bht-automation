<p style=" "><b>He was received up into heaven - </b>In a cloud from the Mount of Olives. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The right hand of God - </b>We are not to suppose that God has hands, or that Jesus sits in any particular direction from God. This phrase is taken from the manner of speaking among men, and means that he was exalted to honor and power in the heavens. It was esteemed the place of the highest honor to be seated at the right hand of a prince. So, to be seated at the right hand of God, means that Jesus is exalted to the highest honor of the universe. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-22">Ephesians 1:20-22</span>.</p>
