Jesus probably remained long enough in the desert to heal the sick who were brought to him, and to give instructions to the multitudes who attended his preaching. Capernaum was not “the city” mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:45">Mark 1:45</span>, and it is probable that there was no difficulty in his remaining there and preaching.</p>
