<p style=" "><b>Son - </b>Literally, “child.” The Hebrews used the words “son” and “child” with a great latitude of signification. They were applied to children, to grandchildren, to adopted children, to any descendants, to disciples, followers, young people, and to dependents. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. In this place it denotes affection or kindness. It was a word of consolation - an endearing appellation, applied by the Saviour to the sick man to show his “compassion,” to inspire confidence, and to assure him that he would heal him.</p>
