<p style=" "><b>Boanerges - </b>This word is made up of two Hebrew words signifying “sons of thunder,” meaning that they, on some accounts, “resembled” thunder. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. It is not known why this name was given to James and John. They are nowhere else called by it. Some suppose it was because they wished to call down fire from heaven and consume a certain village of the Samaritans, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:54">Luke 9:54</span>. It is, however, more probable that it was on account of something fervid, and glowing, and powerful in their genius and eloquence.</p>
