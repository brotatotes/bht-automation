<p style=" "><b>Is a candle brought ... - </b>A candle is not lit up to be put immediately under a measure or a bed, where it can give no light. Its design is to give light. So my preaching by parables is not designed to obscure the truth, but to throw light on it. You should understand those parables, and, understanding them, should impart the truth to others also, as a candle throws its beams upon a dark world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Bushel - </b>The word here used in the original means a measure for grain containing about 12 quarts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Bed - </b>A couch, either to sleep on at night or to recline on at their meals. Probably the latter is here meant, and is equivalent to our saying a candle is not brought to be put “under” the table, but “on” it.
