<p style=" "><b>Take heed what ye hear - </b>Or, consider well what you hear. Make a good improvement of it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With what measure ye mete ... - </b>You shall be treated according to the use you make of your opportunities of learning. If you consider it well, and make a good improvement of what you hear, you shall be well rewarded. If not, your reward shall be small. This is a proverbial expression. See it explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1-2">Matthew 7:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Mete - </b>Measure. With what measure ye measure.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto you that hear - </b>To you who are “attentive,” and who improve what you hear.</p>
