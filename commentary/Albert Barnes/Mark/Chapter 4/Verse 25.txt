<p style=" "><b>For he that hath ... - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:12">Matthew 13:12</span>. The meaning here seems to be, he that diligently attends to my words shall increase more and more in the knowledge of the truth; but he that neglects them and is inattentive shall become more ignorant; the few things which he had learned he will forget, and his trifling knowledge will be diminished.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath not - </b>Does not improve what he possessed, or does not make proper use of his means of learning.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That which he hath - </b>That which he had already learned. By this we are taught the indispensable necessity of giving attention to the means of instruction. The attention must be “continued.” It is not sufficient that we have learned some things, or appear to have learned much. All will be in vain unless we go forward, and improve every opportunity of learning the will of God and the way of salvation. So what children are taught will be of little use unless they follow it up and endeavor to improve themselves.</p>
