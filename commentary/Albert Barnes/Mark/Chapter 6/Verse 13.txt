<p style=" "><b>And anointed with oil ... - </b>Anointing with oil was in common use among the Jews in cases of sickness. It was supposed to have a mild, soothing, and alleviating effect on the body. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14">James 5:14</span>, the elders of the church, in connection with prayer, were directed also to anoint the sick with “oil.” See the notes at that passage. It was also used in wounds. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:6">Isaiah 1:6</span>. The good Samaritan poured oil and wine into the wounds of the waylaid Jew, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:34">Luke 10:34</span>. Josephus says that, in the last sickness of Herod, his physicians commanded him to be anointed with oil. It need not be supposed, however, that the apostles used oil for mere “medical” purposes. It was used, probably, like the imposition of hands, or like our Saviour’s anointing the eyes of the blind with clay; also as a sign, in expectation of imparting that aid and comfort from God which was sought, and which was “represented” by the soothing and gentle effect of oil.</p>
