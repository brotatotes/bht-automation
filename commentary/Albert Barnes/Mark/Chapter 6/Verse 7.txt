<p style=" "><b>And he called unto him the twelve - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:1">Matthew 10:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And began to send them forth by two and two - </b>In order that they might “support” and “encourage” each other in their work. Amid the trials and opposition with which they would meet, mutual counsel and aid would greatly lighten their burdens and alleviate their calamities. Mutual counsel might also contribute to their success, and lead to “united” plans to advance the kingdom of the Redeemer. Jesus here, as in all the work of religion, consulted at the same time the “happiness” and the “usefulness” of his disciples; nor are they ever separated. Whatever contributes to the “usefulness” of his people produces also their happiness; or, in other words, the secret of being happy is to be “useful.”</p>
