<p style=" ">See these verses fully explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:9-15">Matthew 10:9-15</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span> they were commanded not to go among the Gentiles or Samaritans. Mark omits that direction, perhaps, because he was writing for the “Gentiles,” and the direction might create unnecessary difficulty or offence. Perhaps he omits it also because the command was given for a temporary purpose, and was not in force at the time of his writing.</p>
