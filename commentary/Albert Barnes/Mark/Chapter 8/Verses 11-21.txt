<p style=" "><b>Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of Herod - </b>Of the Herodians - of Herod and his followers. Matthew, instead of “Herod,” has “the Sadducees.” It is not improbably that he cautioned them against them all. The Pharisees sought his life, and were exceedingly corrupt in their doctrine and practice; the Sadducees denied some of the essential doctrines of religion, and the Herodians probably were distinguished for irreligion, sensuality, and corrupt living. They were united, therefore, with the Pharisees and Sadducees in opposing the claims of Jesus. Matthew has recorded his caution to avoid the Pharisees and Sadducees, and Mark has added, what Matthew had omitted. the caution likewise to beware of the Herodians. Thus, the evangelists speak the same thing.</p>
