<p style=" "><b>He thought on these things - </b>He did not act hastily. He did not take the course which the law would have permitted him to do, if he had been hasty, violent, or unjust. It was a case deeply affecting his happiness, his character, and the reputation and character of his chosen companion. God will guide the thoughtful and the anxious. And when we have looked patiently at a perplexed subject, and know not what to do, then God, as in the case of Joseph, will interpose to lead us and direct our way. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+25:9">Psalms 25:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The angel of the Lord - </b>The word “angel” literally means a messenger. It is applied chiefly in the Scriptures to those invisible holy beings who have not fallen into sin: who live in heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:6">Jude 1:6</span>); and who are sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13-14">Hebrews 1:13-14</span> notes, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:21">Daniel 9:21</span> note. The word is sometimes applied to men, as messengers <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:24">Luke 7:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:52">Luke 9:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:25">James 2:25</span>; to the winds <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:4">Psalms 104:4</span>; to the pestilence <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:49">Psalms 78:49</span>; or to whatever is appointed to make known or to execute the will of God. It is commonly applied, however, to the unfallen, happy spirits that are in heaven, whose dignity and pleasure it is to do the will of God. Various ways were employed by them in making known the will of God, by dreams, visions, assuming a human appearance, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In a dream - </b>This was a common way of making known the will of God to the ancient prophets and people of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:3">Genesis 20:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+30:1">Genesis 30:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+30:11">Genesis 30:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+30:24">Genesis 30:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:5">Genesis 37:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:1">Genesis 41:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+3:5">1 Kings 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:1">Daniel 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+4:13-15">Job 4:13-15</span>; compare my notes at Isaiah. In what way it was ascertained that these dreams were from God cannot now be ascertained, It is sufficient for us to know that in this way many of the prophecies were communicated, and to remark that there is no evidence that we are to put reliance on our dreams. Dreams are wild, irregular movements of the mind when it is unshackled by reason, and it is mere superstition to suppose that God now makes known His will in this way.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Son of David - </b>Descendant of David. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. The angel put him in mind of his relation to David perhaps to prepare him for the intelligence that Mary was to be the mother of the Messiah - the promised heir of David.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fear not - </b>Do not hesitate, or have any apprehensions about her virtue and purity. Do not fear that she will be unworthy of you, or will disgrace you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To take unto thee Mary thy wife - </b>To take her as thy wife; to recognize her as such, and to treat her as such.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost - </b>Is the direct creation of divine power. A body was thus prepared pure and holy, and free from the corruption of sin, in order that he might be qualified for his great work the offering of a pure sacrifice to God. As this was necessary in order to the great work which he came to perform, Joseph is directed by an angel to receive her as pure and virtuous, and as every way worthy of his love.
