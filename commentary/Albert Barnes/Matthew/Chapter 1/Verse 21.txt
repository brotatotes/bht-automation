<p style=" "><b>His name Jesus - </b>The name Jesus is the same as Saviour. It is derived from the verb signifying to save, In Hebrew it is the same as Joshua. In two places in the New Testament it is used where it means Joshua, the leader of the Jews into Canaan, and in our translation the name Joshua should have been retained, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:45">Acts 7:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:8">Hebrews 4:8</span>. It was a very common name among the Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He shall save - </b>This expresses the same as the name, and on this account the name was given to him. He saves people by dying to redeem them; by giving the Holy Spirit to renew them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7-8">John 16:7-8</span>; by His power in enabling them to overcome their spiritual enemies, in defending them from danger, in guiding them in the path of duty, in sustaining them in trials and in death; and He will raise them up at the last day, and exalt them to a world of purity and love.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His people - </b>Those whom the Father has given to him. The Jews were called the people of God because he had chosen them to himself, and regarded them as His special and beloved people, separate from all the nations of the earth. Christians are called the people of Christ because it was the purpose of the Father to give them to him <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>; and because in due time he came to redeem them to himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From their sins - </b>This was the great business of Jesus in coming and dying. It was not to save people in their sins, but from their sins. Sinners could not be happy in heaven. It would be a place of wretchedness to the guilty. The design of Jesus was, therefore, to save them from sin; and from this we may learn:</p>
<p style=" ">1. That Jesus had a design in coming into the world. He came to save his people; and that design will surely be accomplished. It is impossible that in any part of it he should fail.</p>
<p style=" ">2. We have no evidence that we are his people unless we are saved from the power and dominion of sin. A mere profession of being His people will not answer. Unless we give up our sins; unless we renounce the pride, pomp, and pleasure of the world, we have no evidence that we are the children of God. It is impossible that we should be Christians if we indulge in sin and live in the practice of any known iniquity. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:7-8">1 John 3:7-8</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">3. That all professing Christians should feel that there is no salvation unless it is from sin, and that they can never be admitted to a holy heaven hereafter unless they are made pure, by the blood of Jesus, here.</p>
