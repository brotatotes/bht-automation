<p style=" "><b>Behold, a virgin shall be with child - </b>Matthew clearly understands this as applying literally to a virgin. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:34">Luke 1:34</span>. It thus implies that the conception of Christ was miraculous, or that the body of the Messiah was created directly by the power of God, agreeably to the declaration in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>; “Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they shall call his name Emmanuel - </b>That is, his name shall be so called. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span>. The word “Immanuel” is a Hebrew word, <span class="_800000">צמנוּאל</span> ‛immânû'êl; cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ἐμμανουήλ</span></span> Emmanouēl, and literally means “God with us.” Matthew doubtless understands it as denoting that the Messiah was really “God with us,” or that the divine nature was united with the human. He does not affirm that this was its meaning when used in reference to the child to whom it was first applied, but this is its signification as applicable to the Messiah. It was suitably expressive of his character; and in this sense it was fulfilled. When first used by Isaiah, it denoted simply that the birth of the child was a sign that God was with the Jews to deliver them. The Hebrews often incorporated the name of Yahweh, or God, into their proper names. Thus, Isaiah means “the salvation of Yah;” Eleazer, “help of God:” Eli, “my God,” etc. But Matthew evidently intends more than was denoted by the simple use of such names. He had just given an account of the miraculous conception of Jesus: of his being begotten by the Holy Spirit. God was therefore his Father. He was divine as well as human. His appropriate name, therefore, was “God with us.” And though the mere use of such a name would not prove that he had a divine nature, yet as Matthew uses it, and meant evidently to apply it, it <i>does</i> prove that Jesus was more than a man; that he was God as well as man. And it is this which gives glory to the plan of redemption. It is this which is the wonder of angels. It is this which makes the plan so vast, so grand, so full of instruction and comfort to Christians. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6-8">Philippians 2:6-8</span>. It is this which sheds such peace and joy into the sinner’s heart; which gives him such security of salvation, and which renders the condescension of God in the work of redemption so great and his character so lovely.</p>
