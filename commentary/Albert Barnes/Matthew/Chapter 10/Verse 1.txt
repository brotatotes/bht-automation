<p style=" "><b>And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples ... - </b>This account of sending the apostles forth is recorded also in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7-11">Mark 6:7-11</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1-6">Luke 9:1-6</span>. Mark says that he sent them out two and two. This was a kind arrangement, that each one might have a companion, and that thus they might visit more places and accomplish more labor than if they were all together. These twelve were the original number of apostles. The word “apostle” means one that is “sent,” and was given to them because they were “sent forth” to preach the gospel. They were ambassadors of Christ. To this number Matthias was afterward added, to supply the place of Judas <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:26">Acts 1:26</span>, and Paul was specially called to be an apostle to the Gentiles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8-9">1 Corinthians 15:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>. In all, therefore, there were 14 apostles.</p>
<p style=" ">In selecting “twelve” at first, it is probable that the Saviour was somewhat guided by the number of the tribes of Israel. Twelve was, with them, a well-known number, and it was natural that he should select one for every tribe. Their office was clearly made known. They were to heal the sick, cast out devils, raise the dead, preach the gospel. They were to be with him to receive his instructions, to learn the nature of his religion, be witnesses to his resurrection, and then to bear his gospel around the globe. The number twelve was the best number for these purposes that could be selected. It was sufficiently “large” to answer the purpose of testimony, and it was “so small” as not to tend to disorder, or that they could easily be divided into parties or factions. They were not learned men, and could not be supposed to spread their religion by art or talents. They were not men of wealth, and could not bribe men to follow them. They were not men of rank and office, and could not compel people to believe. They were just such men as are always found the best witnesses in courts of justice - plain men, of good sense, of fair character, of great honesty, and with favorable opportunities of ascertaining the facts to which they bore witness. Such men everybody believes, and especially when they are willing to lay down their lives to prove their sincerity.</p>
<p style=" ">It was important that the Saviour should choose them early in his ministry, in order that they might be fully acquainted with him; might treasure up his instructions, and observe his manner of life and his person, so that, by having been long acquainted with him, they might be able to testify to his identity and be competent witnesses of his resurrection. No witnesses were ever so well qualified to give testimony as they, and none ever gave so much evidence of their sincerity as they did.
