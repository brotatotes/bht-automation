<p style=" "><b>But beware of men - </b>That is, be on your guard against people who are like wolves, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span>. Do not run unnecessarily into danger. Use suitable prudence and caution, and do not needlessly endanger your lives.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Councils - </b>The word used here commonly signifies the great council of the nation, the Sanhedrin. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>. Here it seems to refer to any judicial tribunal, of which there were some in every village.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They will scourge you in their synagogues - </b>Scourging, or “whipping,” is often mentioned in the New Testament as a mode of punishment. The law of Moses directed that the number of stripes should not exceed 40, but might be any number less, at the discretion of the judge, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+25:2-3">Deuteronomy 25:2-3</span>. The person who was sentenced to scourging was formerly laid upon the ground, and the blows inflicted on his back in the presence of the judge. In later times the criminal was tied to a low post. Scourging is still practiced in the East, but the blows are commonly inflicted on the soles of the feet. It is called the “bastinado.”</p>
<p style=" ">The instrument formerly used was a “rod.” Afterward they employed thongs or lashes attached to the rod. To make the blows severe and more painful, they sometimes fastened sharp points of iron or pieces of lead in the thongs. These were called “scorpions,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+12:11">1 Kings 12:11</span>. The law was express that the number of stripes should not exceed forty. The Jews, to secure greater accuracy in counting, used a scourge with three lashes, which inflicted three stripes at once. With this the criminal was struck thirteen times, making the number of blows thirty-nine. Paul was five times scourged in this way. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:24">2 Corinthians 11:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The Romans did not feel themselves bound by the law of the Jews in regard to the “number” of stripes, but inflicted them at pleasure. Thus our Saviour was scourged until he was so weak as not to be able to bear his cross. This was often done in the synagogue. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:19">Acts 22:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>.</p>
