<p style=" "><b>And ye shall be brought ... - </b>This prediction was completely and abundantly fulfilled, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:26">Acts 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1-4">Acts 12:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:33">Acts 23:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:1">Acts 26:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:28">Acts 26:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:30">Acts 26:30</span>. Peter is said to have been brought before Nero, and John before Domitian, Roman emperors; and others before Parthian, Scythian, and Indian kings. They were to stand there to bear a testimony against them; or, as it might be rendered, to them. That is, they were to be “witnesses to them” of the great facts and doctrines of the Christian religion; and if they rejected Christianity, they would be witnesses “against” them in the day of judgment. The fulfillment of this prophecy is a signal evidence that Christ possessed a knowledge of the future. Few things were more improbable when this was uttered than that the fishermen of Galilee would stand before the illustrious and mighty monarchs of the East and the West.</p>
