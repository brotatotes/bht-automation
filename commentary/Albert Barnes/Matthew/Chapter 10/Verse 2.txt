<p style=" "><b>Now the names of the twelve apostles - </b>The account of their being called is more fully given in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:13-18">Mark 3:13-18</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12-19">Luke 6:12-19</span>. Each of those evangelists has recorded the circumstances of their appointment. They agree in saying it was done on a mountain; and, according to Luke, it was done before the sermon on the mount was delivered, perhaps on the same mountain, near Capernaum. Luke adds that the night previous had been spent “in prayer” to God. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Simon, who is called Peter - </b>The word “Peter” means a rock. He was also called Cephas, <span class="_0000ff"><u>Joh 1:42</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:5">1 Corinthians 15:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>. This was a Syro-Chaldaic word signifying the same as Peter. This name was given probably in reference to the “resoluteness and firmness” which he was to exhibit in preaching the gospel. Before the Saviour’s death he was rash, impetuous, and unstable. Afterward, as all history affirms, he was firm, zealous, steadfast, and immovable. The tradition is that he was at last crucified at Rome with his head downward, thinking it too great an honor to die as his Master did. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span>. There is no certain proof, however, that this occurred at Rome, and no absolute knowledge as to the place where he died.</p>
<p style=" "><b>James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother - </b>This James was killed by Herod in a persecution, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>. The other James, the son of Alpheus, was stationed at Jerusalem, and was the author of the epistle that bears his name. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:13">Acts 15:13</span>. A James is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span> as “the Lord’s brother.” It has not been easy to ascertain why he was thus called. He is here called the son of “Alpheus,” that is, of Cleophas, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span>. Alpheus and Cleophas were but different ways of writing and pronouncing the same name. This Mary, called the mother of James and Joses, is called the wife of Cleophas, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span>.</p>
