<p style=" "><b>Ye shall be hated of all men - </b>That is, of all kinds of people. The human heart would be opposed to them, because it is opposed to Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But he that endureth to the end ... - </b>That is, to the end of life, be it longer or shorter. He that bears all these unspeakable sufferings, and who does not shrink and apostatize, will give decisive evidence of attachment to me, and shall enter into heaven. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21-22">Revelation 3:21-22</span>.</p>
