<p style=" "><b>Philip and Bartholomew - </b>These two were probably sent out together. Philip was a native of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. He is not the same as Philip the evangelist, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:8">Acts 21:8</span>. Bartholomew (literally, “the son of Tolmai”).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thomas - </b>Literally, “a twin,” in reference to which he is also called “Didymus,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:16">John 11:16</span>. For his character, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:25">John 20:25</span>. “And Matthew the publican.” See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:9">Matthew 9:9</span>. “James the son of Alpheus.” See the note above.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And Lebbeus, called Thaddeus - </b>These two words have the same signification in Hebrew. Luke calls him “Judas,” by a slight change from the name “Thaddeus.” Such changes are common in all writings.</p>
