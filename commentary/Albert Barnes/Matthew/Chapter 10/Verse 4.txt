<p style=" "><b>Simon the Canaanite - </b>Luke calls him “Simon Zelotes,” the zealous. It is probable that he was one of a small sect of the Jews called “Zealots,” on account of special zeal in religion. His native place was probably “Cana.” Afterward he might with propriety be called by either title.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Judas Iscariot - </b>It is probable this name was given to him to designate his native place. Carioth was a small town in the tribe of Judah.</p>
