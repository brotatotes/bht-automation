<p style=" "><b>Into the way of the Gentiles - </b>That is, among the Gentiles, or nowhere but among the Jews. The full time for preaching the gospel to the Gentiles was not come. It was proper that it should be first preached to the Jews, the ancient covenant people of God, and the people among whom the Messiah was born. Afterward he gave them a charge to go into all the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not - </b>The Samaritans occupied the country formerly belonging to the tribe of Ephraim and the half-tribe of Manasseh. This region was situated between Jerusalem and Galilee; so that in passing from the one to the other, it was a direct course to pass through Samaria. The capital of the country was Samaria, formerly a large and splendid city. It was situated about 15 miles to the northwest of the city of Shechem or Sychar (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:5">John 4:5</span>), and about 40 miles to the north of Jerusalem. For a description of this city, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:1">Isaiah 28:1</span>. Sychar or Shechem was also a city within the limits of Samaria.</p>
<p style=" ">This people was formerly composed of a few of the ten tribes and a mixture of foreigners. When the ten tribes were carried away into captivity to Babylon, the King of Assyria sent people from Cutha, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim to inhabit their country, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:24">2 Kings 17:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+4:2-11">Ezra 4:2-11</span>. These people at first worshipped the idols of their own nations; but, being troubled with lions, which had increased greatly while the country remained uninhabited, they supposed it was because they had not honored the God of the country. A Jewish priest was therefore sent to them from Babylon to instruct them in the Jewish religion. They were instructed partially from the books of Moses, but still retained many of their old rites and idolatrous customs, and embraced a religion made up of Judaism and idolatry, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:26-28">2 Kings 17:26-28</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The grounds of difference between the two nations were the following:</p>
<p style=" ">1. The Jews, after their return from Babylon, set about rebuilding their temple. The Samaritans offered to aid them. The Jews, however, perceiving that it was not from a love of true religion, but that they might obtain a part of the favors granted to the Jews by Cyrus, rejected their offer. The consequence was, that a stare of long and bitter animosity arose between them and the Jews.</p>
<p style=" ">2. While Nehemiah was engaged in building the walls of Jerusalem, the Samaritans used every art to thwart him in his undertaking, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ne+6:1-14">Nehemiah 6:1-14</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">3. The Samaritans at length obtained leave of the Persian monarch to build a temple for themselves. This was erected on “Mount Gerizim,” and they strenuously contended that that was the place designated by Moses as the place where the nation should worship. Sanballat, the leader of the Samaritans, constituted his son-in-law, Manasses, high priest. The religion of the Samaritans thus became perpetuated, and an irreconcilable hatred arose between them and the Jews. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:20">John 4:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">4. Afterward Samaria became a place of resort for all the outlaws of Judea. They received willingly all the Jewish criminals and refugees from justice. The violators of the Jewish laws, and those who had been excommunicated, betook themselves for safety to Samaria, and greatly increased their numbers and the hatred which subsisted between the two nations.</p>
<p style=" ">5. The Samaritans received only the five books of Moses, and rejected the writings of the prophets and all the Jewish traditions. From these causes arose an irreconcilable difference between them, so that the Jews regarded them as the worst of the human race <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span>, and had no dealings with them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:9">John 4:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Our Saviour, however, preached the gospel to them afterward <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:6-26">John 4:6-26</span>, and the apostles imitated his example, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:25">Acts 8:25</span>. The gospel was, however, first preached to the Jews.</p>
