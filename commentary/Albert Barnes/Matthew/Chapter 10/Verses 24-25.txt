<p style=" "><b>The disciple is not above his master ... - </b>That is, you must expect the same treatment which I have received. They have called me, your Master and Teacher, Beelzebub, the prince of the devils (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:15">Luke 11:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span>), and you must expect that they will call all of the family by the same name. “Beelzebub” was a god of the Ekronites. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:2">2 Kings 1:2</span>. The word literally means “the god of flies,” so called because this idol was supposed to protect them from the numerous swarms of flies with which that country abounded. The correct reading here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:15">Luke 11:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:18-19">Luke 11:18-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22">Mark 3:22</span>, is supposed to be, not “Beelzebub,” but “Beelzebul” (Griesbach, Hahn, Robinson, <i>Lexicon</i>) an Aramean form of the word meaning the “god of dung” or “filth.” The name, thus altered by the Jews by changing a single letter, was given to Satan to express supreme contempt and aversion. The Jews seem to have first given to Satan the name of a pagan god, and then, to express their sense of the character of Satan, to have changed that name by altering a single letter so as to express their aversion in the most emphatic manner. By giving the name to Christ, they poured upon him the greatest possible abuse and contempt.</p>
