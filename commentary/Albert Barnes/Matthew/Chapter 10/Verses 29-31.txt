<p style=" "><b>The very hairs of your head are all numbered - </b>That is, each one has exercised the care and attention of God.</p>
<p style=" ">He has fixed the number; and, though of small importance, yet he does not think it beneath him to determine how few or how many they shall be. He will therefore take care of you.</p>
