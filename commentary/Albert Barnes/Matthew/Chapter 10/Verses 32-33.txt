<p style=" "><b>Whosoever therefore shall confess me ... - </b>The same word in the original is translated “confess” and “profess,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12-13">1 Timothy 6:12-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span>. It means to acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ, and our dependence on him for salvation, and our attachment to him, in every proper manner. This profession may be made in uniting with a church, at the communion, in conversation, and in conduct. The Scriptures mean, by a profession of religion, an exhibition of it in every circumstance of the life and before all people. It is not merely in one act that we must do it, but in every act. We must be ashamed neither of the person, the character, the doctrines, nor the requirements of Christ. If we are; if we deny him in these things before people; if we are unwilling to express our attachment to him in every way possible, then it is right that he should “disown all connection with us,” or deny us before God, and he will do it.</p>
