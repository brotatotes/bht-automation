<p style=" "><b>Think not that I am come ... - </b>This is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mic+7:6">Micah 7:6</span>. Christ did not here mean to say that the object of his coming was to produce discord and contention, for he was the Prince of Peace, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:6">Isaiah 11:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>; but he means to say that such would be one of the effects of his coming. One part of a family that was opposed to Him would set themselves against those who believed in him. The wickedness of men, and not the religion of the gospel, is the cause of this hostility. It is unnecessary to say that no prophecy has been more strikingly fulfilled; and it will continue to be fulfilled until all unite in obeying his commandments. Then his religion will produce universal peace. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:21">Matthew 10:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But a sword - </b>The sword is an instrument of death, and to send a sword is the same as to produce hostility and war.</p>
