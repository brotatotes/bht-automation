<p style=" ">1. From the narrative in this chapter, in connection with that in Luke, we are permitted to see the Saviour’s habits in regard to prayer. An important event was before him; an event on which, humanly speaking, depended the whole success of his religion - the choice of those who should be his messengers to mankind. He felt its importance; and even the Son of God sought the place of prayer, and during the nightwatches asked the direction of his Father. His example shows that we, in great and trying circumstances, should seek particularly the direction of God.</p>
<p style=" ">2. We see the benevolence of the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:7-8">Matthew 10:7-8</span>. The apostles were to confer the highest favors on mankind without reward. Like air, and sunbeams, and water - gifts of God - they are without price. The poor are welcome; the rich, unaided by their wealth, are welcome also; the wide world may freely come and partake the rich blessings or the gospel of peace.</p>
<p style=" ">3. Ministers of the gospel, and all the followers of Jesus, should depend on the providence of God for support and the supply of their wants, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:9-10">Matthew 10:9-10</span>. He sent his apostles into a cold, unfriendly world, and he took care of them. So none that trust Him shall lack. The righteous shall not be forsaken. The God who has in His hand all the pearls of the ocean, the gold in the heart of the earth, and the cattle on a thousand hills, and that feeds the raven when it cries, will hear the cries of His children and supply their needs.</p>
<p style=" ">4. We see the duty of treating kindly the messengers of salvation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:11-13">Matthew 10:11-13</span>. Christ expected that in every city and town they would find some who would welcome them. He promised the reward of a prophet to those who should receive a prophet, and assured those of his favor who had nothing better to bestow than even a cup of cold water. The ministers of religion are sent to benefit the world. It is but right that in that world they should be kindly received, and that their wants should be supplied.</p>
<p style=" ">5. The guilt of rejecting the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:14-15">Matthew 10:14-15</span>. It is not a small matter to reject an offer of heaven. A palace, a throne, a rich earthly inheritance, might be rejected, and, compared with rejecting the gospel, it would be a trifle. But life eternal is not like thrones, and gold, and palaces. This lost, all is lost. The gospel rejected, all is gone. Nor hope nor happiness awaits him that hath spurned this offer. God requires everyone to believe the gospel; and woe, woe, a greater woe than befell guilty Sodom and Gomorrah, to him who rejects it.</p>
<p style=" ">6. Judgment will certainly overtake the guilty, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:15">Matthew 10:15</span>. It fell upon Sodom, and it will fall on all transgressors. None shall escape. Damnation may slumber long over the wicked, and they may long mock the God of truth, but in due time their feet will slide, and the whole creation shall not be able to save them from woe. How dangerous, how awful is the condition of an impenitent sinner!</p>
<p style=" ">7. We are to take proper care of our lives, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span>. The apostles were to flee from danger, when they could do it without denying their Lord. So are we. He that throws away his life when it might have been, and ought to have been preserved, is a self-murderer. He that exposes himself when duty does not require it, and whose life pays the forfeit, goes before God “rushing unbidden into his Maker’s presence,” nor can he be held guiltless.</p>
<p style=" ">8. We are to persevere “in our duty” through all trials, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span>. Neither the world, nor pain, nor poverty, nor persecution. nor death is to appal us. He that endures to the end shall be saved. We have but one thing to do - to do the will of God, to “be Christians everywhere,” and to leave the event with him.</p>
<p style=" ">9. God exercises a particular providence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:29-30">Matthew 10:29-30</span>. He watches the falling sparrow, numbers the hairs of the head, and for the same reason he presides over all other things. The Lord reigneth, says the Psalmist, let the earth rejoice, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:1">Psalms 97:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">10. The duty of making a profession of religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32-33">Matthew 10:32-33</span>. It must be done in a proper way, or Christ will disown us in the day of judgment. It is impossible to neglect it, and have evidence of piety. If ashamed of him, he will be ashamed of us.</p>
<p style=" ">11. Religion is easy, and easily tested, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40-42">Matthew 10:40-42</span>. What more easy than to give a cup of water to a stranger, and what more easy than to know from what motive we do it! Yet how many are there who, while they would do the thing, would yet “lose eternal life” rather than do it with a view of honoring Christ or showing attachment to him! How dreadful is the opposition of the human heart to religion! How amazing that man will not do the slightest act to secure an interest in the kingdom of God!</p>
