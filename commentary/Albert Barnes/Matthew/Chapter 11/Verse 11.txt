<p style=" "><b>Among them that are born of women - </b>This is an emphatic way of saying that there “had never” been a greater “man” than John. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+14:1">Job 14:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he - </b>The phrase “kingdom of heaven” is used in many senses. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. It here probably means, “in preaching the kingdom of God,” or the gospel. It could hardly be affirmed of the obscurest and most ignorant Christian that he had clearer views than Isaiah or John; but of the apostles of the Saviour, of the first preachers who were with him and who heard his instructions, it might be said that they had more correct apprehensions than any of the ancient prophets, or than John.</p>
