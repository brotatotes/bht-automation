<p style=" "><b>All the prophets ... - </b>It is meant by this verse that John introduced a new dispensation; and that the old one, under which the prophets and the law of Moses were the guide, was closed when he preached that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. By the “law” is meant here the five books of Moses; by the prophets, the remainder of the books of the Old Testament.</p>
