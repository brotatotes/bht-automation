<p style=" "><b>And thou, Capernaum - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13">Matthew 4:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which art exalted to heaven - </b>This is an expression used to denote great privileges. He meant that they were especially favored with instruction. The city was prosperous. It was signally favored by its wealth. Most of all, it was signally favored by the presence, the preaching, and the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Here he spent a large portion of his time in the early part of his ministry, and in Capernaum and its neighborhood he performed his chief miracles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shalt be brought down to hell - </b>This does not mean that all the people would go to hell, but that the city which had flourished so prosperously would lose its prosperity, and occupy the “lowest place” among cities. The word “hell” is used here, not to denote a place of punishment in the future world, but a state of “desolation and destructions.” It stands in contrast with the word “heaven.” As their being exalted to heaven did not mean that the “people” would all be saved or dwell in heaven, so their being brought down to “hell” refers to the desolation of the “city.” Their privileges, honors, wealth, etc., would be taken away, and they would sink as low among cities as they had been before exalted. This has been strictly fulfilled. In the wars between the Jews and the Romans, Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, etc., were so completely desolated that it is difficult to determine their former situation. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13">Matthew 4:13</span>. It is not to be denied, also, that he threatened future punishment on those who rejected him. The truth inculcated is, that those who are especially favored will be punished accordingly if they abuse their privileges.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If the mighty works ...had been done in Sodom - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:15">Matthew 10:15</span>. Sodom was destroyed on account of its great wickedness. Christ says if his miracles had been performed there, they would have repented, and consequently the city would not have been destroyed. As it was, it would be better for Sodom in the day of judgment than for Capernaum, for its inhabitants would not be called to answer for the abuse of so great privileges.</p>
