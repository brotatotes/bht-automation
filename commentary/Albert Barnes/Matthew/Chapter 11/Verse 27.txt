<p style=" "><b>All things are delivered ... - </b>The same doctrine is clearly taught often in the New Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:35">John 3:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:46">John 6:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:15">John 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16-17">Colossians 1:16-17</span>. It means that Christ has control over all things for the good of his church; that the government of the universe is committed to him “as Mediator,” that he may redeem his people and guide them to glory, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-22">Ephesians 1:20-22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>No man knoweth the Son - </b>That is, such is the nature of the Son of God, such the mystery of the union between the divine and human nature, such his exalted character as “divine,” that no mortal can fully comprehend Jesus. None but God fully knows him. If he had been only a mere man, this language surely would not have been used of him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither knoweth any man the Father ... - </b>In the original this is, neither knoweth “anyone” the Father except the Son. That is, no man or angel clearly and fully comprehends the character of the infinite God; none but the Son - the Lord Jesus - and he to whom he makes him known, have any just apprehensions of his being and perfections.</p>
