<p style=" "><b>Take my yoke - </b>This is a figure taken from the use of oxen, and hence signifying to labor for one, or in the service of anyone. The “yoke” is used in the Bible as an emblem:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)Of bondage or slavery, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+26:13">Leviticus 26:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+28:38">Deuteronomy 28:38</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Of afflictions or crosses, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="la+3:27">Lamentations 3:27</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Of the punishment of sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="la+1:14">Lamentations 1:14</span>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)Of the commandments of God.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)Of legal ceremonies, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">It refers here to the religion of the Redeemer; and the idea is, that they should embrace his system of religion and obey him. All virtue and all religion imply “restraint” - the restraint of our bad passions and inclinations - and subjection to laws; and the Saviour here means to say that the restraints and laws of his religion are mild, and gentle, and easy. Let anyone compare them with the burdensome and expensive ceremonies of the Jews (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>), or with the religious rites of the pagan everywhere, or with the requirements of the Popish system, and he will see how true it is that Jesus’ yoke is easy. And let his laws and requirements be compared with the laws which sin imposes on its votaries - the laws of fashion, and honor, and sensuality - and he will feel that religion is “freedom,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span>. “He is a freeman whom the truth makes free, and all are slaves besides.” It is “easier” to be a Christian than a sinner; and of all the yokes ever imposed on people, that of the Redeemer is the lightest.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For I am meek ... - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:5">Matthew 5:5</span>. This was eminently Christ’s personal character. But this is not its meaning here. He is giving a reason why they should embrace his religion. That was, that he was not harsh, overbearing, and oppressive, like the Pharisees, but meek, mild, and gentle in his government. His laws were reasonable and tender, and it would be easy to obey him.</p>
