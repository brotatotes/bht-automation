<p style=" ">1. A spirit of inquiry about the person and works of Christ is especially proper, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:2-3">Matthew 11:2-3</span>. John was solicitous to ascertain his true character, and nothing is of more importance for all than to understand his true character. Upon him depends all the hope that man has of happiness beyond the grave. He saves, or man must perish. “He” will save, or we must die forever. With what earnestness, therefore, should the old and the young inquire into his character. Our eternal all demands it; and while this is delayed, we are endangering our everlasting felicity.</p>
<p style=" ">2. Clear proof has been furnished that Jesus is the Christ and can save us, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:4-5">Matthew 11:4-5</span>. If his miracles did not prove that he came from God, nothing can prove it. If he could open the eyes of the blind, then he can enlighten the sinner; if he could unstop the ears of the deaf, then he can cause us to hear and live; if he could heal the sick, and make the lame walk, then he can heal our spiritual maladies, and make us walk in the way of life; if he could raise the dead, then he can raise those dead in sin, and breathe into us the breath of eternal life. If he was willing to do all this for the body which is soon to perish, then he will be much more willing to do it for the soul, that never dies. Then the poor, lost sinner may come and live.</p>
<p style=" ">3. We see in this chapter Christ’s manner of praising or complimenting men, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7-15">Matthew 11:7-15</span>. He gave, in no measured terms, his exalted opinion of John - gave him praise which had been bestowed on no other mortal ranked him far above the purest and sublimest of the prophets. But this was not done in the presence of John, “nor was it done in the presence of those who would inform John of it.” It was when the disciples of John had “departed,” and his commendation of John was spoken to “the multitude,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7">Matthew 11:7</span>. He waited until his disciples were gone, apprehending, doubtless, that they would be likely to report what he said in praise of their master, and then expressed his high opinion of his character. The practice of the world is to praise others to their faces, or in the presence of those who will be sure to inform them of it, and to speak evil of them when absent. Jesus delivered his unfavorable opinions of others to the people themselves; their excellences he took pains to commend where they would not be likely to hear of them. He did good to both, and in both prevented the existence of pride.</p>
<p style=" ">4. The wicked take much pains, and are often fickle and inconsistent, for the sake of abusing and calumniating religious people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:18-19">Matthew 11:18-19</span>. They found much fault with the Saviour for doing the very same thing which they blamed John for not doing. So it is commonly with people who slander professors of religion. They risk their own characters, to prove that others are hypocrites or sinners. The object is not truth, but calumny and opposition to religion; and hitherto no means have been too base or too wicked to pour contempt on the followers of Christ.</p>
<p style=" ">5. The purest characters may expect the shaft of calumny and malice, and often in proportion to their purity, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>. Even the Saviour of the world was accused of being intemperate and a glutton. If the only perfectly pure being that ever trod the earth was thus accused, let not his followers think that any strange thing has happened to them if they are falsely accused.</p>
<p style=" ">6. Judgments will overtake guilty people, and cities, and nations, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21-22">Matthew 11:21-22</span>. They fell on Sodom, Tyre, Sidon, and Capernaum. They may long linger; but in due time the hand of God will fall on the wicked, and they will die - forever die.</p>
<p style=" ">7. The wicked will suffer in proportion to their privileges, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23-24">Matthew 11:23-24</span>. So it was with Capernaum. And if they of ancient days suffered thus; if more tremendous judgments fell on them than even on guilty Sodom, what shall be the doom of those who go down to hell from this day of light? The Saviour was indeed there a few days; he worked a few miracles; but they had not, as we have, all his instructions; they had not Sunday schools, and Bible classes, and the stated preaching of the gospel, nor was the world blessed then, as now, with extensive and powerful revivals of religion. How awful must be the doom of those who are educated in the ways of religion - who are instructed from Sabbath to Sabbath - who grow up amid the means of grace - and then are lost!</p>
<p style=" ">8. The poor and needy; the weary and heavy-ladened; the soul sick of sin and of the world; the sinner conscious of guilt and afraid to die, may come to Jesus Christ and live, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28-30">Matthew 11:28-30</span>. The invitation is wide as the world. The child and the old man may seek and find salvation at the feet of the same Saviour. No child is too young; no man is too old: no one is too great a sinner. Christ is “full” of mercy, and all who come shall find peace. O how should we, in this sinful and miserable world, borne down with sin, and exposed each moment to death - how should we come and find the peace which he has promised to all, and take the yoke which all have found to be light!</p>
