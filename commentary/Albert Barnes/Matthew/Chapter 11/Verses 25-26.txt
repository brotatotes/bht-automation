<p style=" "><b>From the wise and prudent - </b>That is, from those who “thought” themselves wise - “wise” according to the world’s estimation of wisdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26-27">1 Corinthians 1:26-27</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hast revealed them unto babes - </b>To the poor, the ignorant, and the obscure; the teachable, the simple, the humble. By the wise and prudent here he had reference probably to the proud and haughty scribes and Pharisees in Capernaum. They rejected his gospel, but it was the pleasure of God to reveal it to obscure and more humble people. The reason given, the only satisfactory reason, is, that it so seemed good in the sight of God. In this the Saviour acquiesced, saying, “Even so, Father;” and in the dealings of God it is proper that all should acquiesce. “Such is the will of God” is often the only explanation which can be offered in regard to the various events which happen to us on earth. “Such is the will of God” is the only account which can be given of the reason of the dispensations of his grace. Our understanding is often confounded. We are unsuccessful in all our efforts at explanation. Our philosophy fails, and all that we can say is, “Even so, Father; for so it seems good to thee.” And this is enough. That God does a thing, is, after all, the best reason which we “can” have that it is right. It is a “security” that nothing wrong is done; and though now mysterious, yet light will hereafter shine upon it like the light of noonday. I have more certainty that a thing is right if I can say that I know such is the will of God, than I could have by depending on my own reason. In the one case I confide in the infallible and most perfect God; in the other I rely on the reason of a frail and erring man. God never errs; but nothing is more common than for people to err.</p>
