<p style=" "><b>Go and show John again ... - </b>Jesus referred them for an answer to these miracles. They were proof that he was the Messiah. Prophets had indeed performed miracles, but no prophet had performed so many, or any so important. Jesus, moreover, performed them “in his own name” and by his own power. Prophets had done it by the power of God. Jesus, therefore, performed the works which none but the Messiah could do, and John might easily infer that he was the Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The poor have the gospel preached to them - </b>It was predicted of the Messiah that he would preach good tidings to the meek <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>; or, as it is rendered in the New Testament, “He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>. By this, therefore, also, John might infer that he was truly the Messiah. It adds to the force of this testimony that the “poor” have always been overlooked by Pharisees and philosophers. No sect of philosophers had condescended to notice them before Christ, and no system of religion had attempted to instruct them before the Christian religion. In all other schemes the poor have been passed by as unworthy of notice.</p>
