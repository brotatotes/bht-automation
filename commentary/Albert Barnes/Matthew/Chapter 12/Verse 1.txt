<p style=" "><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1-8">Matthew 12:1-8</span>. The account contained in these verses is also recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:23-28">Mark 2:23-28</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:1-5">Luke 6:1-5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>At that time - </b>Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:1">Luke 6:1</span> fixes the time more particularly. He says that it was “the second Sabbath after the first.” To understand this, it is proper to remark that the “Passover” was observed during the month “Abib,” or Nisan, answering to the latter part of March and the first of April. The feast was held seven days, commencing on the fourteenth day of the month <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:1-28">Exodus 12:1-28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:15">Exodus 23:15</span>, on the “second” day of the paschal week. The law required that a sheaf of “barley” should be offered up as the first-fruits of the harvest, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:10-11">Leviticus 23:10-11</span>. From this day was reckoned seven weeks to the feast of “Pentecost” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:15-16">Leviticus 23:15-16</span>, called also the feast of weeks <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+16:10">Deuteronomy 16:10</span>, and the feast of the harvest, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:16">Exodus 23:16</span>. This second day in the feast of the Passover, or of unleavened bread, was the beginning, therefore, from which they reckoned toward the Pentecost. The Sabbath in the week following would be the “second Sabbath” after this first one in the reckoning, and this was doubtless the time mentioned when Christ went through the fields. It should be further mentioned, that in Judea the barley harvest commences about the beginning of May, and both that and the wheat harvest are over by the twentieth. Barley is in full ear in the beginning of April. There is no improbability, therefore, in this narrative on account of the season of the year. This feast was always held at Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the corn - </b>Through the “barley,” or “wheat.” The word “corn,” as used in our translation of the Bible, has no reference to “maize,” or “Indian corn,” as it has with us. Indian corn was unknown until the discovery of America, and it is scarcely probable that the translators knew anything about it. The word “corn” was applied, as it is still in England, to wheat, rye, oats, and barley. This explains the circumstance that they “rubbed it in their hands” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:1">Luke 6:1</span> to separate the grain from the chaff.</p>
