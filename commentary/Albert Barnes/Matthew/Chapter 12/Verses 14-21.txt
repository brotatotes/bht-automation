<p style=" "><b>And in his name ... - </b>The Hebrew in Isaiah is, “And the isles shall wait for his law.” The idea is, however, the same.</p>
<p style=" ">The “isles” denote the Gentiles, or a part of the Gentiles - those out of Judea. The meaning is, that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles, and that they should receive it. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:1">Isaiah 41:1</span> for an explanation of the word “islands,” as it is used in the Bible.</p>
