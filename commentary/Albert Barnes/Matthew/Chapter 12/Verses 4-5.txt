<p style=" "><b>How he entered into the house of God - </b>That is, the “tabernacle,” the temple not being then built.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have ye not read in the law? - </b>In the law, or in the books of Moses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Profane the Sabbath - </b>He referred them to the conduct of the priests also. On the Sabbath days they were engaged, as well as on other days, in killing beasts for sacrifice, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+28:9-10">Numbers 28:9-10</span>. Two lambs were killed on the Sabbath, in addition to the daily sacrifice. The priests must be engaged in killing them, and making fires to burn them in sacrifice, whereas to kindle a fire was expressly forbidden the Jews on the Sabbath, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+35:3">Exodus 35:3</span>. They did that which, for other persons to do, would have been “profaning” the Sabbath. Yet they were blameless. They did what was necessary and commanded. This was done in the very temple, too, the place of holiness, where the law should be most strictly observed.</p>
