<p style=" "><b>One greater than the temple - </b>Here the Saviour refers to himself, and to his own dignity and power. “I have power over the laws; I can grant to my disciples a dispensation from those laws. An act which I command or permit them to do is therefore right.” This proves that he was divine. None but God can authorize people to do a thing contrary to the divine laws. He refers them again <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:7">Matthew 12:7</span> to a passage he had before quoted (See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>), showing that God preferred acts of righteousness, rather than a precise observance of a ceremonial law.</p>
<p style=" ">Mark adds <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:27">Mark 2:27</span> “the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.” That is, the Sabbath was intended for the welfare of man; it was designed to promote his happiness, and not to produce misery by harsh, unfeeling requirements. It is not to be so interpreted as to produce suffering by making the necessary supply of wants unlawful. Man was not made for the Sabbath. Man was created first, and then the Sabbath was appointed for his happiness, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:1-3">Genesis 2:1-3</span>. His necessities, his real comforts and needs, are not to be made to bend to that which was made “for him.” The laws are to be interpreted favorably to his real wants and comforts. This authorizes works only of real necessity, not of imaginary wants, or amusements, or common business and worldly employments.</p>
