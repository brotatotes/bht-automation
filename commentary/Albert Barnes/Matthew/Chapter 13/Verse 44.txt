<p style=" "><b>The kingdom of heaven - </b>The gospel. The new dispensation. The offer of eternal life. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. The Saviour in this parable compares that kingdom to treasure hid in a field; that is, to money concealed; or more likely to a mine of silver or gold that was unknown to the owner of the field.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He hideth - </b>That is, he conceals the fact that he has found it; he does not tell of it. With a view of obtaining this, Jesus says that a man would go and sell his property and buy the field. The conduct of the man would be dishonest. It would be his duty to inform the owner of the field of the discovery. He would be really endeavoring to gain property belonging to another at far less than its real value, and the principle of real integrity would require him to inform the owner of the discovery. But Christ does not intend to vindicate his conduct. He merely states the way in which people do “actually” manage to obtain wealth. He states a case where a man would actually “sacrifice his property,” and practice diligence and watchfulness to obtain the wealth which he had discovered. The point of the parable lies in his “earnestness,” his anxiety, his care, and his actually obtaining it. The gospel is more valuable than such a treasure, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:10">Psalms 19:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:13-15">Proverbs 3:13-15</span>. It is hidden from most people. When a person sees it and hears it, it is his duty to sacrifice all that hinders his obtaining it, and to seek it with the earnestness with which other people seek for gold. The truth often lies buried: it is like rich veins of ore in the sacred Scriptures; it must be searched out with diligence, and its discovery will repay a man for all his sacrifices, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:33">Luke 14:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span>.</p>
