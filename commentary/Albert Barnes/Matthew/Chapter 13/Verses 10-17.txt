<p style=" "><b>Many prophets and righteous men ... - </b>They wished to see the times of the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" ">They looked to it as a time when the hopes of the world would be fulfilled, and when the righteous would be happy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>. “Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.” Compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:10-12">1 Peter 1:10-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>. So Isaiah and the prophets looked forward to the coming of the Messiah as the consummation of their wishes and the end of the prophecies, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>. The object always dearest to the hearts of all righteous people is to witness the coming and advancement of the kingdom of Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span>.</p>
