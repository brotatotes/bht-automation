<p style=" "><b>Into good ground - </b>Those whose hearts are prepared by grace to receive it honestly, and to give it full opportunity to grow.</p>
<p style=" ">In a rich and mellow soil - in a heart that submits itself to the full influence of truth, unchecked by cares and anxieties; under the showers and summer suns of divine grace; with the heart spread open, like a broad, luxuriant field, to the rays of the morning and to evening dews, the gospel takes deep root and grows; it has full room, and then and there only shows “what it is.”</p>
