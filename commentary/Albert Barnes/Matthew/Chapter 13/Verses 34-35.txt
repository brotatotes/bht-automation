<p style=" "><b>That it might be fulfilled - </b>This is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:2-3">Psalms 78:2-3</span>. The sense, and not the very words of the Psalm, are given. Christ taught, as did that prophet - Asaph - in parables. The words of Asaph described the manner in which Christ taught, and in this sense it could be said that they were fulfilled. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22-23">Matthew 1:22-23</span>.</p>
