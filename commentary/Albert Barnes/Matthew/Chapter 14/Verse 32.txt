<p style=" "><b>And when they were come into the ship the wind ceased - </b>Here was a new proof of the power of Jesus. He that has power over winds and waves has all power. John adds <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:21">John 6:21</span> that the ship was immediately at the land whither they went; another proof, amid this collection of wonders, that the Son of God was with them. They came, therefore, and worshipped him, acknowledging him to be the Son of God. That is, they gave him homage, or honored him as the Son of God.</p>
