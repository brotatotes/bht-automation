<p style=" "><b>And straightway Jesus constrained ... - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45-56">Mark 6:45-56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15-21">John 6:15-21</span>. The word “straightway” means immediately; that is, as soon as the fragments were gathered up. To “constrain” usually means to compel. It here means to command. There was no need of compulsion. They were at this time on the east side of the Lake of Gennesareth. He directed them to get into a ship and cross over to the other side; that is, to Capernaum. Mark adds that he sent them to Bethsaida <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>. Bethsaida was situated at the place where the Jordan empties into the lake on the east side of the river. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span>. It is probable that he directed them to go in a ship or boat to Bethsaida, and remain there till he should dismiss the people, and that he would meet them there, and with them cross the lake. The effect of the miracle on the multitude was so great <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:14">John 6:14</span> that they believed him to be that prophet which should come into the world; that is, the Messiah, the king that they had expected, and they were about to take him by force and make him a king, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>. To avoid this, Jesus got away from them as privately as possible. He went into a solitary mountain alone. In view of the temptation - when human honors were offered to him and almost forced upon him - he retired for private prayer; an example for all who are tempted with human honors and applause. Nothing is better to keep the mind humble and unambitious than to seek some lonely place; to shut out the world with all its honors; to realize that the great God, before whom all creatures and all honors sink to nothing, is round about us; and to ask him to keep us from pride and vainglory.</p>
