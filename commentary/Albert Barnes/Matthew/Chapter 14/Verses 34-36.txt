<p style=" ">1. We learn from this chapter the power of conscience, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1-4">Matthew 14:1-4</span>. Herod’s guilt was the only reason why he thought John the Baptist had risen. At another time he would altogether have disbelieved it. Consciousness of guilt will at some period infallibly torment a man.</p>
<p style=" ">2. The duty of faithfulness, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:4">Matthew 14:4</span>. John reproved Herod at the hazard of his life, and he died for it; but he had the approbation of conscience and of God. So will all who do their duty. Here was an example of fidelity to all ministers of religion. They are not to fear the face of man, however rich, or mighty, or wicked.</p>
<p style=" ">3. The righteous will command the respect of the wicked. Herod was a wicked man, but he respected John and feared him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:20">Mark 6:20</span>. The wicked profess to despise religion, and many really do; but their consciences tell them that religion is a good thing. In times of trial they will sooner trust Christians than others. In sickness and death they are often glad to see them and hear them pray, and desire the comfort which they have; and, like Balsam, say, “Let me die the death of the righteous,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+23:10">Numbers 23:10</span>. No person, young or old, is ever the less really esteemed for being a Christian.</p>
<p style=" ">4. People are often restrained from great sins by mere selfish motives, as Herod was by the love of popularity, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:5">Matthew 14:5</span>. Herod would have put John to death long before had it not been that he feared the people. His constantly desiring to do it was a kind of prolonged murder. God will hold men guilty for desiring to do evil; and will not justify them if they are restrained, not by the fear of him, but by the fear of people.</p>
<p style=" ">5. We see the effect of what is called the principle of honor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:9">Matthew 14:9</span>. It was in obedience to this that Herod committed murder. This is the principle of duelling and war. No principle is so foolish and wicked. The great mass of people disapprove of it. The wise and good have always disapproved of it. This principle of honor is usually the mere love of revenge. It is often the fear of being laughed at. It produces evil. God cannot and will not love it. The way to prevent duels and murders is to restrain the passions and cultivate a spirit of meekness and forgiveness when young; that is, to come early under the full influence of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" ">6. People should be cautious about promises, and especially about oaths. Herod made a foolish promise, and confirmed it by a wicked oath, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:9">Matthew 14:9</span>. Promises should not be made without knowing what is promised, and without knowing that it will be right to perform them. Oaths are always wicked except when made before a magistrate, and on occasions of real magnitude. The practice of profane and common swearing, like that of Herod, is always foolish and wicked, and sooner or later will bring people into difficulty.</p>
<p style=" ">7. Amusements are often attended with evil consequences, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:6-11">Matthew 14:6-11</span>. The dancing of a frivolous and profligate girl was the means of the death of one of the holiest of men. Dancing, balls, splendid parties, and theaters are thought by many to be innocent; but they are a profitless waste of time. They lead to forgetfulness of God. They nourish passion and sensual desires. They often lead to the seduction and ruin of the innocent. They are unfit for dying creatures. From the very midst of such scenes the “happy” may go to the judgment bar of God. How poor a preparation to die! How dreadful the judgment seat to such!</p>
<p style=" ">8. Jesus will take care of the poor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:14-21">Matthew 14:14-21</span>. He regarded the temporal as well as the spiritual needs of the people. Rather than see them suffer, he worked a miracle to feed them. So, rather than see us suffer, God is daily doing what man cannot do. He causes the grain to grow; he fills the land, and seas, and air with living creatures; nay, he provides in desert places for the support of man. How soon would all people and beasts die if he did not put forth continued power and goodness for the supply of our wants!</p>
<p style=" ">9. It is the duty of Christians to be solicitous about the temporal wants of the poor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:15">Matthew 14:15</span>. They are with us. By regarding them, and providing for them, we have an opportunity of showing our attachment to Christ, and our resemblance to God, who continually does good.</p>
<p style=" ">10. A blessing should be sought on our enjoyments, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19">Matthew 14:19</span>. It is always right to imitate Christ. It is right to acknowledge our dependence on God, and in the midst of mercies to pray that we may not forget the Giver.</p>
<p style=" ">11. We see the duty of economy. The Saviour, who had power to create worlds by a word, yet commanded to take up the fragments, that nothing might be lost, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:12">John 6:12</span>. Nothing that God has created and given to us should be wasted.</p>
<p style=" ">12. It is proper to make preparation for private prayer. Jesus sent the people away that he might be alone, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:22-23">Matthew 14:22-23</span>. So Christians should take pains that they may have times and places for retirement. A grove or a mountain was the place where our Saviour sought to pray, and there, too, may we find and worship God.</p>
<p style=" ">13. In time of temptation, of prosperity, and honor, it is right to devote much time to secret prayer. Jesus, when the people were about to make him a king, retired to the mountain, and continued there until the early morning in prayer, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">14. When Christ commands us to do a thing we should do it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:22">Matthew 14:22</span>. Even if it should expose us to danger, it should be done.</p>
<p style=" ">15. In times of danger and distress, Jesus will see us and will come to our relief, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:25-26">Matthew 14:25-26</span>. Even in the tempest that howls, or on the waves of affliction that beat around us, he will come, and we shall be safe.</p>
<p style=" ">16. We should never be afraid of him. We should always have good cheer when we see him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:27">Matthew 14:27</span>. When he says, “It is I,” he also says, “be not afraid.” He can still the waves, and conduct us safely to the port which we seek.</p>
<p style=" ">17. Nothing is too difficult for us when we act under the command of Christ. Peter at his command leaves the ship and walks on the billows, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:29">Matthew 14:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">18. Christ sometimes leaves his people to see their weakness and their need of strength. Without his continued aid they would sink. Peter had no strength of his own to walk on the deep, and Christ suffered him to see his dependence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:30">Matthew 14:30</span>.<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19">Matthew 14:19</span>. The eye, in difficulty, should be fixed on Christ. As soon as Peter began to look at the waves and winds, rather than Christ, he began to sink, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:30">Matthew 14:30</span>. True courage in difficulties consists not in confidence in ourselves, but in confidence in Jesus, the Almighty Saviour and Friend.</p>
<p style=" ">20. Prayer may be instantly answered. When we are in immediate danger, and offer a prayer of faith, we may expect immediate aid, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:31">Matthew 14:31</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">21. Pride comes before a fall. Peter was self-confident and proud, and he fell. His confidence and rashness were the very means of showing the weakness of his faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:31">Matthew 14:31</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">22. It is proper to render homage to Jesus, and to worship him as the Son of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:33">Matthew 14:33</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">23. We should be desirous that all about us should partake of the benefits that Christ confers. When we know him and have tested his goodness, we should take pains that all around us may also be brought to him and be saved, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:35">Matthew 14:35</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">24. Jesus only can make us perfectly whole. No other being can save us. He that could heal the body can save the soul. A word can save us. With what earnestness ought we to plead with him that we may obtain his saving grace! <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:36">Matthew 14:36</span>.</p>
