<p style=" "><b>These are the things which defile a man - </b>These are the true sources of pollution in man.</p>
<p style=" ">These are what corrupt and degrade. It is not the neglect of washing the body which defiles; it is the deep, inward corruption of the heart. And what a fountain of pollution is the human soul! What an array of crimes to proceed from the heart of man! What a proof of guilt! What strictness is there in the law of God! How universal is depravity!</p>
