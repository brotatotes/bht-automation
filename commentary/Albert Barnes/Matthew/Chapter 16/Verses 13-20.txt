<p style=" "><b>Then charged ... - </b>That is, he commanded them.</p>
<p style=" "><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:30">Mark 8:30</span> and Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:21">Luke 9:21</span> say (in Greek) that he strictly or severely charged them. He laid emphasis on it, as a matter of much importance. The reason of this seems to be that his time had not fully come; that he was not willing to rouse the Jewish malice, and to endanger his life, by having it proclaimed that he was the Messiah. The word “Jesus” is wanting in many manuscripts, and should probably be omitted: “Then he charged them strictly to tell no man that he was the Christ or Messiah.”</p>
