<p style=" "><b>For what is a man profited ... - </b>To gain the whole world means to possess it as our own - all its riches, its honors, and its pleasures.</p>
<p style=" ">“To lose his own soul” means to be cast away, to be shut out from heaven, to be sent to hell. Two things are implied by Christ in these questions:</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span></p>
<p style=" ">1. People will often judge far more correctly about natural than about spiritual things, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1-3">Matthew 16:1-3</span>. In respect to natural objects they are watchful. In them they feel a deep interest, and they watch for every sign that may affect their interest. They are too much concerned to judge falsely. But they feel no such interest in religious things. Hence, it happens that people who have good sense and much wisdom in regard to worldly concerns, are often exceedingly foolish in regard to religion. They believe reports respecting religion, revivals, and missions, which they would despise on any other subject. They read and believe newspapers and other publications, which they would hold in contempt on any other topic but religion. They give a degree of weight to arguments against the Bible, and against the doctrines of the gospel, to which they would attach little or no importance on any other subject. They sustain themselves in infidelity by arguments which they would regard as of no force if the same kind of reasoning was urged in defense of anything else.</p>
<p style=" ">2. It is of importance to watch the signs of the times, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:3">Matthew 16:3</span>. In the days of Christ it was the duty of the people to look at the evidence that he was the Messiah. The proofs were clear that he was the Messiah. It is also important to look at the signs of the times in which we live. They are clear also. Much is doing; and the diffusion of the Bible, the labors among the pagan, the distribution of tracts, and perhaps, above all, the institution of Sunday schools, betoken an eventful age, and are an indication that brighter days are about to dawn on the world. We should watch these signs that we may rejoice; that we may pray with more fervor, and that we may do our part to advance the kingdom of God. Little children should grow up believing that they live in an important age; that they enjoy many special privileges, and that they may and must do much to spread the gospel through the earth. Even in childhood, they should pray, and they should give to benefit others; and, most of all, they should give themselves to Christ, that they may benefit others with a right spirit.</p>
<p style=" ">3. Sinners should be addressed with deep feeling and faithfulness, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:12">Mark 8:12</span>. Jesus sighed deeply. So should we. We should not be harsh, or sour, or cold and unfeeling when we address our fellow-men about eternity. We should weep over them, and pray for them, and speak to them, not as if we were better than they, but with an earnest desire for their salvation. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:31">Acts 20:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:18">Philippians 3:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">4. People easily mistake plain instruction, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:7">Matthew 16:7</span>. And especially is this the case where there is any chance of giving a worldly turn to the instruction. If people’s thoughts - even those of Christians were more off from the world, and they thought less of the supply of their temporal wants, they would understand the truths of religion much better than they do. No man can understand the doctrines of religion aright whose principal concern is what he shall eat, and drink, and wear. Hence, even Christians are often strangely ignorant of the plainest truths of religion; and hence the importance of teaching those truths to children before their thoughts become engrossed by the world; and hence, too, the importance of Sunday schools.</p>
<p style=" ">5. We should not have undue anxiety about the supply of our wants. Christ supplied many thousands by a word, and he can easily supply us, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:9-12">Matthew 16:9-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">6. We should learn, from his past goodness, to trust him for the future, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:9-12">Matthew 16:9-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">7. We should be on our guard against error, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:11">Matthew 16:11</span>. It is sly, artful, plausible, working secretly, but effectually. We should always be cautious of what we believe, and examine it by the word of God. False doctrines are often made as much like the truth as possible, for the very purpose of deceiving. “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:14">2 Corinthians 11:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">8. It is important to ascertain our views of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13-15">Matthew 16:13-15</span>. Our all depends on this. If we do not think and feel right respecting him we cannot be safe. We should often, then, ask ourselves - we should ask one another - what we think of Christ.</p>
<p style=" ">9. It is our duty to profess attachment to Christ. It should be done boldly, and always, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span>. We should never be ashamed of him. And to do this, we should always, in our own hearts, believe that he is the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>
<p style=" ">10. We should esteem it a great happiness and honor to be enabled thus to show our attachment to him. The world may not honor us, but God will, and He will pronounce us blessed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">11. God only reveals to people right views of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>. This he does by his word and Spirit. We should, then search the Bible; and we should pray much that God would reveal his Son in us, and enable us boldly to confess him before people.</p>
<p style=" ">12. The church is safe, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>. It may be small - it may be feeble - it may weep much - it may be much opposed and ridiculed - it may have mighty enemies - the rich and the great may set themselves against it - but it is safe. It is founded upon a rock. Its enemies shall never be able to overcome it. Jesus has promised it, and in all ages he has shown that he has remembered his promise. It has not been suffered to become extinct. It has been persecuted, opposed, ridiculed, and almost driven from the world; but a few have been found who have loved the Lord; and soon the flame has kindled, and the church has shone forth “fair as the sun, clear as the moon, and terrible as any army with banners.” So it is still. Feeble churches may mourn much - iniquity may abound - the few pious people may weep in secret places, but Jesus hears their groans and counts their tears, and they and the church are safe. He is their friend, and all the powers of hell shall not prevail against his church.</p>
<p style=" ">13. The importance of prudence in delivering truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>. It should be well-timed - it should be when people are prepared to receive it. Especially is this true of young converts. They have need of milk, and not of strong meat. They should not be surprised that many doctrines of the Bible are mysterious now, but they will fully comprehend them hereafter. Peter, a young convert, did not understand the plain doctrine that Jesus must die for sin, yet it was made clear to him later, and, most cordially, he loved it.</p>
<p style=" ">14. It is highly wicked and improper to attempt to counsel God, or to think that we understand things better than he does, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:22-23">Matthew 16:22-23</span>. God’s plan is the best plan; and though it does not fall within our views of “wisdom,” yet we should be still. It is all wise. What He does we do not know now, yet we shall know hereafter.</p>
<p style=" ">15. We see what religion requires, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span>. We must deny ourselves. We must submit to trials. We must do our duty. We must welcome persecution, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span>. We must be, in all places, among all people, and in every employment, Christians, no matter what may happen. Come poverty, disease, persecution, death, it is ours to take up the cross and do our duty. So, apostles, and martyrs, and the Saviour himself have gone before us, and we must follow in their steps:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Shall I be carried to the skies</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> On flowery beds of ease,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> While others fought to win the prize</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> And sailed through bloody seas?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Sure I must fight if I would reign;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> Increase my courage, Lord,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> To bear the cross, endure the shame,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> Supported by Thy Word.”</p>
<p style=" ">16. How foolish are the people of this world! <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>. In a little time how worthless will be all their wealth! It is gained by anxiety, and toil, and tears. It never satisfies. It harasses them with constant care. It smooths no wrinkles on their brow, alleviates no pain when they are sick, saves no friend from death, gives no consolation in regard to the future, and may be left at any moment. Others will soon possess, and perhaps scatter in dissipation, what they have obtained by so much toil. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:6">Psalms 39:6</span>. And while they scatter or enjoy it, where shall the soul of him be who spent all his probation to obtain it? Alas! Lost, lost, lost - forever lost! And no wealth, no man, no devil, no angel, can redeem him, or be given for his soul. The harvest will be past, the summer ended, and he not saved. In gaining the world he made two things certain - disappointment and trouble here, and an eternity of woe hereafter. How foolish and wicked is man!</p>
<p style=" ">17. The righteous should rejoice that Jesus will come again to our world. He will reward them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>. He will come as their friend, and they shall ascend with him to heaven.</p>
<p style=" ">18. The wicked should weep and wail that Jesus will come again to our world. He will punish them for their crimes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>. They cannot escape. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">19. It will not be long before he will come, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>. At any rate, it will not be long before we shall meet him. Death is near; and then we must stand before him, and give an account of the deeds done in the body.</p>
