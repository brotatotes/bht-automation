<p style=" "><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1-9">Matthew 17:1-9</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:2-10">Mark 9:2-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28-36">Luke 9:28-36</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And after six days - </b>That is, six days from the conversation recorded in the last chapter.</p>
<p style=" ">Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28">Luke 9:28</span> says, about an eight days after. Matthew mentions the six days that intervened between the day of the conversation and the transfiguration. Luke includes both those days, and thus reckons eight. Besides, Luke does not pretend to fix the precise time. He says, “about an eight days after.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Taketh Peter, and James, and John - </b>These three disciples were with him, also, in the garden of Gethsemane, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:33">Mark 14:33</span>. He designed to prepare them in an eminent degree for the work of the gospel ministry by the previous manifestations of his glory, and of his patience in suffering.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into a high mountain apart - </b>That is, apart from the other disciples. It is commonly supposed that this was Mount Tabor, a high mountain in Galilee. The name of the mountain is not, however, mentioned in the New Testament. Luke adds <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28">Luke 9:28</span> that he went up there to pray. Our Saviour prayed much. When he did it he chose to be alone. For this purpose he often ascended mountains or went into the deserts. There is something in the solitude and deep and awful stillness of a lofty mountain favorable to devotion.</p>
