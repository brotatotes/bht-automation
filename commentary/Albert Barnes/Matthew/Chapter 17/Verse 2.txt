<p style=" "><b>And was transfigured before them - </b>The word “transfigure” means to change the appearance or form. It does not denote the change of the substance of a thing, but simply of its appearance. It puts on a new aspect. What this change was we are expressly told.</p>
<p style=" ">1. His face shone as the sun; that is, with a special brightness. A similar appearance is described respecting Moses when he came down from the mount, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:29-30">Exodus 34:29-30</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>, where Christ is called the brightness of the glory of God: in the original, the splendor or shining, like the brightness of the sun.</p>
<p style=" ">2. The second change was that of his garments. They were white as the light. Mark says, “exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth could white them.” The word “fuller” means, commonly, one who dresses cloth or fulls it, so as to make it more thick and strong. Here it means one who bleaches cloth or makes it white; one who cleanses garments when by wearing they become soiled. Among the Greeks that was a distinct trade. Luke says, “white and glistering,” that is, resplendent, shining, or a very bright white. There is no evidence here that what is commonly said of him is true, that his body was so changed as to show what his glorified body is. His body, so far as the sacred writers inform us, underwent no change. All this splendor and glory was a change in appearance only. The Scriptures should be taken just as they are, without any attempt to affix a meaning to them which the sacred writers did not intend.</p>
