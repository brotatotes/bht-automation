<p style=" "><b>Elias is come already - </b>That is, John the Baptist has come, in the spirit and power of Elias. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They have done unto him whatsoever they listed - </b>The word “list” is an old English word, signifying to choose, to desire, to be inclined. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+3:8">Judges 3:8</span>. It means, here, that they had done to John as they pleased; that is, they had put him to death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:10">Matthew 14:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Mark adds <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:12">Mark 9:12</span> that Jesus told them that it was “written of the Son of man that he must suffer many things, and be set at naught.” This was written of him particularly in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1-12">Isaiah 53:1-12</span>. To be set at naught is to be esteemed as worthless or as nothing; to be cast out and despised. No prophecy was ever more strikingly fulfilled. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:11">Luke 23:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:14-21">Luke 23:14-21</span>. This narrative, with some additions, is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:14-29">Mark 9:14-29</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:37-43">Luke 9:37-43</span>.</p>
