<p style=" "><b>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones. ... - </b>That is, one who has become like a little child, or a Christian.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For I say unto you ... - </b>Jesus then proceeds to state the reason why we should not despise his feeblest and obscurest follower. That reason is drawn from the care which God exercises over them. The first instance of that care is, that “in heaven their angels do always behold his face.” He does not mean, I suppose, to state that every good man has his guardian angel, as many of the Jews believed; but that the angels were, in general, the guards of his followers, and aided them and watched over them. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Do always behold the face of God - </b>This is taken from the practice of earthly courts. To be admitted to the presence of a king; to be allowed to see his face continually; to have free access to him at all times, was deemed a mark of special favor <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+10:8">1 Kings 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="es+1:14">Esther 1:14</span>, and was esteemed a security for his protection. So, says our Saviour, we should not despise the obscurest Christian, for he is ministered to by the highest and noblest of beings by beings who are always enjoying the favor and friendship of God.</p>
