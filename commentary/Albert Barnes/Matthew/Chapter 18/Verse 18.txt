<p style=" "><b>Whatsoever ye shall bind ... - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>. These words were spoken to the apostles. Jesus had before addressed the same words to Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>. He employs them here to signify that they all had the same power; that in ordering the affairs of the church he did not intend to give Peter any supremacy or any exclusive right to regulate it. The meaning of this verse is, whatever you shall do in the discipline of the church shall be approved by God or bound in heaven. This promise, therefore, cannot be understood as extending to all Christians or ministers, for all others but the apostles may err.</p>
