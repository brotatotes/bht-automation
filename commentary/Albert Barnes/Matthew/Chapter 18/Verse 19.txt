<p style=" "><b>Again I say unto you, That if two of you ... - </b>This is connected with the previous verses. The connection is this: The obstinate man is to be excluded from the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span>. The care of the church - the power of admitting or excluding members - of organizing and establishing it - is committed to you, the apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span>. Yet there is not need of the whole to give validity to the transaction. When two of you agree, or have the same mind, feelings, and opinion, about the arrangement of affairs in the church, or about things desired for its welfare, and shall ask of God, it shall be done for them. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14-26">Acts 1:14-26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1-29">Acts 15:1-29</span>. The promise here has respect to the apostles in organizing the church. It cannot with any propriety be applied to the ordinary prayers of believers. Other promises are made to them, and it is true that the prayer of faith will be answered, but that is not the truth taught here.</p>
