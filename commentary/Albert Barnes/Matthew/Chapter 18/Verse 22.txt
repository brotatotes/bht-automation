<p style=" "><b>Till seven times? - </b>The Jews caught that a man was to forgive another three times, but not the fourth. Peter more than doubled this, and asked whether forgiveness was to be exercised to so great an extent.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven - </b>The meaning is, that we are not to limit our forgiveness to any fixed number of times. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:24">Genesis 4:24</span>. As often as a brother injures us and asks forgiveness, we are to forgive him. It is, indeed, his duty to ask forgiveness, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:4">Luke 17:4</span>. If he does this, it is our duty to declare that we forgive him, and to treat him accordingly. If he does not ask us to forgive him, yet we are not at liberty to follow him with revenge and malice, but are still to treat him kindly and to do him good, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:30-37">Luke 10:30-37</span>.</p>
