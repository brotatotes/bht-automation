<p style=" "><b>Whoso shall offend - </b>That is, cause to fall, or to sin; or who should place anything in their way to hinder their piety or happiness. See notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>.</p>

<p style=" "><b>It were better for him that a millstone ... - </b>Mills, anciently, were either turned by hand (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:41">Matthew 24:41</span>), or by beasts, chiefly by mules. These last were of the larger kind, and the original words denote that it was this kind that was intended. This was one mode of capital punishment practiced by the Greeks, Syrians, Romans, and by some other nations. The meaning is, it would be better for him to have died before he had committed the sin. To injure, or to cause to sin, the feeblest Christian, will be regarded by Christ as a most serious offence, and will be punished accordingly.</p>
