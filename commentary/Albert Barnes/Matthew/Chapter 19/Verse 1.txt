See Robinson’s Harmony. Matthew and Mark now resume the narrative by relating that after Jesus had left Galilee he approached Jerusalem by passing through the country beyond Jordan. The country was, in general, called Perea, and appertained to Judea, being the region formerly occupied by the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh. The word “coasts” means regions or parts. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span>.</p>
