<p style=" "><b>For there are some eunuchs ... - </b>Jesus proceeds to state that there were some who were able to receive that saying and to remain in an unmarried state. Some were so born; some were made such by the cruelty of men; and there were some who voluntarily abstained from marriage for the kingdom of heavenâ€™s sake - that is, that they might devote themselves entirely to the proper business of religion. Perhaps he refers here to the Essenes, a sect of the Jews (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>), who held that marriage was unsuitable to their condition; who had no children of their own, but perpetuated their sect by adopting the poor children of others. Eunuchs were employed chiefly in attending on the females or in the harem. They rose often to distinction, and held important offices in the state. Hence, the word is sometimes used with reference to such an officer of state, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:27">Acts 8:27</span>.</p>
