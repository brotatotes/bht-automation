<p style=" "><b>Tempting him - </b>This means, to get him, if possible, to express an opinion that should involve him in difficulty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is it lawful ... - </b>There was the more art in the captious question which they proposed, as at that time the people were very much divided on the subject. A part, following the opinions of Hillel, said that a man might divorce his wife for any offence, or any dislike he might have of her. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:31">Matthew 5:31</span>. Others, of the school of Shammai, maintained that divorce was unlawful except in case of adultery. Whatever opinion, therefore, Christ expressed, they expected that he would involve himself in difficulty with one of their parties.</p>
