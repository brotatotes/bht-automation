<p style=" "><b>The house - </b>The place where he was born, or the place where they lived at that time.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fell down - </b>This was the usual way of showing respect or homage among the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="es+8:3">Esther 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:20">Job 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+3:7">Daniel 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:11">Psalms 72:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+46:6">Isaiah 46:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Worshipped him - </b>Did him homage as King of the Jews. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:2">Matthew 2:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had opened their treasures - </b>The treasures which they had brought, or the boxes, etc., in which they had brought their gold, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They presented unto him gifts - </b>These were presented to him as King of the Jews, because they supposed he was to be a distinguished prince and conqueror. It was customary in the East to show respect for persons of distinction by making presents or offerings of this kind. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:14">Genesis 32:14</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Gen 43:11</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+10:27">1 Samuel 10:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+10:2">1 Kings 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:10-15">Psalms 72:10-15</span>. This custom is still common in the East, and it is everywhere there unusual to approach a person of distinguished rank without a valuable present.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Frankincense - </b>Frankincense is a white resin or gum. It is obtained from a tree by making incisions in the bark, and suffering the gum to flow out. It is highly odoriferous or fragrant when burned, and was therefore used in worship, where it was burned as a pleasant offering to God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:8">Exodus 30:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:12">Leviticus 16:12</span>. It is found in the East Indies, but chiefly in Arabia; and hence it has been supposed probable that the wise men came from Arabia.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Myrrh - </b>This was also a production of Arabia, and was obtained from a tree in the same manner as frankincense. The name denotes bitterness, and was given to it on account of its great bitterness. It was used chiefly in embalming the dead, because it had the property of preserving dead bodies from putrefaction. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span>, it was much used in Egypt and in Judea. It was obtained from a thorny tree, which grows 8 or 9 feet high. It was at an early period an article of commerce <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:25">Genesis 37:25</span>, and was an ingredient of the holy ointment, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:23">Exodus 30:23</span>. It was also used as an agreeable perfume, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="es+2:12">Esther 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:8">Psalms 45:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+7:17">Proverbs 7:17</span>. It was also sometimes mingled with wine to form an article of drink. Such a drink was given to our Saviour, when about to be crucified, as a stupefying potion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:23">Mark 15:23</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span>. The offerings here referred to were made because they were the most valuable which the country of the Magi or wise men produced. They were tokens of respect and homage which they paid to the new-born King of the Jews. They evinced their high regard for him, and their belief that he was to be an illustrious prince; and the fact that their deed is recorded with approbation shows us that we should offer our most valuable possessions, our all, to the Lord Jesus Christ. Wise men came from far to do him homage, and bowed down, and presented their best gifts and offerings. It is right that we give to him also our hearts, our property, our all.</p>
