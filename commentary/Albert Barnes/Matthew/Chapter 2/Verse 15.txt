<p style=" "><b>The death of Herod - </b>Herod died in the thirty-seventh year of his reign. It is not certainly known in what year he began his reign, and hence it is impossible to determine the time that Joseph remained in Egypt. The best chronologers have supposed that he died somewhere between two and four years after the birth of Christ, but at what particular time cannot now be determined. Nor can it be ascertained at what age Jesus was taken into Egypt. It seems probable that he was supposed to be a year old (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span>), and of course the time that he remained in Egypt was not long. Herod died of a most painful and loathsome disease in Jericho. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span>; also Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. xvii. 6. 5.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That it might be fulfilled ... - </b>This language is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+11:1">Hosea 11:1</span>. It there evidently speaks of Godâ€™s calling His people out of Egypt, under Moses. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:22-23">Exodus 4:22-23</span>. It might be said to be fulfilled in his calling Jesus from Egypt, because the words in Hosea aptly expressed this also. The same love which led him to deliver His people Israel from the land of Egypt, now led him also to deliver His Son from that place. The words used by Hosea would express both events. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22">Matthew 1:22</span>. Perhaps, also, the place in Hosea became a proverb, to express any great deliverance from danger; and thus it could be said to be fulfilled in Christ, as other proverbs are in cases to Which they are applicable. It cannot be supposed that the passage in Hosea was a prophecy of the Messiah. It is evidently used by Matthew only because the language is appropriate to express the event.</p>
