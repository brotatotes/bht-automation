<p style=" "><b>By the prophet - </b>The Sanhedrin answered without hesitation. The question where he would be born had been settled by prophecy. This prophecy is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>. In that prophecy both the place of his birth and the character of the Messiah are so clearly set forth that there was no room to doubt. It will be observed that there is a considerable difference between the passage as quoted by the Sanhedrin and as it stands in Micah. The main point, however, is retained - the place of his birth. We are not concerned, therefore, in showing how these passages can be reconciled. Matthew, moreover, is not responsible for the correctness of the quotation. He affirms only that the chief priests and scribes gave this answer to Herod, and that Herod was satisfied. Admitting that they did not quote the passage correctly, it does not prove that Matthew has not reported their answer as they gave it, and this is all that he pretends to give.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Art not the least - </b>In Micah, “though thou be little.” Though a small place so far as population is concerned, yet it shall not be small, or be the least in honor; for the Messiah shall be born there. His birth gave the place an honor which could not be conferred on the larger cities by all their numbers, their splendor, and their wealth. The birth of a distinguished personage was always supposed to give honor and importance to a city or country. Thus, seven cities contended for the honor of giving birth to Homer; Stratford-upon-Avon is distinguished as the birthplace of Shakespeare; and Corsica as the birthplace of Napoleon.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A Governor - </b>A ruler. This is one of the characters of the Messiah, who is the king of his people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:37">John 18:37</span>. The word “rule” here means to rule as a shepherd does his flock, in faithfulness and tenderness. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:10-11">Isaiah 40:10-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span>.</p>
