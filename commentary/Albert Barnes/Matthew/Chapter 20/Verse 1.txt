<p style=" "><b>For the kingdom of heaven ... - </b>The word “for” shows that this chapter should have been connected with the preceding. The parable was spoken expressly to illustrate the sentiment in the last verse of that chapter: “Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.” The kingdom of heaven means here the church, including, perhaps, its state here and hereafter. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. It has reference to rewards, and the meaning may be thus expressed: “Rewards shall be bestowed in my kingdom, or on my followers, in the same manner as they were by a certain householder - in such a way that the last shall be equal to the first, and the first last.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>A householder - </b>A master of a family. One at the head of family affairs.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His vineyard - </b>No inconsiderable part of Judea was employed in the culture of the grape. Vineyards are often used, therefore, to represent a fertile or well-cultivated place, and hence the church, denoting the care and culture that God has bestowed on it. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:7">Isaiah 5:7</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+12:10">Jeremiah 12:10</span>. For the manner of their construction, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33">Matthew 21:33</span>.</p>
