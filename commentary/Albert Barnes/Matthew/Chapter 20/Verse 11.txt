<p style=" "><b>Murmured - </b>Complained; found fault with.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The goodman of the house - </b>The original here is the same word which in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:1">Matthew 20:1</span> is translated householder, and should have been so translated here. It is the old English way of denoting the father of a family. It expresses no moral quality.</p>
