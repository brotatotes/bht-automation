<p style=" "><b>Is thine we evil because I am good? - </b>The Hebrews used the word evil, when applied to the eye, to denote one envious and malicious, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+15:9">Deuteronomy 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+23:6">Proverbs 23:6</span>. The eye is called evil in such cases, because envy and malice show themselves directly in the eye. No passions are so fully expressed by the eye as these. “Does envy show itself in the eye? is thine eye so soon turned to express envy and malice because I have chosen to do good?”</p>
