<p style=" "><b>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem - </b>Jesus assured them that what they feared would come to pass, but he had, in some measure, prepared their minds for this state of suffering by the promises which he had made to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:27-30">Matthew 19:27-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:1-16">Matthew 20:1-16</span>. In all their sufferings they might be assured that eternal rewards were before them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be betrayed - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:22">Matthew 17:22</span>. “Unto the chief priests and scribes.” The high priest, and the learned men who composed the Sanhedrin or the Great Council of the nation. He was thus betrayed by Judas, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:15">Matthew 26:15</span>. He was delivered to the chief priests and scribes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:57">Matthew 26:57</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they shall condemn him to death - </b>They had not power to inflict death, as that power had been taken away by the Romans; but they had the power of expressing an opinion, and of delivering him to the Romans to be put to death. This they did, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:66">Matthew 26:66</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:2">Matthew 27:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall deliver him to the Gentiles - </b>That is, because they have not the right of inflicting capital punishment, they will deliver him to those who have to the Roman authorities. The Gentiles here means Pontius Pilate and the Roman soldiers. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:2">Matthew 27:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27-30">Matthew 27:27-30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To mock - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To scourge - </b>That is, to whip. This was done with thongs, or a whip made for the purpose, and this punishment was commonly inflicted upon criminals before crucifixion. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:17">Matthew 10:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To crucify him - </b>That is, to put him to death on a cross - the common punishment of slaves. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:31-32">Matthew 27:31-32</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The third day ... - </b>For the evidence that this was fulfilled, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:15">Matthew 28:15</span>. Mark and Luke say that he would be spit upon. Spitting on another has always been considered an expression of the deepest contempt. Luke says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:31">Luke 18:31</span>, “All things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.” Among other things, he says he shall be “spitefully entreated;” that is, treated with spite or malice; malice, implying contempt. These sufferings of our Saviour, and this treatment, and his death, had been predicted in many places. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1-12">Isaiah 53:1-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:26-27">Daniel 9:26-27</span>.</p>
