<p style=" "><b>Even as the Son of man ... - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:20">Matthew 8:20</span>. Jesus points them to his own example. He was in the form of God in heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>. He came to people in the form of a servant, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>. He came not with pomp and glory, but as a man in humble life; and since he came he had not required them to minister to him. “He labored for them.” He strove to do them good. He provided for their needs; fared as poorly as they did; went before them in dangers and sufferings; practiced self-denial on their account, and for them was about to lay down his life.

<p style=" "><b>To give his life a ransom for many - </b>The word “ransom” means literally a price paid for the redemption of captives. In war, when prisoners are taken by an enemy, the money demanded for their release is called a ransom; that is, it is the means by which they are set at liberty. So anything that releases anyone from a state of punishment, or suffering, or sin, is called a ransom. People are by nature captives to sin. They are sold under it. They are under condemnation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:9-20">Romans 3:9-20</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:23">Romans 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>. They are under a curse, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>. They are in love with sin They are under its withering dominion, and are exposed to death eternal, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+18:4">Ezekiel 18:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:17">Psalms 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+11:6">Psalms 11:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:2">Psalms 68:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:19">Psalms 139:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:6-9">Romans 2:6-9</span>. They must have perished unless there had been some way by which they could he rescued. This was done by the death of Jesus - by giving his life a ransom. The meaning is, that he died in the place of sinners, and that God was willing to accept the pains of his death in the place of the eternal suffering of the redeemed. The reasons why such a ransom was necessary are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That God had declared that the sinner shall die; that is, that he would punish, or show his hatred to, all sin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That all people had sinned, and, if justice was to take its regular course, all must perish.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That man could make no atonement for his own sins. All that he could do, were he holy, would be only to do his duty, and would make no amends for the past. Repentance and future obedience would not blot away one sin.</p>
