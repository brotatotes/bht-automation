<p style=" "><b>And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem - </b>They were going up now from Jericho.</p>
<p style=" "><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:29">Matthew 20:29</span>. The distance was about 19 miles. The most of the way was a desert, or filled with caves, and rocks, and woods - a suitable place for robbers. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:30">Luke 10:30</span>. The Mount of Olives, or “Olivet,” is on the east of Jerusalem. Between this and Jerusalem there runs a small stream called the brook Kidron, or Cedron. It is dry in the hot seasons of the year, but swells to a considerable size in time of heavy rains. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:1">John 18:1</span>. The Mount of Olives was so called from its producing in abundance the olive. It was from Jerusalem about a Sabbath-day’s journey. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12">Acts 1:12</span>. On the west side of the mountain was the garden of Gethsemane, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:39">Luke 22:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:32">Mark 14:32</span>. On the eastern declivity of the mountain were the villages of Bethphage and Bethany. Mark and Luke say that he came near to both those places.</p>
<p style=" ">He appears to have come first to Bethany, where he passed the night <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:9-11">John 12:9-11</span>, and in the morning sent over to the adjacent village Bethphage. Bethany was the place where Lazarus lived, whom he raised from the dead <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:0">John 11:0</span>; where Martha and Mary lived; and where Mary anointed him with ointment against the day of his burying, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1-7">John 12:1-7</span>. The Mount of Olives is about a mile in length and about 700 feet in height, and overlooks Jerusalem, so that from its summit almost every part of the city can be seen. The mountain is composed of three peaks or summits. The “olive” is a fruit well known among us as an article of commerce. The tree blooms in June, and bears white flowers. The fruit is small. It is first green, then whitish, and, when fully ripe, black. It encloses a hard stone in which are the seeds. The “wild olive” was common, and differed from the other only in being of a smaller size. There are two roads from Jerusalem to Bethany; one around the southern end of the Mount of Olives, and the other across the summit. The latter is considerably shorter, but more difficult, and it was probably along this road that the Saviour went.</p>
