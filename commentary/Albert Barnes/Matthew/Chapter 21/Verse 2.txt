<p style=" "><b>Ye shall find an ass tied ... - </b>In Judea there were few horses, and those were chiefly used in war. People seldom employed them in common life and in ordinary journeys. The ass, the mule, and the camel are still most used in Eastern countries. To ride on a horse was sometimes an emblem of war; on a mule and an ass, the emblem of peace. Kings and princes commonly rode on them in times of peace, and it is mentioned as a mark of rank and dignity to ride in that manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+10:4">Judges 10:4</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Jdg 12:14</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+25:20">1 Samuel 25:20</span>. So Solomon, when he was inaugurated as king, rode on a “mule,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+1:33">1 Kings 1:33</span>. Riding in this manner, then, denoted neither poverty nor degradation, but was the appropriate way in which a king should ride, and in which, therefore, the King of Zion should enter into his capital, the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" ">Mark and Luke say that he told them they should find “a colt tied.” This they were directed to bring. They mention only the colt, because it was this on which he rode.</p>
