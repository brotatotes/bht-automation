<p style=" "><b>We cannot tell - </b>This was a direct falsehood. They could have told; and the answer should have been, “We will not tell.” There was no reason but that why they did not tell. The reason, probably, why they would not acknowledge that John was a prophet, was that, if they did, they saw he could easily show them by “what authority” he did those things; that is, by his authority as Messiah. John came as his forerunner, pointed him out to the people, baptized him, and bore his public and solemn testimony to the fact that he was the Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:13-15">Matthew 3:13-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29-34">John 1:29-34</span>. If they acknowledged one, they must the other. In this way our Saviour was about to lead these crafty men to answer their own question, to their own confusion, about his authority. They saw this; and, having given them a “sufficient” answer, there was no need of stating anything further.</p>
