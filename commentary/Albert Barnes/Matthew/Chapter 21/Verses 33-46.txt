<p style=" ">1. Jesus is omniscient, and sees and knows all things, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:2">Matthew 21:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">2. It is our duty to obey the Lord Jesus, and to do it at once, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:3">Matthew 21:3</span>. When He commands there should be no delay. What he orders is right, and we should not hesitate or deliberate about it.</p>
<p style=" ">3. Especially is this the case where He is to be honored, as he was on this occasion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:3">Matthew 21:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:8">Matthew 21:8</span>. If it was for “our” interest or honor only that we obeyed him, it would be of less consequence; but our obedience will honor Him, and we should seek that honor by any sacrifice or self-denial.</p>
<p style=" ">4. We should be willing to give up our property to honor the Lord Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:3">Matthew 21:3</span>. He has a right to it. If given to spread the gospel, it goes, as this did, to increase “the triumphs of our King.” We should be willing to give our wealth that he might “gird on his sword,” and “ride prosperously among the heathen.” Everyone who is saved among the pagan by sending the gospel to them will be for the honor of Jesus. They will go to swell his train when he shall enter triumphantly into his kingdom at the day of judgment.</p>
<p style=" ">5. It is our duty to honor him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:7-9">Matthew 21:7-9</span>. He is King of Zion. He is Lord of all. He reigns, and shall always reign.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Sinners! Whose love can ne’er forget</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> The wormwood and the gall,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Go spread your trophies at his feet,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> And crown him Lord of all.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> Ye ransomed from the fall;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Hail him who saves you by his grace,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> And crown him Lord of all.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Let every kindred, every tribe,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> On this terrestrial ball,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> To him all majesty ascribe,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> And crown him Lord of all.”</p>
<p style=" ">6. “Children” should also honor him and shout “hosanna” to him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:15">Matthew 21:15</span>. The chief priests and scribes, in the time of our Saviour, were displeased that they did it; and many of the great, and many formal professors since, have been displeased that “children” should profess to love and honor Jesus. They have opposed Sunday schools, and opposed the praying of children, and opposed their singing to his praise, and opposed their giving their money to spread his gospel; but Jesus loves such praise and such service. The mouths of babes and sucklings should be taught to speak his name; and whatever the world may say, whatever the proud, the rich, or the formal may say, children should seek him early and give their first years to him. He loves their praises. Perhaps few of all the songs of thanksgiving are so pleasant to his ears as the “hosannas” of a Sunday school.</p>
<p style=" ">7. We have here a view of the glory of Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9-11">Matthew 21:9-11</span>. Though humble yet he was King. Though most of his life unhonored, yet once he had the honors of his station rendered to him, and entered the city of his father David as a triumphant King of Zion. He will be yet “more” honored. He will come with all his saints, with the glory of his Father, and with the holy angels. There we shall be; and we should be prepared to join with the vast host in shouting hosanna to the returning King of Zion.</p>
<p style=" ">8. Yet, amid all these honors, he was meek and lowly, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:5">Matthew 21:5</span>. Others would have been proud and lifted up, but he was always meek; his heart was not proud. He is the only one of kings that could bear triumph and honors without being lifted up by it and made proud.</p>
<p style=" ">9. Yet amid all his triumphs he wept over Jerusalem (Luke). No king, no conqueror, ever before showed compassion like this. People weep when “they” are afflicted, or are poor and needy; but what prince has ever, in the moment of his triumph, wept over the miseries and dangers of his subjects? Not an instance can be found in all history where an earthly conqueror ever showed compassion like this. So Jesus has still compassion over blind, ruined, wretched man. Amid all the triumphs of the gospel, he does not forget those I who are yet in their sins, but stretches out his arms to welcome them to his embrace.</p>
<p style=" ">10. Prophecy will be certainly and exactly fulfilled (Luke). That respecting Jerusalem was literally accomplished; and in like manner will all that is predicted of “all” sinners assuredly come to pass. If Jerusalem had repented it would have been saved; so if sinners repent they will be saved. If not, like Jerusalem, in due time they will perish.</p>
<p style=" ">11. Jesus purified the temple, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>. It was the house of God. So our hearts should be the dwelling-place of the Holy Spirit; so, also, they should be pure. All worldly cares, and traffic, and business, that would interfere with the dwelling of the Spirit there, and all wickedness, oppression, extortion, cheating, and pollution should be banished. God dwells not in such polluted temples; and unless we are “pure in heart,” he will not be with us, and we shall not see his face in peace. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16-17">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">12. Jesus only can purify our hearts. He does it by his blood and Spirit. Over all our sins he holds the same power as he did over the traffickers in the temple. At his command they will flee, and we shall be pure. If our hearts are ever purified, therefore, it will be by the power of Jesus. Nor should we wait in sin for him to do it. We should come to him, and beseech him to have mercy, and to save us from our pollutions.</p>
<p style=" ">13. Envy and hatred will take hold of very small matters, to show itself against the good and even the prudent, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:15">Matthew 21:15</span>. When the enemies of Jesus could find nothing else to blame, they chose to find fault with the shouting of children. So always in a revival of religion, or any great work of the Lord, it is some small matter that is seized upon something not exactly to the view of wicked objectors - that is made the occasion of reproach and opposition.</p>
<p style=" ">14. We must produce fruit in our lives as well as flowers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>. A profession of religion is like the flowers of spring. A revival is like fragrant blossoms. They are beautiful, and promise much fruit; but how many wither, and droop, and fall useless to the ground! How few of all the blossoms of the spring produce ripe and mellow fruit in autumn! So, alas! it is often with those who appear well in revivals of religion.</p>
<p style=" ">15. If we make a profession and do not produce fruit, Jesus will curse us, and we shall soon wither away, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19-20">Matthew 21:19-20</span>. He will suffer none to enter into his kingdom on the ground of profession only. If we bear fruit and live lives of piety, we are Christians; if not, all our professions are like the blossoms of spring or the leaves of the tree. They will not save us from the withering frown of Jesus.</p>
<p style=" ">16. People will do almost anything right or wrong, and as often wrong as right - to court popularity, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:24">Matthew 21:24</span>. It is generally not asked by such people what is “right” or what is “true,” but what will secure popularity. If they have that, they are satisfied.</p>
<p style=" ">17. People often tell a direct falsehood rather than acknowledge the truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:27">Matthew 21:27</span>. Especially is this the case when the truth makes against them.</p>
<p style=" ">18. Double-dealing and an attempt to evade the truth commonly lead into difficulty. If these people had been honest, they would have had far less trouble, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:27">Matthew 21:27</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">19. A state of gross and open sin is often more hopeful than one of hypocrisy, pride, and self-conceit, together with external conformity to religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:28">Matthew 21:28</span>. Multitudes of profane and licentious people may be saved, while the proud and self-righteous will be cut off. The reasons are,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Nothing so effectually prevents religion as pride and self-confidence.</p>
<p style=" ">20. Multitudes of people profess to go, and go not, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:30">Matthew 21:30</span>. They profess to love God, and love themselves better. They profess to obey him, and yet obey their lusts. They are hypocrites, and destruction must come upon them.</p>
<p style=" ">21. Sinners, when they see the effect of truth on others, should repent, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:32">Matthew 21:32</span>. It is proof of the truth of religion, and they, as much as others, need it.</p>
<p style=" ">22. We see the goodness of God in sending his messengers to a lost world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33-38">Matthew 21:33-38</span>. His prophets he sent one after another, and they were put to death. His well-beloved Son he sent, and He also was put to death. Nor is his mercy yet stayed. He still sends his message to sinners. Thousands have died, as his Son did, in attempting to spread the gospel, but still he sends it. We have often, often rejected it, yet still he sends it. What earthly monarch would be treated in this manner? What earthly parent would be so patient and so kind?</p>
<p style=" ">23. If we improve not our privileges they will be taken away from us, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:43">Matthew 21:43</span>. The gospel will be sent to many of the pagan, and they will be saved, but woe to those who have had it all their lives and are not saved.</p>
<p style=" ">24. All who reject the Saviour must perish, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>.</p>
