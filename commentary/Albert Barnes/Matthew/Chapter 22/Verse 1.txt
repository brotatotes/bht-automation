<p style=" "><b>And Jesus answered and spake unto them again in parables - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3">Matthew 13:3</span>. That is, he answered or made reply to the Pharisees, who had been enraged at him for what he had already spoken to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:45-46">Matthew 21:45-46</span>. He made a still further statement, to show how the gospel would be received and treated by them. The real answer here, as is frequently the case in the New Testament, refers to what was passing in the mind, or to the conduct of those who were addressed, not to what they said.</p>
