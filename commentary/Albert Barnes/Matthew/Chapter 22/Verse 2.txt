<p style=" "><b>The kingdom of heaven - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. The idea here is, “God deals with man in his kingdom, or in regard to the dispensation of the gospel, as a certain king did,” etc. This parable refers, undoubtedly, to the rejection of the Jews and to the calling of the Gentiles. The gospel, with all its privileges, was offered to the Jewish people; but through their wickedness and pride they rejected it, and all its blessings were offered to the Gentiles and accepted. This is the general truth. Many circumstances are thrown in to fill out the narrative which cannot be particularly explained.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A marriage for his son - </b>Rather a “marriage-feast,” or a feast on the occasion of the marriage of his son. The king here doubtless represents God providing for the salvation of the world.</p>
