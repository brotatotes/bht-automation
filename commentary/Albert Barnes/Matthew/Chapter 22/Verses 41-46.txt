<p style=" ">1. Multitudes of people, who are invited to be saved, reject the gospel and perish in their sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:3">Matthew 22:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">2. If they perish, they only will be to blame. The offer was freely made, the salvation was provided, and the only reason why they were not saved was that they would not come, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:3">Matthew 22:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">3. Attention to the affairs of this life, the love of the world, will shut many out of the kingdom of heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</span>. Some attention to those things is necessary; but such a devotion to these things as to lead to the loss of the soul never can be right.</p>
<p style=" ">4. It is treating God ungratefully to reject his gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:3-5">Matthew 22:3-5</span>. He has sent his Son to die for us; he has entreated us to be saved; he has followed us with mercies; and to reject all these, and refuse to be saved, is to treat him with contempt, as well as to overwhelm ourselves in condemnation. “Man has no right to be damned.” He is under the most solemn obligations to be “saved;” and after what God has done for us, deep and dreadful woe will await us if we are so foolish and wicked as to be lost.</p>
<p style=" ">5. Many of the poor and needy will be saved, while the haughty and rich will perish forever, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:9-10">Matthew 22:9-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">6. Let those who make a profession of religion look often to the great day when Christ will search them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:11">Matthew 22:11</span>. There is a day coming that will try us. His eye will be upon us. He will read our hearts, and see whether we are clothed in his righteousness, or only the filthy rags of our own.</p>
<p style=" ">7. A profession of religion will not save us, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:11-13">Matthew 22:11-13</span>. It is foolish to deceive ourselves. Nothing but genuine piety, true faith in Jesus, and a holy life, will save us. God asks not profession merely, but the heart. He asks not mockery, but sincerity; not pretension, but reality.</p>
<p style=" ">8. The hypocrite must perish, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:13">Matthew 22:13</span>. It is right that he should perish. He knew his Master’s will and would not do it. He must perish with an awful condemnation. No man sins amid so much light, none with so high a hand. No sin is so awful as to attempt to deceive God, and to palm pretensions on him for reality.</p>
<p style=" ">9. Pretended friends are sometimes more dangerous than avowed enemies, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>. Pretended friendship is often for the purpose of decoying us into evil. It throws us off our guard, and we are more easily taken.</p>
<p style=" ">10. The truth is often admitted by wicked people from mere hypocrisy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>. It is only for the purpose of deceiving others and leading them into sin.</p>
<p style=" ">11. Wicked people can decide correctly on the character of a public preacher, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>. They often admit his claim in words, but for an evil purpose.</p>
<p style=" ">12. It may be right for us sometimes to attend to artful and captious questions, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:18">Matthew 22:18</span>. It may afford opportunity to do good; to confound the wicked and to inculcate truth.</p>
<p style=" ">13. No cunning can overreach God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:18">Matthew 22:18</span>. He knows the heart, and he perceives the wickedness of all who attempt to deceive him.</p>
<p style=" ">14. It is right, and it is our duty to obey the law of the land, when it does not contravene the law of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:21">Matthew 22:21</span>. “Conscientious Christians make the best citizens.” Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1-7">Romans 13:1-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">15. We should give honor to civil rulers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:21">Matthew 22:21</span>, We should pay respect to the office, whatever may be the character of the ruler. We should speak well of it, not abuse it; yield proper obedience to its requirements, and not rebel against it. Men may be wicked who hold an office, but the office is ordained by God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1-2">Romans 13:1-2</span>; and for the sake of the office we must be patient, meek, submissive, and obedient, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:3">Matthew 23:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">16. Yet we are to obey civil rulers no further than their commands are consistent with the law of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:21">Matthew 22:21</span>. God is to be obeyed rather than man; and when a civil ruler commands a thing contrary to the laws of the Bible and the dictates of our consciences, we may, we must resist it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:29">Acts 5:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">17. The objections of people to the doctrines of the Bible are often founded on ignorance of what those doctrines are, and distrust of the power of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:29">Matthew 22:29</span>. People often set up a notion which they call a doctrine of the Bible, and then fight a shadow, and think they have confuted the truth of God, while that truth was, in fact, untouched. It is a totally different thing from what they supposed.</p>
<p style=" ">18. When people attack a doctrine they should be certain that they under stand it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:29">Matthew 22:29</span>. The Sadducees did not understand the true doctrine of the resurrection. The inquiry which they should have made was whether they had correct views of it. This is the inquiry which people ought always first to make when they approach a doctrine of the Bible.</p>
<p style=" ">19. We learn the glory and happiness of the state after the resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:30">Matthew 22:30</span> (Luke). We shall be in some respects equal to the angels. Like them we shall be free from sin, suffering, and death. Like them we shall be complete in knowledge and felicity. Like them we shall be secure of eternal joy. Happy are those - the good of all the earth who shall have part in that resurrection of the just!</p>
<p style=" ">20. The dead shall be raised, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:31-32">Matthew 22:31-32</span>. There is a state of happiness hereafter. This the gospel has revealed; and it is the most consoling and cheering truth that has ever beamed upon the heart of man.</p>
<p style=" ">21. Our pious friends that have died are now happy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:31-32">Matthew 22:31-32</span>. They are with God. God is still their God. A father, or mother, or sister, or friend that may have left us is there in perfect felicity. We should rejoice at that, nor should we wish them hack to the poor comforts and the many sufferings of this world.</p>
<p style=" ">22. It is our duty to love God with all the heart. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:37">Matthew 22:37</span>. No half, formal, cold, and selfish affection comes up to the requirement. It must be full, entire, absolute. It must be pleasure in all his attributes - his justice, his power, his purposes, as well as his mercy and his goodness. God is to be loved just as he is. If man is not pleased with his whole character he is not pleased with him at all.</p>
<p style=" ">23. God is worthy of love. He is perfect. He should be loved early in life. Children should love him more than they do father, or mother, or friends. Their first affections should he fixed on God, and fixed on him supremely, until they die.</p>
<p style=" ">24. We must love our neighbor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:39">Matthew 22:39</span>. We must do to all as we would have them do to us. This is the law and the prophets: this is the way of justice, of peace, of kindness, of charity, of benevolence. If all men obeyed these laws, the earth would be a paradise, and man would taste the bliss of heaven here below.</p>
<p style=" ">25. We may ask here of each one, What think you of Christ? <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:42">Matthew 22:42</span>. What do you think of the necessity of a Saviour? What do you think of his nature? Is he God as well as man, or do you regard him only as a man? What do you think of his character? Do you see him to be lovely and pure, and is he such as to draw forth the warm affections of your heart? What do you think of salvation by him? Do you depend on him, and trust in him, and expect heaven only on the ground of his merits? Or, do you reject and despise him, and would you have joined in putting him to death? Nothing, more certainly tests the character, and shows what the feelings are, than the views which we entertain of Christ. Here error is fatal error; but he who has just views of the Redeemer, and right feelings toward him, is sure of salvation.</p>
<p style=" ">26. We have in this chapter an illustrious specimen of the wisdom of Jesus. He successfully met the snares of his mighty and crafty foes, and with infinite ease confounded them. No art of man could confound him. Never was wisdom more clear, never more triumphant.</p>
