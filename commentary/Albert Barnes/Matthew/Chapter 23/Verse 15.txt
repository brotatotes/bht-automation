<p style=" "><b>Ye compass sea and land - </b>You take every means, spare no pains, to gain proselytes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Proselyte - </b>One that comes over from a foreign nation, religion, or sect to us - a convert. Among the Jews there were two kinds of proselytes:</p>
<p style=" "><b>Twofold more the child of hell - </b>That is, twice as bad. To be a child of hell was a Hebrew phrase, signifying to be deserving of hell, to be awfully wicked. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. The Jewish writers themselves say that the proselytes were “scabs of Israel,” and “hindered the coming of the Messiah” by their great wickedness. The Pharisees gained them either to swell their own numbers, or to make gain by extorting their money under various pretences; and when they had accomplished that, they took no pains to instruct them or to restrain them. They had renounced their superstition which had before somewhat restrained them, but the Pharisees had given them no religion in its place to restrain them, and they were consequently left to the full indulgence of their vices.</p>
