Him that dwelleth therein - That is, God. The temple was his house, his dwelling. In the first, or Solomonâ€™s temple, he dwelt between the cherubims in the most holy place. He manifested himself there by a visible symbol, in the form of a cloud resting on the mercy-seat, 1 Kings 8:10, 1 Kings 8:13; Psalms 80:1.
