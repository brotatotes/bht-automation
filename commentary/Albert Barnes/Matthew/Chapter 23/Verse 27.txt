<p style=" "><b>Like unto whited sepulchres - </b>For the construction of sepulchres, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>. Those tombs were annually whitewashed to prevent the people from accidentally coming in contact with them as they went up to Jerusalem. This custom is still continued. Dr. Thomson (<i>The Land and the Book</i>, vol. i. p. 148) says, “I have been in places where this is repeated very often. The graves are kept clean and white as snow, a very striking emblem of those painted hypocrites, the Pharisees, beautiful without, but full of dead men’s bones and of all uncleanness within.” The law considered those persons unclean who had touched anything belonging to the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:16">Numbers 19:16</span>. Sepulchres were therefore often whitewashed, that they might be distinctly seen. Thus “whited,” they appeared beautiful; but within they contained the bones and corrupting bodies of the dead. So the Pharisees. Their outward conduct appeared well, but their hearts were full of hypocrisy, envy, pride, lust, and malice - suitably represented by the corruption within a whited tomb.</p>
