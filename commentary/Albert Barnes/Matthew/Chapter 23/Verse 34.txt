<p style=" "><b>I send unto you prophets ... - </b>Jesus doubtless refers here to the apostles, and other teachers of religion. Prophets, wise men, and scribes were the names by which the teachers of religion were known among the Jews, and he therefore used the same terms when speaking of the messengers which he would send. “I send” has the force of the future, I “will” send.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Some of them ye shall kill - </b>As in the case of Stephen <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span> and James <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1-2">Acts 12:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Crucify - </b>Punish with death on the cross. There are no cases of this mentioned; but few historical records of this age have come down to us. The Jews had not the power of crucifying, but they had power to deliver those whom they condemned to death into the hands of the Romans to do it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall scourge - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:17">Matthew 10:17</span>. This was done, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:19-24">Acts 22:19-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:24-25">2 Corinthians 11:24-25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Persecute ... - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span>. This was fulfilled in the case of nearly all the apostles.</p>
