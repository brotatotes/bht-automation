<p style=" "><b>That upon you may come ... - </b>That is, the nation is guilty. Your fathers were guilty. You have shown yourselves to be like them. You are about, by killing the Messiah and his messengers, to fill up the iniquity of the land. The patience of God is nearly exhausted, and the nation is about to be visited with signal vengeance. These national crimes deserve national judgments; and the proper judgment for all these crimes are about to come upon you in the destruction of your temple and city.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All the righteous blood - </b>That is, all the judgments due for shedding that blood. God did not hold them guilty for what their fathers had done; but temporal judgments descend on children in consequence of the wickedness of parents, as in the case of drunken and profligate parents. A drunken father wastes the property that his children might have possessed. A gambler reduces his children to poverty and want. An imprudent and foolish parent is the occasion of leading his sons into places of poverty, ignorance, and crime, materially affecting their character and destiny. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12-19">Romans 5:12-19</span>. So of the Jews. The appropriate effects of their fathers’ crimes were coming on the nation, and they would suffer.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Upon the earth - </b>Upon the land of “Judea.” The word is often used with this limitation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Righteous Abel - </b>Slain by Cain, his brother, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:8">Genesis 4:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Zacharias, son of Barachias - </b>It is not certainly known who this was. Some have thought that it was the Zecharias whose death is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:20-21">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</span>. He is there called the son of Jehoiada; but it is known that it was common among the Jews to have two names, as Matthew is called Levi; Lebbeus, Thaddeus; and Simon, Cephas. Others have thought that Jesus referred to Zecharias the prophet, who might have been massacred by the Jews, though no account of his death is recorded. It might have been known by tradition.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whom ye slew - </b>Whom you, Jews, slew. Whom your nation killed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Between the temple and the altar - </b>Between the temple, properly so called, and the altar of burnt-offering in the court of the priests. See the plan of the temple. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>.</p>
