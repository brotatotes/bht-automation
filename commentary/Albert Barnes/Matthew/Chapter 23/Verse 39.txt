<p style=" ">1. Proper respect should always be shown to teachers and rulers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:3">Matthew 23:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">2. We are not to copy the example of wicked people, though they are our teachers or rulers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:3">Matthew 23:3</span>. We are to frame our conduct by the law of God, and not by the example of people.</p>
<p style=" ">3. People are often very rigid in exacting of others what they fail altogether of performing themselves, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">4. We are not to seek human honors <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:8">Matthew 23:8</span>, nor to give flattering titles to others, nor to allow others to give them to us <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:9">Matthew 23:9</span>. Our highest honor is in humility, and he is most exalted who is most lowly, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:11-12">Matthew 23:11-12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">5. In the descriptions of the scribes and Pharisees in this chapter, we have a full-length portrait of a hypocrite.</p>
<p style=" ">(1) They shut up the kingdom of heaven against others, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</span>. They made great pretensions to knowledge, but they neither entered in themselves, nor suffered others.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) They committed the grossest iniquity under a cloak of religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:14">Matthew 23:14</span>. They cheated widows out of their property, and made long prayers to hide their villainy.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) They showed great zeal in making proselytes, yet did it only for gain, and made them more wicked, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:15">Matthew 23:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) They taught false doctrine, and they resorted to artful contrivances to destroy the force of oaths, and to shut out the Creator from their view, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:16-22">Matthew 23:16-22</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) They were superstitious, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span>. Small matters they were exact in; matters of real importance they cared little about.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) They took great pains to appear well, while they themselves knew that it was all deceit and falsehood, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:25-28">Matthew 23:25-28</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(7) They professed great veneration for the memory of the pious dead, while at the same time they were conscious that they really approved the conduct of those that killed them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:29-31">Matthew 23:29-31</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Never, perhaps, was there a combination of more wicked feelings and hypocritical actions than among them; and never was there more profound knowledge of the human heart, and more faithfulness, than in him who tore off the mask, and showed them what they were.</p>
<p style=" ">6. It is amazing with what power and authority our blessed Lord reproves this wicked people. It is wonderful that they ever waited for a mock trial, and did not kill him at once. But his time was not come, and they were restrained, and not buffered to act out the fury of their mad passions.</p>
<p style=" ">7. Jesus pities dying sinners, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span>. He seeks their salvation. He pleads with them to be saved. He would gather them to him, if they would come. The most hardened, even like the sinners of Jerusalem, he would save if they would come to him. But they will not. They turn from him, and tread the road to death.</p>
<p style=" ">8. The reason why the wicked are not saved is their own obstinacy. They choose not to be saved, and they die. If they will not come to Christ, it is right that they should die. If they do not come, they must die.</p>
<p style=" ">9. The sinner will be destroyed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:38">Matthew 23:38</span>. The day will come when the mercy of God will be clean gone forever, and the forbearance of God exhausted, and then the sinner must perish. When once God has given him over, he must die. No man, no parent, no minister, no friend, no angel, no archangel, can then save. Salvation is lost, forever lost. Oh how amazing is the folly of the wicked, that they weary out the forbearance of God, and perish in their sins!</p>
