<p style=" "><b>Many shall be offended - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>. Many shall stumble, fall, apostatize from a profession of religion. Many who “professed” to love me will then show that they had no “real” attachment to me; and in those trying times it will be seen that they knew nothing of genuine Christian love.

<p style=" "><b>Shall betray one another - </b>Those who thus apostatize from professed attachment to me will betray others who really love me. This they would do to secure their own safety, by revealing the names, habitations, or places of concealment of others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall hate one another - </b>Not that real Christians would do this, but those who had professed to be such would then show that they were not his true followers, and would hate one another. Luke adds that they should be betrayed “by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:16">Luke 21:16</span>. They would break over the most tender ties to surrender Christians to punishment. So great would be their hatred of Christianity, that it would overcome all the natural endearments of kindred and home. This, in the persecutions of Christians, has often occurred, and nothing shows more fully the deep and deadly hatred of the human heart to the gospel.
