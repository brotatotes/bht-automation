<p style=" "><b>The abomination of desolation - </b>This is a Hebrew expression, meaning an abominable or hateful destroyer. The Gentiles were all held in abomination by the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>. The abomination of desolation means the Roman army, and is so explained by <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:20">Luke 21:20</span>.

<p style=" "><b>Standing in the holy place - </b>Mark says, standing where it ought not,” meaning the same thing. All Jerusalem was esteemed “holy,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:5">Matthew 4:5</span>. The meaning of this is, when you see the Roman armies standing in the holy city or encamped around the temple, or the Roman ensigns or standards in the temple. Josephus relates that when the city was taken, the Romans brought their idols into the temple, and placed them over the eastern gate, and sacrificed to them there, “<i>Jewish Wars</i>,” b. 6 chapter 6, section 1.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whoso readeth ... - </b>This seems to be a remark made by the evangelist to direct the attention of the reader particularly to the meaning of the prophecy by Daniel.</p>
