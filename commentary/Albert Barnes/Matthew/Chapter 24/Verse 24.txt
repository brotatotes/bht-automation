<p style=" "><b>False Christs - </b>Persons claiming to be the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>False prophets - </b>Persons claiming to be “the prophet” spoken of by Moses <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>; or persons pretending to declare the way of deliverance from the Romans, and calling the people to follow them. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall show great signs and wonders - </b>That is, shall pretend to work miracles. They will so nearly resemble prophets in their miraculous power as to render it difficult to detect the imposture. Josephus represents the false Christs and prophets that appeared as “magicians and sorcerers.” He says they led the people out into the deserts, and promised to work miracles to deliver them, <i>Antiq.</i> b. 20 chapter 8, section 6.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect - </b>So nearly would their pretended miracles resemble true miracles as to render it difficult to detect the imposture; so much so, that if it were possible they would persuade even true Christians that they were the Messiah. But that was not possible. His real friends would be too firmly established in the belief that he was the Christ to be wholly led away by others. Christians may be sometimes led far astray; they may be in doubt about some great doctrines of religion; they may be perplexed by the cavils and cunning craftiness of those who do not love the truth, but they cannot be entirely deceived and seduced from the Saviour. Our Saviour says that if this “were possible,” it would be done then; but it was not possible.
