<p style=" "><b>Immediately after the tribulation of those days - </b>That is, immediately after these tribulations, events will occur that “may be properly represented” by the darkening of the sun and moon, and by the stars falling from heaven. The word rendered “immediately” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εὐθέως</span></span> eutheōs - means, properly, “straightway, immediately,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:3">Matthew 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:5">Matthew 13:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:31">Mark 1:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:10">Acts 12:10</span>; then “shortly,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:14">3 John 1:14</span>. This is the meaning here. Such events would “shortly” or “soon” occur In the fulfillment of the predictions they would be “the next in order,” and would occur “before long.” The term here requires us to admit that, in order to the fulfillment of the prophecy, it can be shown, or it actually happened, that things “did” soon occur “after the tribulation of those days” which would be “properly represented or described” by the images which the Saviour employs. It is not necessary to show that there could not have been “a more remote” reference to events lying far in the future, in which there would be a more complete fulfillment or “filling up” of the meaning of the words (compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22-23">Matthew 1:22-23</span>); but it is necessary that there should have been events which would be “properly expressed” by the language which the Saviour uses, or which would have been in some proper sense “fulfilled,” even if there had not been reference to more remote events. It will be seen in the exposition that this was actually the case, and that therefore there was a propriety in saying that these events would occur “immediately” - that is, “soon, or the next in order.” Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall the sun be darkened ... - </b>The images used here are not to be taken literally. They are often employed by the sacred writers to denote “any great calamities.” As the darkening of the sun and moon, and the falling of the stars, would be an inexpressible calamity, so any great catastrophe - any overturning of kingdoms or cities, or dethroning of kings and princes is represented by the darkening of the sun and moon, and by some terrible convulsion in the elements. Thus the destruction of Babylon is foretold in similar terms <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:10">Isaiah 13:10</span>, and of Tyre <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:23">Isaiah 24:23</span>. The slaughter in Bozrah and Idumea is predicted in the same language, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:4">Isaiah 34:4</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:3">Isaiah 50:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:19-20">Isaiah 60:19-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:7">Ezekiel 32:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:15">Joel 3:15</span>. To the description in Matthew, Luke has added <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:25-26">Luke 21:25-26</span>, “And upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; people’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.” All these are figures of great and terrible calamities. The roaring of the waves of the sea denotes great tumult and affliction among the people. “Perplexity” means doubt, anxiety; not knowing what to do to escape. “Men’s hearts should fail them for fear,” or by reason of fear. Their fears would be so great as to take away their courage and strength.</p>
