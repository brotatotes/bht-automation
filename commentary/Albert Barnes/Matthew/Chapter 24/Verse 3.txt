<p style=" "><b>He sat upon the Mount of Olives - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:1">Matthew 21:1</span>. From that mount there was a magnificent view of the whole city.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The disciples came unto him privately - </b>Not all of them, but Peter, James, John, and Andrew, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:3">Mark 13:3</span>. The prediction that the temple would be destroyed <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:2">Matthew 24:2</span> had been made in the presence of all the apostles. A “part” now came privately to know more particularly when this would be.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When shall these things be? - </b>There are three questions here:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.When those things should take place</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.What should be the signs of his own coming</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.What should be the signs that the end of the world was near</p>
<p style=" ">To these questions He replies in this and the following chapters. This He does, not by noticing them distinctly, but by intermingling the descriptions of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the end of the world, so that it is sometimes difficult to tell to what particular subject his remarks apply. The principle on which this combined description of two events was spoken appears to be, that “they could be described in the same words,” and therefore the accounts are intermingled. A similar use of language is found in some parts of Isaiah, where the same language will describe the return from the Babylonian captivity, and deliverance by the Messiah. See Introduction to Isaiah, section 7.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sign of thy coming - </b>Evidence that thou art coming. By what token shall we know that thou art coming?</p>
