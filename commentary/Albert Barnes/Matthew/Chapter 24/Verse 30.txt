<p style=" "><b>The sign of the Son of man - </b>The “evidence” that he is coming to destroy the city of Jerusalem. It is not to be denied, however, that this description is applicable also to his coming at the day of judgment. The disciples had asked him <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:3">Matthew 24:3</span> what should be the sign of his coming, and “of the end of the world.” In his answer he has reference to both events, and his language may be regarded as descriptive of both. At the destruction of Jerusalem, the sign or evidence of his coming was found in the fulfillment of these predictions. At the end of the world, the sign of his coming will be his personal approach with the glory of his Father and the holy angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:27">Luke 21:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All the tribes of the earth mourn - </b>That is, either all the “tribes or people” of the land of Judea shall mourn at the great calamities coming upon them, or all the nations of the world shall wail when he comes to judgment. All the wicked shall mourn at the prospect of their doom, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>. The cause of their wailing at the day of judgment will be chiefly that they have pierced, killed, rejected the Saviour, and that they deserve the condemnation that is coming upon them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:37">John 19:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:12">Zechariah 12:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they shall see the Son of man - </b>The Lord Jesus coming to judgment. Probably this refers more directly to his coming at the last day, though it may also mean that the “evidence” of his coming to destroy Jerusalem will then be seen.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the clouds of heaven - </b>He ascended in a cloud, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>. He shall return in like manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>. “The clouds of heaven” denote not the clouds in heaven, but the clouds that appear to shut heaven, or the sky, from our view.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With power - </b>Power, manifest in the destruction of Jerusalem, by the wonders that preceded it, and by the overturning of the temple and city. In the day of judgment, power manifest by consuming the material world <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:7">2 Peter 3:7</span>, <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Pe 3:10</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:12">2 Peter 3:12</span>; by raising the dead <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29-30">John 5:29-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>; by changing those who may be alive when he shall come - that is, making their bodies like those who have died, and who have been raised up <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>; by bringing the affairs of the world to a close, receiving the righteous to heaven <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:57">1 Corinthians 15:57</span>, and sending the wicked, however numerous or however strong, down to hell, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Great glory - </b>The word “glory” here means the visible display of honor and majesty. This glory will be manifested by the manner of his coming <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>, by the presence of the angels <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span>, and by the wonders that shall attend him down the sky.</p>
