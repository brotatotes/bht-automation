<p style=" "><b>So likewise ye ... - </b>In the same manner, when you see what I have predicted the “signs” around Jerusalem - then know that its destruction is at hand,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is near - </b>Luke says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>, “your redemption draweth nigh, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:31">Luke 21:31</span> the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.” Your deliverance from the dangers that threaten the city approaches, and the kingdom of God will be set up in the earth; or your everlasting redemption from sin and death will come at the day of judgment, and his eternal kingdom will be established in the heavens.</p>
