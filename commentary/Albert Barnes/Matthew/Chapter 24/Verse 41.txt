<p style=" "><b>Two women ... - </b>Grinding in the East was performed, as it is now, chiefly by hand. The millstones were about 2 feet in diameter and 12 foot in thickness. The lower one was fixed, and the upper one was turned by a handle or crank. This was done by two persons, who sat opposite to each other. One took hold of the mill-handle and turned it half-way round; the other then seized it and completed the revolution. This was done by women - by servants of the lowest order - and was a very laborious employment. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+11:5">Exodus 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+31:10">Job 31:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+47:2">Isaiah 47:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+16:21">Judges 16:21</span>. The meaning of this verse is similar to the former. Of two persons sitting near each other, one shall be taken and the other. left. The calamity would be sudden, and would come upon them before they were aware.</p>
