<p style=" "><b>Be ye also ready - </b>Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:36">Luke 21:36</span> says that he charged them to pray always, that they might be accounted worthy to escape those things - the judgments coming upon the wicked - and to stand before the Son of man - that is, to stand there approved by him, or to be admitted to his favor. He also charged them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span> to take heed and not to suffer their hearts to be overcharged with surfeiting, or too much eating, or drunkenness, or the cares of this life, lest that day should come upon them unawares; things improper if there were no judgment - especially mad and wicked when the judgment is near.</p>
