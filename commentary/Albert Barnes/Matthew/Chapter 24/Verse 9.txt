<p style=" "><b>To be afflicted - </b>By persecution, imprisonment, scourging, etc.</p>
<p style=" ">“They shall deliver you up to councils” (Mark). To the great council, or Sanhedrin - for this is the word in the original. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>. This was fulfilled when Peter and John were brought before the council, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:5-7">Acts 4:5-7</span>. Mark further adds <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:9">Mark 13:9</span> that they should be delivered to synagogues and to prisons to be beaten, and should be brought before rulers and kings for his name’s sake. All this was remarkably fulfilled. Peter and John were imprisoned <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:3">Acts 4:3</span>; Paul and Silas were imprisoned <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:24">Acts 16:24</span>, and also beaten <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>; Paul was brought before Gallic <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span>, before Felix <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:24">Acts 24:24</span>, and before Agrippa <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:23">Acts 25:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And shall kill you - </b>That is, shall kill some of you. Stephen was stoned <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>; James was killed by Herod <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>; and, in addition to all that the sacred writers have told us, the persecution under Nero took place before the destruction of Jerusalem, in which were put to death, with many others, Peter and Paul. Most of the apostles, it is believed, died by persecution.</p>
<p style=" ">When they were delivered up, Jesus told them not to premeditate what they should say, for he would give them a mouth and wisdom which all their adversaries would not be able to gainsay or resist, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:14-15">Luke 21:14-15</span>. The fulfillment of this is recorded in the case of Stephen <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:10">Acts 6:10</span>, and of Paul, who made Felix “tremble,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye shall be hated of all nations - </b>This was fulfilled then, and has been in all ages. It was judged to be a crime to be a Christian. Multitudes for this, and for nothing else, were put to death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For my name’s sake - </b>On account of attachment to me, or because you bear my “name as Christians.”</p>
