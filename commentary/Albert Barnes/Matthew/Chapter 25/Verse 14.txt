The words “the kingdom, of heaven” are not in the original, but are very properly inserted by the translators. The design of the parable is to teach that those who improve their talents or faculties in the cause of religion who improve them to their own salvation and in doing good to others shall be proportionally rewarded; but they who neglect their talents, and who neither secure their own salvation nor do good to others, will be punished. The kingdom of heaven is like such a man - that is, “God deals with people in his government as such a man did.”</p>

He has given to all talents to improve, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>.</p>
