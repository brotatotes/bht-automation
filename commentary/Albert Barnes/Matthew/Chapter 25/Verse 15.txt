<p style=" "><b>Five talents - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:24">Matthew 18:24</span>. The word “talents” here is used to denote indefinitely “a large sum,” and is designed to refer to the endowments conferred on people. We have retained in our language the word “talent” as referring to the abilities or gifts of men.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to his several ability - </b>According to the ability of each one. According as he saw each one was adapted to improve it. So in the church and the world. God gives people stations which he judges them adapted to fill, and requires them to fill them. He makes “distinctions” among people in regard to abilities, and in the powers and opportunities of usefulness, requiring them only to occupy those stations, and to discharge their duties there, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:7">1 Corinthians 4:7</span>.</p>
