<p style=" "><b>Ruler over many things - </b>I will promote thee to greater honors and to more important trusts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Joy of thy lord - </b>In the meantime share the pleasures and enjoyments of his palace; be his companion, and receive the rewards which he has promised thee. “The joy of his lord” may mean either the festivals and rejoicings at his return, or the rewards which his lord had prepared for his faithful servants. Applied to Christians, it means that they who rightly improve their talents will, at the return of Christ, be promoted to great honors in heaven, and be partakers of the joys of their Lord in the world of glory.
