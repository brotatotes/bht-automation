The one talent - The design of this part of the parable is to show that no one is excused for neglecting his duty because he has few talents. God will require of him only according to his ability, 1 Corinthians 4:2; Luke 12:48; 2 Corinthians 8:12.A hard man - Of a sordid, griping disposition; taking advantage of the poor, and oppressing them.Reaping ... - This is indicative of an avaricious and overbearing disposition; compelling the poor to sow for him, and reaping all the benefit himself.Hast not strawed - The word “straw” means to “scatter” - as people scatter seed in sowing it. It may mean, also, to “ventilate,” or to “fan by ventilating” or winnowing. As “sowing” the seed is mentioned just before, it may be that this refers to gathering grain fanned or winnowed by others, while he did nothing - indicating, also, a hard or sordid disposition.
