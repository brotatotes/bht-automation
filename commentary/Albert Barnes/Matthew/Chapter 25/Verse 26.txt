<p style=" "><b>Slothful - </b>Indolent, lazy, who had done nothing. God will judge people not merely for doing wrong, but for not “doing” right. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:45">Matthew 25:45</span>. That servant was “wicked,” because he had such an opinion of his master; he had shown that he was slothful by not making good use of the talent, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:27">Matthew 25:27</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou knewest ... - </b>This should be understood, and might have been translated, as a question. If you knew that I was Such a man you ought to have acted accordingly, so as to have escaped punishment. Didst thou know that I reap, etc.? Then thou shouldst have given my money to the exchangers, etc. This is not intended to “admit” that he was such a man, but to convict the slothful servant of guilt and folly in not having been prepared to meet him.</p>
