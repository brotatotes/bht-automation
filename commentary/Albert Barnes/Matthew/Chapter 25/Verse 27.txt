<p style=" "><b>The exchangers - </b>The “exchangers” were persons who were in the habit of borrowing money, or receiving it on deposit at a low rate of interest, to be loaned to others at higher interest. They commonly sat by “tables” in the temple, with money ready to exchange or loan. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>. This money was left with the servant, not to exchange, nor to increase it by any such idle means, but by honest industry and merchandise; but since he was too indolent for that, he ought at least to have loaned it to the exchangers, that his master might have received some benefit from it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With usury - </b>With interest, increase, or gain. The word “usury,” in our language, has a bad signification, meaning unlawful or exorbitant interest. This was contrary to the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:25">Exodus 22:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+25:36">Leviticus 25:36</span>. The original means “gain,” increase, or lawful interest.</p>
