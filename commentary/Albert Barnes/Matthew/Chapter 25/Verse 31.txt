<p style=" "><b>When the Son of man ... - </b>This is in answer to the question which the disciples proposed to Jesus respecting the end of the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:3">Matthew 24:3</span>. That this refers to the last judgment, and not, as some have supposed, to the destruction of Jerusalem, appears:</p>
<p style=" ">None of these things took place at the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In his glory - </b>In his own proper honor. With his glorified body, and as the head and king of the universe, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-22">Ephesians 1:20-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24-25">1 Corinthians 15:24-25</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The throne of his glory - </b>This means, in the language of the Hebrews, his glorious or splendid throne. It is not to be taken literally, as if there would be a material throne or seat for the King of Zion. It expresses the idea that he will come “as a king and judge” to assemble his subjects before him, and to appoint them their rewards.</p>
