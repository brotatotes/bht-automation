<p style=" "><b>Inherit the kingdom - </b>Receive “as heirs” the kingdom, or be received there as the sons of God. Christians are often called heirs of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6-7">Galatians 4:6-7</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Heb 1:14</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Prepared for you ... - </b>That is, “designed” for you, or appointed for you. The phrase “from the foundation of the world” is used to denote that this was appointed for them in the beginning; that God has no new plan; that the rewards which he will now confer on them he always intended to confer. Christ says to the righteous that the kingdom was prepared for “them.” Of course, God meant to confer it on “them.” They were individuals, and it follows that He intended to bestow His salvation on them as individuals. Accordingly, the salvation of His people is universally represented as the result of the free gift of God, according to His own pleasure, bestowed on individuals, and by a plan which is eternal, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29-30">Romans 8:29-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4-5">Ephesians 1:4-5</span>, <span class="_0000ff"><u>Eph 1:11-12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>.
