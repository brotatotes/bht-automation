Inasmuch as ye did it not ... - By not doing good to the “followers” of Christ, they showed that they had no real love to Him. By not doing good to the poor and needy, to the stranger and the prisoner, they showed that they had not his spirit, and were not like him, and were unfit for his kingdom. Let it be observed here that the public ground of their condemnation is the neglect of duty, or because “they did it not.” We are not to suppose that they will not also be condemned for their open and positive sins. See Romans 2:9; Ephesians 5:5; Colossians 3:5-6; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10; Revelation 21:8; Psalms 9:17. But their neglect of doing good to him and his people may be the “public” reason of condemning them:If it is asked how the pagan who never heard of the name of Christ can be justly condemned in this manner, it may be answered: 1.That Christ acknowledges all the poor, and needy, and strangers of every land, as his brethren. See Matthew 25:40. 2.That by neglecting the duties of charity they show that they have not his spirit are not like him. 3.That these duties are clearly made known by conscience and by the light of nature, as well as by revelation, and people may therefore be condemned for the neglect of them. 4.That they are not condemned for not believing in Christ, of whom they have not heard, but for a wrong spirit, neglect of duty, open crime; for being unlike Christ, and therefore unfit for heaven.One of the least of these - These on my right hand. My brethren. Those who are saved.
