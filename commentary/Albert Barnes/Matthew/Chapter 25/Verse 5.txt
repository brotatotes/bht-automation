The bridegroom tarried - That is, while they waited for him. It was uncertain at what time he would come. He delayed longer than they expected.All slumbered and slept - Waiting until near midnight, they fell into repose. This circumstance is not to be pressed to prove that all Christians will be asleep, or cold and careless, when the Lord Jesus shall come. “Many” may be so, but many, also, will be looking for his coming. This circumstance is designed simply to show more clearly the “duty of being ready,” Matthew 25:13. It does not mean to affirm it “as a fact” that none will be ready.
