<p style=" "><b>I was an hungered - </b>The union between Christ and his people is the most tender and endearing of all connections. It is represented by the closest unions of which we have knowledge, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:4-6">John 15:4-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:23-32">Ephesians 5:23-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:15">1 Corinthians 6:15</span>. This is a union - not physical, but moral; a union of feelings, interests, plans, destiny; or, in other words, he and his people have similar feelings, love the same objects, share the same trials, and inherit the same blessedness, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>. Hence, he considers favors shown to his people as shown to himself, and will reward them accordingly, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40">Matthew 10:40</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:42">Matthew 10:42</span>. They show attachment to him, and love to his cause. By showing kindness to the poor, the needy, and the sick, they show that they possess his spirit, for he did it when on earth; they evince attachment to him, for he was poor and needy; and they show that they have the proper spirit to outfit them for heaven, <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Jo 3:14</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:17">1 John 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1-5">James 2:1-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:41">Mark 9:41</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was a stranger - </b>The word “stranger” means a foreigner or traveler; in our language, one unknown to us. To receive such to the rites of hospitality was, in Eastern countries, where there were few or no public houses, a great virtue. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:1-8">Genesis 18:1-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Took me in - </b>Into your house. Received me kindly.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Naked - </b>Poorly clothed. Among the Jews they were called “naked” who were clad in poor raiment, or who had on only the “tunic” or inner garment, without any outer garment.
