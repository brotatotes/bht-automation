When the even was come - The lamb was killed “between the evenings,” Exodus 12:6 (Hebrew) - that is between three o’clock, p. m., and nine in the evening. The Jews reckoned two evenings - one from three o’clock p. m. to sunset, the other from sunset to the close of the first watch in the night, or nine o’clock p. m. The paschal supper was commonly eaten after the setting of the sun, and often in the night, Exodus 12:8.He sat down - At first the supper was eaten standing, with their loins girded and their staff in their hand, denoting the haste with which they were about to flee from Egypt. Afterward, however, they introduced the practice, it seems, of partaking of this as they did of their ordinary meals. The original word is, “he reclined” - that is, he placed himself on the couch in a reclining posture, in the usual manner in which they partook of their meals. See the notes at Matthew 23:6. While reclining there at the supper, the disciples had a dispute which should be the greatest. See the notes at Luke 22:24-30. At this time, also, before the institution of the Lord’s supper, Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, to teach them humility. See the notes at John 13:1-20.
