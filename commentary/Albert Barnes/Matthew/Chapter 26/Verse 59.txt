<p style=" "><b>False witness - </b>That is, they sought for witnesses who would accuse him of crime of violation of the laws of the land or of God. We are not to suppose that “they wished” them to be “false” witnesses. They were indifferent, probably, whether they were true or false, if they could succeed in condemning him. “The evangelist” calls it false testimony. Before these witnesses were sought, we learn from John <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:19-23">John 18:19-23</span> that the high priest asked Jesus of his disciples and his doctrine. Jesus replied that he had taught openly in the temple, and in secret had said nothing; that is, he had no “secret doctrines” which he had not been willing openly to teach, and he referred the high priest to those who had heard him. In a firm, dignified manner he put himself on trial, and insisted on his rights. “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:23">John 18:23</span>. This conversation took place, probably, before the council was assembled, and during this time the denials by Peter occurred. Luke informs us <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66">Luke 22:66</span> that the council came together as soon as it was day; that is, probably, near the morning, or not far from the break of day - after Peter had denied him and gone out.</p>
