<p style=" "><b>Thou hast said - </b>This is a form of assenting or affirming. Thou hast said the truth; or, as Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:70">Luke 22:70</span> has it, “Ye say that I am.” This was not, however, said “immediately.” Before Jesus acknowledged himself to be the Messiah, he said to them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:67-68">Luke 22:67-68</span>, “If I tell you ye will not believe, and if I also ask you” - that is, propose the proofs of my mission, and require you to give your opinion of them “ye will not answer me, nor let me go.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nevertheless - </b>This word should have been translated: “moreover or furthermore.” What follows is designed to explain and give confirmation to what he had said.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sitting on the right hand of power - </b>That is, of God, called here the Power - equivalent to “the Mighty, or the Almighty.” It denotes dignity and majesty; for to sit at the right hand of a prince was the chief place of honor. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:21">Matthew 20:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Coming in the clouds of heaven - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:0">Matthew 25:0</span>. The meaning of this is, You shall see “the sign from heaven” which you have so often demanded; even the Messiah returning himself “as the sign,” with great glory, to destroy your city and to judge the world.</p>
