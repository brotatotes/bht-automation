<p style=" "><b>But he deeded before them all ... - </b>He denied that he was a disciple; he denied that he knew Jesus; he denied (Mark) that he understood what was meant - that is, he did not see any reason why this question was asked. All this was palpable falsehood, and Peter must have known that it was such. This is remarkable, because Peter had just before been so confident. It is more remarkable, because the edge of the charge was taken off by the insinuation that “John” was known to be a disciple thou “also” wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
