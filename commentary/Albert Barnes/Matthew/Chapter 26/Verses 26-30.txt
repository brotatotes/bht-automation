And when they had sung a hymn - The Passover was observed by the Jews by singing or “chanting” Ps. 113–118. These they divided into two parts. They sung Ps. 113–114 during the observance of the Passover, and the others at the close. There can be no doubt that our Saviour, and the apostles also, used the same psalms in their observance of the Passover. The word rendered “sung a hymn” is a participle, literally meaning “hymning” - not confined to a single hymn, but admitting many.Mount of Olives - See the notes at Matthew 20:1.
