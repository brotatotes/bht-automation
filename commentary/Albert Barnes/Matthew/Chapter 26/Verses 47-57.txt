<p style=" ">The trial of our Lord before the council, and the denial of Peter happening at the same time, might be related one before the other, according to the evangelists’ pleasure.</p>
<p style=" ">Accordingly, Matthew and Mark relate the “trial” first, and Peter’s denial afterward; Luke mentions the denial first, and John has probably observed the natural order. The parallel places are recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:53-72">Mark 14:53-72</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:54-71">Luke 22:54-71</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13-27">John 18:13-27</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To Caiaphas - </b>John says that they led him first to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas. This was done, probably as a mark of respect, he having been high priest, and perhaps distinguished for prudence, and capable of “advising” his son-in-law in a difficult case. The Saviour was “detained” there. probably, until the chief priests and elders were assembled.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The high priest - </b>Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:3">Matthew 26:3</span>. John says he was high priest for that year. Annas had been high priest some years before. In the time of our Saviour the office was frequently changed by the civil ruler. This Caiaphas had prophesied that it was expedient that one should die for the people. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:49-50">John 11:49-50</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The scribes and elders - </b>The men composing the great council of the nation, or Sanhedrin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>. It is not probable that they could be immediately assembled, and some part of the transaction respecting the denial of Peter probably took place while they were collecting.</p>
