<p style=" "><b>And Jesus stood before the governor - </b>Many things are omitted by Matthew, in the account of this trial, which are recorded by the other evangelists. A much more full account is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28-40">John 18:28-40</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the governor asked him ... - </b>This question was asked On account of the “charge” which the Jews brought against Jesus, “of perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span>. It was on this charge that, after consultation, they had agreed to arraign him before Pilate. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>. “They” had condemned him for “blasphemy,” but they well knew that Pilate would altogether disregard an accusation of that kind. They therefore attempted to substitute a totally different accusation from that on which they had professed to find him guilty, to excite the jealousy of the Roman governor, and to procure his death on a charge of treason against the Roman emperor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou sayest - </b>That is, thou sayest right, or thou sayest the truth. We may wonder why the Jews, if they heard this confession, did not press it upon the attention of Pilate as a full confession of his guilt. It was what they had accused him of. But it might be doubtful whether, in the confusion, they heard the confession; or, if they did, Jesus took away all occasion of triumph by explaining to Pilate the “nature” of his kingdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36">John 18:36</span>. Though he acknowledged that he was a king, yet he stated fully that “his kingdom was not of this world,” and that therefore it could not be alleged against him as treason against the Roman emperor. This was done “in the palace,” apart from the Jews, and fully satisfied Pilate of his innocence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:23">John 18:23</span>.</p>
