<p style=" "><b>And when they had bound him - </b>He was “bound” when they took him in the garden, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:12">John 18:12</span>. Probably when he was tried before the Sanhedrin in the palace of Caiaphas, he had been loosed from his bonds, being there surrounded by multitudes, and supposed to be safe. As they were about to lead him to another part of the city now, they again bound him. The binding consisted, probably, in nothing more than tying his hands.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Pontius Pilate, the governor - </b>The governor appointed by the Romans over Judea. The governor commonly resided at Caesarea; but he came up to Jerusalem usually at the great feasts, when great numbers of the Jews were assembled, to administer justice, and to suppress tumults if any should arise. The “title” which Pilate received was that of “governor or procurator.” The duties of the office were, chiefly, to collect the revenues due to the Roman emperor, and in certain cases to administer justice. Pilate was appointed governor of Judea by Tiberius, then Emperor of Rome. John says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span> that they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment - that is, to the part of the “praetorium,” or governor’s palace, where justice was administered. The Jews did not, however, enter in themselves, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:22">Numbers 19:22</span> it is said that whosoever touched an unclean thing should be unclean. For this reason they would not enter into the house of a pagan, lest they should contract some defilement that would render them unfit to keep the Passover.</p>
