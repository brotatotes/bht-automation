<p style=" "><b>He took water ... - </b>The Jews were accustomed to wash their hands when they wished to show that they were innocent of a crime committed by others. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:6">Deuteronomy 21:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+26:6">Psalms 26:6</span>. Pilate, in doing this, meant to denote that they were guilty of his death, but that he was innocent. But the mere washing of his hands did not free him from guilt. He was “bound” as a magistrate to free an innocent man; and whatever might be the clamour of the Jews, “he” was guilty at the bar of God for suffering the holy Saviour to be led to execution, in order to gratify the malice of enraged priests and the clamors of a tumultuous populace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>See ye to it - </b>That is, take it upon yourselves. You are responsible for it, if you put him to death.</p>
