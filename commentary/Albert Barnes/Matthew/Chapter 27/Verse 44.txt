<p style=" "><b>The thieves also - </b>The robbers, or highwaymen. Luke says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:39">Luke 23:39</span> that one of them did it, and that the other reproved him and was penitent. The account in Luke may, however, easily be reconciled with that in Matthew by supposing that “at first both” of them reviled the Saviour, and that it is of this fact that Matthew speaks. Afterward one of them relented and became penitent perhaps from witnessing the patient sufferings of Christ. It is of this one particularly that Luke speaks. Or it may be that what is true of one of the criminals is by Matthew attributed to both. The evangelists, when for the sake of brevity they avoid particularizing, often attribute to many what is said or done by single persons, meaning no more than that it was done by some one or more of them, without specifying the one. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:17">Mark 7:17</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:15">Matthew 15:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:31">Mark 5:31</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45">Luke 8:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:13">Luke 9:13</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:8-9">John 6:8-9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cast the same in his teeth - </b>This is a most unhappy translation. It means in the original simply, they upbraided him or reproached him in the same manner.</p>
