<p style=" "><b>One of them ran - </b>John <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:28">John 19:28</span> says that this was in consequence of Jesus’ saying “I thirst.” One of the effects of crucifixion was excessive thirst.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Took a sponge - </b>A sponge is a well-known porous substance that easily absorbs water. It was used in this case because, Jesus being elevated, it was difficult to convey a cup to his lips.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Filled it with vinegar - </b>This was the common drink of Roman soldiers. It was a light wine, turned sour and mixed with water. John says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:29">John 19:29</span> there was a vessel set full of vinegar, probably for the use of the soldiers who watched his crucifixion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And put it on a reed - </b>John says it was put upon “hyssop.” The “hyssop” was a “shrub,” growing so large sometimes as to be called a “tree,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+4:33">1 Kings 4:33</span>. The stalk of this was what Matthew calls a “reed.” The sponge fastened to this could easily be extended to reach the mouth of “Jesus.” This vinegar Jesus drank, for it was not intended to “stupefy” him or blunt his sense of pain, like the “wine” and myrrh.</p>
