<p style=" "><b>Cried again with a loud voice - </b>He cried, “It is finished,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span>. It was in the height of his agony, probably attended with deep groaning, and uttered amid sorrows which were never else experienced in our world. It finished the work of atonement, made the way of salvation possible, rolled away the curse from guilty people, and opened the kingdom of heaven to all true believers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yielded up the ghost - </b>This, though a literal translation, is unhappy. It means resigned his spirit, or “expired.” The same phrase is used by the Septuagint in describing the death of Rachel. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+35:18">Genesis 35:18</span>.</p>
