<p style=" "><b>When the even was come - </b>That is, some time after three o’clock in the afternoon. Before this, the Jews had besought Pilate that the legs of those who were crucified might be broken and the bodies be taken down, that they might not remain on the cross during the Sabbath. The soldiers, coming to Jesus for that purpose, found that he was already dead, contrary to their expectation. A soldier, however, thrust a spear into his side, and there was furnished the fullest proof that he had expired.

<p style=" "><b>A rich man of Arimathea - </b>It is uncertain where Arimathea was. There were several cities of that name in Judea. It is commonly supposed to be the same as Rama. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:17">Matthew 2:17</span>. Luke says that this was a “city of the Jews,” and it is probable, therefore, that it was in the tribe of Benjamin, and but a short distance from Jerusalem. This man sustained a high character. He was an “honorable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:43">Mark 15:43</span>; he was “a good man and a just” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:50">Luke 23:50</span>; he had nobly set himself against the wicked purposes of the Sanhedrin <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:51">Luke 23:51</span>; he was a disciple of Jesus, though he was not openly his follower, because he feared the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span>.</p>
