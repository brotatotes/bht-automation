<p style=" ">“He wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.” John adds that this was done “with spices” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:40">John 19:40</span>. The Jews were accustomed to use myrrh, aloes, and other aromatics in large quantities when they buried their dead. When they were not regularly embalmed, which was a long and tedious process, they enclosed the spices in the folds of the linen, or wrapped the body in it. Spices were sometimes used in such quantities as to form a “heap or bed,” on which the dead body was laid. Thus it is said of Asa <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+16:14">2 Chronicles 16:14</span>, “they laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and spices,” etc. There not being time properly to embalm the body of Jesus, he was buried in this manner. The women who attended him, either not being aware of this, or desirous of showing a further regard for him, returned from the sepulchre and prepared other spices with which to embalm him on the first day of the week, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:56">Luke 23:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>.</p>
