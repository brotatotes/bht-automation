<p style=" "><b>Now the next day, that followed the days of the preparation - </b>The first day of the feast of the Passover was called the day of “preparation,” because all things were on that day got in readiness for the observances of the paschal week. The Jewish day closed at sunset, and the Sabbath at that time commenced. The “next day” mentioned here does not mean the following day in our acceptation of the word, or the following “morning,” but the next day in the Jewish way of speaking - that is, after the next day had commenced, or after sundown. To suppose them to have waited until the next morning would be absurd, as the disciples would be as likely to steal him away the first night as the second.</p>
