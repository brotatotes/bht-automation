<p style=" "><b>And they took counsel ... - </b>They consulted among themselves about the proper way to dispose of this money.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And bought with them - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>, it is said of Judas that “he purchased a field with the reward of his iniquity.” By the passage in the Acts is meant no more than that he “furnished the means” or “was the occasion” of purchasing the field. It is not of necessity implied that Judas actually made the contract and paid down the money to buy a field to bury strangers in - a thing which would be in itself very improbable, but that it was “by his means” that the field was purchased. It is very frequent in the Scriptures, as well as in other writings, to represent a man as doing that which he is only the cause or occasion of another’s doing. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:1">John 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:59-60">Matthew 27:59-60</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The potter’s field - </b>Probably this was some field well known by that name, which was used for the purpose of making earthen vessels. The price paid for a field so near Jerusalem may appear to be very small; but it is not improbable that it had been worked until the clay was exhausted, and was neither suitable for that business nor for tillage, and was therefore considered as of little value.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To bury strangers in - </b>Jews, who came up from other parts of the world to attend the great feasts at Jerusalem. The high priests, who regarded the “Gentiles” as abominable, would not be inclined to provide a burial-place for them.</p>
