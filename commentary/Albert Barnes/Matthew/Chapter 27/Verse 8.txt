<p style=" "><b>The field of blood - </b>The field purchased by the price of blood. The name by which this field was called was “Aceldama,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:19">Acts 1:19</span>. It was just without the walls of Jerusalem, on the south of Mount Zion. It is now used as a burying-place by the Armenian Christians in Jerusalem, who have a magnificent convent on Mount Zion - Missionary Herald, 1824, p. 66. See the plan of Jerusalem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To this day - </b>That is, to the day when Matthew wrote this gospel, about 30 years after the field was purchased.</p>
