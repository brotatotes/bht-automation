<p style=" "><b>And the governor said, Why? - </b>Luke informs us that Pilate put this question to them “three times,” so anxious was he to release him.</p>
<p style=" ">He affirmed that he had found no cause of death in him. He said, therefore, that he would chastise him and let him go. He expected, probably, by causing him to be publicly whipped, to excite their compassion, to satisfy “them,” and thus to evade the demands of the priests, and to set him at liberty with the consent of the people. So weak and irresolute was this Roman governor! Satisfied of his innocence, he should at once have preferred “justice to popularity,” and acted as became a magistrate in acquitting the innocent.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let him be crucified - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:39">Matthew 27:39</span>. Luke says they were instant with loud voices demanding this. They urged it. They demanded it with a popular clamor.</p>
