<p style=" "><b>Be not afraid - </b>The ancients, when in the presence of a heavenly being - an angel, or one who was supposed to be possessed of divine power were commonly struck with great “fear,” as well as a great sense of their unworthiness. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:8">Luke 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+6:22-23">Judges 6:22-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+13:21-22">Judges 13:21-22</span>. These women were in like manner alarmed when they saw Jesus, believing him now especially to be a Divine Being; seeing him returning from the regions of the dead, and doubtless impressed with a new consciousness that they were unworthy of being in his presence. Jesus comforted them. He was the “same Jesus” with whom they had been before his death, and they had no reason now to fear him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Go tell my brethren - </b>There is something exceedingly tender in the appellation used here - “my brethren.” Though he was risen from the dead, though about to be exalted to heaven, yet he did not disdain to call his disciples his brethren. This was calculated still further to silence the fears of the women and to inspire them with confidence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into Galilee - </b>Galilee was the northern part of the land. There the Saviour commenced his ministry; and there, away from the noise and confusion of the city, he purposed again to meet them, in retirement and quietness, to satisfy them of his resurrection, and to commission them to go forth and preach the everlasting gospel.</p>
