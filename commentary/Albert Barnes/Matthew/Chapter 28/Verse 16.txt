<p style=" "><b>Then the eleven disciples - </b>Judas was dead, leaving but eleven of the original number of the apostles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into a mountain where Jesus lead appointed them - </b>This “appointment” is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:32">Matthew 26:32</span>. On what particular mountain this was is not known. It is probable that Jesus, when he made the appointment, specified the place, which has been omitted by the evangelists. Matthew has omitted many appearances which Jesus made to his disciples which have been recorded by Luke, John, and Paul. See the harmony of the resurrection at the end of the chapter.</p>
