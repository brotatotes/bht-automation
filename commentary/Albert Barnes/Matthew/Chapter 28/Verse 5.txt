<p style=" "><b>And the angel answered and said ... - </b>This was not on the outside of the tomb, for Matthew does not say that the angel appeared to the “women” there, but only to the keepers. Mark says, “entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:5">Mark 16:5</span>. Luke says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:3">Luke 24:3</span>, “they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus; and as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.” Seeing the stone rolled away and the sepulchre open, they of course anxiously entered into it, to see if the body was there. They did not find it, and there they saw the vision of the angels, who gave them information respecting his resurrection. Infidels have objected that there are three inconsistencies in the accounts by Mark and Luke:</p>
<p style=" ">1. That Mark says the angel was sitting, and Luke says they were standing. Answer: The word in Luke does not of necessity mean that they “stood,” but only that they were “present.” Or it may be that the one that Mark mentions was sitting when they entered, and then arose.</p>
<p style=" ">2. It is objected that Luke mentions two, but Mark and Matthew one. Answer: Mark mentions the one who spoke; for it cannot be supposed they both spake the same thing. He does not deny that another was present with him. Luke affirms that there was. This way of speaking is not unfrequent. Thus, Mark and Luke mention only one demoniac who was cured at Gadara. Matthew mentions two. In like manner Mark and Luke speak of only one blind man who was cured at Jericho, while from Matthew it is certain that two were. The fact that but one is mentioned, where it is not denied that there were others, does not prove that there could not be others.</p>
<p style=" ">3. Matthew calls this an “angel.” Mark and Luke say “a man.” Answer: Angels, in the Scriptures, from “appearing” in the form of human beings, are often called as they “appear,” and are mentioned as men. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:2">Genesis 18:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:16">Genesis 18:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:22">Genesis 18:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:1">Genesis 19:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:5">Genesis 19:5</span>. “Fear not ye.” That is, “Be not agitated, or troubled, that you do not find the body of the Saviour. I know that ye seek him, and are troubled that he is removed; but you need not fear that he has been stolen. You will see him again in Galilee.”</p>
