<p style=" "><b>And they departed quickly - </b>Joyful at the “news,” and wishing to impart it to all, they fled to find the disciples, and to tell them that the Lord was risen.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With fear and great joy - </b>Fear because of:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.The wonderful scenes which they had witnessed the stone rolled away, and the presence of an angel;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.A confused state of mind, apprehensive, perhaps, that it might not, after all, be true.</p>
<p style=" ">The news was too good to be credited at once, yet they had sufficient faith in it to fill them with great and unexpected joy. Perhaps no language could better express the state of their minds - the mingled awe and rejoicing - than that which is used here.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And did run ... - </b>They ran to announce what they had seen to the disciples. The city, where the disciples were, was half a mile or more from the place.</p>
