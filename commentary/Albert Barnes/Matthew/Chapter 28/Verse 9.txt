And as they went ... Jesus met them - This was when they left the sepulchre the “second” time. Jesus first appeared to Mary Magdalene when alone, John 20:14. “Afterward” he appeared to the other women, as related by Matthew. See the accounts of the resurrection harmonized at the end of this chapter.All hail - This is a term of salutation. The word all has been supplied by the translators. It is not in the original. The meaning of the word “hail,” here, is rejoice;” a term of salutation connected with the idea of joy at his resurrection, and at meeting them again.Held him by the feet - Or threw themselves prostrate before him. This was the usual posture of supplication. See 2 Kings 4:37. It does not mean that they took hold of his feet, but only that they cast themselves down before him.And worshipped him - See the notes at Matthew 8:2. In this place the word “worship” seems to denote the homage due to the Messiah risen from the dead; regarded by them now in a proper light, and entitled to the honor which was due to God, agreeably to John 5:23.
