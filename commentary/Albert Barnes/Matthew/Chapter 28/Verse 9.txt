<p style=" "><b>And as they went ... Jesus met them - </b>This was when they left the sepulchre the “second” time. Jesus first appeared to Mary Magdalene when alone, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:14">John 20:14</span>. “Afterward” he appeared to the other women, as related by Matthew. See the accounts of the resurrection harmonized at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All hail - </b>This is a term of salutation. The word all has been supplied by the translators. It is not in the original. The meaning of the word “hail,” here, is rejoice;” a term of salutation connected with the idea of joy at his resurrection, and at meeting them again.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Held him by the feet - </b>Or threw themselves prostrate before him. This was the usual posture of supplication. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:37">2 Kings 4:37</span>. It does not mean that they took hold of his feet, but only that they cast themselves down before him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And worshipped him - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:2">Matthew 8:2</span>. In this place the word “worship” seems to denote the homage due to the Messiah risen from the dead; regarded by them now in a proper light, and entitled to the honor which was due to God, agreeably to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>.</p>
