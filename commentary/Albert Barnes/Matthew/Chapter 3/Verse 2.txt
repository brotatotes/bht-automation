<p style=" "><b>Repent ye - </b>Repentance implies sorrow for past offences <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:10">2 Corinthians 7:10</span>; a deep sense of the evil of sin as committed against God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:4">Psalms 51:4</span>; and a full purpose to turn from transgression and to lead a holy life. A true penitent has sorrow for sin, not only because it is ruinous to his soul, but chiefly because it is an offence against God, and is that abominable thing which he hates, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+44:4">Jeremiah 44:4</span>. It is produced by seeing the great danger and misery to which it exposes us; by seeing the justice and holiness of God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+42:6">Job 42:6</span>; and by seeing that our sins have been committed against Christ, and were the cause of his death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61-62">Luke 22:61-62</span>. There are two words in the New Testament translated “repentance,” one of which denotes a change of mind, or a reformation of life; and the other, sorrow or regret that sin has been committed. The word used here is the former, calling the Jews to a change of life, or a reformation of conduct. In the time of John, the nation had become extremely wicked and corrupt, perhaps more so than at any preceding period. Hence, both he and Christ began their ministry by calling the nation to repentance.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The kingdom of heaven is at hand - </b>The phrases kingdom of heaven, kingdom of Christ, kingdom of God, are of frequent occurrence in the Bible. They all refer to the same thing. The expectation of such a kingdom was taken from the Old Testament, and especially from Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</span>. The prophets had told of a successor to David that should sit on his throne <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:4">1 Kings 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:25">1 Kings 8:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+33:17">Jeremiah 33:17</span>. The Jews expected a great national deliverer. They supposed that when the Messiah should appear, all the dead would be raised; that the judgment would take place; and that the enemies of the Jews would be destroyed, and that they themselves would be advanced to great national dignity and honor.</p>
<p style=" ">The language in which they were accustomed to describe this event was retained by our Saviour and his apostles. Yet they early attempted to correct the common notions respecting his reign. This was one design, doubtless, of John in preaching repentance. Instead of summoning them to military exercises, and collecting an army, which would have been in accordance with the expectations of the nation, he called them to a change of life; to the doctrine of repentance - a state of things far more accordant with the approach of a kingdom of purity.</p>
<p style=" ">The phrases “kingdom of God” and “kingdom of heaven” have been supposed to have a considerable variety of meaning. Some have supposed that they refer to the state of things in heaven; others, to the personal reign of Christ on earth; others, that they mean the church, or the reign of Christ in the hearts of his people. There can be no doubt that there is reference in the words to the condition of things in heaven after this life. But the church of God is a preparatory state to that beyond the grave - a state in which Christ pre-eminently rules and reigns and there is no doubt that the phrases sometimes refer to the state of things in the church; and that they may refer, therefore, to the state of things which the Messiah was to set up his spiritual reign begun in the church on earth and completed in heaven.</p>
<p style=" ">The expression “the kingdom of heaven is at hand” would be best translated, “the reign of God draws near.” We do not say commonly of a kingdom that it is movable, or that it approaches. A reign may be said to be at hand; and it may be said with propriety that the time when Christ would reign was at hand. In this sense it is meant that the time when Christ should reign, or set up his kingdom, or begin his dominion on earth, under the Christian economy, was about to commence. The phrase, then, should not be confined to any period of that reign, but includes his whole dominion over his people on earth and in heaven.</p>
<p style=" ">In the passage here it clearly means that the coming of the Messiah was near, or that the time of the reign of God which the Jews had expected was coming.</p>
<p style=" ">The word “heaven,” or “heavens,” as it is in the original, means sometimes the place so called; and sometimes it is, by a figure of speech, put for the Great Being whose residence is there, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+4:26">Daniel 4:26</span>; “the Heavens do rule.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:30">Mark 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:18">Luke 15:18</span>. As that kingdom was one of purity, it was proper that the people should prepare themselves for it by turning from their sins, and by bringing their hearts into a state suitable to his reign.</p>
