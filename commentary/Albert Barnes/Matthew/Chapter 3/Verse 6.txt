<p style=" "><b>Were baptized - </b>The word “baptize” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτίζω</span></span> baptizo signifies originally to tinge, to dye, to stain, as those who dye clothes. It here means to cleanse or wash anything by the application of water. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:4">Mark 7:4</span>. Washing, or ablution, was much in use among the Jews, as one of the rites of their religion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:7">Numbers 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:10">Hebrews 9:10</span>. It was not customary, however, among them to baptize those who were converted to the Jewish religion until after the Babylonian captivity. At the time of John, and for some time previous, they had been accustomed to administer a rite of baptism, or washing, to those who became proselytes to their religion; that is, to those who were converted from being Gentiles. This was done to signify that they renounced the errors and worship of the pagans, and as significant of their becoming pure by embracing a new religion.</p>
<p style=" ">It was a solemn rite of washing, significant of cleansing from their former sins, and purifying them for the special service of Yahweh. John found this custom in use; and as he was calling the Jews to a new dispensation - to a change in their form of religion - he administered this rite of baptism (washing), to signify the cleansing from sin, the adopting of the new dispensation, or the fitness for the pure reign of the Messiah. He applied an old ordinance to a new purpose. As it was used by him it was a significant rite, or ceremony, intended to denote the putting away of impurity, and a purpose to be pure in heart and life. The Hebrew word <span class="_800000">טבל</span> Tabal which is rendered by the word “baptize,” occurs in the Old Testament in the following places, namely: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:6">Leviticus 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+14:6">Leviticus 14:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+14:51">Leviticus 14:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:18">Numbers 19:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ru+2:14">Ruth 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:22">Exodus 12:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:24">Deuteronomy 33:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+3:15">Joshua 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+9:31">Job 9:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+9:9">Leviticus 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:27">1 Samuel 14:27</span> (twice); <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:14">2 Kings 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+8:15">2 Kings 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:31">Genesis 37:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+3:15">Joshua 3:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">It occurs in no other places; and from a careful examination of these passages its meaning among the Jews is to be derived. From these passages it will be seen that its radical meaning is neither to sprinkle nor to immerse. It is to dip, commonly for the purpose of sprinkling, or for some other purpose.</p>
<p style=" ">Thus, to dip the finger, i. e., a part of the finger, in blood enough to sprinkle with, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:6">Leviticus 4:6</span>. To dip a living bird, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop, in the blood of the bird that was killed, for the purpose of sprinkling; where it could not be that all these would be immersed the blood of a single bird, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+14:6">Leviticus 14:6</span>. To dip hyssop in the water, to sprinkle with, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:18">Numbers 19:18</span>. To dip a portion of bread in vinegar, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ru+2:14">Ruth 2:14</span>. To dip the feet in oil - an emblem of plenty, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:24">Deuteronomy 33:24</span>. To dye, or stain, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+23:15">Ezekiel 23:15</span>. To plunge into a ditch, so as to defile the clothes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+9:31">Job 9:31</span>. To dip the end of a staff in honey, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:27">1 Samuel 14:27</span>. To dip in Jordan - a declaration respecting Naaman the Syrian, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:14">2 Kings 5:14</span>. The direction of the prophet was to wash himself <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:10">2 Kings 5:10</span>, and this shows that he understood washing and baptizing to mean the same thing. To dip a towel, or quilt, so as to spread it on the face of a man to smother him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+8:15">2 Kings 8:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">In none of these cases can it be shown that the meaning of the word is to immerse entirely But in nearly all the cases the notion of applying the water to a part only of the person or object, though it was by dipping, is necessarily to be supposed.</p>
<p style=" ">In the New Testament the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτίζω</span></span> baptizo, in various forms, occurs 80 times; 57 with reference to persons. Of these 57 times, it is followed by “in” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν</span></span> en 18 times, as in water, in the desert, in Jordan; 9 times by “into” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis, as into the name, etc., into Christ; once it is followed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπί</span></span> epi <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>, and twice by “for” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὑπέρ</span></span> huper, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:29">1 Corinthians 15:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The following remarks may be made in view of the investigation of the meaning of this word:</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Jordan - </b>The River Jordan is the eastern boundary of Palestine or Judea. It rises in Mount Lebanon, on the north of Palestine, and runs in a southerly direction, underground, for 13 miles, and then bursts forth with a great noise at Cesarea Philippi. It then unites with two small streams, and runs some miles farther, and empties into the Lake Merom. From this small lake it flows 13 miles, and then falls into the Lake Gennesareth, otherwise called the Sea of Tiberias or the Sea of Galilee. Through the middle of this lake, which is 15 miles long and from 6 miles to 9 miles wide, it flows undisturbed, and preserves a southerly direction for about 70 miles, and then falls into the Dead Sea. The Jordan, at its entrance into the Dead Sea, is about 90 feet wide. It flows in many places with great rapidity, and when swollen by rains pours like an impetuous torrent. It formerly regularly overflowed its banks in time of harvest, that is, in March, in some places 600 paces, <span class="_0000ff"><u>Jos 3:15</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+12:15">1 Chronicles 12:15</span>. These banks are covered with small trees and shrubs, and afford a convenient dwelling for wild beasts. Allusion is often made to these thickets in the sacred Scriptures, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+49:19">Jeremiah 49:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+50:44">Jeremiah 50:44</span>. On the reason why a river, or a place abounding in water, was selected for administering baptism, see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:23">John 3:23</span>.</p>
