<p style=" "><b>Bring forth therefore fruits ... - </b>That is, the proper fruits of reformation; the proper evidence that you are sincere. Do not bring your cunning and dissimulation to this work; do not carry your hypocrisy into your professed repentance, but evince your sincerity by forsaking sin, and thus give evidence that this coming to Jordan to be baptized is not an act of dissimulation. No discourse could have been more appropriate or more cutting.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fruits - </b>Conduct. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16-19">Matthew 7:16-19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Meet for repentance - </b>Fit for repentance; appropriate to it the proper expression of repentance.</p>
