<p style=" "><b>Then the devil leaveth him - </b>He left him for a time, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:13">Luke 4:13</span>. He intended to return again to the temptation, and, if possible, to seduce him yet from God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span>.

<p style=" "><b>The angels came and ministered - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>. They came and supplied his wants and comforted him. From this narrative we may learn:</p>
<p style=" ">(a) That no one is so holy as to be free from temptation, for even the Son of God was sorely tempted.</p>
<p style=" ">(b) That when God permits a temptation or trial to come upon us, he will, if we look to him, give us grace to resist and overcome it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:13">1 Corinthians 10:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(c) We see the art of the tempter. His temptations are adapted to times and circumstances. They are plausible. What could have been mere plausible than his suggestions to Christ? They were applicable to his circumstances. They had the appearance of much piety. They were backed by passages of Scripture misapplied, but still most artfully presented. Satan never comes boldly and tempts people to sin, telling them that they are committing sin. Such a mode would defeat his design. It would put people on their guard. He commences, therefore, artfully and plausibly, and the real purpose does not appear until he has prepared the mind for it. This is the way with all temptation. No wicked person would at once tempt another to be profane, to be drunk, to be an infidel, or to commit adultery. The principles are first corrupted. The confidence is secured. The affections are won. And <i>then</i> the allurement is little by little presented, until the victim falls. How everyone should be on his guard at the very first appearance of evil, at the first suggestion that may possibly lead to sin!</p>
<p style=" ">(d) One of the best ways of meeting temptation is by applying Scripture. So our Saviour did, and they will always best succeed who best wield the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span>.</p>
