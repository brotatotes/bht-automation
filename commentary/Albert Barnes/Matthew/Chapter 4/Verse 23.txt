<p style=" "><b>Synagogues - </b>Places of worship, or places where the people assembled together to worship God. The origin of synagogues is involved in much obscurity. The sacrifices of the Jews were appointed to be held in one place, at Jerusalem. But there was nothing to forbid the other services of religion to be performed at any other place. Accordingly, the praises of God were sung in the schools of the prophets; and those who chose were assembled by the prophets and seers on the Sabbath, and the new moons, for religious worship, <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Ki 4:23</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+10:5-11">1 Samuel 10:5-11</span>. The people would soon see the necessity of providing convenient places for their services, to shelter them from storms and from the heat, and this was probably the origin of synagogues. At what time they were commenced is unknown. They are mentioned by Josephus a considerable time before the coming of Christ; and in his time they were multiplied, not only in Judea, but wherever there were Jews. There were no less than 480 in Jerusalem alone before it was taken by the Romans.</p>
<p style=" ">Synagogues were built in any place where ten men were found who were willing to associate for the purpose, and were the regular customary places of worship. In them the law, i. e. the Old Testament, divided into suitable portions, was read, prayers were offered, and the Scriptures were expounded. The law was so divided that the five books of Moses, and portions of the prophets, could be read through each year. The Scriptures. after being read, were expounded. This was done, either by the officers of the synagogue, or by any person who might be invited by the officiating minister. Our Saviour and the apostles were in the habit of attending at those places continually, and of speaking to the people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:15-27">Luke 4:15-27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:14-15">Acts 13:14-15</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The synagogues were built in imitation of the temple, with a center building, supported by pillars, and a court surrounding it. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>. In the center building, or chapel, was a place prepared for the reading of the law. The law was kept in a chest, or ark, near to the pulpit. The uppermost seats <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span> were those nearest to the pulpit. The people sat around, facing the pulpit. When the law was read, the officiating person rose; when it was expounded, he was seated. Our Saviour imitated their example, and was commonly seated in addressing the people, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1">Matthew 13:1</span>.</p>
