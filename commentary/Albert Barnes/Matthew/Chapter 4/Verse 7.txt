<p style=" "><b>Jesus said unto him, It is written again - </b>Again the Saviour replied to Satan by a text of Scripture - a passage which expressly forbade an act like this.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God - </b>This is quoted literally from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:16">Deuteronomy 6:16</span>. The meaning is, thou shalt not try him; or, thou shalt not, by throwing thyself into voluntary and uncommanded dangers, appeal to God for protection, or trifle with the promises made to those who are thrown into danger by his providence. It is true, indeed, that God aids those of his people who are placed by him in trial or danger; but it is not true that the promise was meant to extend to those who wantonly provoke him and trifle with the promised help. Thus, Satan, artfully using and perverting Scripture, was met and repelled by Scripture rightly applied.</p>
