<p style=" "><b>The people which sat in darkness - </b>This is an expression denoting great ignorance.</p>
<p style=" ">As in darkness or night we can see nothing, and know not where to go, so those who are ignorant of God and their duty are said to be in darkness. The instruction which removes this ignorance is called light. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Pe 2:9</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span>. As ignorance is often connected with crime and vice, so darkness is sometimes used to denote sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:5">1 Thessalonians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11">Ephesians 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Saw great light - </b>That is, as the passage is employed by Matthew, the light under the Messiah would spring up among them. In that region he grew up, and in that region he preached a great part of his discourses and performed a great part of his miracles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The region and shadow of death - </b>This is a forcible and beautiful image, designed also to denote ignorance and sin. It is often used in the Bible, and is very expressive. A “shadow” is caused by an object coming between us and the sun. So the Hebrews imaged death as standing between us and the sun, and casting a long, dark, and baleful shadow abroad on the face of the nations, denoting their great ignorance, sin, and woe.. It denotes a dismal, gloomy, and dreadful shade, where death and sin reign, like the chills, damps, and horrors of the dwelling-place of the dead. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+10:21">Job 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+16:16">Job 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+34:22">Job 34:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+23:4">Psalms 23:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:6">Jeremiah 2:6</span>. See also the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span>. These expressions denote that the country of Galilee was especially dark. We know that the people were proverbially ignorant and stupid. They were distinguished for a coarse, outlandish manner of speech <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:70">Mark 14:70</span>, and are represented as having been also distinguished by a general profligacy of morals and manners. It shows the great compassion of the Saviour, that he went to preach to such poor and despised sinners. Instead of seeking the rich and the learned, he chose to minister to the needy, the ignorant, and the contemned. His office is to enlighten the ignorant; his delight to guide the wandering, and to raise up those that are in the shadow of death. In doing this, Jesus set an example for all his followers. It is their duty to seek out those who are sitting in the shadow of death, and to send the gospel to them. No small part of the world is still lying in wickedness - as wicked and wretched as was the land of Zabulon and Naphthali in the time of Jesus. The Lord Jesus is able to enlighten them also, and every Christian should regard it a privilege, as well as a duty, to imitate his Saviour in this, and to be permitted to send to them the light of life.
