<p style=" "><b>And seeing the multitudes - </b>The great numbers that came to attend on his ministry. The substance of this discourse is recorded also in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:0">Luke 6:0</span>. It is commonly called the “Sermon on the Mount.” It is not improbable that it was repeated, in substance, on different occasions, and to different people. At those times parts of it may have been omitted, and Luke may have recorded it as it was pronounced on one of those occasions. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17-20">Luke 6:17-20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Went up into a mountain - </b>This mountain, or hill, was somewhere in the vicinity of Capernaum, but where precisely is not mentioned. He ascended the hill, doubtless, because it was more convenient to address the multitude from an eminence than if he were on the same level with them. A hill or mountain is still shown a short distance to the northwest of the ancient site of Capernaum, which tradition reports to have been the place where this sermon was delivered, and which is called on the maps the Mount of Beatitudes. The hill commonly believed to be that on which the sermon was delivered is on the road from Nazareth to Tiberias, not far from the latter place. The hill is known by the name of Kuran Huttin, the Horns of Huttin. Of this hill Professor Hackett (<i>Illustrations of Scripture</i>, pp. 323, 324) says: “Though a noontide heat was beating down upon us with scorching power, I could not resist the temptation to turn aside and examine a place for which such a claim has been set up, though I cannot say that I have any great confidence in it. The hill referred to is rocky, and rises steeply to a moderate height above the plain. It has two summits, with a slight depression between them, and it is from these projecting points, or horns, that it receives the name given to it. From the top the observer has a full view of the Sea of Tiberias. The most pleasing feature of the landscape is that presented by the diversified appearance of the fields. The different plots of ground exhibit various colors, according to the state. of cultivation: some of them are red, where the land has been newly plowed up, the natural appearance of the soil; others yellow or white, where the harvest is beginning to ripen, or is already ripe; and others green, being covered with grass or springing grain. As they are contiguous to each other, or intermixed, these particolored plots present at some distance an appearance of joyful chequered work, which is really beautiful.</p>
<p style=" ">“In rhetorical descriptions of the delivery of the Sermon on the Mount, we often hear the people represented as looking up to the speaker from the sides of the hill, or listening to him from the plain. This would not be possible with reference to the present locality; for it is too precipitous and too elevated to allow of such a position. The Saviour could have sat there, however, in the midst of his hearers, for it affords a platform amply large enough for the accommodation of the hundreds who may have been present on that occasion.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And when he was set - </b>This was the common mode of teaching among the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:3">Luke 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:2">John 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:14">Acts 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His disciples came unto him - </b>The word “disciples” means “learners,” those who are taught. Here it is put for those who attended on the ministry of Jesus, and does not imply that they were all Christians.
