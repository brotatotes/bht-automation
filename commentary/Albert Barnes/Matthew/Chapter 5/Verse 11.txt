<p style=" "><b>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you - </b>Reproach you; call you by evil and contemptuous names; ridicule you because you are Christians. Thus, they said of Jesus that he was a Samaritan and had a devil <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span>; that he was mad <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:20">John 10:20</span>; and thus they reviled and mocked him on the cross, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:39-44">Matthew 27:39-44</span>. But, being reviled, he reviled not again <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:23">1 Peter 2:23</span>; and thus being reviled, we should bless <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>; and thus, though the contempt of the world is not in itself desirable, yet it is blessed to tread in the footsteps of Jesus, to imitate his example, and even to suffer for his sake, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:29">Philippians 1:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All manner of evil against you falsely - </b>An emphasis should be laid on the word falsely in this passage. It is not blessed to have evil spoken of us if we deserve it; but if we deserve it not, then we should not consider it as a calamity. We should take it patiently, and show how much the Christian, under the consciousness of innocence, can bear, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:13-18">1 Peter 3:13-18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For my sake - </b>Because you are attached to me; because you are Christians. We are not to seek such things. We are not to do things to offend others; to treat them harshly or unkindly, and. to court revilings. We are not to say or do things, though they may be on the subject of religion, designed to disgust or offend. But if, in the faithful endeavor to be Christians, we are reviled, as our Master was, then we are to take it with patience, and to remember that thousands before us have been treated in like manner. When thus reviled or persecuted, we are to be meek, patient, humble; not angry; not reviling again; but endeavoring to do good to our persecutors and slanderers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:24-25">2 Timothy 2:24-25</span>. In this way many have been convinced of the power and excellence of that religion which they were persecuting and reviling. They have seen that nothing else but Christianity could impart such patience and meekness to the persecuted; and have, by this means, been constrained to submit themselves to the gospel of Jesus. Long since it became a proverb, “that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church.”</p>
