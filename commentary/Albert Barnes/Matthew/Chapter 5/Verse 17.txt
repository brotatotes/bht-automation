<p style=" "><b>Think not that I am come ... - </b>Our Saviour was just entering on his work. It was important for him to state what he came to do. By his setting up to be a teacher in opposition to the scribes and Pharisees, some might charge him with an intention to destroy their law, and to abolish the customs of the nation. He therefore told them that he did not come for that end, but really to fulfill or accomplish what was in the law and the prophets.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To destroy - </b>To abrogate; to deny their divine authority; to set people free from the obligation to obey them. “The law.” The five books of Moses called the law. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44">Luke 24:44</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The Prophets - </b>The books which the prophets wrote. These two divisions here seem to comprehend the Old Testament, and Jesus says that he came not to do away or destroy the authority of the Old Testament.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But to fulfil - </b>To complete the design; to fill up what was predicted; to accomplish what was intended in them. The word “fulfill” also means sometimes “to teach” or “to inculcate,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:25">Colossians 1:25</span>. The law of Moses contained many sacrifices and rites which were designed to shadow forth the Messiah. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:0">Hebrews 9:0</span>. These were fulfilled when he came and offered himself a sacrifice to God,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “A sacrifice of nobler name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> And richer blood than they.”</p>
<p style=" ">The prophets contained many predictions respecting his coming and death. These were all to be fulfilled and fully accomplished by his life and his sufferings.</p>
