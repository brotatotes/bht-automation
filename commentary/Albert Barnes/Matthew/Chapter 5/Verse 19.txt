<p style=" "><b>Whosoever therefore shall break - </b>Shall violate or disobey.</p>
<p style=" "><b>One of these least commandments - </b>The Pharisees, it is probable, divided the precepts of the law into lesser and greater, teaching that they who violated the former were guilty of a trivial offence only. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span>. Christ teaches that in his kingdom they who make this distinction, or who taught that any laws of God might be violated with impunity, should be called least; while they should be held in high regard who observed all the laws of God without distinction.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be called least - </b>That is, shall be least. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>. The meaning of this passage seems to be this: in the kingdom of heaven, that is, in the kingdom of the Messiah, or in the church which he is about to establish (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>), he that breaks the least of these commandments shall be in no esteem, or shall not be regarded as a proper religious teacher. The Pharisees, by dividing the law into greater and lesser precepts, made no small part of it void by their traditions and divisions, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:3-6">Matthew 15:3-6</span>. Jesus says that in his kingdom all this vain division and tradition would cease. Such divisions and distinctions would be a small matter. He that attempted it should be the least of all. People would be engaged in yielding obedience to all the law of God without any such vain distinctions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be called great - </b>He that teaches that all the law of God is binding, and that the whole of it should be obeyed, without attempting to specify what is most important, shall be a teacher worthy of his office, and shall be called great. Hence, we learn:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1.That all the law of God is binding on Christians. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:10">James 2:10</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2.That all the commands of God should be preached, in their proper place, by Christian ministers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3.That they who pretend that there are any laws of God so small that they need not obey them, are unworthy of his kingdom. And,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 4.That true piety has respect to all the commandments of God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:6">Psalms 119:6</span>.</p>
