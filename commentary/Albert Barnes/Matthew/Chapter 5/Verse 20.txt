<p style=" "><b>Your righteousness - </b>Your holiness; your views of the nature of righteousness, and your conduct and lives. Unless you are more holy than they are, you cannot be saved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall exceed - </b>Shall excel, or abound more. The righteousness of true Christians is seated in the heart, and is therefore genuine. Jesus means that unless they had more real holiness of character than the scribes and Pharisees, they could not be saved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>. Their righteousness consisted in outward observances of the ceremonial and traditional law. They offered sacrifices, fasted often. prayed much, were punctilious about ablutions, and tithes, and the ceremonies of religion, but neglected justice, truth, purity, and holiness of heart. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13-33">Matthew 23:13-33</span>. The righteousness that Jesus required in his kingdom was purity, chastity, honesty, temperance, the fear of God, and the love of man. It is pure, eternal, reaching the motives, and making the life holy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The kingdom of heaven - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>. Shall not be a suitable subject of his kingdom here, or saved in the world to come.</p>
