<p style=" "><b>Ye have heard - </b>Or, this is the common interpretation among the Jews. Jesus proceeds here to comment on some prevailing opinions among the Jews; to show that the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was defective; and that people needed a better righteousness, or they could not be saved. He illustrates what he meant by that better righteousness by showing that the common opinions of the scribes were erroneous.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By them of old time - </b>This might be translated to the ancients, referring to Moses and the prophets. But it is more probable that Jesus here refers to the interpreters of the law and the prophets. He did not set himself against the law of Moses, but against the false and pernicious interpretations of the law prevalent in his time.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou shalt not kill - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:13">Exodus 20:13</span>. This properly denotes taking the life of another with malice, or with an intention to murder him. The Jews understood it as meaning no more. The comment of our Saviour shows that it was spiritual, and was designed to extend to the thoughts and feelings as well as the external act.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be in danger of - </b>Shall be held guilty, and be punished by. The law of Moses declared that the murderer should be put to death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+24:21">Leviticus 24:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+35:16">Numbers 35:16</span>. It did not say, however, by whom this should be done, and it was left to the Jews to organize courts to have cognizance of such crimes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+16:18">Deuteronomy 16:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The judgment - </b>This was the tribunal that had cognizance of cases of murder, etc. It was a court that sat in each city or town, and consisted commonly of seven members. It was the lowest court among the Jews, and from it an appeal might be taken to the Sanhedrin.</p>
