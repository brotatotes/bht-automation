<p style=" "><b>Blessed are the poor in spirit - </b>The word “blessed” means “happy,” referring to that which produces felicity, from whatever quarter it may come.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Poor in spirit - </b>Luke says simply, Blessed are the poor. It has been disputed whether Christ meant the poor in reference to the things of this life, or to the humble. The gospel is said to be preached to the poor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span>. It was predicted that the Messiah would preach to the poor, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>. It is said that they have special facilities for being saved, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:23">Matthew 19:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:24">Luke 18:24</span>. The state of such persons is therefore comparatively blessed, or happy. Riches produce care, anxiety, and dangers, and not the least is the danger of losing heaven by them. To be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves; to be sensible that we are sinners, and have no righteousness of our own; to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of God; to be willing to be where God places us, to bear what he lays on us, to go where he bids us, and to die when he commands; to be willing to be in his hands, and to feel that we deserve no favor from him. It is opposed to pride, and vanity, and ambition. Such are happy:</p>
<p style=" ">It is remarkable that Jesus began his ministry in this manner, so unlike all others. Other teachers had taught that happiness was to be found in honor, or riches, or splendor, or sensual pleasure. Jesus overlooked all those things, and fixed his eye on the poor and the humble, and said that happiness was to be found in the lowly vale of poverty more than in the pomp and splendors of life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Theirs is the kingdom of heaven - </b>That is, either they have special facilities for entering the kingdom of heaven, and of becoming Christians here, or they shall enter heaven hereafter. Both these ideas are probably included. A state of poverty a state where we are despised or unhonored by people is a state where people are most ready to seek the comforts of religion here, and a home in the heavens hereafter. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:2">Matthew 2:2</span>.</p>
