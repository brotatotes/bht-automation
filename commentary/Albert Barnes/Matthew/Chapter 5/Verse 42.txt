<p style=" "><b>Give to him that asketh thee - </b>This is the general rule. It is better to give sometimes to an undeserving person than to turn away one who is really in need. It is good to be in the habit of giving. At the same time, the rule must be interpreted so as to be consistent with our duty to our families <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:8">1 Timothy 5:8</span> and with other objects of justice and charity. It is seldom, perhaps never, good to give to a person who is able to work, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</span>. To give to such is to encourage laziness, and to support the idle at the expense of the industrious. If such a one is indeed hungry, feed him; if he needs anything further, give him employment. If a widow, an orphan, a man of misfortune, or an infirmed man, lame, or sick, is at your door, never send any of them away empty. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:2">Hebrews 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:35-45">Matthew 25:35-45</span>. So this is true of a poor and needy friend that wishes to borrow. We are not to turn away or deny him. This deserves, however, some limitation. It must be done in consistency with other duties. To lend to every worthless man would be to throw away our property, encourage laziness and crime, and ruin our own families. It should be done consistently with every other obligation, and of this everyone is to be the judge. Perhaps our Saviour meant to teach that where there was a deserving friend or brother in need, we should lend to him without usury, and without standing much about the security.</p>
