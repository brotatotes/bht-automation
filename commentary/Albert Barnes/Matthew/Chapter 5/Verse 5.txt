<p style=" "><b>The meek - </b>Meekness is patience in the reception of injuries. It is neither meanness nor a surrender of our rights, nor cowardice; but it is the opposite of sudden anger, of malice, of long-harbored vengeance. Christ insisted on his right when he said, “If I have done evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:23">John 18:23</span>. Paul asserted his right when he said, “They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves, and fetch us out,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:37">Acts 16:37</span>. And yet Christ was the very model of meekness. It was one of his characteristics, “I am meek,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>. So of Paul. No man endured more wrong, or endured it more patiently than he. Yet the Saviour and the apostle were not passionate. They bore all patiently. They did not press their rights through thick and thin, or trample down the rights of others to secure their own.</p>
<p style=" ">Meekness is the reception of injuries with a belief that God will vindicate us. “Vengeance is his; he will repay,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:19">Romans 12:19</span>. It little becomes us to take his place, and to do what he has promised to do.</p>
<p style=" ">Meekness produces peace. It is proof of true greatness of soul. It comes from a heart too great to be moved by little insults. It looks upon those who offer them with pity. He that is constantly ruffled; that suffers every little insult or injury to throw him off his guard and to raise a storm of passion within, is at the mercy of every mortal that chooses to disturb him. He is like “the troubled sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>They shall inherit the earth - </b>This might have been translated the land. It is probable that here is a reference to the manner in which the Jews commonly expressed themselves to denote any great blessing. It was promised to them that they should inherit the land of Canaan. For a long time the patriarchs looked forward to this, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:7-8">Genesis 15:7-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:13">Exodus 32:13</span>. They regarded it as a great blessing. It was so spoken of in the journey in the wilderness, and their hopes were crowned when they took possession of the promised land, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+1:38">Deuteronomy 1:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+16:20">Deuteronomy 16:20</span>. In the time of our Saviour they were in the constant habit of using the Old Testament, where this promise perpetually occurs, and they used it “as a proverbial expression to denote any great blessing, perhaps as the sum of all blessings,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:20">Psalms 37:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:21">Isaiah 60:21</span>. Our Saviour used it in this sense, and meant to say, not that the meek would own great property or have many lands, but that they would possess special blessings. The Jews also considered the land of Canaan as a type of heaven, and of the blessings under the Messiah. To inherit the land became, therefore, an expression denoting those blessings. When our Saviour uses this language here, he means that the meek shall be received into his kingdom, and partake of its blessings here, and of the glories of the heavenly Canaan hereafter. The value of meekness, even in regard to worldly property and success in life, is often exhibited in the Scriptures, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:24-25">Proverbs 22:24-25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+15:1">Proverbs 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:8">Proverbs 25:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:15">Proverbs 25:15</span>. It is also seen in common life that a meek, patient, mild man is the most prospered. An impatient and quarrelsome man raises up enemies; often loses property in lawsuits; spends his time in disputes and broils rather than in sober, honest industry; and is harassed, vexed, and unsuccessful in all that he does. “Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3-6">1 Timothy 6:3-6</span>.</p>
