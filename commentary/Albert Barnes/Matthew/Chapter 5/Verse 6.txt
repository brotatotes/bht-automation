<p style=" "><b>Blessed are they which do hunger ... - </b>Hunger and thirst, here, are expressive of strong desire. Nothing would better express the strong desire which we ought to feel to obtain righteousness than hunger and thirst. No needs are so keen, none so imperiously demand supply, as these. They occur daily, and when long continued, as in case of those shipwrecked, and doomed to wander months or years over burning sands, with scarcely any drink or food, nothing is more distressing. An ardent desire for anything is often represented in the Scriptures by hunger and thirst, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+42:1-2">Psalms 42:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+63:1-2">Psalms 63:1-2</span>. A desire for the blessings of pardon and peace; a deep sense of sin, and want, and wretchedness, is also represented by thirsting, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:1-2">Isaiah 55:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They shall be filled - </b>They shall be satisfied as a hungry man is when supplied with food, or a thirsty man when supplied with drink. Those who are perishing for want of righteousness; those who feel that they are lost sinners and strongly desire to be holy, shall be thus satisfied. Never was there a desire to be holy which God was not willing to gratify, and the gospel of Christ has made provision to satisfy all who truly desire to be holy.
