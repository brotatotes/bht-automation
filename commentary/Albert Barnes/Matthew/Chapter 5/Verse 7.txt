<p style=" "><b>Blessed are the merciful - </b>That is, those who are so affected by the sufferings of others as to be disposed to alleviate them. This is given as an evidence of piety, and it is said that they who show mercy to others shall obtain it. The same sentiment is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:42">Matthew 10:42</span>; “Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34-40">Matthew 25:34-40</span>. This should be done with a wish to glorify God; that is, in obedience to his commandments, and with a desire that he should be honored, and with a feeling that we are benefiting one of his creatures. Then he will regard it as done to him, and will reward us. See the sentiment of this verse, that the merciful shall obtain mercy, more fully expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+22:26-27">2 Samuel 22:26-27</span>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:25-26">Psalms 18:25-26</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Nowhere do we imitate God more than in showing mercy. In nothing does God delight more than in the exercise of mercy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:6">Exodus 34:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+33:11">Ezekiel 33:11</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ti 2:4</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:9">2 Peter 3:9</span>. To us, guilty sinners; to us, wretched, dying, and exposed to eternal woe, he has shown his mercy by giving his Son to die for us; by expressing his willingness to pardon and save us; and by sending his Spirit to renew and sanctify our hearts. Each day of our life, each hour, and each moment, we partake of his undeserved mercy. All the blessings we enjoy are proofs of his mercy. If we, then, show mercy to the poor, the wretched, the guilty, it shows that we are like God. We have his spirit, and shall not lose our reward. And we have abundant opportunity to do it. Our world is full of guilt and woe, which we may help to relieve; and every day of our lives we have opportunity, by helping the poor and wretched, and by forgiving those who injure us, to show that we are like God.
