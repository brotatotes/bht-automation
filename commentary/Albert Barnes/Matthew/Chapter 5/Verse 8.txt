<p style=" "><b>Blessed are the pure in heart - </b>That is, whose minds, motives, and principles are pure; who seek not only to have the external actions correct, but who desire to be holy in heart, and who are so. Man looks on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They shall see God - </b>There is a sense in which all will see God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>. That is, they will behold him as a Judge, not as a Friend. In this place it is spoken of as a special favor. So also in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span>, “And they shall see his face.” To see the face of one, or to be in the presence of any one, were terms among the Jews expressive of great favor. It was regarded as a high honor to be in the presence of kings and princes, and to be permitted to see them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:29">Proverbs 22:29</span>, “He shall stand before kings.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+25:19">2 Kings 25:19</span>, “Those that stood in the king’s presence;” in the Hebrew, those that saw the face of the king; that is, who were his favorites and friends. So here, to see God, means to be his friends and favorites, and to dwell with him in his kingdom.</p>
