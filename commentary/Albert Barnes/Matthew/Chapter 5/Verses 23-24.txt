<p style=" "><b>Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar ... - </b>The Pharisees were intent only on the external act in worship. They looked not at all to the internal state of the mind. If a man conformed to the external rites of religion, however much envy, and malice, and secret hatred he might have, they thought he was doing well. Our Saviour taught a different doctrine. It was of more consequence to have the heart right than to perform the outward act. If, therefore, says he, a man has gone so far as to bring his gift to the very altar, and should remember that anyone had anything against him, it was his duty there to leave his offering and go and be reconciled. While a difference of this nature existed, his offering could not be acceptable. He was not to wait until the offended brother should come to him; he was to go and seek him out, and be reconciled. So now the worship of God will not be acceptable, however well performed externally, until we are at peace with those that we have injured. “To obey is better than sacrifice,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:22">1 Samuel 15:22</span>. He that comes to worship his Maker filled with malice, and hatred, and envy, and at war with his brethren, is a hypocritical worshipper, and must meet with God’s displeasure. God is not deceived, and he will not be mocked.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thy gift - </b>Thy sacrifice. What thou art about to devote to God as an offering.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the altar - </b>The altar was situated in front of the temple, and was the place on which sacrifices were made. See the notes on plan, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>. To bring a gift to the altar was expressive of worshipping God, for this was the way in which he was formerly worshipped.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thy brother - </b>Any man, especially any fellow-worshipper. Anyone of the same religious society.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath aught - </b>Is offended, or thinks he has been injured by you in any manner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>First be reconciled - </b>This means to settle the difficulty; to make proper acknowledgment or satisfaction for the injury. If you have wronged him, make restitution. If you owe him a debt which ought to be paid, pay it. If you have injured his character, confess it and seek pardon. If he is under an erroneous impression, if your conduct has been such as to lead him to suspect that you have injured him, make an explanation. Do all in your power; and all you ought to do, to have the matter settled. From this we learn:</p>
