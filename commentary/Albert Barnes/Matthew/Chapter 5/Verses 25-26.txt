<p style=" "><b>Agree with thine adversary quickly - </b>This is still an illustration of the sixth commandment. To be in hostility, to go to law, to be litigious, is a violation always, on one side or the other, of the law requiring us to love our neighbor, and our Saviour regards it as a violation of the sixth commandment. While you are in the way with him, says he, that is, while you are going to the court, before the trial has taken place, it is your duty, if possible, to come to an agreement. It is wrong to carry the contention to a court of law. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:6-7">1 Corinthians 6:6-7</span>. The consequence of not being reconciled, he expresses in the language of courts. The adversary shall deliver to the judge, and he to the executioner, and he shall throw you into prison. He did not mean to say that this would be literally the way with God, but that His dealings with those that harbored these feelings, and would not be reconciled with their brethren, were represented by the punishment inflicted by human tribunals. That is, he would hold all such as violators of the sixth commandment, and would punish them accordingly.</p>
<p style=" ">There is no propriety in the use sometimes made of this verse, in representing God as the “adversary” of the sinner, and urging him to be reconciled to God while in the way to judgment. Nor does the phrase “thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing” refer to the eternity of future punishment. It is language taken from courts of justice, to illustrate the truth that God will punish people according to justice for not being reconciled to him. The punishment in the future world will be eternal indeed <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>, but this passage does not prove it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thine adversary - </b>A man that is opposed to us in law. It here means a creditor; a man who has a just claim on us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the way with him - </b>While you are going before the court. Before the trial comes on. It is remarkable that this very direction is found in the Roman law of the Twelve Tables, which expressly directed the plaintiff and defendant to make up the matter while they were in the way, or going to the praetor - in via, rem uti pacunt orato. - <i>Blackstone’s Commentary</i>, iii. p. 299. Whether the Saviour had any reference to this cannot be determined. As the Roman laws prevailed to some extent in Palestine, however, it is possible that there was such an allusion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The officer - </b>The executioner; or, as we should say, the sheriff.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The uttermost farthing - </b>The last farthing. All that is due. The farthing was a small coin used in Judea, equal to two mites. It was not quite equal to half a farthing of British money.</p>
