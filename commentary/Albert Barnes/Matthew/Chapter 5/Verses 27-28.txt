<p style=" "><b>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21">Matthew 5:21</span>. Our Saviour in these verses explains the seventh commandment. It is probable that the Pharisees had explained this commandment, as they had the sixth, as extending only to the external act; and that they regarded evil thoughts and a wanton imagination as of little consequence, or as not forbidden by the law. Our Saviour assures them that the commandment did not regard the external act merely, but the secrets of the heart, and the movements of the eye. He declares that they who indulge a wanton desire, that they who look on a woman to increase their lust, have already, in the sight of God, violated the commandment, and committed adultery in the heart. Such was the guilt of David, whose deep and awful crime fully shows the danger of indulging in evil desires, and in the rovings of a wanton eye.

And so heinous in his sight axe thoughts and feelings which may be forever concealed from the world!</p>
