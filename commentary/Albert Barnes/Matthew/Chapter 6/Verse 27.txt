<p style=" "><b>Which of you, by taking thought - </b>The third argument is taken from their extreme weakness and helplessness. With all your care you cannot increase your stature a single cubit. God has ordered your height. Beyond his appointment your powers are of no avail, and you can do nothing. So of raiment. He, by His providence, orders and arranges the circumstances of your life. “Beyond” that appointment of His providence, beyond his care for you, your efforts avail nothing. Seeing, then, that he alike orders your growth and the supply of your needs, how obvious is the duty of depending upon him, and of beginning all your efforts, feeling that He only can grant you the means of preserving life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>One cubit - </b>The cubit was originally the length from the elbow to the end of the middle finger. The cubit of the Scriptures is not far from 22 inches. Terms of “length” are often applied to life, and it is thought by many to be so here. Thus, it is said, “Thou hast made my days as a handbreadth” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:5">Psalms 39:5</span>; “Teach me the measure of my days” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:4">Psalms 39:4</span>. In this place it is used to denote a “small length.” You cannot increase your stature even a cubit, or in the smallest degree. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:26">Luke 12:26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Stature - </b>This word means “height.” The original word, however, means oftener “age,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:21">John 9:21</span>; “He is of age;” so also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:23">John 9:23</span>. If this be its meaning here, as is probable (compare Robinson, <i>Lexicon</i>), it denotes that a man cannot increase the length of his life at all. The utmost anxiety will not prolong it one hour beyond the time appointed for death.</p>
