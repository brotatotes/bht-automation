<p style=" "><b>For if ye forgive men their trespasses - </b>If ye forgive others when they offend or injure you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Your heavenly Father will also forgive you - </b>This is constantly required in the Bible. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>. Our Saviour says we should forgive even if the offence be committed seventy times seven times, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:22">Matthew 18:22</span>. By this is meant, that when a man asks forgiveness, we are cordially and forever to pardon the offence; we are to declare our willingness to forgive him. If he does not ask forgiveness, yet we are still to treat him kindly; not to harbor malice, not to speak ill of him, to be ready to do him good, and be always prepared to declare him forgiven when he asks it, and if we are not ready and willing to forgive him; we are assured that God will not forgive us.</p>
