<p style=" "><b>But thou when thou fastest, anoint ... - </b>That is, appear as you do daily. Do not assume any new appearance, or change your visage or dress. The Jews and all neighboring nations were much in the habit of washing and anointing their bodies. This washing was performed at every meal; and where it could be effected, the head, or other parts of the body, was daily anointed with sweet or olive oil. In a warm climate, exposed to the great heat of the sun, this practice conduced much to health, preserved the skin smooth and tender, and afforded a most grateful sensation and odor. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:2-3">Mark 7:2-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14">James 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:13">Mark 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The meaning of this whole commandment is, when you regard it to be your duty to fast, do it as a thing expressing deep feeling or sorrow for sin, not by assuming unfelt gravity and moroseness, but in your ordinary dress and appearance; not to attract attention, but as an expression of feeling toward God, and he will approve and reward it.</p>
