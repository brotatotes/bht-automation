<p style=" "><b>Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven - </b>That is, have provision made for your eternal felicity. Do not exhaust your strength and spend your days in providing for the life here, but let your chief anxiety be to be prepared for eternity. Compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:2">Isaiah 55:2</span>. In heaven nothing corrupts; nothing terminates; no enemies plunder or destroy. To have treasure in heaven is to possess evidence that its purity and joys will be ours. It is to be heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>. The heart, or affections, will of course be fixed on the treasure. To regulate the heart, it is therefore important that the treasure, or object of attachment, should be right.</p>
