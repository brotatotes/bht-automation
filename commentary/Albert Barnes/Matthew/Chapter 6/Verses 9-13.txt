<p style=" "><b>And lead us not into temptation - </b>A petition similar to this is offered by David, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+141:4">Psalms 141:4</span>; “Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with the workers of iniquity.” God tempts no man. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>. This phrase, then, must be used in the sense of “permitting.” Do not “suffer” us, or “permit” us, to be tempted to sin. In this it is implied that God has such control over the tempter as to save us from his power if we call upon him. The word “temptation,” however (see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>), means sometimes “trial, affliction,” anything that “tests” our virtue. If this be the meaning here, as it may be, then the import of the prayer is, “Do not afflict or try us.” It is not wrong to pray that we may be saved from suffering if it be the will of God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:42">Luke 22:42</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Deliver us from evil - </b>The original in this place has the article - deliver us from the evil - that is, as has been supposed, the Evil One, or Satan. He is elsewhere called, by way of eminence, the “Evil One,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:19">Matthew 13:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13-14">1 John 2:13-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:12">1 John 3:12</span>. The meaning here is, “deliver us from his power, his snares, his arts, his temptations.” He is supposed to be the great parent of evil, and to be delivered from him is to be safe. Or it may mean, “deliver us from the various evils and trials which beset us, the heavy and oppressive calamities into which we are continually liable to fall.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thine is the kingdom - </b>That is, thine is the reign or dominion. Thou hast control over all these things, and canst so order them as to answer these petitions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thine is the power - </b>Thou hast power to accomplish what we ask. We are weak, and cannot do it; but thou art Almighty, and all things are possible with thee.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thine is the glory - </b>That is, thine is the honor or praise. Not for “our honor,” but that thy glory, thy goodness, may be displayed in providing for our wants; thy power exerted in defending us; thy praise be celebrated by causing thy kingdom to spread through the earth.</p>
<p style=" ">This “doxology,” or ascription of praise, is connected with the prayer by the word “for,” to signify that all these things - the reign, power, and glory of God - will be manifested by granting these petitions. It is not because we are to be benefited, but that God’s name and perfections may be manifested. His glory is, then, the first and principal thing which we are to seek when we approach him. We are to suffer our concerns to be lost sight of in the superior glory and honor of his name and dominion. We are to seek temporal and eternal life chiefly because the honor of our Maker will be promoted, and his name be more illustriously displayed to his creatures. He is to be “first, last, supremest, best,” in our view; and all selfish and worldly views are to be absorbed in that one great desire of the soul that God may be “all in all.” Approaching him with these feelings, our prayers will be answered; our devotions will ascend like incense, and the lifting up our hands will be like the evening sacrifice.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Amen - </b>This is a word of Hebrew origin, from a verb signifying “to be firm, secure, to be true and faithful.” It is a word expressing consent or strong approbation; a word of strong asseveration. It means “verily, certainly, so be it.” It is probable that this word was used by the people in the synagogue to signify their assent to the prayer that was uttered by the minister, and, to some extent, it was probably so used in the Christian Church. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:16">1 Corinthians 14:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">It may be proper to remark that this doxology, “for thine is the kingdom,” etc., is missing in many manuscripts, and that its authenticity is doubtful.</p>
