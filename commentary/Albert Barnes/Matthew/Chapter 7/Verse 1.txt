<p style=" "><b>Judge not ... - </b>This command refers to rash, censorious, and unjust judgment. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1">Romans 2:1</span>. Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:37">Luke 6:37</span> explains it in the sense of “condemning.” Christ does not condemn judging as a magistrate, for that, when according to justice, is lawful and necessary. Nor does he condemn our “forming an opinion” of the conduct of others, for it is impossible “not” to form an opinion of conduct that we know to be evil. But what he refers to is a habit of forming a judgment hastily, harshly, and without an allowance for every palliating circumstance, and a habit of “expressing” such an opinion harshly and unnecessarily when formed. It rather refers to private judgment than “judicial,” and perhaps primarily to the customs of the scribes and Pharisees.</p>
