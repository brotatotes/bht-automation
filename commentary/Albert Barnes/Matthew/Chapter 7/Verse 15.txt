<p style=" "><b>False prophets - </b>The word prophet originally means one who foretells future events. As prophets, however, were commonly regarded as public instructors on the subject of religion, the word came to denote all who were religious teachers. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span>. In this sense it is probably used here. A false prophet is a teacher of incorrect doctrine, or one falsely and unjustly laying claims to divine inspiration. It probably had reference to the false teachers then among the Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who come in sheep’s clothing - </b>The sheep is an emblem of innocence, sincerity, and harmlessness. To come in sheep’s clothing is to assume the appearance of sanctity and innocence, when the heart is evil.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ravening wolves - </b>Rapacious; voraciously devouring; hungry even to rage. Applied to the false teachers, it means that they assumed the appearance of holiness in order that they might the more readily get the property of the people. They were full of extortion and excess. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:25">Matthew 23:25</span>.</p>
