With what judgment ... - This was a proverb among the Jews. It expressed a truth; and Christ did not hesitate to adopt it as conveying his own sentiments. It refers no less to the way in which people will judge of us, than to the rule by which God will judge us. See 2 Samuel 22:27; Mark 4:24; James 2:13.Mete - Measure. You shall be judged by the same rule which you apply to others.
