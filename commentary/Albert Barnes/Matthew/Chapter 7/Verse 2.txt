<p style=" "><b>With what judgment ... - </b>This was a proverb among the Jews. It expressed a truth; and Christ did not hesitate to adopt it as conveying his own sentiments. It refers no less to the way in which people will judge of us, than to the rule by which God will judge us. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+22:27">2 Samuel 22:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:24">Mark 4:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:13">James 2:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Mete - </b>Measure. You shall be judged by the same rule which you apply to others.</p>
