<p style=" "><b>Profess unto them - </b>Say unto them; plainly declare.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I never knew you - </b>That is, I never approved of your conduct; never loved you; never regarded you as my friends. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:6">Psalms 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:3">1 Corinthians 8:3</span>. This proves that, with all their pretensions, they had never been true followers of Christ. Jesus will not then say to false prophets and false professors of religion that he had once known them and then rejected them; that they had been once Christians and then had fallen away; that they had been pardoned and then had apostatized but that he had never known them - they had never been true christians. Whatever might have been their pretended joys, their raptures, their hopes, their self-confidence, their visions, their zeal, they had never been regarded by the Saviour as his true friends. I do not know of a more decided proof that Christians do not fall from grace than this text. It settles the question; and proves that whatever else such people had, they never had any true religion.
