<p style=" "><b>Give not that which is holy ... - </b>By some the word “holy” has been supposed to mean “flesh offered in sacrifice,” made holy, or separated to a sacred use; but it probably means here “anything connected with religion” - admonition, precept, or doctrine. Pearls are precious stones found in shell-fish, chiefly in India, in the waters that surround Ceylon. They are used to denote anything especially precious, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:12-16">Revelation 18:12-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:45">Matthew 13:45</span>. In this place they are used to denote the doctrines of the gospel. “Dogs” signify people who spurn, oppose, and abuse that doctrine; people of special sourness and malignity of temper, who meet it like growling and quarrelsome curs, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span>. “Swine” denote those who would trample the precepts underfoot; people of impurity of life; those who are corrupt, polluted, profane, obscene, and sensual; those who would not know the value of the gospel, and who would tread it down as swine would pearls, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+11:22">Proverbs 11:22</span>. The meaning of this proverb, then, is, do not offer your doctrine to those violent and abusive people who would growl and curse you; nor to those especially debased and profligate who would not perceive its value, would trample it down, and would abuse you. This verse furnishes a beautiful instance of what has been called the “introverted parallelism.” The usual mode of poetry among the Hebrews, and a common mode of expression in proverbs and apothegms, was by the parallelism, where one member of a sentence answered to another, or expressed substantially the same sense with some addition or modification. See the Introduction to the Book of Job. Sometimes this was alternate, and sometimes it was introverted - where the first and fourth lines would correspond, and the second and third. This is the case here. The dogs would tear, and not the swine; the swine would trample the pearls under their feet, and not the dogs. It may be thus expressed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> Neither cast ye your pearls before swine,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> Lest they (that is, the swine) trample them under their feet,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> And turn again (that is, the dogs) and rend you.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> <br/><br/> </p>
