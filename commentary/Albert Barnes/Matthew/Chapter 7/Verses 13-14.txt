<p style=" "><b>Enter ye in at the strait gate - </b>Christ here compares the way to life to an entrance through a gate. The words “straight” and “strait” have very different meanings. The former means “not crooked;” the latter, “pent up, narrow, difficult to be entered.” This is the word used here, and it means that the way to heaven is “pent up, narrow, close,” and not obviously entered. The way to death is open, broad, and thronged. The Saviour here referred probably to ancient cities. They were surrounded with walls and entered through gates. Some of those, connected with the great avenues to the city, were broad and admitted a throng; others, for more private purposes, were narrow, and few would be seen entering them. So, says Christ, is the path to heaven. It is narrow. It is not “the great highway” that people tread. Few go there. Here and there one may be seen - traveling in solitude and singularity. The way to death, on the other hand, is broad. Multitudes are in it. It is the great highway in which people go. They fall into it easily and without effort, and go without thought. If they wish to leave that and go by a narrow gate to the city, it would require effort and thought. So, says Christ, “diligence” is needed to enter life. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24">Luke 13:24</span>. None go of course. All must strive, to obtain it; and so narrow, unfrequented, and solitary is it, that few find it. This sentiment has been beautifully versified by Watts:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “Broad is the road that leads to death,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> And thousands walk together there;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> But wisdom shows a narrower path,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> With here and there a traveler.”</p>
