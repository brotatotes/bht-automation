<p style=" "><b>When Jesus heard it, he marveled - </b>He wondered at it, or he deemed it remarkable.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I have not found so great faith - </b>The word “faith,” here, means “confidence” or belief that Christ had power to heal his servant. It does not of “necessity” imply that he had saving faith; though, from the connection and the spirit manifested, it seems probable that he had. If this was so, then he was the first Gentile convert to Christianity, and was a very early illustration of what was more clearly revealed afterward - that the pagan were to be brought to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not in Israel - </b>Israel was a name given to “Jacob” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:28-29">Genesis 32:28-29</span>, because, as a prince, he had power with God; because he persevered in wrestling with the angel that met him, and obtained the blessing. The name is derived from two Hebrew words signifying “Prince” and “God.” He was one of the patriarchs, a progenitor of the Jewish nation; and the names “Israel and Israelites” were given to them, as the name Romans to the Roman people was in honor of Romulus, and the name “American” to this continent from “Americus Vespuccius.” The name Israel was given to the whole nation until the time of Jeroboam, when only the ten tribes that revolted received the name, probably because they were a majority of the nation. After the captivity of Babylon it was given to all the Jews indiscriminately. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:6">Matthew 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:42">Acts 7:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8">Hebrews 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:32">Mark 15:32</span>. It here means, “I have not found such an instance of “confidence” among the Jews.”</p>
