<p style=" "><b>Many shall come from the east ... - </b>Jesus takes occasion from the faith of a Roman centurion to state that this conversion would not be solitary; that many pagans - many from the east and west would be converted to the gospel, and be saved, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were. The phrase “from the east and from the west,” in the Scripture, is used to denote the “whole world,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:6">Isaiah 45:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:19">Isaiah 59:19</span>. The phrase, “shall sit down,” in the original, refers to the manner of sitting at meals (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:6">Matthew 23:6</span>); and the enjoyments of heaven are described under the similitude of a feast or banquet - a very common manner of speaking of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:15">Luke 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>. It is used here to denote felicity, enjoyment, or honor. To sit with those distinguished men was an honor, and would be expressive of great felicity.</p>
