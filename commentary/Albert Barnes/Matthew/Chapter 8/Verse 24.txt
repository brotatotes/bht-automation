A great tempest - A violent storm; or a “wind” so strong as to endanger their lives. This lake was subject to sudden squalls. Dr. Thomson (“The Land and the Book,” vol. ii. p. 59) says: “Small as the lake is, and placid, in general, as a molten mirror, I have repeatedly seen it quiver, and leap, and boil like a caldron, when driven by fierce winds from the eastern mountains.”The ship was covered with the waves - The billows dashed against the ship Mark 4:37, so that it was fast filling and in danger of sinking.He was asleep - On the hinder part of the vessel, on a pillow, Mark 4:38. It was in the night, and Jesus had retired to rest. He was probably weary, and slept calmly and serenely. He apprehended no danger, and showed to his disciples how calmly one can sleep with a pure conscience, and who feels safe in the hands of God.
