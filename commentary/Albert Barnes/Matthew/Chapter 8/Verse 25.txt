<p style=" "><b>Save us - </b>Save our lives.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We perish - </b>We are in danger of perishing. This showed great confidence in the Saviour. It shows, also, where sinners and Christians should always go who feel that they are in danger of perishing. There is none that can save from the storms of divine wrath but the Son of God.</p>
