<p style=" "><b>See thou tell no man - </b>This command is to be understood as extending only to the time until he had made the proper representation to the priest. It was his duty to hasten to him immediately <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+14:2">Leviticus 14:2</span>; not to delay by talking about it, but, as the first thing, to obey the laws of God, and make proper acknowledgments to him by an offering. The place where this cure was performed was in Galilee, a distance of 40 or 50 miles from Jerusalem; and it was his duty to make haste to the residence of the priest, and obtain his sanction to the reality of the cure. Perhaps, also, Christ was apprehensive that the report would go “before” the man if he delayed, and the priest, through opposition to Jesus, might pronounce it an imposition.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And offer the gift that Moses commanded - </b>That Moses directed to be offered by a leper when he was cured. That gift consisted of “two birds alive and clean, cedar-wood, scarlet, and hyssop,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+14:4">Leviticus 14:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For a testimony unto them - </b>Not to the priest, but to the people. Show thyself to the priest, and get his testimony to the reality of the cure, as a proof to the people that the healing is genuine. It was necessary that he should have that testimony before he could be received to the congregation or allowed to mingle with the people. Having this, he would be, of course, restored to the privileges of social and religious life, and the proof of the miracle, to the people, would be put beyond a doubt.</p>
