<p style=" "><b>Sick of the palsy - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>. The particular form which the palsy assumed in this case is not mentioned. It seems it was a violent attack. Perhaps it was the painful form which produced violent “cramps,” and which immediately endangered his life.</p>
