Mark says that Simon and Andrew lived together, and that James and John went with them to the house. He adds, also, that before the miracle they spake to him about the sick person. The miracle was direct and complete. She that had been sick was so completely restored as to attend to them and minister to them. The mention of “Peter’s wife’s mother” proves that Peter either then was or had been married. The fair and obvious interpretation is, that his wife was then living. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>, and see the note at that place. Peter is claimed by the Roman Catholics to be the head of the church and the vicegerent of Christ. The Pope, according to their view, is the successor of this apostle. On what pretence do they maintain that it is wrong for “priests” to marry? Why did not Christ at once reject Peter from being an apostle for having a wife? How remarkable that he should be set up as the head of the church, and an example and a model to all who were to succeed him! But all this is human law, and is contrary to the New Testament. Compare <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ti 3:2</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4-5">1 Timothy 3:4-5</span>. That Peter had a wife was no objection to his being an apostle, and marriage has been expressly declared to be “honorable in all,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span>.</p>
