<p style=" "><b>And a certain scribe came ... - </b>It is not improbable that this man had seen the miracles of Jesus, and had formed an expectation that by following him he would obtain some considerable worldly advantage. Christ, in reply to his professed purpose to follow him, proclaimed his own poverty, and dashed the hopes of the avaricious scribe. The very foxes and birds, says he, have places of repose and shelter, but the Son of man has no home and no pillow. He is a stranger in his own world - a wanderer and an outcast from the homes of people. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Son of man - </b>This means, evidently, Jesus himself. No title is more frequently given to the Saviour than this, and yet there is much difficulty in explaining it. The word “son” is used in a great variety of significations. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. The name “Son of man” is given to Jesus only three times in the New Testament <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>, except by himself. When he speaks of himself, this is the most common appellation by which he is known. The phrase “Son of God,” given to Christ, denotes a unique connection with God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span>. The name “Son of man” probably denotes a corresponding unique connection with man. Perhaps the Saviour used it to signify the interest he felt in man; his special love and friendship for him; and his willingness to devote himself to the best interests of the race. It is sometimes, however, used as synonymous with “Messiah,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34">John 1:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:37">Acts 8:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span>.</p>
