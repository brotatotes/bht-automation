<p style=" "><b>And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house - </b>This was at a feast given to him by “Levi” or “Matthew,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:29">Luke 5:29</span>. This is another circumstance favorable to Matthew, but omitted by him, and recorded by Luke; showing also that the apostles were averse to praising themselves. To receive Christ hospitably and kindly was a commendable act, and it strongly evinces Matthew’s freedom from ostentation that he has not himself mentioned the fact. It thus illustrates the command of the Saviour, as recorded by himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1-4">Matthew 6:1-4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>At meat - </b>At the table; at supper.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Many publicans and sinners came - </b>Probably the old friends of Matthew who had been invited by him. The character of a “publican,” or tax-gatherer, among the Jews was commonly not very respectable (see notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:47">Matthew 5:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span>), and there is no improbability in supposing that Matthew, before his conversion, had sustained the general character of such people, and that his associations and friendships had been among those who were not remarkable for their morality.</p>
