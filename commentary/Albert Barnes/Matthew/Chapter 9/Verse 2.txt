<p style=" "><b>A man sick of the palsy - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lying on a bed - </b>This was probably a mattress, or perhaps a mere blanket spread to lie on, so as to be easily borne. Being light, Jesus might with propriety command him to take it up and walk, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:6">Matthew 9:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Mark says “they uncovered the roof,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:4">Mark 2:4</span>. Luke says “they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:19">Luke 5:19</span>. To us it would appear that much injury must have been done to the house where Jesus was, and that they must be much incommoded by the removal of tiles and rafters, etc. An acquaintance, however, with the mode of building in the East removes every difficulty of this nature. Houses in Eastern countries are commonly square in their form, and of a single story. On approaching them from the street a single door is seen in the center, and usually, directly above it, a single latticed window. This destitution of doors and lights from the streets, though it gives their dwellings a sombre appearance, is yet adapted to the habits of retirement and secrecy among the people of the East, where they are desirous of keeping their “females” from observation. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:6">Matthew 6:6</span>. On entering the only door in front, the first room is a small square room, surrounded with benches, called the “porch.” In this room the master of the family commonly transacts business, and on private occasions receives visits. Passing through the porch, you enter a large square room directly in the center of the building, called the court. Luke says that the “paralytic” was let down “into the midst;” not in the midst of the “people,” but of the “building” - the “middle place” of the house. This “court” is paved commonly with marble; and, if possible, a fountain of water is formed in the center, to give it beauty, and to diffuse a grateful coolness. This room is surrounded by a gallery or covered walk on every side. From that covered walk doors open into the other apartments of the house.</p>
<p style=" ">This center room, or court, is commonly uncovered or open above. In wet weather, however, and in times of great heat of the sun, it is covered with an awning or canvas, stretched on cords and capable of being easily removed or rolled up. This is what Mark means when he says “they uncovered the roof.” They “rolled up” or removed this awning.</p>
<p style=" ">From the court to the roof the ascent is by flights of stairs, either in the covered walk or gallery or in the porch. The roof is nearly flat. It is made of earth; or, in houses of the rich, is a firmly; constructed flooring, made of coals, chalk, gypsum, and ashes, made hard by repeated blows. On those roofs spears of grass. wheat, or barley sometimes spring up; but these are soon withered by the sun, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+129:6-8">Psalms 129:6-8</span>. The roof is a favourite place for walking, for repose in the cool of the day, for conversation, and for devotion. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:6">Matthew 6:6</span>. On such a roof Rahab concealed the spies <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:6">Joshua 2:6</span>, Samuel talked with Saul <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:25">1 Samuel 9:25</span>, David walked at eventide <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+11:2">2 Samuel 11:2</span>), and Peter went up to pray <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:9">Acts 10:9</span>. This roof was surrounded with a “balustrade,” or railing, breast-high, on the sides; but where a house was contiguous to another, and of the same height, the railing was lower, so as to walk from one roof to another. In cities where the houses were constructed in this manner, it was possible to walk through a considerable part of the city on the roofs. A breastwork or railing was of course built in the same manner around the “open space” in the center, to prevent persons from falling into the court below. This railing, or breastwork, is what Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:19">Luke 5:19</span> says they let him down through. They removed it, probably, so that the couch could be conveniently let down with cords; and, standing on the roof “over” the Saviour, they let the man down directly before him. The perseverance they had manifested was the evidence of their faith or confidence in his power to heal the sick man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be of good cheer: thy sins be forgiven thee - </b>It may seem remarkable, since the man came only to be “healed,” that Jesus should have first declared his sins forgiven. For this the following reasons may be suggested:</p>
<p style=" ">1. The man might have brought on this disease of the palsy by a long course of vicious indulgence. Conscious of guilt, he may have feared that he was so great a sinner that Christ would not regard him. He therefore assured him that his offences were pardoned, and that he might lay aside his fears.</p>
<p style=" ">2. Jesus might be willing to show his power to forgive sins. Had he stated it without any miracle, the Jews would not have believed it, and even his disciples might have been staggered. In proof of it, he worked a miracle; and no one, therefore, could doubt that he had the power. The miracle was performed in “express attestation” of the assertion that he had power to forgive sins. As God would not work a miracle to confirm a falsehood or to deceive people, the miracle was a solemn confirmation, on the part of God, that Jesus had the power to forgive sins.</p>
<p style=" ">3. The Jews regarded disease as the effect of sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:2">John 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14-15">James 5:14-15</span>. There is a “real” connection between sin and suffering, as in the case of gluttony, intemperate drinking, lewdness, debauchery. Jesus might be willing to direct the minds of the spectators “to this fact;” and, by pointing them to a manifest instance of the effect of sin, to lead them to hate and forsake it. Diseases are sometimes the direct judgment of God for sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:3-5">1 Corinthians 5:3-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+24:10-14">2 Samuel 24:10-14</span>. This truth, also, Christ might have been desirous of impressing on the people.</p>
