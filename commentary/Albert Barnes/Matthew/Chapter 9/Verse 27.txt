He was the descendant or Son of David by way of eminence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:32">Luke 1:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>.
