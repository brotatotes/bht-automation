<p style=" "><b>And as they went out, behold, they brought unto him - </b>That is, the friends of the dumb man brought him. This seems to have occurred as soon as the blind men which had been healed left him. Possibly it was from what they had observed of his power in healing them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A dumb man possessed with a devil - </b>That is, the effect of the “possession,” in his case, was to deprive him of speech. Those “possessed with devils” were affected in different ways (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>), and there is no improbability in supposing that if other forms of disease occurred under demoniacal possessions, this form might occur also.</p>
