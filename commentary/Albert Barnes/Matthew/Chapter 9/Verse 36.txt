<p style=" "><b>But when he saw the multitudes - </b>That followed him from place to place. When he saw their anxiety to be instructed and saved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He was moved with compassion on them - </b>He pitied them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because they fainted - </b>The word used here refers to the weariness and fatigue which results from labor and being burdened. He saw the people burdened with the rites of religion and the doctrines of the Pharisees; sinking down under their ignorance and the weight of their traditions; neglected by those who ought to have been enlightened teachers; and scattered and driven out without care and attention. With great beauty he compares them to sheep wandering without a shepherd. Judea was a land of flocks and herds. The faithful shepherd, by day and night, was with his flock. He defended it, made it to lie down in green pastures, and led it beside the still waters, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+23:2">Psalms 23:2</span>. Without his care the sheep would stray away. They were in danger of wild beasts. They panted in the summer sun, and they did not know where the cooling shade and stream was. So, said the Saviour, is it with this people. No wonder that the compassionate Redeemer was moved with pity.</p>
