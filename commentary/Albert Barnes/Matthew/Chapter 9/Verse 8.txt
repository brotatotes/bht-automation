<p style=" "><b>They glorified God - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:16">Matthew 5:16</span>. To “glorify” God, here, means to “praise him,” or to acknowledge his power. The expression, “which had given such power to people,” was a part of “their” praise. It expresses no sentiment of the evangelist about the nature of Christ, but is a record of their feelings and their praise.</p>
