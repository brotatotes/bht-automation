<p style=" "><b>Neither do men put new wine ... - </b>The third illustration was taken from wine put into bottles.</p>
<p style=" ">Bottles, in Eastern nations, were made, and are still made, of skins of beasts. Generally the skin was taken entire from a sheep or a goat, and, properly prepared, was filled with wine or water. Such bottles are still used, because, in crossing deserts of sand, they have no other conveyances but camels, or other beasts of burden. It would be difficult for them to carry glass bottles or kegs on them. They therefore fill two skins, and fasten them together and lay them across the back of a camel, and thus carry wine or water to a great distance. These bottles were, of course, of different sizes, as the skins of kids, goats, or oxen might be used. Bruce describes particularly a bottle which he saw in Arabia, made in this manner of an ox-skin, which would hold 60 gallons, and two of which were a lead for a camel. By long usage, however, bottles of skins became tender and would be easily ruptured. New wine put into them would ferment, and swell and burst them open. New skins or bottles would yield to the fermenting wine, and be strong enough to hold it from bursting. So, says Christ, there is “fitness” or propriety of things. It is not “fit” that my doctrine should be attached to or connected with the old and corrupt doctrines of the Pharisees. New things should be put together, and made to match.</p>
<p style=" ">This account of Eastern bottles may illustrate the following passages in the Bible: The Gibeonites took “wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+9:4">Joshua 9:4</span>. “My belly is ready to burst, like new bottles,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+32:19">Job 32:19</span>. “I am become like a bottle in the smoke,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:83">Psalms 119:83</span>; i. e., like a bottle of skin hung up in a tent filled with smoke.</p>
