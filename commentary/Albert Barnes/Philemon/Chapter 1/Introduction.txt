<p style=" ">The Epistle embraces the following subjects:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. The salutation; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:1-3">Philemon 1:1-3</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. A mention of the excellent account which the apostle had heard of Philemon, and the occasion which he had for thankfulness on his behalf; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:4-7">Philemon 1:4-7</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. The main subject of the Epistle - the desire that he would receive his servant Onesimus again, and the arguments to persuade him to do it; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:8-21">Philemon 1:8-21</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (1)He places it on the ground of entreaty, not of command. He might, in virtue of his apostolic office, enjoin many things on him, and possibly this, yet he chooses to place it entirely on other grounds, and to make it a matter of personal friendship; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:8">Philemon 1:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">He concludes the argument by referring to the happiness which it would give him if Philemon would receive his former servant again; and with the expression of his conviction that he would do more than he asked in the matter, and then asks that, while he showed favor to Onesimus, he would also prepare a lodging for him, for he hoped soon to be with him; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:20-22">Philemon 1:20-22</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">Perhaps by this last suggestion he hoped also to do much to favor the cause of Onesimus - for Philemon could hardly turn him away when he expected that Paul himself would soon be with him. Such an argument would be likely to be effectual in the case. We do not like to deny the request which a friend makes in a letter, if we expect soon to see the writer himself. It would be much more easy to do it if we had no expectations of seeing him very soon.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. The Epistle closes with affectionate salutations from certain persons who were with Paul, and who were probably well known to Philemon, and with the customary benediction; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23-25">Philemon 1:23-25</span>.</p>
