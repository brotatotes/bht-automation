<p style=" "><b>Unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow-labourer - </b>See Introduction, Section 1. The word rendered “fellow-laborer” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεργω</span></span> sunergō, does not determine what office he held, if he held any, or in what respects he was a fellow-laborer with Paul. It means a co-worker, or helper, and doubtless here means that he was a helper or fellow-worker in the great cause to which Paul had devoted his life, but whether as a preacher, or deacon, or a private Christian, can not be ascertained. It is commonly, in the New Testament, applied to ministers of the gospel, though by no means exclusively, and in several instances it cannot be determined whether it denotes ministers of the gospel, or those who furthered the cause of religion, and cooperated with the apostle in some other way than preaching.
