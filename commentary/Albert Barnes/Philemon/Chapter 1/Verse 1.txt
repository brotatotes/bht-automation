Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ - A prisoner at Rome in the cause of Jesus Christ; Ephesians 3:1 note; 2 Timothy 1:8 note.And Timothy our brother - Timothy, it seems, had come to him agreeably to his request; 2 Timothy 4:9. Paul not unfrequently joins his name with his own in his epistles; 2 Corinthians 1:1; Philippians 1:1; Col 1:1; 1 Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:1. As Timothy was of that region of country, and as he had accompanied Paul in his travels, he was doubtless acquainted with Philemon.Unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow-labourer - See Introduction, Section 1. The word rendered “fellow-laborer” συνεργω sunergō, does not determine what office he held, if he held any, or in what respects he was a fellow-laborer with Paul. It means a co-worker, or helper, and doubtless here means that he was a helper or fellow-worker in the great cause to which Paul had devoted his life, but whether as a preacher, or deacon, or a private Christian, can not be ascertained. It is commonly, in the New Testament, applied to ministers of the gospel, though by no means exclusively, and in several instances it cannot be determined whether it denotes ministers of the gospel, or those who furthered the cause of religion, and cooperated with the apostle in some other way than preaching. See the following places, which are the only ones where it occurs in the New Testament; Romans 16:3, Romans 16:9,Rom 16:21; 1 Corinthians 3:9; 2Co 1:24; 2 Corinthians 8:23; Philippians 2:25; Philippians 4:3; Colossians 4:11; 1 Thessalonians 3:2; Philemon 1:24; 3 John 1:8.
