<p style=" "><b>And to our beloved Apphia - </b>This was a female (Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀγαπητῇ</span></span> agapētē), and was probably the wife of Philemon.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And Archippus our fellow-soldier - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:17">Colossians 4:17</span>. It has been supposed that he was a son of Philemon, and this would appear not to be improbable, as he was one of his family. On the term “fellow-soldier,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>. It is applied here to one who was a minister of the gospel, and who is spoken of in con nection with Paul as enlisted under the banners of the Captain of salvation, and waging a warfare with the wickedness of the world; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:3-4">2 Timothy 2:3-4</span>. That Archippus was a minister of the gospel, is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:17">Colossians 4:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to the church in thy house - </b>Either the church that commonly met in his house, or more probably that was composed of his own family; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>.</p>
