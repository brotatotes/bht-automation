<p style=" "><b>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord - </b>“By showing me this favor in receiving my friend and brother as I request.” The phrase “in the Lord,” here seems to mean that, if this request was granted, he would recognize the hand of the Lord in it, and would receive it as a favor from him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Refresh my bowels in the Lord - </b>The “bowels,” in the Scriptures, are uniformly spoken of as the seat of the affections - meaning commonly the upper viscera, embracing the heart and the lungs; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+16:11">Isaiah 16:11</span>. The reason is, that in any deep emotion this part of our frame is peculiarly affected, or we feel it there. Compare Robinson’s <i>Lex</i>. on the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπλάγχνον</span></span> splangchnon See this illustrated at length in Sir Charles Bell’s” Anatomy of Expression,” p. 85, following Ed. London, 1844. The idea here is, that Paul had such a tender affection for Onesimus as to give him great concern and uneasiness. The word rendered “refresh” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀνάπαυσόν</span></span> anapauson - means “to give rest to, to give repose, to free from sorrow or care;” and the sense is, that by receiving Onesimus, Philemon would cause the deep and anxious feelings of Paul to cease, and he would be calm and happy; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:7">Philemon 1:7</span>.</p>
