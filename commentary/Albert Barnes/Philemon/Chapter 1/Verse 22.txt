<p style=" "><b>Prepare me also a lodging - </b>Philemon had been accustomed to show kindness to the saints <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:5">Philemon 1:5</span>, and not improbably Paul had before shared his hospitality. The word rendered “lodging” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξενία</span></span> xenia), means, properly, guest-right, hospitality, entertainment; and then, a place for a guest; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:23">Acts 28:23</span>.</p>

Paul had no doubt thus Philemon would so regard it, and he had no apprehension that his abiding with him would be considered as a burden.</p>
