<p style=" "><b>That the communication of thy faith - </b>That is, this was a subject of prayer on the part of the apostle, that the “communication of his faith” might receive from all the proper acknowledgment of the good which he did in the Christian cause. The phrase translated “communication of thy faith,” means the making of thy faith common to others; that is, enabling others to partake of the fruits of it, to wit, by good deeds. On the meaning of the word here rendered “communication” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνία</span></span> koinōnia), see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>. Calvin has well expressed the sense of this passage. “It is to be observed that the apostle here does not proceed in the commendation of Philemon, but rather expresses what he desires for him from the Lord. These words are connected with those in which he says that he remembered him in his prayers. What, therefore, did he desire for Philemon? That his faith, expressing itself by good fruits, might be shown to be true and not vain. For he calls that the communication of his faith when it does not remain inoperative within, but bears itself forth to benefit men by its proper effects. For although faith has its proper seat in the heart, yet it communicates itself to men by good works.” The meaning is, that he desired that Philemon would so make common the proper fruits of faith by his good deeds toward others, that all might acknowledge it to be genuine and efficacious.</p>
<p style=" "><b>May become effectual - </b>Greek, “May be energetic” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐνεργὴς</span></span> energēs); may become operative, active, effective.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the acknowledging - </b>That is, so as to secure from others the proper recognition of the existence of faith in your heart. In other words, so that others may see that you are truly pious, and understand to what extent you have faith.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of every good thing which is in you - </b>Of every good principle, and of every benevolent trait, which is in your character. That is, the proper outward expression of his faith in Christ, by doing good to others, would be a development of the benevolence which existed in his heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Christ Jesus - </b>Or “toward (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εἰς</span></span> eis) Christ Jesus.” The goodness in his heart had respect to the Lord Jesus as its proper object, but would be made manifest by his kindness to men. The truth which is taught in this passage, therefore, is, that when faith exists in the heart, it is very desirable that it should impart its proper fruits toward others in such a way that all may see that it is operative, and may recognize its power; or in other words, it is desirable that when true religion exists it should be fairly developed, that its possessor may be acknowledged to be under its influence. We should wish that he may have all the credit and honor which the goodness of his heart is entitled to. Paul supposed that a case had now occurred in which an opportunity was furnished to Philemon to show the world how much he was governed by the faith of the gospel.</p>
