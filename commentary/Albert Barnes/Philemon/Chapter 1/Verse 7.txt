<p style=" "><b>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love - </b>In thy love toward Christians. The word here rendered “joy” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χάριν</span></span> charin), properly means grace. A large number of manuscripts, however, instead of this word, have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρὰν</span></span> charan, Charan, joy. See Wetstein. This reading has been adopted by Griesbach, Tittman, and Hahn.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother - </b>For your kindness to them. The word “bowels” here probably means minds, hearts, for it is used in the Scriptures to denote the affections. The sense is, that the kindness which he had shown to Christians had done much to make them happy. On the word refreshed, see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:13">2 Corinthians 7:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:16">2 Timothy 1:16</span>.</p>
