For we have great joy and consolation in thy love - In thy love toward Christians. The word here rendered “joy” (χάριν charin), properly means grace. A large number of manuscripts, however, instead of this word, have χαρὰν charan, Charan, joy. See Wetstein. This reading has been adopted by Griesbach, Tittman, and Hahn.Because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother - For your kindness to them. The word “bowels” here probably means minds, hearts, for it is used in the Scriptures to denote the affections. The sense is, that the kindness which he had shown to Christians had done much to make them happy. On the word refreshed, see 2 Corinthians 7:13; 2 Timothy 1:16.
