Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ - Though I might have much boldness as an apostle of Christ. He means that he was invested with authority by the Lord Jesus, and would have a right, as an apostle, to enjoin what ought to be done in the case which he is about to lay before him; compare 1 Thessalonians 2:6-7.To enjoin thee that which is convenient - To command what is proper to be done. The word “convenient” here (τὸ ἀνῆκω to anēkō), means that which would be fit or proper in the case; compare the notes at Ephesians 5:4. The apostle implies here that what he was about to ask, was proper to be done in the circumstances, but he does not put it on that ground, but rather asks it as a personal layout. It is usually not best to command a thing to be done if we can as well secure it by asking it as a favor; compare Daniel 1:8, Daniel 1:11-12.
