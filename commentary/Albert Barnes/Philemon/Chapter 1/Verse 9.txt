<p style=" "><b>Being such an one as Paul the aged - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτης</span></span> presbutēs - an old man. We have no means of ascertaining the exact age of Paul at this time, and I do not recollect that he ever alludes to his age, though he often does to his infirmities, in any place except here. Doddridge supposes that at the time when Stephen was stoned, when he is called “a young man” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεανίας</span></span> neanias, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>), he was 24 years of age, in which case he would now have been about 53. Chrysostom supposes that he may have been 35 years old at the time of his conversion, which would have made him about 63 at this time. The difficulty of determining with any degree of accuracy the age of the apostle at this time, arises from the indefinite nature of the word used by Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>, and rendered “a young man.” That word, like the corresponding word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεανίσκος</span></span> neaniskos, was applied to men in the vigor of manhood up to the age of 40 years.</p>
<p style=" ">Robinson, Lex. Phavorinus says a man is called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεανίσκος</span></span> neaniskos, a young man, until he is 28; and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβύτης</span></span> presbutēs, presbutēs, from 49 until he is 56. Varro says that a man is young (“juvenis”), until he is 45, and aged at 60. Whitby. These periods of time, however, are very indefinite, but it will accord well with the usual meaning of the words to suppose that Paul was in the neighborhood of 30 when he was converted, and that he was now not far from 60. We are to remember also, that the constitution of Paul may have been much broken by his labors, his perils, and his trials. Not advanced probably to the usual limit of human life, he may have had all the characteristics of a very aged man; compare the note of Benson. The argument here is, that we feel that it is proper, as far as we can, to grant the request of an old man. Paul thus felt that it was reasonable to suppose that Philemon would not refuse to gratify the wishes of an aged servant of Christ, who had spent the vigor of his life in the service of their common Master. It should be a very strong case when we refuse to gratify the wishes of an aged Christian in anything, especially if he has rendered important services to the church and the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ - </b>In the cause of Jesus Christ; or a prisoner for endeavoring to make him known to the world; compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:20">Ephesians 6:20</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span> note. The argument here is, that it might be presumed that Philemon would not refuse the request of one who was suffering in prison on account of their common religion. For such a prisoner we should be ready to do all that we can to mitigate the sorrows of his confinement, and to make his condition comfortable.</p>
