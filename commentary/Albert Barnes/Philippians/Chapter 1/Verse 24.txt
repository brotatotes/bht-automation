<p style=" "><b>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh - </b>To live. All this is language derived from the belief that the soul will be separate from the body at death, and will occupy a separate state of existence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is more needful for you - </b>Another object that was dear to the heart of Paul. He never supposed that his life was useless; or that it was a matter of no importance to the cause of religion whether he lived or died. He knew that God works by means; and that the life of a minister of the gospel is of real value to the church and the world. His experience, his influence, his paternal counsels, he felt assured would be of value to the church, and he had, therefore, a desire to live - and it was no part of his religion affectedly to undervalue or despise himself.</p>
