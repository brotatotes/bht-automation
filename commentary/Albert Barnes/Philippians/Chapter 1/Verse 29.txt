<p style=" "><b>For unto you - </b>Unto you as Christians. This favor is granted unto you in your present circumstances.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is given - </b>God concedes to you this privilege or advantage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the behalf of Christ - </b>In the cause of Christ, or with a view to honor Christ. Or, these things are brought on you in consequence of your being Christians.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not only to believe on him - </b>It is represented here as a privilege to be permitted to believe on Christ. It is so:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It is an honor to a man to believe one who ought to be believed, to trust one who ought to be trusted, to love one who ought to be loved.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It is a privilege to believe on Christ, because it is by such faith that out sins are forgiven; that we become reconciled to God, and have the hope of heaven.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) It is a privilege, because it saves the mind from the tortures and the deadly influence of unbelief - the agitation, and restlessness, and darkness, and gloom of a skeptic.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) It is a privilege, because we have then a friend to whom we may go in trial, and on whom we may roll all our burdens. If there is anything for which a Christian ought to give unfeigned thanks, it is that he has been permitted to believe on the Redeemer. Let a sincere Christian compare his peace, and joy, and hope of heaven, and support in trials, with the restlessness, uneasiness, and dread of death, in the mind of an unbeliever; and he will see abundant occasion for gratitude.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But also to suffer for his sake - </b>Here it is represented as a privilege to suffer in the cause of the Redeemer - a declaration which may sound strange to the world. Yet this sentiment frequently occurs in the New Testament. Thus, it is said of the apostles <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:41">Acts 5:41</span>, that “they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>. “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span>. “But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings;” compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:30">Mark 10:30</span>; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:41">Acts 5:41</span>. It is a privilege thus to suffer in the cause of Christ:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)Because we then resemble the Lord Jesus, and are united with him in trials;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Because we have evidence that we are his, if trials come upon us in his cause;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Because we are engaged in a good cause, and the privilege of maintaining such a cause is worth much of suffering; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)Because it will be connected with a brighter crown and more exalted honor in heaven.</p>
