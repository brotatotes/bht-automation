<p style=" "><b>Being confident - </b>This is strong language. It means to be fully and firmly persuaded or convinced; participle, middle voice, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πείθω</span></span> peithō - to persuade; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:31">Luke 16:31</span>. “Neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead;” that is, they would not be convinced; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:24">Acts 28:24</span>. It means here that Paul was entirely convinced of the truth of what he said. It is the language of a man who had no doubt on the subject.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That he which hath begun a good work in you - </b>The “good work” here referred to, can be no other than religion, or true piety. This is called the work of God; the work of the Lord; or the work of Christ; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29">John 6:29</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:58">1 Corinthians 15:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:30">Philippians 2:30</span>. Paul affirms here that that work was begun by God. It was not by their own agency or will; compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:13">John 1:13</span>. It was on the fact that it was begun by God, that he based his firm conviction that it would be permanent. Had it been the agency of man, he would have had no such conviction, for nothing that man does today can lay the foundation of a certain conviction that he will do the same thing tomorrow. If the perseverance of the Christian depended wholly on himself, therefore, there could be no sure evidence that he would ever reach heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Will perform it - </b>Margin, “Or, finish” The Greek word - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπιτελέσει</span></span> epitelesei - means that he would carry it forward to completion; he would perfect it. It is an intensive form of the word, meaning that it would be carried through to the end. It occurs in the following places: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32">Luke 13:32</span>, “I do cures;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:28">Romans 15:28</span>, “when I have performed this;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span>, “perfecting holiness;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>, “so he would also finish in you;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:11">2 Corinthians 8:11</span>, “perform the doing of it;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:3">Galatians 3:3</span>, “are ye now made perfect by the flesh;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>, “when he was about to make the tabernacle;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:6">Hebrews 9:6</span>, “accomplishing this service;” and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:9">1 Peter 5:9</span>, “are accomplished in your brethren.” The word occurs nowhere else; and here means that God would carry on the work which he had begun to completion. He would not leave it unfinished. It would not he commenced and then abandoned. This would or could be “performed” or “finished” only:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) By keeping them from falling from grace, and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) By their ultimate entire perfection.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Until the day of Jesus Christ - </b>The day when Christ shall so manifest himself as to be the great attractive object, or the day when he shall appear to glorify himself, so that it may be said emphatically to be his day. That day is often called “his day,” or “the day of the Lord,” because it will be the day of his triumph and glory. It refers here to the day when the Lord Jesus will appear to receive his people to himself - the day of judgment. We may remark on this verse, that Paul believed in the perseverance of saints. It would be impossible to express a stronger conviction of the truth of that doctrine than he has done here. Language could not be clearer, and nothing can be more unequivocal than the declaration of his opinion that where God has begun a good work in the soul, it will not be finally lost. The ground of this belief he has not stated in full, but has merely hinted at it. It is based on the fact that God had begun the good work. That ground of belief is something like the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) It is in God alone. It is not in man in any sense. No reliance is to be placed upon man in keeping himself. He is too weak; too changeable; too ready to be led astray; too much disposed to yield to temptation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) The reliance, therefore, is on God; and the evidence that the renewed man will be kept is this:</p>
