<p style=" "><b>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all - </b>“There is a reason why I should cherish this hope of you, and this confident expectation that you will be saved. That reason is found in the evidence which you have given that you are sincere Christians. Having evidence of that, it is proper that I should believe that you will finally reach heaven.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because I have you in my heart - </b>Margin, “Ye have me in your.” The Greek will bear either, though the former translation is the most obvious. The meaning is, that he was warmly attached to them, and had experienced many proofs of their kindness; and that there was, therefore, a propriety in his wishing for their salvation. Their conduct toward him, moreover, in his trials, had convinced him that they were actuated by Christian principle; and it was proper that he should believe that they would be kept to eternal life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Both in my bonds - </b>While I have been a prisoner - referring to the care which they had taken to minister to his needs; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:10">Philippians 4:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:14">Philippians 4:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And in the defence - </b>Greek: apology. He is probably referring to the time when he made his defense before Nero, and vindicated himself from the charges which had been brought against him; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16">2 Timothy 4:16</span>. Perhaps he means here, that on that occasion he was abandoned by those who should have stood by him, but that the Philippians showed him all the attention which they could. It is not impossible that they may have sent some of their number to sympathize with him in his trials, and to assure him of the unabated confidence of the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And confirmation of the gospel - </b>In my efforts to defend the gospel, and to make it known; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:17">Philippians 1:17</span>. The allusion is probably to the fact that, in all his efforts to defend the gospel, he had been sure of their sympathy and cooperation. Perhaps he refers to some assistance which he had derived from them in this cause, which is now to us unknown.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye all are partakers of my grace - </b>Margin, “Or, with me of grace.” The meaning is, that as they had participated with him in the defense of the gospel; as in all his troubles and persecutions they had made common cause with him, so it followed that they would partake of the same tokens of the divine favor. He expected that the divine blessing would follow his efforts in the cause of the gospel, and he says that they would share in the blessing. They had shown all the sympathy which they could in his trials; they had nobly stood by him when others forsook him; and he anticipated, as a matter of course, that they would all share in the benefits which would flow to him in his efforts in the cause of the Redeemer.</p>
