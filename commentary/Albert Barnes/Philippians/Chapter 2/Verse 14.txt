<p style=" "><b>Do all things without murmurings and disputings - </b>In a quiet, peaceful, inoffensive manner. Let there be no brawls, strifes, or contentions. The object of the apostle here is, probably, to illustrate the sentiment which he had expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3-5">Philippians 2:3-5</span>, where he had inculcated the general duties of humbleness of mind, and of esteeming others better than themselves, in order that that spirit might be fully manifested, he now enjoins the duty of doing everything in a quiet and gentle manner, and of avoiding any species of strife; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:31-32">Ephesians 4:31-32</span>.</p>
