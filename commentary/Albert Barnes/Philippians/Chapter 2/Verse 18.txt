<p style=" "><b>For the same cause - </b>Because we are united, and what affects one of us should affect both.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Do ye joy, and rejoice with me - </b>That is, “do not grieve at my death. Be not overwhelmed with sorrow, but let your hearts be filled with congratulation. It will be a privilege and a pleasure thus to die.” This is a noble sentiment, and one that could have been uttered only by a heroic and generous mind - by a man who will not dread death, and who felt that it was honorable thus to die Doddridge has illustrated the sentiment by an appropriate reference to a fact stated by Plutarch. A brave Athenian returned from the battle of Marathon, bleeding with wounds and exhausted, and rushed into the presence of the magistrates, and uttered only these two words - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR"> χαιρετε</span></span> chairete, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρομεν</span></span> chairomen - “rejoice, we rejoice,” and immediately expired. So Paul felt that there was occasion for him, and for all whom he loved, to rejoice, if he was permitted to die in the cause of others, and in such a manner that his death would benefit the world.</p>
