<p style=" "><b>For I have no man like-minded - </b>Margin, “so dear unto me.” The Greek is, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἰσόψυχον</span></span> isopsuchon - similar in mind, or like-minded. The meaning is, that there was no one with him who would feel so deep an interest in their welfare.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who will naturally care - </b>The word rendered “naturally” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνησίως</span></span> gnēsiōs - means sincerely and the idea is, that he would regard their interests with a sincere tenderness and concern. He might be depended on to enter heartily into their concerns. This arose doubtless from the fact that he had been with them when the church was founded there, and that he felt a deeper interest in what related to the apostle Paul than any other man. Paul regarded Timothy as a son, and Paul’s sending him on such an occasion would evince the feelings of a father who should send a beloved son on an important message.</p>
