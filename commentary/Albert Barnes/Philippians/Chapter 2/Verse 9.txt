<p style=" "><b>Wherefore - </b>As a reward of this humiliation and these sufferings. The idea is, that there was an appropriate reward for it, and that that was bestowed upon him by his exaltation as Mediator to the right hand of God; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God also hath highly exalted him - </b>As Mediator. Though he was thus humbled, and appeared in the form of a servant, he is now raised up to the throne of glory, and to universal dominion. This exaltation is spoken of the Redeemer as he was, sustaining a divine and a human nature. If there was, as has been supposed, some obscuration or withdrawing of the symbols of his glory <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>, when he became a man, then this refers to the restoration of that glory, and would seem to imply, also, that there was additional honor conferred on him. There was all the augmented glory resulting from the work which he had performed in redeeming man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And given him a name which is above every name - </b>No other name can be compared with his. It stands alone. He only is Redeemer, Saviour. He only is Christ, the Anointed of God; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>. He only is the Son of God. His rank, his titles, his dignity, are above all others; see this illustrated in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-21">Ephesians 1:20-21</span>.</p>
