<p style=" "><b>Not as though I had already attained - </b>This verse and the two following are full of allusions to the Grecian races. “The word rendered ‘attained’ signifies, to have arrived at the goal and won the prize, but without having as yet received it” - The Pictorial Bible. The meaning here is, I do not pretend to have attained to what I wish or hope to be. He had indeed been converted; he had been raised up from the death of sin; he had been imbued with spiritual life and peace; but there was a glorious object before him which he had not yet received. There was to be a kind of resurrection which he had not arrived at. It is possible that Paul here may have had his eye on an error which prevailed to some extent in the early church, that “the resurrection was already past” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span>, by which the faith of some had been perverted. How far this error had spread, or on what it was founded, is not now known; but it is possible that it might have found advocates extensively in the churches. Paul says, however, that he entertained no such opinion. He looked forward to a resurrection which had not yet occurred. He anticipated it as a glorious event yet to come, and he purposed to secure it by every effort which he could make.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Either were already perfect - </b>This is a distinct assertion of the apostle Paul that he did not regard himself as a perfect man. He had not reached that state where he was free from sin. It is not indeed a declaration that no one was perfect, or that no one could be in this life but it is a declaration that he did not regard himself as having attained to it. Yet who can urge better claims to having attained perfection than Paul could have done? Who has surpassed him in love, and zeal, and self-denial, and true devotedness to the service of the Redeemer? Who has more elevated views of God, and of the plan of salvation? Who prays more, or lives nearer to God than he did? That must be extraordinary piety which surpasses that of the apostle Paul; and he who lays claim to a degree of holiness which even Paul did not pretend to, gives little evidence that he has any true knowledge of himself, or has ever been imbued with the true humility which the gospel produces.</p>
<p style=" ">It should be observed, however, that many critics, as Bloomfield, Koppe, Rosenmuller, Robinson (Lexicon), Clarke, the editor of The Pictorial Bible, and others, suppose the word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειόω</span></span> teleioō - not to refer to moral or Christian perfection, but to be an allusion to the games that were celebrated in Greece, and to mean that he had not completed his course and arrived at the goal, so as to receive the prize. According to this, the sense would be, that he had not yet received the crown which he aspired after as the result of his efforts in this life. It is of importance to understand precisely what he meant by the declaration here; and, in order to this, it will be proper to look at the meaning of the word elsewhere in the New Testament. The word properly means, to complete, to make perfect, so as to be full, or so that nothing shall be wanting. In the New Testament it is used in the following places, and is translated in the following manner: It is rendered “fulfilled” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:23">Luke 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:28">John 19:28</span>; “perfect,” and “perfected,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32">Luke 13:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:9">2 Corinthians 12:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:12">Philippians 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:19">Hebrews 7:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:14">Hebrews 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:40">Hebrews 11:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:22">James 2:22</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Jo 2:5</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12">1 John 4:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:17-18">1 John 4:17-18</span>; “finish,” and “finished,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>; and “consecrated,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:28">Hebrews 7:28</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">In one case <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>, it is applied to a race or course that is run - “That I might finish my course with joy;” but this is the only instance, unless it be in the case before us. The proper sense of the word is that of bringing to an end, or rendering complete, so that nothing shall be wanting. The idea of Paul evidently is, that he had not yet attained that which would be the completion of his hopes. There was something which he was striving after, which he had not obtained, and which was needful to render him perfect, or complete. He lacked now what he hoped yet to attain to; and that which he lacked may refer to all those things which were wanting in his character and condition then, which he expected to secure in the resurrection. What he would then obtain, would be - perfect freedom from sin, deliverance from trials and temptations, victory over the grave, and the possession of immortal life.</p>
<p style=" ">As those things were needful in order to the completion of his happiness, we may suppose that he referred to them now, when he says that he was not yet “perfect.” This word, therefore, while it will embrace an allusion to moral character, need not be understood of that only, but may include all those things which were necessary to be observed in order to his complete felicity. Though there may be, therefore, an allusion in the passage to the Grecian foot-races, yet still it would teach that he did not regard himself as in any sense perfect in all respects, there were things wanting to render his character and condition complete, or what he desired they might ultimately be. The same is true of all Christians now. We are imperfect in our moral and religious character, in our joys, in our condition. Our state here is far different from that which will exist in heaven; and no Christian can say, anymore than Paul could, that he has obtained that which is requisite to the completion or perfection of his character and condition. He looks for something brighter and purer in the world beyond the grave. Though, therefore, there may be - as I think the connection and phraseology seem to demand - a reference to the Grecian games, yet the sense of the passage is not materially varied. It was still a struggle for the crown of perfection - a crown which the apostle says he had not yet obtained.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But I follow after - </b>I pursue the object, striving to obtain it. The prize was seen in the distance, and he diligently sought to obtain it. There is a reference here to the Grecian races, and the meaning is, “I steadily pursue my course;” compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If that I may apprehend - </b>If I may obtain, or reach, the heavenly prize. There was a glorious object in view, and he made most strenuous exertions to obtain it. The idea in the word “apprehend” is that of taking hold of, or of seizing suddenly and with eagerness; and, since there is no doubt of its being used in an allusion to the Grecian foot-races, it is not improbable that there is a reference to the laying hold of the pole or post which marked the goal, by the racer who had outstripped the other competitors, and who, by that act, might claim the victory and the reward.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus - </b>By Christ Jesus. The idea is, that he had been called into the service of the Lord Jesus, with a view to the obtaining of an important object. He recognized:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The fact that the Lord Jesus had, as it were, laid hold on him, or seized him with eagerness or suddenness, for so the word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατελήμφθην</span></span> katelēmphthēn - means (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:18">Mark 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:3-4">John 8:3-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The fact that the Lord Jesus had laid hold on him, with a view to his obtaining the prize. He had done it in order that he might obtain the crown of life, that he might serve him faithfully here, and then be rewarded in heaven.</p>
<p style=" ">We may learn, from this:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That Christians are seized, or laid hold on, when they are converted, by the power of Christ, to be employed in his service.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That there is an object or purpose which he has in view. He designs that they shall obtain a glorious prize, and he “apprehends” them with reference to its attainment.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) That the fact that Christ has called us into his service with reference to such an object, and designs to bestow the crown upon us, need not and should not dampen our exertions, or diminish our zeal. It should rather, as in the case of Paul, excite our ardor, and urge us forward. We should seek diligently to gain that, for the securing of which, Christ has called us into his service. The fact that he has thus arrested us in our mad career of sin; that he has by his grace constrained us to enter into his service, and that he contemplates the bestowment upon us of the immortal crown, should be the highest motive for effort. The true Christian, then, who feels that heaven is to be his home, and who believes that Christ means to bestow it upon him, will make the most strenuous efforts to obtain it. The prize is so beautiful and glorious, that he will exert every power of body and soul that it may be his. The belief, therefore, that God means to save us, is one of the highest incentives to effort in the cause of religion.</p>
