<p style=" "><b>I press toward the mark - </b>As he who was running a race did. The “mark” means properly the object set up at a distance at which one looks or aims, and hence the goal, or post which was set up at the end of a race-course, and which was to be reached in order that the prize might be won. Here it means that which is at the end of the Christian race - in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the prize - </b>The prize of the racer was a crown or garland of olive, laurel, pine, or apple; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>. The prize of the Christian is the crown that is incorruptible in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the high calling of God - </b>Which is the end or result of that calling. God has called us to great and noble efforts; to a career of true honor and glory; to the obtainment of a bright and imperishable crown. It is a calling which is “high,” or “upward” - (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄνω</span></span> anō) - that is, which tends to the skies. The calling of the Christian is from heaven, and to heaven; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+15:24">Proverbs 15:24</span>. He has been summoned by God through the gospel of the Lord Jesus to secure the crown. It is placed before and above him in heaven. It may be his, if he will not faint or tire or look backward. It demands his highest efforts, and it is worth all the exertions which a mortal can make even in the longest life.</p>
