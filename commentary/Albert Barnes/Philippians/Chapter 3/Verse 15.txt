<p style=" "><b>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:12">Philippians 3:12</span>. Or, rather, those who would be perfect; or who are aiming at perfection. It can hardly be supposed that the apostle would address them as already perfect, when he had just said of himself that lie had not attained to that state. But those whom he addressed might be supposed to be aiming at perfection, and he exhorts them, therefore, to have the same spirit that he himself had, and to make the same efforts which he himself put forth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be thus minded - </b>That is, be united in the effort to obtain the prize, and to become entirely perfect. “Let them put forth the same effort which I do, forgetting what is behind, and pressing forward to the mark.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And if in anything ye be otherwise minded - </b>That is, if there were any among them who had not these elevated views and aims, and who had not been brought to see the necessity of such efforts, or who had not learned that such high attainments were possible. There might be those among them who had been very imperfectly instructed in the nature of religion; those who entertained views which impeded their progress, and prevented the simple and earnest striving for salvation which Paul was enabled to put forth. He had laid aside every obstacle; renounced all the Jewish opinions which had impeded his salvation, and had now one single aim - that of securing the prize. But there might be those who had not attained to these views, and who were still impeded and embarrassed by erroneous opinions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God shall reveal even this unto you - </b>He will correct your erroneous opinions, and disclose to you the importance of making this effort for the prize. This is the expression of an opinion, that to those who were sincere and true Christians, God would yet make a full revelation of the nature of religion, or would lead them on so that they would fully understand, it. They who are acquainted with religion at all, or who have been truly converted, God will teach and guide until they shall have a full understanding of divine things.</p>
