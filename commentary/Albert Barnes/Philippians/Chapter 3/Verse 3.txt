<p style=" "><b>For we are the circumcision - </b>We who are Christians. We have and hold the true doctrine of circumcision. We have that which was intended to be secured by this rite - for we are led to renounce the flesh, and to worship God in the spirit. The apostle in this verse teaches that the ordinance of circumcision was not designed to be a mere outward ceremony, but was intended to be emblematic of the renunciation of the flesh with its corrupt propensities, and to lead to the pure and spiritual worship of God. In this, he has undoubtedly stated its true design. They who now urged it as necessary to salvation, and who made salvation depend on its mere outward observance, had lost sight of this object of the rite. But this, the real design of circumcision, was attained by those who had been led to renounce the flesh, and who had devoted themselves to the worship of God; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28-29">Romans 2:28-29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which worship God in the spirit - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:24">John 4:24</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:10-14">Genesis 17:10-14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And rejoice in Christ Jesus - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:1">Philippians 3:1</span>. That is, we have, through him, renounced the flesh; we have become the true worshippers of God, and have thus attained what was originally contemplated by circumcision, and by all the other rites of religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And have no confidence in the flesh - </b>In our own corrupt nature; or in any ordinances that relate merely to the flesh. We do not depend on circumcision for salvation, or on any external rites and forms whatever - on any advantage of rank, or blood. The word “flesh” here seems to refer to every advantage which any may have of birth; to any external conformity to the law, and to everything which unaided human nature can do to effect salvation. Or none of these things can we put reliance for salvation; none of them will constitute a ground of hope.</p>
