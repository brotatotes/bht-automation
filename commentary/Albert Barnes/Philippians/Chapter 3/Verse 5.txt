<p style=" "><b>Circumcised the eighth day - </b>That is, he was circumcised in exact compliance with the law. If there was any ground confidence from such compliance with the law, he had it. The law required that circumcision should be performed on the eighth day <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:12">Genesis 17:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+12:3">Leviticus 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:59">Luke 1:59</span>; but it is probable that, in some cases, this was delayed on account of sickness, or from some other cause; and, in the case of proselytes, it was not performed until adult age; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>. But Paul says that, in his case, the law had been literally complied with; and, consequently, all the advantage which could be derived from such a compliance, was his.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the stock of Israel - </b>Descended from the patriarch Israel, or Jacob; and, therefore, able to trace his genealogy back as far as any Jew could. He was not a proselyte himself from among the pagan, nor were any of his ancestors proselytes. He had all the advantages which could be derived from a regular descent from the venerable founders of the Jewish nation. He was thus distinguished from the Edomites and others who practiced circumcision; from the Samaritans, who were made up of a mixture of people; and from many, even among the Jews, whose ancestors had been once pagan, and who had become proselytes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the tribe of Benjamin - </b>Benjamin was one of the two tribes which remained when the ten tribes revolted under Jeroboam, and, with the tribe of Judah, it ever afterward maintained its allegiance to God. The idea of Paul is, that he was not one of the revolted tribes, but that he had as high a claim to the honor of being a Jew as anyone could boast. The tribe of Benjamin, also, was located near the temple, and indeed it has been said that the temple was on the dividing line between that tribe and the tribe of Judah; and it might have been supposed that there was some advantage in securing salvation from having been born and reared so near where the holy rites of religion were celebrated. If there were any such derived from the proximity of the tribe to the temple, he could claim it; for, though his birth was in another place, yet he was a member of the tribe.</p>
<p style=" "><b>An Hebrew of the Hebrews - </b>This is the Hebrew mode of expressing the superlative degree; and the idea is, that Paul enjoyed every advantage which could possibly be derived from the fact of being a Hebrew. He had a lineal descent from the very ancestor of the nation; he belonged to a tribe that was as honorable as any other, and that had its location near the very center of religious influence; and he was an Hebrew by both his parents, with no admixture of Gentile blood. On this fact - that no one of his ancestors had been a proselyte, or of Gentile extraction - a Jew would pride himself much; and Paul says that he was entitled to all the advantage which could be derived from it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As touching the law, a Pharisee - </b>In my views of the law, and in my manner of observing it, I was of the straitest sect - a Pharisee; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:5">Acts 26:5</span>. The Pharisees were distinguished among the Jewish sects for their rigid adherence to the letter of the law, and had endeavored to guard it from the possibility of violation by throwing around it a vast body of traditions, which they considered to be equally binding with the written law; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>. The Sadducees were much less strict; and Paul here says that whatever advantage could be derived from the most rigid adherence to the letter of the law, was his.</p>
