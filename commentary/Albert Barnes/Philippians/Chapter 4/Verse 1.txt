<p style=" "><b>Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for - </b>Doddridge unites this verse with the previous chapter, and supposes that it is the proper close of the solemn statement which the apostle makes there. The word “therefore” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὥστε</span></span> hōste - has undoubted reference to the remarks made there; and the meaning is, that in view of the fact that there were many professed Christians who were not sincere - that the “citizenship” of all true Christians was in heaven, and that Christians looked for the coming of the Lord Jesus, who would make them like to himself, the apostle exhorts them to stand fast in the Lord. The accumulation of epithets of endearment in this verse shows his tender regard for them, and is expressive of his earnest solicitude for their welfare, and his deep conviction of their danger. The term “longed for” is expressive of strong affection; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:26">Philippians 2:26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>My joy - </b>The source of my joy. He rejoiced in the fact that they had been converted under him; and in their holy walk, and their friendship. Our chief joy is in our friends; and the chief happiness of a minister of the gospel is in the pure lives of those to whom he ministers; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:4">3 John 1:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And crown - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>. The word “crown” means a circlet, chaplet, or diadem:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)As the emblem of royal dignity - the symbol of office;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)As the prize conferred on victors in the public games, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>, and hence, as an emblem of the rewards of a future life; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Jam 1:12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Anything that is an ornament or honor, as one glories in a crown; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+12:4">Proverbs 12:4</span>, “A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+14:24">Proverbs 14:24</span>, “The crown of the wise is their riches;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+16:31">Proverbs 16:31</span>, “The hoary head is a crown of glory;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:6">Proverbs 17:6</span>, “Children’s children are the crown of old men.”</p>
<p style=" ">The idea here is, that the church at Philippi was that in which the apostle gloried. He regarded it as a high honor to have been the means of founding such a church, and he looked upon it with the same interest with which a monarch looks upon the diadem which he wears.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So stand fast in the Lord - </b>In the service of the Lord, and in the strength which he imparts; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13-14">Ephesians 6:13-14</span>.</p>
