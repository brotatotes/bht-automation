<p style=" "><b>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly - </b>The favor which Paul had received, and for which he felt so much gratitude, had been received of the Philippians; but he regarded “the Lord” as the source of it, and rejoiced in it as the expression of his kindness. The effect was to lead his heart with cheerfulness and joy up to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That now at the last - </b>After so long a time. The reason why he had not before received the favor, was not neglect or inattention on their part, but the difficulty of having communication with him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Your care of me hath flourished again - </b>In the margin this is rendered “is revived,” and this is the proper meaning of the Greek word. It is a word properly applicable to plants or flowers, meaning to grow green again; to flourish again; to spring up again. Here the meaning is, that they had been again prospered in their care of him, and to Paul it seemed as if their care had sprung up anew.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Wherein ye were also careful - </b>That is, they were desirous to render him assistance, and to minister to his wants. Paul adds this, lest they should think he was disposed to blame them for inattention.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But ye lacked opportunity - </b>Because there were no persons going to Rome from Philippi by whom they could send to him. The distance was considerable, and it is not probable that the contact between the two places was very constant.</p>
