<p style=" "><b>In the beginning of the gospel - </b>“At the time when I first preached the gospel to you; or when the gospel began its benign influence on your hearts.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>When I departed from Macedonia - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>. The last place that Paul visited in Macedonia, at that time, was Berea. There a tumult was excited by the Jews, and it was necessary for him to go away. He left Macedonia to go to Athens; and left it in haste, amidst scenes of persecution, and when he needed sympathizing aid. At that time, as well as when he was in Thessalonica <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:1-10">Acts 17:1-10</span>, he needed the assistance of others to supply his wants; and he says that aid was not withheld. The meaning here is, that this aid was sent to him “as he was departing from Macedonia;” that is, alike in Thessalonica and afterward. This was about twelve years before this Epistle was written - Doddridge.</p>
<p style=" "><b>No church communicated with me - </b>No church so participated with me in my sufferings and necessities, as to send to my relief; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8-9">2 Corinthians 11:8-9</span>. Why they did not, Paul does not intimate. it is not necessary to suppose that he meant to blame them. They might not have been acquainted with his necessities. All that is implied here is, that he specially commends the Philippians for their attention to him.</p>
