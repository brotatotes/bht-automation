<p style=" "><b>But I have all - </b>Margin, “or, have received.” The phrase here is equivalent to, “I have received everything. I have all I want, and desire no more.” He was entirely satisfied. What they had sent to him is, of course, now unknown. It is sufficient to know, that it was of such a nature as to make his situation comfortable.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am full - </b>I have enough, This is a strong expression, denoting that nothing was lacking.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having received of Epaphroditus - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>An odour of a sweet smell - </b>This does not mean that it was such an odor to Paul, but to God. He regarded it as an offering which they had made to God himself; and he was persuaded that he would regard it as acceptable to him. They had doubtless made the offering, not merely from personal friendship for Paul, but because he was a minister of Christ, and from love for his cause; and Paul felt assured that this offering would be acceptable to him; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41-42">Matthew 10:41-42</span>. The word “odor” refers properly to the pleasant fragrance produced in the temple by the burning of incense; notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:9">Luke 1:9</span>. On the meaning of the word rendered “a sweet smell,” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εὐωδία</span></span> euōdia - see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:15">2 Corinthians 2:15</span>. The whole language here is taken from an act of worship; and the apostle regarded what he had received from the Philippians as in fact a thank-offering to God, and a presented with the spirit of true devotion to him. It was not, indeed, a formal act of worship; but it was acceptable to God as an expression of their regard for his cause.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A sacrifice acceptable - </b>Acceptable to God; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:16">Hebrews 13:16</span>; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Well-pleasing to God - </b>Because it evinced a regard for true religion. Hence, learn:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That kindness done to the ministers of the gospel is regarded as an acceptable offering to God.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That kindness to the servants of God in distress and want, is as well-pleasing to God as direct acts of worship.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) That such acts of benevolence are evidences of attachment to the cause of religion, and are proofs of genuine piety; notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:42">Matthew 10:42</span>.</p>
