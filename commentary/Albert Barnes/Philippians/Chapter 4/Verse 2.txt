<p style=" "><b>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche - </b>These are doubtless the names of females. The name Syntyche is sometimes the name of a man; but, if these persons are referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</span>, there can be no doubt that they were females. Nothing more is known of them than is here mentioned. It has been commonly supposed that they were deaconesses, who preached the gospel to those of their own sex; but there is no certain evidence of this. All that is known is, that there was some disagreement between them, and the apostle entreats them to be reconciled to each other.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That they be of the same mind - </b>That they be united, or reconciled. Whether the difference related to doctrine, or to something else, we cannot determine from this phrase. The language is such as would properly relate to any difference.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the Lord - </b>In their Christian walk and plans. They were doubtless professing Christians, and the apostle exhorts them to make the Lord the great object of their affections, and in their regard for him, to bury all their petty differences and animosities.</p>
