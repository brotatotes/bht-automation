<p style=" "><b>And I entreat thee also, true yoke-fellow - </b>It is not known to whom the apostle refers here. No name is mentioned, and conjecture is useless. All that is known is, that it was someone whom Paul regarded as associated with himself in labor, and one who was so prominent at Philippi that it would be understood who was referred to, without more particularly mentioning him. The presumption, therefore. is, that it was one of the ministers, or “bishops” (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>) of Philippi, who had been particularly associated with Paul when he was there. The Epistle was addressed to the “church with the bishops and deacons” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; and the fact that this one had been particularly associated with Paul, would serve to designate him with sufficient particularity. Whether he was related to the women referred to, is wholly unknown. Doddridge supposes that he might be the husband of one of these women; but of that there is no evidence. The term “yoke-fellow” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συζυγος</span></span> suzugos - some have understood as a proper name (Syzygus); but the proper import of the word is yoke-fellow, and there is no reason to believe that it is used here to denote a proper name. If it had been, it is probable that some other word than that used here and rendered “true” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνήσιος</span></span> gnēsios - would have been employed. The word “true” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνήσιος</span></span> gnēsios - means that he was sincere, faithful, worthy of confidence. Paul had had evidence of his sincerity and fidelity; and he was a proper person, therefore, to whom to entrust a delicate and important business.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Help those women - </b>The common opinion is, tidal the women here referred to were Euodias and Syntyche, and that the office which the friend of Paul was asked to perform was, to secure a reconciliation between them. There is, however, no certain evidence of this The reference seems rather to be to influential females who had rendered important assistance to Paul when he was there. The kind of “help” which was to be imparted was probably by counsel, and friendly cooperation in the duties which they were called to perform, There is no evidence that it refers to pecuniary aid; and, had it referred to a reconciliation of those who were at variance, it is probable that some other word would have been used than that rendered here as “help” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλλαμβάνου</span></span> sullambanou.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which laboured with me in the gospel - </b>As Paul did not permit women to preach (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span>; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:5">1 Corinthians 10:5</span>), he must have referred here to some other services which they had rendered. There were deaconesses in the primitive churches (see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span>., note), to whom was probably entrusted particularly the care of the female members of a church. In the custom which prevailed in the oriental world, of excluding females from the public gaze, and of confining them to their houses, it would not be practicable for the apostles to have access to them. The duties of instructing and exhorting them were then probably entrusted chiefly to pious females; and in this way important aid would be rendered in the gospel. Paul could regard such as “laboring with him,” though they were not engaged in preaching.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With Clement also - </b>That is, they were associated with Clement, and with the other fellow-laborers of Paul, in aiding him in the gospel. Clement as doubtless someone who was well known among them; and the apostle felt that, by associating them with him, as having been real helpers in the gospel, their claim to respectful attention would be better appreciated. Who Clement was, is unknown. Most of the ancients say it was Clement of Rome, one of the primitive fathers. But there is no evidence of this. The name Clement was common, and there is no improbability in supposing that there might have been a preacher of this name in the church at Philippi.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whose names are in the book of life - </b>see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:3">Isaiah 4:3</span>. The phrase, “the book of life,” which occurs here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:15">Revelation 20:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:27">Revelation 21:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:19">Revelation 22:19</span>, is a Jewish phrase, and refers originally to a record or catalogue of names, as the roll of an army. It then means to be among the living, as the name of an individual would be erased from a catalog when he was deceased. The word “life” here refers to eternal life; and the whole phrase refers to those who were enrolled among the true friends of God, or who would certainly be saved. The use of this phrase here implies the belief of Paul that these persons were true Christians. Names that are written in the book of life will not be blotted out. If the hand of God records them there who can obliterate them?</p>
