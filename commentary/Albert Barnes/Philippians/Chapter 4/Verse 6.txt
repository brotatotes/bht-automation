<p style=" "><b>Be careful for nothing - </b>That is, be not anxious or solicitous about the things of the present life. The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριμνᾶτε</span></span> merimnate - does not mean that we are to exercise no care about worldly matters - no care to preserve our property, or to provide for our families (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:8">1 Timothy 5:8</span>); but that there is to be such confidence in God as to free the mind from anxiety, and such a sense of dependence on him as to keep it calm; see the subject explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But in everything - </b>Everything in reference to the supply of your wants, and the wants of your families; everything in respect to afflictions, embarrassments, and trials; and everything relating to your spiritual condition. There is nothing which pertains to body, mind, estate, friends, conflicts, losses, trials, hopes, fears, in reference to which we may not go and spread it all out before the Lord.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By prayer and supplication - </b>The word rendered “supplication” is a stronger term than the former. It is the mode of prayer which especially arises from the sense of “need,” or “want” - from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δέομαι</span></span> deomai, “to want, to need.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>With thanksgiving - </b>Thanksgiving connected with prayer. We can always find something to be thankful for, no matter what may be the burden of our wants, or the special subject of our petitions. When we pray for the supply of our wants, we may be thankful for that kind providence which has hitherto befriended us; when we pray for restoration from sickness, we may be thankful for the health we have hitherto enjoyed, and for God’s merciful interposition in the former days of trial, and for his goodness in now sparing our lives; when we pray that our children and friends may be preserved from danger and death, we may remember how often God has interposed to save them; when, oppressed with a sense of sin, we pray for pardon, we have abundant cause of thanksgiving that there is a glorious way by which we may be saved. The greatest sufferer that lives in this world of redeeming love, and who has the offer of heaven before him, has cause of gratitude.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let your request be made known unto God - </b>Not as if you were to give him information, but to express to him your wants. God needs not to be informed of our necessities, but he requires that we come and express them to him; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:37">Ezekiel 36:37</span>. “Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them.”</p>
