<p style=" "><b>The Revelation of Jesus Christ - </b>This is evidently a title or caption of the whole book, and is designed to comprise the substance of the whole; for all that the book contains would be embraced in the general declaration that it is a revelation of Jesus Christ. The word rendered “Revelation” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ἀποκάλυψις</span></span> Apokalupsis, whence we have derived our word “Apocalypse” - means properly an that is, nakedness; from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀποκαλύπτω</span></span> apokaluptō, to uncover. It would apply to anything which had been covered up so as to be hidden from the view, as by a veil, a darkness, in an ark or chest, and then made manifest by removing the covering. It comes then to be used in the sense of disclosing or revealing, by removing the veil of darkness or ignorance. “There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed.” It may be applied to the disclosing or manifesting of anything which was before obscure or unknown. This may be done:</p>
<p style=" ">(a) by instruction in regard to what was before obscure; that is, by statements of what was unknown before the statements were made; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>, where it is said that Christ would be “a light to lighten the Gentiles” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φῶς εἰς ἀποκάλυψιν ἐθνῶν</span></span> phōs eis apokalupsin ethnōn; or when it is applied to the divine mysteries, purposes, or doctrines, before obscure or unknown, but made clear by light revealed in the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 2:10</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(b) by the event itself; as the manifestation of the wrath of God at the day of judgment will disclose the true nature of his wrath. “After thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and “revelation” of the righteous judgment of God,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>. “For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation (Greek revelation) of the sons of God,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>; that is until it shall be manifest by the event what they who are the children of God are to be. In this sense the word is frequently applied to the second advent or appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ, as disclosing him in his glory, or showing what he truly is; “When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span> - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν τῇ ἀποκαλυψει</span></span> en tēn apokalupsei - in the revelation of Jesus Christ; “Waiting for the coming (the revelation - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ἀποκάλυψιν</span></span> tēn apokalupsin of our Lord Jesus Christ,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>; “At the appearing (Greek revelation) of Jesus Christ,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>; “When his glory shall be revealed,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(c) It is used in the sense of making known what is to come, whether by words, signs, or symbols, as if a veil were lifted from what is hidden from human vision, or which is covered by the darkness of the unknown future. This is called a revelation, because the knowledge of the event is in fact made known to the world by Him who alone can see it, and in such a manner as he pleases to employ; though many of the terms or the symbols may be, from the necessity of the case, obscure, and though their full meaning may be disclosed only by the event. It is in this sense, evidently, that the word is used here: and in this sense that it is more commonly employed when we speak of a revelation. Thus, the word <span class="_800000">גּלה</span> gaalaah is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="am+3:7">Amos 3:7</span>, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants.” So <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+33:16">Job 33:16</span>, “Then he openeth (margin, revealeth or uncovereth; Heb. <span class="_800000">יגלה</span> yigleh the ears of men”; that is, in a dream, he discloses to their ears his truth before concealed or unknown. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:22">Daniel 2:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:28-29">Daniel 2:28-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+10:1">Daniel 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+29:29">Deuteronomy 29:29</span>. These ideas enter into the word as used in the passage before us. The idea is that of a disclosure of an extraordinary character, beyond the mere ability of man, by a special communication from heaven. This is manifest, not only from the usual meaning of this word, but by the word “prophecy,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>, and by all the arrangements by which these things were made known. The ideas which would be naturally conveyed by the use of this word in this connection are two:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)That there was something which was before hidden, obscure, or unknown; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That this was so disclosed by these communications as to be seen or known.</p>
<p style=" ">The things hidden or unknown were those which pertained to the future; the method of disclosing them was mainly by symbols. In the Greek, in this passage, the article is missing - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀποκάλυψις</span></span> apokalupsis - a Revelation, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἡ</span></span> hē, the Revelation. This is omitted because it is the title of a book, and because the use of the article might imply that this was the only revelation, excluding other books claiming to be a revelation; or it might imply some previous mention of the book, or knowledge of it in the reader. The simple meaning is, that this was “a Revelation”; it was only a part of the revelation which God has given to mankind.</p>
<p style=" ">The phrase, “the Revelation of Jesus Christ,” might, so far as the construction of the language is concerned, refer either to Christ as the subject or object. It might either mean that Christ is the object revealed in this book, and that its great purpose is to make him known, and so the phrase is understood in the commentary called Hyponoia (New York, 1844); or it may mean that this is a revelation which Christ makes to mankind, that is, it is his in the sense that he communicates it to the world. That this latter is the meaning here is clear:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)Because it is expressly said in this verse that it was a revelation which God gave to him;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Because it is said that it pertains to things which must shortly come to pass; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Because, in fact, the revelation is a disclosure of eyelets which were to happen, and not of the person or work of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which God gave unto him - </b>Which God imparted or communicated to Jesus Christ. This is in accordance with the representations everywhere made in the Scriptures, that God is the original fountain of truth and knowledge, and that, whatever was the original dignity of the Son of God, there was a mediatorial dependence on the Father. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19-20">John 5:19-20</span>, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatsoever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυσιν αὐτῷ</span></span> deiknusin autō) all things that himself doeth.” “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:16">John 7:16</span>. “As my Father hath taught me <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐδιδάξεν με</span></span> edidaxen me, I speak these things,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:28">John 8:28</span>. “For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:49">John 12:49</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:10">John 14:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:7-8">John 17:7-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:32">Mark 13:32</span>. The same mediatorial dependence the apostle teaches us still subsists in heaven in his glorified state, and will continue until he has subdued all things <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24-28">1 Corinthians 15:24-28</span>; and hence, even in that state, he is represented as receiving the Revelation from the Father to communicate it to people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To show unto his servants - </b>That is, to his people, to Christians, often represented as the servants of God or of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16">1 Peter 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:2">Revelation 19:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>. It is true that the word is sometimes applied, by way of eminence, to the prophets <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+6:49">1 Chronicles 6:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+6:20">Daniel 6:20</span>, and to the apostles <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>; but it is also applied to the mass of Christians, and there is no reason why it should not be so understood here. The book was sent to the churches of Asia, and was clearly designed for general use; and the contents of the book were evidently intended for the churches of the Redeemer in all ages and lands. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>. The word rendered “to show” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖξαι</span></span> deixai) commonly denotes to point out, to cause to see, to present to the sight, and is a word eminently appropriate here, as what was to be revealed was, in general, to be presented to the sight by sensible tokens or symbols.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Things which must shortly come to pass - </b>Not all the things that will occur, but such as it was deemed of importance for his people to be made acquainted with. Nor is it certainly implied that all the things that are communicated would shortly come to pass, or would soon occur. Some of them might perhaps he in the distant future, and still it might be true that there were those which were revealed in connection with them, which soon would occur. The word rendered “things” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἅ</span></span> ha) is a pronoun, and might be rendered “what”; “he showed to his servants what things were about to occur,” not implying that he showed all the things that would happen, but such as he judged to be needful that his people should know. The word would naturally embrace those things which, in the circumstances, were most desirable to be known. The phrase rendered “must come to pass” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖ γενέσθαι</span></span> dei genesthai), would imply more than mere futurity; The word used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖ</span></span> dei) means “it needs, there is need of,” and implies that there is some kind of necessity that the event should occur.</p>
<p style=" ">That necessity may either arise from the felt waist of anything, as where it is absent or missing, Xen. Cyr. iv., 10; ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:5">Revelation 7:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>; or from the nature of the case, or from a sense of duty, as <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>, “Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖ ἀπελθεῖν</span></span> dei apelthein) to Jerusalem” (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:35">Matthew 26:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:31">Mark 14:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:49">Luke 2:49</span>); or the necessity may exist, because a thing is right and just, meaning that it ought to be done, as <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:14">Luke 13:14</span>, “There are six days in which men ought to work” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖ ἐργάζεσθαι</span></span> dei ergazesthai. And ought not this woman <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οὐκ ἔδει</span></span> ouk edei, whom Satan hath bound, etc., be loosed from this bond,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:14">Mark 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:20">John 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:11">Acts 5:11</span>, <span class="_0000ff"><u>Act 5:29</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:6">2 Timothy 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:33">Matthew 18:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:27">Matthew 25:27</span>); or the necessity may be that it is conformable to the divine arrangement, or is made necessary by divine appointment, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span>, “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖ</span></span> dei) the Son of man be lifted up.” “For as yet they knew not the Scriptures, that he must (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῖ</span></span> dei) rise again from the dead,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:9">John 20:9</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:12">Acts 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>, et al.</p>
<p style=" ">In the passage before us, it is implied that there was some necessity that the things referred to should occur. They were not the result of chance, they were not fortuitous. It is not, however, stated what was the ground of the necessity; whether because there was a want of something to complete a great arrangement, or because it was fight and proper in existing circumstances, or because such was the divine appointment. They were events which, on some account, must certainly occur, and which, therefore, it was important should be made known. The real ground of the necessity, probably, was founded in the design of God in redemption. He intended to carry out his great plans in reference to his church, and the things revealed here must necessarily occur in the completion of that design. The phrase rendered “shortly” (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν τάχει</span></span> en tachei) is one whose meaning has been much controverted, and on which much has been made to depend in the interpretation of the whole book.</p>
<p style=" ">The question has been whether the phrase necessarily implies that the events referred to were soon to occur, or whether it may have such an extent of meaning as to admit the supposition that the events referred to, though beginning soon, would embrace in their development far distant years, and would reach the end of all things. Those who maintain, as Prof. Stuart, that the book was written before the destruction of Jerusalem, and that the portion in Rev. 4–11 has special reference to Jerusalem and Judea, and the portion in Rev. 12–19 refers to persecution and pagan Rome, maintain the former opinion; those who suppose that Rev. 4–11 refers to the irruption of Northern barbarians in the Roman empire, and Rev. 12ff., to the rise and the persecutions of the papal power, embrace the latter opinion. All that is proper in this place is, without reference to any theory of interpretation, to inquire into the proper meaning of the language, or to ascertain what idea it would naturally convey:</p>
<p style=" ">(a) The phrase properly and literally means, “with quickness, swiftness, speed; that is, speedily, quickly, shortly” (Robinson’s Lexicon; Stuart, in loco). It is the same in meaning as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχέως</span></span> tacheōs. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span>, “But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will.” “Go out quickly into the streets,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:21">Luke 14:21</span>. “Sit down quickly, and write fifty,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:6">Luke 16:6</span>. “She rose up hastily (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχέως</span></span> tacheōs) and went out,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:31">John 11:31</span>. “That ye are so soon removed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχέως</span></span> tacheōs) from him that called you,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>. “Lay hands suddenly on no man,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19">Philippians 2:19</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:24">Philippians 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:9">2 Timothy 4:9</span>. The phrase used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν τάχει</span></span> en tachei occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:8">Luke 18:8</span>, “He will avenge them speedily” (literally with speed). “Arise up quickly,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:7">Acts 12:7</span>. “Get time quickly out of Jerusalem,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18">Acts 22:18</span>. “Would depart shortly,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:4">Acts 25:4</span>. “Bruise Satan under your feet shortly,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>. The essential idea is, that the thing which is spoken of was soon to occur, or it was not a remote and distant event. There is the notion of rapidity, of haste, of suddenness. It is such a phrase as is used when the thing is on the point of happening, and could not be applied to an event which was in the remote future, considered as an independent event standing by itself. The same idea is expressed, in regard to the same thing, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>, “The time is at hand” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὁ γὰρ καιρὸς ἐγγύς</span></span> ho gar kairos engus; that is, it is near, it is soon to occur. Yet.</p>
<p style=" ">(b) it is not necessary to suppose that the meaning is that all that there is in the book was soon to happen. It may mean that the series of events which were to follow on in their proper order was soon to commence, though it might be that the sequel would be remote. The first in the series of events was soon to begin, and the others would follow on in their train, though a portion of them, in the regular order, might be in a remote futurity. If we suppose that there was such an order, that a series of transactions was about to commence, involving along train of momentous developments, and that the beginning of this was to occur soon, the language used by John would be what would be naturally employed to express it. Thus, in case of a revolution in a government, when a reigning prince should be driven from his kingdom, to be succeeded by a new dynasty, which would long occupy the throne, and involving, as the consequence of the revolution, important events extending far into the future, we would naturally say that these things were shortly to occur, or that the time was near. It is customary to speak of a succession of events or periods as near, however vast or interminable the series may be, when the commencement is at hand. Thus, we say that the great events of the eternal world are near; that is, the beginning of them is soon to occur. So Christians now speak often of the millennium as near, or as about to occur, though it is the belief of many that it will be protracted for many ages.</p>
<p style=" ">(c) That this is the true idea hem is clear, whatever general view of interpretation in regard to the book is adopted. Even Prof. Stuart, who contends that the greater portion of the book refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the persecutions of pagan Rome, admits that “the closing part of the Revelation relates beyond all doubt to a distant period, and some of it to a future eternity” (ii., p. 5); and, if this be so, then there is no impropriety in supposing that a part of the series of predictions preceding this may lie also in a somewhat remote futurity. The true idea seems to be that the writer contemplated a series of events that were to occur, and that this series was about to commence. How far into the future it was to extend, is to be learned by the proper interpretation of all the parts of the series.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he sent - </b>Greek: “Sending by his angel, signified it to his servant John.” The idea is not precisely that he sent his angel to communicate the message, but that he sent by him, or employed him as an agent in doing it. The thing sent was rather the message than the angel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And signified it - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ἐσήμανεν</span></span> Esēmanen. He indicated it by signs and symbols. The word occurs in the New Testament only in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:33">John 12:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:32">John 18:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:27">Acts 25:27</span>, and in the passage before us, in all which places it is rendered “signify, signifying, or signified.” It properly refers to some sign, signal, or token by which anything is made known (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:12-13">Genesis 9:12-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:11">Genesis 17:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:12">Luke 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:22">1 Corinthians 14:22</span>), and is a word most happily chosen to denote the manner in which the events referred to were to be communicated to John, for nearly the whole book is made up of signs and symbols. If it be asked what was signified to John, it may be replied that either the word “it” may be understood, as in our translation, to refer to the Apocalypse (Revelation), or refer to what he saw (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὅσα εἶδε</span></span> hosa eide), as Prof. Stuart supposes; or it may be absolute, without any object following, as Prof. Robinson (Lexicon) supposes. The general sense is, that, sending by his angel, he made to John a communication by expressive signs or symbols.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By his angel - </b>That is, an angel was employed to cause these scenic representations to pass before the mind of the apostle. The communication was not made directly to him, but was through the medium of a heavenly messenger employed for this purpose. Thus, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>, it is said, “And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8-9">Revelation 1:8-9</span> of that chapter. There is frequent allusion in the Scriptures to the fact that angels have been employed as agents in making known the divine will, or in the revelations which have been made to people. Thus, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:53">Acts 7:53</span>, it is said, “Who have received the law by the disposition of angels.” “For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast,” etc., <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>; “and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>.

There is almost no further reference to the agency of the angel employed for this service in the book, and there is no distinct specification of what he did, or of his great agency in the case.</p>
<p style=" ">John is everywhere represented as seeing the symbols himself, and it would seem that the agency of the angel was, either to cause those symbols to pass before the apostle, or to convey their meaning to his mind. How far John himself understood the meaning of these symbols, we have not the means of knowing with certainty. The most probable supposition is, that the angel was employed to cause these visions or symbols to pass before his mind, rather than to interpret them. If an interpretation had been given, it is inconceivable that it should not have been recorded, and there is no more probability that their meaning should have been disclosed to John himself, for his private use, than that it should have been disclosed and recorded for the use of others. It would seem probable, therefore, that John had only that view of the meaning of what he saw which anyone else might obtain from the record of the visions.

<p style=" "><b>Unto his servant John - </b>Nothing could be learned from this expression as to what John was the author of the book, whether the apostle of that name or some other. Compare the introduction, section 1. It cannot be inferred from the use of the word “servant,” rather than apostle, that the apostle John was not the author, for it was not uncommon for the apostles to designate themselves merely by the words “servants,” or “servants of God.” Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>.</p>
