<p style=" "><b>Saying - </b>That is, literally, “the trumpet saying.” It was, however, manifestly the voice that addressed these words to John, though they seemed to come through a trumpet, and hence the trumpet is represented as uttering them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am Alpha and Omega - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The first and the last - </b>An explanation of the terms Alpha and Omega. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And, What thou seest - </b>The voice, in addition to the declaration, “I am Alpha and Omega,” gave this direction that he should record what he saw. The phrase, “what thou seest,” refers to what would pass before him in vision, what he there saw, and what he would see in the extraordinary manifestations which were to be made to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Write in a book - </b>Make a fair record of it all; evidently meaning that he should describe things as they occurred, and implying that the vision would be held so long before the eye of his mind that he would be able to transfer it to the “book.” The fair and obvious interpretation of this is, that he was to make the record in the island of Patmos, and then send it to the churches. Though Patmos was a lonely and barren place, and though probably here were few or no inhabitants there, yet there is no improbability in supposing that John could have found writing materials there, nor even that he may have been permitted to take such materials with him. He seems to have been banished for “preaching,” not for “writing”; and there is no evidence that the materials for writing would be withheld from him. John Bunyan, in Bedford jail, found materials for writing the “Pilgrim’s Progress,” and there is no evidence that the apostle John was denied the means of recording his thoughts when in the island of Patmos. The word “book” here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλίον</span></span> biblion), would more properly mean a roll or scroll, that being the form in which books were anciently made. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:17">Luke 4:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia - </b>The churches which are immediately designated, not implying that there were no other churches in Asia, but that there were particular reasons for sending it to these. He was to send all that he should “see”; to wit, all that is recorded in this volume or book of “Revelation.” Part of this <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:0">Revelation 2:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:0">Revelation 3:0</span> would pertain particularly to them; the remainder Rev. 4–22 would pertain to them no more than to others, but still they would have the common interest in it which all the church would have, and, in their circumstances of trial, there might be important reasons why they should see the assurance that the church would ultimately triumph over all its enemies. They were to derive from it themselves the consolation which it was suited to impart in time of trial, and to transmit it to future times, for the welfare of the church at large.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto Ephesus - </b>Perhaps mentioned first as being the capital of that portion of Asia Minor; the most important city of the seven; the place where John had preached, and whence he had been banished. For a particular description of these seven churches, see the notes on the epistles addressed to them in Rev. 2–3.</p>
