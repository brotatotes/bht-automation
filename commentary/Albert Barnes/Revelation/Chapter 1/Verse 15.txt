<p style=" "><b>And his feet like unto fine brass - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+10:6">Daniel 10:6</span>, “And his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:7">Ezekiel 1:7</span>, “and they” (the feet of the living creatures) “sparkled like the color of burnished brass.” The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλκολιβάνω</span></span> chalkolibanō - occurs in the New Testament only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:18">Revelation 2:18</span>. It is not found in the Septuagint. The word properly means “white brass” (probably compounded of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλκός</span></span> chalkos, brass, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λίβανος</span></span> libanos, whiteness, from the Hebrew <span class="_800000">לבן</span> laban, white). Others regard it as from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλκός</span></span> chalkos, brass, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιπαρόν</span></span> liparon, clear. The metal referred to was undoubtedly a species of brass distinguished for its clearness or whiteness. Brass is a compound metal, composed of copper and zinc. The color varies much according to the different proportions of the various ingredients. The Vulgate here renders the word “aurichalcum,” a mixture of gold and of brass - perhaps the same as the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἠλεκτρον</span></span> ēlektron - the electrum of the ancients, composed of gold and of silver, usually in the proportion of four parts gold and one part silver, and distinguished for its brilliancy. See Robinson, Lexicon, and Wetstein, in loco. The kind of metal here referred to, however, would seem to be some compound of brass - of a whitish and brilliant color. The exact proportion of the ingredients in the metal here referred to cannot now be determined.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As if they burned in a furnace - </b>That is, his feet were so bright that they seemed to be like a beautiful metal glowing intensely in the midst of a furnace. Anyone who has looked upon the dazzling and almost insupportable brilliancy of metal in a furnace, can form an idea of the image here presented.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his voice as the sound of many waters - </b>As the roar of the ocean, or of a cataract. Nothing could be a more sublime description of majesty and authority than to compare the voice of a speaker with the roar of the ocean. This comparison often occurs in the Scriptures. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+43:2">Ezekiel 43:2</span>, “And behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.” So <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:6">Revelation 19:6</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:24">Ezekiel 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+10:6">Daniel 10:6</span>.</p>
