<p style=" "><b>Write the things which thou hast seen - </b>An account of the vision which thou hast had, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10-18">Revelation 1:10-18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the things which are - </b>Give an account of those things which thou hast seen as designed to represent the condition of the seven churches. He had seen not only the Saviour, but he had seen seven lampstands, and seven stars in the hand of the Saviour, and he is now commanded to record the meaning of these symbols as referring to things then actually existing in the seven churches. This interpretation is demanded by <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the things which shall be hereafter - </b>The Greek phrase rendered “hereafter” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετὰ ταῦτα</span></span> meta tauta - means “after these things”; that is, he was to make a correct representation of the things which then were, and then to record what would occur “after these things:” to wit, of the images, symbols, and truths, which would be disclosed to him after what he had already seen. The expression refers to future times. He does not say for how long a time; but the revelations which were to be made referred to events which were to occur beyond those which were then taking place. Nothing can be argued from the use of this language in regard to the length of time embraced in the revelation-whether it extended only for a few years or whether it embraced all coming time. The more natural interpretation, however, would seem to be, that it would stretch far into future years, and that it was designed to give at least an outline of what would be the character of the future in general.</p>
