<p style=" "><b>And hath made us kings and priests unto God - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span> the same idea is expressed by saying of Christians that they are “a royal priesthood.” See the notes on that verse. The quotation in both places is from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>; “And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests.” This idea is expressed here by saying that Christ had made us in fact kings and priests; that is, Christians are exalted to the dignity and are invested with the office, implied in these words. The word “kings,” as applied to them, refers to the exalted rank and dignity which they will have; to the fact that they, in common with their Saviour, will reign triumphant over all enemies; and that, having gained a victory over sin and death and hell, they may be represented as reigning together. The word “priests” refers to the fact that they are engaged in the holy service of God, or that they offer to him acceptable worship. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his Father - </b>Even his Father; that is, the Saviour has redeemed them, and elevated them to this exalted rank, in order that they may thus be engaged in the service of his Father.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To him be glory - </b>To the Redeemer; for so the construction <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span> demands. The word “glory” here means praise, or honor, implying a wish that all honor should be shown him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And dominion - </b>This word means literally “strength” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κράτος</span></span> kratos; but it here means the strength, power, or authority which is exercised over others, and the expression is equivalent to a wish that he may reign.</p>
