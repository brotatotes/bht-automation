<p style=" "><b>And I saw - </b>I had a vision of. The meaning is, that he saw this subsequently to the vision in the previous chapter. The attention is now arrested by a new vision - as if some new dispensation or economy was about to occur in the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Another mighty angel - </b>He had before seen the seven angels who were to blow the seven trumpets <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:2">Revelation 8:2</span>, he had seen six of them successively blow the trumpet, he now sees another angel, different from them, and apparently having no connection with them, coming from heaven to accomplish some important purpose before the seventh angel should give the final blast. The angel is here characterized as a “mighty” angel - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἰσχυρὸν</span></span> ischuron - one of strength and power; implying that the work to be accomplished by his mission demanded the interposition of one of the higher orders of the heavenly inhabitants. The coming of an angel at all was indicative of some divine interposition in human affairs; the fact that he was one of exalted rank, or endowed with vast power, indicated the nature of the work to be done - that it was a work to the execution of which great obstacles existed, and where great power would be needed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Clothed with a cloud - </b>Encompassed with a cloud, or enveloped in a cloud. This was a symbol of majesty and glory, and is often represented as accompanying the divine presence, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:9-10">Exodus 16:9-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:16">Exodus 24:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:5">Exodus 34:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:25">Numbers 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:10">1 Kings 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:2">Psalms 97:2</span>. The Saviour also ascended in a cloud, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>; and he will again descend in clouds to judge the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:26">Mark 13:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>. Nothing can be argued here as to the purpose for which the angel appeared, from his being encompassed with a cloud; nor can anything be argued from it in respect to the question who this angel was. The fair interpretation is, that this was one of the angels now represented as sent forth on an errand of mercy to man, and coming with appropriate majesty as the messenger of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And a rainbow was upon his head - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span> the throne in heaven is represented as encircled by a rainbow. See the notes on that verse. The rainbow is properly an emblem of peace. Here the symbol would mean that the angel came not for wrath, but for purposes of peace; that he looked with a benign aspect upon people, and that the effect of his coming would be like that of sunshine after a storm.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his face was as it were the sun - </b>Bright like the sun (See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>); that is, he looked upon people with:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)An intelligent aspect - as the sun is the source of light; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)With benignity - not covered with clouds, or darkened by wrath. The brightness is probably the main idea, but the appearance of the angel would, as here represented, naturally suggest the ideas just referred to. As an emblem or symbol we should regard his appearing as what was to be followed by knowledge and by prosperity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his feet as pillars of fire - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:15">Revelation 1:15</span>. In this symbol, then, we have the following things:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)The fact that he was “mighty” - indicating that the work to be done required power beyond human strength;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (c)The fact that he came in a cloud - on an embassage so grand and magnificent as to make this symbol of majesty proper;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (d)The fact that he was encircled by a rainbow - that the visitation was to be one of peace to mankind; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (e)The fact that his coming was like the sun - or would diffuse light and peace.</p>
<p style=" ">Now, in regard to the application of this, without adverting to any other theory, no one can fail to see that, on the supposition that it was designed to refer to the Reformation, this would be the most striking and appropriate symbol that could have been chosen. For:</p>
<p style=" ">(a) as we have seen already, this is the place which the vision naturally occupies in the series of historical representations.</p>
<p style=" ">(b) It was at a period of the world, and the world was in such a state, that an intervention of this kind would be properly represented by the coming of an angel from heaven. God had visited the nations with terrible judgments, but the effect had not been to produce reformation, for the same forms of wickedness continued to prevail which had existed before. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20-21">Revelation 9:20-21</span>. In this state of things any new interposition of God for reforming the world would be properly represented by the coming of an angel from heaven as a messenger of light and peace.</p>
<p style=" ">(c) The great and leading events of the Reformation were well represented by the power of this angel. It was not, indeed, physical power; but the work to be done in the Reformation was a great work, and was such as would be well symbolized by the intervention of a mighty angel from heaven. The task of reforming the church, and of correcting the abuses which had prevailed, was wholly beyond any ability which man possessed, and was well represented, therefore, by the descent of this messenger from the skies.</p>
<p style=" ">(d) The same thing may be said of the rainbow that was upon his head. Nothing would better symbolize the general aspect of the Reformation, as suited to produce peace, tranquility, and joy upon the earth. And,</p>
<p style=" ">(e) the same thing was indicated by the splendor - the light and glory - that attended the angel. The symbol would denote that the new order of things would be attended with light; with knowledge; with what would be benign in its influence on human affairs. And it need not be said, to anyone acquainted with the history of those times, that the Reformation was preceded and accompanied with a great increase of light; that at just about that period of the world the study of the Greek-language began to be common in Europe; that the sciences had made remarkable progress; that schools and colleges had begun to flourish; and that, to a degree which had not existed for ages before, the public mind had become awakened to the importance of truth and knowledge. For a full illustration of this, from the close of the eleventh century and onward, see Hallam’s <i>Middle Ages</i>, vol. ii. pp. 265-293, ch. ix. part 2. To go into any satisfactory detail on this point would be wholly beyond the proper limits of these notes, and the reader must be referred to the histories of those times, and especially to Hallam, who has recorded all that is necessary to be known on the subject. Suffice it to say, that on the supposition that it was the intention to symbolize those times, no more appropriate emblem could have been found than that of an angel whose face shone like the sun, and who was covered with light and splendor. These remarks will show, that if it be supposed it was intended to symbolize the Reformation, no more appropriate emblem could have been selected than that of such an angel coming down from heaven. If, after the events have occurred, we should desire to represent the same things by a striking and expressive symbol, we could find none that would better represent those times.</p>
