<p style=" "><b>And the seventh angel sounded - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:2">Revelation 8:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:6-7">Revelation 8:6-7</span>. This is the last of the trumpets, implying, of course, that under this the series of visions was to end, and that this was to introduce the state of things under which the affairs of the world were to be wound up. The place which this occupies in the order of time, is when the events pertaining to the colossal Roman power - the fourth kingdom of Daniel Dan. 2–7 - should have been completed, and when the reign of the saints <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:9-14">Daniel 7:9-14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:27-28">Daniel 7:27-28</span> should have been introduced. This, both in Daniel and in John, is to occur when the mighty power of the papacy shall have been overthrown at the termination of the twelve hundred and sixty years of its duration. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span>. In both Daniel and John the termination of that persecuting power is the commencement of the reign of the saints; the downfall of the papacy, the introduction of the kingdom of God, and its establishment on the earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And there were great voices in heaven - </b>As of exultation and praise. The grand consummation had come, the period so long anticipated and desired when God should reign on the earth had arrived, and this lays the foundation for joy and thanksgiving in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The kingdoms of this world - </b>The modern editions of the New Testament (see Tittmann and Hahn) read this in the singular number - “The kingdom of this world has become,” etc. According to this reading, the meaning would be, either that the sole reign over this world had become that of the Lord Jesus; or, more probably, that the dominion over the earth had been regarded as one in the sense that Satan had reigned over it, but had now become the kingdom of God; that is, that “the kingdoms of this world are many considered in themselves; but in reference to the sway of Satan, there is only one kingdom ruled over by the ‘god of this world’” (Prof. Stuart). The sense is not materially different whichever reading is adopted; though the authority is in favor of the latter (Wetstein). According to the common reading, the sense is, that all the kingdoms of the earth, being many in themselves, had been now brought under the one scepter of Christ; according to the other, the whole world was regarded as in fact one kingdom - that of Satan - and the scepter had now passed from his hands into those of the Saviour.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The kingdoms of our Lord - </b>Or, the kingdom of our Lord, according to the reading adopted in the previous part of the verse. The word “Lord” here evidently has reference to God as such - represented as the original source of authority, and as giving the kingdom to his Son. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:8">Psalms 2:8</span>. The word “Lord” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> Kurios - implies the notion of possessor, owner, sovereign, supreme ruler - and is thus properly given to God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22">Matthew 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:33">Matthew 5:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:19">Mark 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:33">Acts 7:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:15">James 4:15</span>, al. saepe.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of his Christ - </b>Of his anointed; of him who is set apart as the Messiah, and consecrated to this high office. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. He is called “his Christ,” because he is set apart by him, or appointed by him to perform the work appropriate to that office on earth. Such language as what occurs here is often employed, in which God and Christ are spoken of as, in some respects, distinct - as sustaining different offices, and performing different works. The essential meaning here is, that the kingdom of this world had now become the kingdom of God under Christ; that is, that that kingdom is administered by the Son of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he shall reign forever and ever - </b>A kingdom is commenced which shall never terminate. It is not said that this would be on the earth; but the essential idea is, that the scepter of the world had now, after so long a time, come into his hands never more to pass away. The fuller characteristics of this reign are stated in a subsequent part of this book Rev. 20–22. What is here stated is in accordance with all the predictions in the Bible. A time is to come when, in the proper sense of the term, God is to reign on the earth; when his kingdom is to be universal; when his laws shall be everywhere recognized as binding; when all idolatry shall come to an end; and when the understandings and the hearts of people everywhere shall bow to his authority.
