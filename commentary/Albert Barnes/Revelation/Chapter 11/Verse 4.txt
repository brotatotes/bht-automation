<p style=" "><b>These are the two olive-trees - </b>These are represented by the two olive-trees, or these are what are symbolized by the two olive-trees. There can be little doubt that there is an allusion here to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:3">Zechariah 4:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:11">Zechariah 4:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:14">Zechariah 4:14</span>, though the imagery is in some respects changed. The prophet <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:2-3">Zechariah 4:2-3</span> saw in vision “a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which were upon the top thereof; and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.” These two “olive branches” were subsequently declared <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:14">Revelation 11:14</span> to be “the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.” The olive-trees, or olive-branches <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:12">Revelation 11:12</span>, appear in the vision of the prophet to have been connected with the ever-burning lamp by golden pipes; and as the olive-tree produced the oil used by the ancients in their lamps, these trees are represented as furnishing a constant supply of oil through the golden pipes to the candlestick, and thus they become emblematic of the supply of grace to the church. John uses this emblem, not in the sense exactly in which it was employed by the prophet, but to denote that these two “witnesses,” which might be compared with the two olivetrees, would be the means of supplying grace to the church. As the olive-tree furnished oil for the lamps, the two trees here would seem properly to denote ministers of religion; and as there can be no doubt that the candlesticks, or lamp-bearers, denote churches, the sense would appear to be that it was through the pastors of the churches that the oil of grace which maintained the brightness of those mystic candlesticks, or the churches, was conveyed. The image is a beautiful one, and expresses a truth of great importance to the world; for God has designed that the lamp of piety shall be kept burning in the churches by truth supplied through ministers and pastors.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the two candlesticks - </b>The prophet Zechariah saw but one such candlestick or lamp-bearer; John here saw two - as there are two “witnesses” referred to. In the vision described in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:12">Revelation 1:12</span>, he saw seven - representing the seven churches of Asia. For an explanation of the meaning of the symbol, see the notes on that verse.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Standing before the God of the earth - </b>So <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:14">Zechariah 4:14</span>, “These be the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.” The meaning is, that they stood, as it were, in the very presence of God - as, in the tabernacle and temple, the golden candlestick stood “before” the ark on which was the symbol of the divine presence, though separated from it by a veil. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:13">Revelation 9:13</span>. This representation, that the ministers of religion “stand before the Lord,” is one that is not uncommon in the Bible. Thus it is said of the priests and Levites: “The Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to staled before the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless his name,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:8">Deuteronomy 10:8</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:7">Deuteronomy 18:7</span>. The same thing is said of the prophets, as in the cases of Elijah and Elisha: “As the Lord liveth, before whom I stand,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:1">1 Kings 17:1</span>; also, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:15">1 Kings 18:15</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Ki 3:14</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:16">2 Kings 5:16</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+15:19">Jeremiah 15:19</span>. The representation is, that they ministered, as it were, constantly in his presence, and under his eye.</p>
