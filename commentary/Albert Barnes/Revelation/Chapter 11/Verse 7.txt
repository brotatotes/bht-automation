<p style=" "><b>And when they shall have finished their testimony - </b>Prof. Stuart renders this, “And whenever they shall have finished their testimony.” The reference is undoubtedly to a period when they should have faithfully borne the testimony which they were appointed to bear. The word rendered here “shall have finished” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελέσωσιν</span></span> telesōsin, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελέω</span></span> teleō means properly to end, to finish, to complete, to accomplish. It is used, in this respect, in two senses - either in regard to time or in regard to the end or object in view, in the sense of “perfecting it,” or “accomplishing it.” In the former sense it is employed in such passages as the following: “Till the thousand years should be fulfilled,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3">Revelation 20:3</span>. “Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel (Greek, ye shall not have finished the cities of Israel) until the Son of man be come,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span>; that is, ye shall not have finished passing through them. “When Jesus had made an end (Greek, finished) of commanding his twelve disciples,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span>. “I have “finished” my course,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">In these passages it clearly refers to time. In the other sense it is used in such places as the following: “And shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:27">Romans 2:27</span>; that is, if it accomplish or come up to the demands of the law. “If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scriptures,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:8">James 2:8</span>. The word, then, may here refer not to “time,” meaning that, these events would occur at the end of the “thousand two hundred and threescore days,” but to the fact that what is here stated would occur when they had completed their testimony in the sense of having testified all that they were “appointed” to testify; that is, when they had borne full witness for God, and fully uttered his truth. Thus understood, the meaning here may be that the event here referred to would take place, not at the end of the 1260 years, but at that period during the 1260 years when it could be said with propriety that they had accomplished their testimony in the world, or that they had borne full and ample witness on the points entrusted to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The beast - </b>This is the first time in the Book of Revelation in which what is here called “the beast” is mentioned, and which has so important an agency in the events which it is said would occur. It is repeatedly mentioned in the course of the book, and always with similar characteristics, and as referring to the same object. Here it is mentioned as “ascending out of the bottomless pit”; in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>, as “rising up out of the sea”; in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>, as “coming up out of the earth.” It is also mentioned with characteristics appropriate to such an origin, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2-4">Revelation 13:2-4</span> (twice), <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:12">Revelation 13:12</span> (twice), <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span> (twice), <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:15">Revelation 13:15</span> (twice), 17, 18; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:11">Revelation 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:2">Revelation 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:10">Revelation 16:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:13">Revelation 16:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:7-8">Revelation 17:7-8</span> (twice), 11, 12, 13, 16, 17; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:19-20">Revelation 19:19-20</span> (twice); <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:9">Revelation 20:9</span>. The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηρίον</span></span> thērion - means properly “a beast, a wild beast,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:13">Mark 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:12">Acts 10:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:6">Acts 11:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4-5">Acts 28:4-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:20">Hebrews 12:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:7">James 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>. It is once used tropically of brutal or savage men, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:12">Titus 1:12</span>. Elsewhere, in the passages above referred to in the Apocalypse, it is used symbolically. As employed in the Book of Revelation, the characteristics of the “beast” are strongly marked:</p>
<p style=" ">These things serve to characterize the “beast” as distinguished from all other things, and they are so numerous and definite, that it would seem to have been intended to make it easy to understand what was meant when the power referred to should appear. In regard to the origin of the imagery here, there can be no reasonable doubt that it is to be traced to Daniel, and that the writer here means to describe the same “beast” which Daniel refers to in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:7">Revelation 7:7</span>. The evidence of this must be clear to anyone who will compare the description in Daniel <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:0">Revelation 7:0</span> with the minute details in the book of Revelation. No one, I think, can doubt that John means to carry forward the description ill Daniel, and to apply it to new manifestations of the same great and terrific power - the power of the fourth monarchy - on the earth. For full evidence that the representation in Daniel refers to the Roman power prolonged and perpetuated in the papal dominion, I must refer the reader to the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span>. It may be assumed here that the opinion there defended is correct, and consequently it may be assumed that the “beast” of this book refers to the papal power.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ascendeth out of the bottomless pit - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1">Revelation 9:1</span>. This would properly mean that its origin is the nether world; or that it will have characteristics which will show that it was from beneath. The meaning clearly is, that what was symbolized by the beast would have such characteristics as to show that it was not of divine origin, but had its source in the world of darkness, sin, and death. This, of course, could not represent the true church, or any civil government that is founded on principles which God approves. But if it represent a community pretending to be a church, it is an apostate church; if a civil community, it is a community the characteristics of which are that it is controlled by the spirit that rules over the world beneath. For reasons which we shall see in abundance in applying the descriptions which occur of the “beast,” I regard this as referring to that great apostate power which occupies so much of the prophetic descriptions - the papacy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall make war against them - </b>Will endeavor to exterminate them by force. This clearly is not intended to be a general statement that they would be persecuted, but to refer to the particular manner in which the opposition would be conducted. It would be in the form of “war”; that is, there would be an effort to destroy them by arms.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And shall overcome them - </b>Shall gain the victory over them; conquer them - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικήσει αὐτοὺς</span></span> nikēsei autous. That is, there will be some signal victory in which those represented by the two witnesses will he subdued.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And kill them - </b>That is, an effect would be produced as if they were put to death. They would be overcome; would be silenced; would be apparently dead. Any event that would cause them to cease to bear testimony, as if they were dead, would be properly represented by this. It would not be necessary to suppose that there would be literally death in the ease, but that there would be some event which would be well represented by death - such as an entire suspension of their prophesying in consequence of force.</p>
