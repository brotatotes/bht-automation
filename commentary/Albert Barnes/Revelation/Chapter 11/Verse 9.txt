<p style=" "><b>And they of the people - </b>Some of the people; a part of the people - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐκ τῶν λαῶν</span></span> ek tōn laōn. The language is such as would be employed to describe a scene where a considerable portion of a company of people should be referred to, without intending to include all. The essential idea is, that there would be an assemblage of different classes of people to whom their carcasses would be exposed, and that they would come and look upon them. We should expect to find the fulfillment of this in some place where, from any cause, a variety of people should be assembled - as in some capital, or some commercial city, to which they would be naturally attracted.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall see their dead bodies - </b>That is, a state of things will occur as if these witnesses were put to death, and their carcasses were publicly exposed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Three days and an half - </b>This might be either literally three days and a half, or, more in accordance with the usual style of this book, these would be prophetic days; that is, three years and a half. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:5">Revelation 9:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:15">Revelation 9:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves - </b>That is, there would be a course of conduct in regard to these witnesses such as would be shown to the dead if they were not suffered to be decently interred. The language used here - “shall not suffer” - seems to imply that there would be those who might be disposed to show them the respect evinced by interring the dead, but that this would not be permitted. This would find a fulfillment if, in a time of persecution, those who had borne faithful testimony were silenced and treated with dishonor and if there should be those who were disposed to show them respect, but who would be prevented by positive acts on the part of their persecutors. This has often been the case in persecution, and there could be no difficulty in finding numerous instances in the history of the church to which this language would he applicable.</p>
