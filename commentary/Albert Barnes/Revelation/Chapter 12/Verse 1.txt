<p style=" "><b>And there appeared a great wonder in heaven - </b>In that heavenly world thus disclosed, in the very presence of God, he saw the impressive and remarkable symbol which he proceeds to describe. The word “wonder” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεῖον</span></span> sēmeion - properly means something extraordinary, or miraculous, and is commonly rendered “sign.” See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38-39">Matthew 12:38-39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:3-4">Matthew 16:3-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:3">Matthew 24:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:48">Matthew 26:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:11-12">Mark 8:11-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:4">Mark 13:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:22">Mark 13:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:17">Mark 16:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:20">Mark 16:20</span>; in all which, and in numerous other places in the New Testament, it is rendered “sign,” and mostly in the sense of “miracle.” When used in the sense of a miracle, it refers to the fact that the miracle is a sign or token by which the divine power or purpose is made known. Sometimes the word is used to denote “a sign of future things” - a portent or presage of coming events; that is, some remarkable appearances which foreshadow the future. Thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:3">Matthew 16:3</span>; “signs of the times”; that is, the miraculous events which foreshadow the coming of the Messiah in his kingdom. So also in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:3">Matthew 24:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:4">Mark 13:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:7">Luke 21:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:11">Luke 21:11</span>. This seems to be the meaning here, that the woman who appeared in this remarkable manner was a portent or token of what was to occur.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A woman clothed with the sun - </b>Bright, splendid, glorious, as if the sunbeams were her raiment. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="so+6:10">Song of Solomon 6:10</span> - a passage which, very possibly, was in the mind of the writer when he penned this description: “Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the moon under her feet - </b>The moon seemed to be under her feet. She seemed as if she stood on the moon, its pale light contrasted with the burning splendor of the sun, heightening the beauty of the whole picture. The woman, beyond all question, represents the church. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:2">Revelation 12:2</span>. Is the splendor of the sunlight designed to denote the brightness of the gospel? Is the moon designed to represent the comparatively feeble light of the Jewish dispensation? Is the fact that she stood upon the moon, or that it was under her feet, designed to denote the superiority of the gospel to the Jewish dispensation? Such a supposition gives much beauty to the symbol, and is not foreign to the nature of symbolic language.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And upon her head a crown of twelve stars - </b>A diadem in which there were placed twelve stars. That is, there were twelve sparkling gems in the crown which she wore. This would, of course, greatly increase the beauty of the vision; and there can be no doubt that the number twelve here is significant. If the woman here is designed to symbolize the church, then the number twelve has, in all probability, some allusion either to the twelve tribes of Israel as being a number which one who was born and educated as a Jew would be likely to use (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>), or to the twelve apostles - an allusion which, it may be supposed, an apostle would be more likely to make. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:14">Revelation 21:14</span>.</p>
