<p style=" "><b>And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle - </b>The most powerful of birds, and among the most rapid in flight. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>. The meaning here is, that the woman is represented as prepared for a rapid flight; so prepared as to be able to outstrip her pursuer, and to reach a place of safety. Divested of the figure, the sense is, that the church, when exposed to this form of persecution, would be protected as if miraculously supplied with wings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That she might fly into the wilderness - </b>There is here a more full description of what is briefly stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6">Revelation 12:6</span>. A wilderness or desert is often represented as a place of safety from pursuers. Thus David <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+23:14-15">1 Samuel 23:14-15</span> is represented as fleeing into the wilderness from the persecutions of Saul. So Elijah <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:4">1 Kings 19:4</span> fled into the wilderness from the persecutions of Jezebel. The simple idea here is, that the church, in the opposition which would come upon it, would find a refuge.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into her place - </b>A place appointed for her; that is, a place where she could be safe.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Where she is nourished - </b>The word rendered here “nourished” is the same - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρέφω</span></span> trephō - which occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6">Revelation 12:6</span>, and which is there rendered “feed.” It means to feed, nurse, or nourish, as the young of animals <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:26">Matthew 6:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:37">Matthew 25:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:24">Luke 12:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:20">Acts 12:20</span>; that is, to sustain by proper food. The meaning here is, that the church would be kept alive. It is not indeed mentioned by whom this would be done, but it is evidently implied that it would be by God. During this long period in which the church would be in obscurity, it would not be suffered to become extinct. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:3-6">1 Kings 17:3-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For a time, and times, and half a time - </b>A year, two years, and half a year; that is, forty-two months (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:2">Revelation 11:2</span>); or, reckoning the month at thirty days, twelve hundred and sixty days; and regarding these as prophetic days, in which a day stands for a year, twelve hundred and sixty years. For a full discussion of the meaning of this language, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span>; and Editor’s Pref. For the evidence, also, that the time thus specified refers to the papacy, and to the period of its continuance, see the notes on that place. The full consideration given to the subject there renders it unnecessary to discuss it here. For it is manifest that there is an allusion here to the passage in Daniel; that the twelve hundred and sixty days refer to the same thing; and that the true explanation must be made in the same way. The main difficulty, as is remarked on the notes on that passage, is in determining the time when the papacy properly commenced.</p>
<p style=" ">If that could be ascertained with certainty, there would be no difficulty in determining when it would come to an end. But though there is considerable uncertainty as to the exact time when it arose, and though different opinions have been entertained on that point, yet it is true that all the periods assigned for the rise of that power lead to the conclusion that the time of its downfall cannot be remote. The meaning in the passage before us is, that during all the time of the continuance of that formidable, persecuting power, the true church would not in fact become extinct. It would be obscure and comparatively unknown, but it would still live. The fulfillment of this is found in the fact, that during all the time here referred to, there has been a true church on the earth. Pure, spiritual religion - the religion of the New Testament - has never been wholly extinct. In the history of the Waldenses, and Albigenses, the Bohemian brethren, and kindred people; in deserts and places of obscurity; among individuals and among small and persecuted sects; here and there in the cases of individuals in monasteries, the true religion has been kept up in the world, as in the days of Elijah God reserved seven thousand men who had not bowed the knee to Baal: and it is possible now for us, with a good degree of certainty, to show, even during the darkest ages, and when Rome seemed to have entirely the ascendency, where the true church was. To find out this, was the great design of the Ecclesiastical History of Milner; it has been done, also, with great learning and skill, by Neander.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From the face of the serpent - </b>The dragon - or Satan represented by the dragon. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>. The reference here is to the opposition which Satan makes to the true church under the persecutions and corruptions of the papacy.</p>
