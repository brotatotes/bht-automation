<p style=" "><b>And it was given unto him - </b>By the same power that taught him to blaspheme God and his church. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:5">Revelation 13:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To make war with the saints - </b>See this fully illustrated in the notes on the parallel passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:21">Daniel 7:21</span>, and at the end of that chapter, (f).</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to overcome them - </b>In those wars. This was abundantly fulfilled in the wars with the Waldenses, the Albigenses, and the other sincere followers of the Saviour in the time of the papal persecutions. The language used here is the same as what is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:21">Daniel 7:21</span>; “The same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them.” See the notes on that passage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And power was given him - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations - </b>For the meaning of these words see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>. The meaning here is, that this dominion was set up over the world. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span>. The fact that so large a portion of the kingdoms of the earth was under the influence of the papacy, and sustained it, and the claim which it set up to universal dominion, and to the right of deposing kings and giving away kingdoms, corresponds entirely with the language used here.</p>
