<p style=" "><b>And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him - </b>That is, as immediately stated, all whose names are not in the book of life. On the word “worship,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:4">Revelation 13:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb - </b>That is, of the Lord Jesus - the Lamb of God. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</span>. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>. The representation here is, that the Lord Jesus keeps a book or register, in which are recorded the names of all who shall obtain everlasting life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Slain from the foundation of the world - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>. The meaning here is, not that he was actually put to death “from the foundation of the world,” but that the intention to give him for a sacrifice was formed then, and that it was so certain that it might be spoken of as actually then occurring. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span>. The purpose was so certain, it was so constantly represented by bloody sacrifices from the earliest ages, all typifying the future Saviour, that it might be said that he was “slain from the foundation of the world.” Prof. Stuart, however (Com. in loco), supposes that this phrase should be connected with the former member of the sentence, “whose names are not written, from the foundation of the world, in the life-book of the Lamb, which was slain.” Either construction makes good sense; but it seems to me that what is found in our common version is the most simple and natural.</p>
