<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">In the previous chapters Rev. 12–13 there is a description of the woes and sorrows which, for a long period, would come upon the church, and which would threaten to destroy it. It was proper that this gloomy picture should be relieved, and accordingly this chapter, having much of the aspect of an episode, is thrown in to comfort the hearts of those who should see those troublous times. There were bright scenes beyond, and it was important to direct the eye to them, that the hearts of the sad might be consoled. This chapter, therefore, contains a succession of symbolical representations designed to show the ultimate result of all these things - “to hold out the symbols of ultimate and certain victory” (Prof. Stuart). Those symbols are the following:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The vision of the hundred and forty-four thousand on Mount Zion, as emblematical of the final triumph of the redeemed, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1-5">Revelation 14:1-5</span>. They have the Father’s name in their foreheads <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>; they sing a song of victory <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2-3">Revelation 14:2-3</span>; they are found without fault before God - representatives, in this respect, of all that will be saved, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4-5">Revelation 14:4-5</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The vision of the final triumph of the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6-7">Revelation 14:6-7</span>. An angel is seen flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to all that dwell upon the earth, and announcing that the end is near - a representation designed to show that the gospel will be thus preached among all nations; and when that is done, the time will draw on when the affairs of the world will be wound up.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The fall of Babylon, the mighty anti-Christian power, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>. An angel is seen going forth announcing the glad tidings that this mighty power is overthrown, and that, therefore, its oppressions are come to an end. This, to the church in trouble and persecution, is one of the most comforting of all the assurances that God makes in regard to the future.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) The certain and final destruction of all the upholders of that anti-Christian power, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9-12">Revelation 14:9-12</span>. Another angel is seen making proclamation that all the supporters and abettors of this formidable power would drink of the wine of the wrath of God; that they would be tormented with fire and brimstone; and that the smoke of their torment would ascend up forever and ever.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) The blessedness of all those who die in the Lord; who, amidst the persecutions and trials that were to come upon the church, would be found faithful unto death, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span>. They would rest from their labors; the works of mercy which they had done on the earth would follow them to the future world, securing rich and eternal blessings there.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) The final overthrow of all the enemies of the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14-20">Revelation 14:14-20</span>. This is the grand completion; to this all things are tending; this will be certainly accomplished in due time. This is represented under various emblems:</p>
<p style=" ">This whole chapter, therefore, is designed to relieve the gloom of the former representations. The action of the grand moving panorama is stayed that the mind may not be overwhelmed with gloomy thoughts, but that it may be cheered with the assurance of the final triumph of truth and righteousness. The chapter, viewed in this light, is introduced with great artistic skill, as well as great beauty of poetic illustration; and, in its place, it is adapted to set forth this great truth, that, to the righteous, and to the church at large, in the darkest times, and with the most threatening prospect of calamity and sorrow, there is the certainty of final victory, and that this should be allowed to cheer and sustain the soul.</p>
