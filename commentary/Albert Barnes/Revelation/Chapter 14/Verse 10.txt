The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God - See notes on Revelation 14:8. The “wine of the wrath of God” is the cup in the hand of the Lord, which, when drunk, makes them reel and fall. The image would seem to have been taken from the act of holding out a cup of poison to a condemned man that he might drink and die. See the sentiment here expressed illustrated in the notes on Isaiah 51:17.Which is poured out without mixture - Without being diluted with water - that is, in its full strength. In other words, there would be no mitigation of the punishment.Into the cup of his indignation - The cup held in his hand, and given them to drink. This is expressive of his indignation, as it causes them to reel and fall. The sentiment here is substantially the same, though in another form, as what is expressed in 2 Thessalonians 2:12. See the notes on that verse.And he shall be tormented - Shall be punished in a manner that would be well represented by being burned with fire and brimstone. On the meaning of this word see the notes on Revelation 9:5; Revelation 11:10. Compare also Revelation 18:7, Revelation 18:10, Revelation 18:15; Revelation 20:10; Matthew 8:29; Mark 5:7; Luke 8:28. The word commonly denotes “severe torture.”With fire and brimstone - As if with burning sulphur. See the notes on Luke 17:28-30. Compare Psalms 11:6; Job 18:15; Isaiah 30:33; Ezekiel 38:22. The imagery is taken from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Genesis 19:24. The common representation of the punishment of the wicked is, that it will be in the manner here represented, Matthew 5:22; Matthew 13:42; Matthew 18:9; Matthew 25:41; Mark 9:44-48; 2 Peter 3:7; Jude 1:7; Revelation 20:14. Compare the Matthew 5:22 note; Mark 9:44 note.In the presence of the holy angels - This may mean either: (a)That the angels will be present at their condemnation Matthew 25:31, or. (b)That the punishment will be actually witnessed by the angels, as it is most probable it will be. Compare Isaiah 66:24; Luke 16:23-26.And in the presence of the Lamb - The Lamb of God - the final Judge. This also may mean either that the condemnation will occur in his presence, or that the punishment will be under his eye. Both of these things will be true in regard to him; and it will be no small aggravation of the punishment of the wicked, that it will occur in the very presence of their slighted and rejected Saviour.
