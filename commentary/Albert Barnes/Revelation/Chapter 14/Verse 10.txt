<p style=" "><b>The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God - </b>See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>. The “wine of the wrath of God” is the cup in the hand of the Lord, which, when drunk, makes them reel and fall. The image would seem to have been taken from the act of holding out a cup of poison to a condemned man that he might drink and die. See the sentiment here expressed illustrated in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:17">Isaiah 51:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is poured out without mixture - </b>Without being diluted with water - that is, in its full strength. In other words, there would be no mitigation of the punishment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into the cup of his indignation - </b>The cup held in his hand, and given them to drink. This is expressive of his indignation, as it causes them to reel and fall. The sentiment here is substantially the same, though in another form, as what is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:12">2 Thessalonians 2:12</span>. See the notes on that verse.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he shall be tormented - </b>Shall be punished in a manner that would be well represented by being burned with fire and brimstone.

<p style=" "><b>In the presence of the holy angels - </b>This may mean either:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)That the angels will be present at their condemnation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span>, or.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)That the punishment will be actually witnessed by the angels, as it is most probable it will be.

<p style=" "><b>And in the presence of the Lamb - </b>The Lamb of God - the final Judge. This also may mean either that the condemnation will occur in his presence, or that the punishment will be under his eye. Both of these things will be true in regard to him; and it will be no small aggravation of the punishment of the wicked, that it will occur in the very presence of their slighted and rejected Saviour.</p>
