<p style=" "><b>And the smoke of their torment - </b>The smoke proceeding from their place of torment. This language is probably derived from the account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:28">Genesis 19:28</span>; “And he (Abraham) looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.” The destruction of these cities is regarded as an emblem of the destruction of the wicked, and the smoke that ascended from them as a representation of what ascends from the place where the wicked suffer forever. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:7">Jude 1:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ascendeth up - </b>Continually rises from that world of woe.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For ever and ever - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:7">Jude 1:7</span>. This does not indeed affirm that their individual sufferings would be eternal, since it is only a declaration that “the smoke of their torment ascends,” but it is such language as would be used on the supposition that they would suffer forever, and as can be explained only on that supposition. It implies that their torments continued, and were the cause of that ascending smoke; that is, that they were tormented while it ascended; and, as this is declared to be “forever and ever,” it implies that the sufferings of the wicked will be eternal: and this is such language as would not, and could not have been used in a revelation from God, unless the punishment of the wicked is eternal.

<p style=" "><b>And they have no rest day nor night - </b>“Day and night” include all time; and hence, the phrase is used to denote perpetuity - “always.” The meaning here is, that they never have any rest - any interval of pain. This is stated as a circumstance strongly expressive of the severity of their torment. Here, rest comes to the sufferer. The prisoner in his cell lies down on his bed, though hard, and sleeps; the overworked slave has also intervals of sleep; the eyes of the mourner are locked in repose, and for moments, if not hours, he forgets his sorrows; no pain that we endure on earth can be so certain and prolonged that nature will not, sooner or later, find the luxury of sleep, or will find rest in the grave. But it will be one of the bitterest ingredients in the cup of woe, in the world of despair, that this luxury will be denied forever, and that they who enter that gloomy prison sleep no more, never know the respite of a moment, never even lose the consciousness of their heavy doom. Oh how different from the condition of sufferers here! And oh how sad and strange that any of our race will persevere in sin, and go down to those unmitigated and unending sorrows!</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who worship the beast and his image - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:4">Revelation 13:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:15">Revelation 13:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And whosoever receiveth the mark of his name - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:17">Revelation 13:17</span>. The meaning here is, that such worshippers will receive the punishment which other idolaters and sinners do. No exception will be made in favor of an idolater, though he worships idols under the forms of an abused Christianity; none will be made in favor of a sinner because he practiced iniquity under the garb of religion.</p>
