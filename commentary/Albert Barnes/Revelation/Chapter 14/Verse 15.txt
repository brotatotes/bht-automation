<p style=" "><b>And another angel - </b>The fourth in order, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8-9">Revelation 14:8-9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Came out of the temple - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>. Came, as it were, from the immediate presence of God; for the temple was regarded as his unique dwelling-place.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud - </b>To the Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>. That is, the command was borne directly from God by the angel to the Messiah, to go forth and reap the great harvest of the world. It is not a command of the angel, but a command from God the Father to the Son. This is in accordance with all the representations in the New Testament, that the Son, as Messiah or Redeemer, is subordinate to the Father, and performs the work which has been given him to do. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16-17">John 3:16-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:18">John 10:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:49">John 12:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span>.

<p style=" "><b>Thrust in thy sickle, and reap - </b>Into the great harvest of the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the time is come for thee to reap - </b>That is, “the harvest which thou art to reap is ripe; the seed which thou hast sown has grown up; the earth which thou hast cultivated has produced this golden grain, and it is fit that thou shouldst now gather it in.” This language is appropriately addressed to the Son of God, for all the fruits of righteousness on the earth may be regarded as the result of his culture.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the harvest of the earth is ripe - </b>The “harvest” in reference to the righteous - fruit of the good seed sown by the Saviour and his apostles and ministers. The time alluded to here is the end of the world, when the affairs of earth shall be about to he wound up. The design is to state that the Redeemer will then gather in a great and glorious harvest, and by this assurance to sustain the hearts of his people in times of trial and persecution.</p>
