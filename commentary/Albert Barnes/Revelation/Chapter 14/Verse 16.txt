<p style=" "><b>And he that sat on the cloud - </b>The Saviour, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thrust in his sickle on the earth - </b>To cut down the harvest - that is, to gather his people to himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the earth was reaped - </b>So far as the righteous were concerned. The end had come; the church was redeemed; the work contemplated was accomplished; and the results of the work of the Saviour were like a glorious harvest.</p>
