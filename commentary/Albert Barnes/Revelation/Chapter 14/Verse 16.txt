And he that sat on the cloud - The Saviour, Revelation 14:14.Thrust in his sickle on the earth - To cut down the harvest - that is, to gather his people to himself.And the earth was reaped - So far as the righteous were concerned. The end had come; the church was redeemed; the work contemplated was accomplished; and the results of the work of the Saviour were like a glorious harvest.
