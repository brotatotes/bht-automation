<p style=" "><b>And another angel - </b>The sixth in order. He came, like the angel in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:15">Revelation 14:15</span>, with a command to him who had the sickle to go forth and execute his commission.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Came out from the altar - </b>This stood in the front of the temple (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>; compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:23-24">Matthew 5:23-24</span>), and was the place where burnt-sacrifices were made. As the work now to be done was a work of destruction, this was an appropriate place in the representation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which had power over fire - </b>As if he kept the fire on the altar. Fire is the usual emblem of destruction; and as the work now to be done was such, it was proper to represent this angel as engaged in it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And cried with a loud cry, ... - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:15">Revelation 14:15</span>. That is, he came forth, as with a command from God, to call on him who was appointed to do the work of destruction, now to engage in performing it. The time had fully come.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thrust in thy sharp sickle - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:15">Revelation 14:15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And gather the clusters of the vine of the earth - </b>That portion of the earth which might be represented by a vineyard in which the grapes were to be gathered and crushed. The image here employed occurs elsewhere to denote the destruction of the wicked. See the very beautiful description in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:1-6">Isaiah 63:1-6</span>, respecting the destruction of Edom, and the notes on that passage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For her grapes are fully ripe - </b>That is, the time has come for the ingathering; or, to apply the image, for the winding up of human affairs by the destruction of the wicked. The time here, as in the previous representation, is the end of the world; and the design is, to comfort the church in its trials and persecutions, by the assurance that all its enemies will be cut off.</p>
