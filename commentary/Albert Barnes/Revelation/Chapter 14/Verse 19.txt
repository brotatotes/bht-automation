<p style=" "><b>And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth - </b>That is, into that part of the earth which might be represented by a vineyard; or the earth considered as having been the abode of wicked men.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:1-6">Isaiah 63:1-6</span>. That is, the wine-press where the grapes are crushed, and where the juice, resembling blood, flows out, may be used as a symbol to denote the destruction of the wicked in the last day; and as the numbers will be immensely great, it is called the “great wine-press of divine wrath.” The symbol appears to be used here alike with reference to the color of the wine resembling blood, and the pressure necessary to force it out; and thus employed it is one of the most striking emblems conceivable to denote the final destruction of the wicked.</p>
