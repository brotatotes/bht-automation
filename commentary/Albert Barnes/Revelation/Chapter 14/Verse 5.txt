<p style=" "><b>And in their mouth was found no guile - </b>No deceit, fraud, hypocrisy. They were sincerely and truly what they professed to be - the children of God. This is the last characteristic which is given of them as redeemed, and it is not necessary to say that this is always represented as one of the characteristics of the true children of God. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:47">John 1:47</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For they are without fault before the throne of God - </b>The word here rendered “without fault” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἄμωμοι</span></span> amōmoi - means, properly, “spotless, without blemish,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>. This cannot be construed as meaning that they were by nature pure and holy, but only that they were pure as they stood before the throne of God in heaven - “having washed their robes, and made them pure in the blood of the Lamb.” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>. It will be certainly true that all who stand there will be, in fact, pure, for nothing impure or unholy shall enter there, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:27">Revelation 21:27</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The “design” of this portion of the chapter was evidently to comfort those to whom the book was addressed, and, in the same way, to comfort all the children of God in times of persecution and trial. Those living in the time of John were suffering persecution, and, in the previous chapters, he had described more fearful trials yet to come on the church. In these trials, therefore, present and prospective, there was a propriety in fixing the thoughts on the final triumph of the redeemed - that glorious state in heaven where all persecution shall cease, and where all the ransomed of the Lord shall stand before his throne. What could be better suited than this view to sustain the souls of the persecuted and the sorrowful? And how often since in the history of the church in the dark times of religious declension and of persecution - has there been occasion to seek consolation in this bright view of heaven? How often in the life of each believer, when sorrows come upon him like a flood, and earthly consolation is gone, is there occasion to look to that blessed world where all the redeemed shall stand before God; where all tears shall be wiped away from every face; and where there shall be the assurance that the last pang has been endured, and that the soul is to be happy forever?</p>
