<p style=" "><b>And I saw another sign in heaven - </b>Another wonder or extraordinary symbol. The word “sign” here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεῖον</span></span> sēmeion - is the same which in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:13">Revelation 13:13</span>, is rendered “wonder” and “wonders,” and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:14">Revelation 16:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>, “miracles.” The word is not found elsewhere in the Book of Revelation, though it is of frequent occurrence in other parts of the New Testament. See it explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>. Here it is used to denote something wonderful or marvelous. This is represented as appearing in heaven, for the judgments that were to fall upon the world were to come thence. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13-14">Revelation 14:13-14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17">Revelation 14:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Great and marvelous - </b>Great and wonderful, or suited to excite admiration - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαστὸν</span></span> thaumaston. The subsequent statements fully justify this, and show that the vision was one of portentous character, and that was suited to hold the mind in astonishment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Seven angels - </b>Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having the seven last plagues - </b>The article here, “the seven last plagues,” would seem to imply that the plagues referred to had been before specified, or that it would be at once understood what is referred to. These plagues, however, have not been mentioned before, and the reason why the article is used here seems to be this: the destruction of this great anti-Christian power had been distinctly mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:0">Revelation 14:0</span>. That might be spoken of as a thing now well known, and the mention of it would demand the article; and as that was well known, and would demand the article, so any allusion to it, or description of it, might be spoken of in the same manner, as a thing that was definite and fixed, and hence, the mention of the plagues by which it was to be accomplished would be referred to in the same manner. The word “plagues” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληγὰς</span></span> plēgas, from, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληγή</span></span> plēgē - means properly a wound caused by a stripe or blow, and is frequently rendered “stripe” and “stripes,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:33">Acts 16:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:5">2 Corinthians 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament, except in the Book of Revelation. In this book it is rendered “wound” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3">Revelation 13:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:12">Revelation 13:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>; and plagues in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20">Revelation 9:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:6">Revelation 11:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:6">Revelation 15:6</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:8">Revelation 15:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:9">Revelation 16:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:21">Revelation 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:4">Revelation 18:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:8">Revelation 18:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:18">Revelation 22:18</span>. It does not occur elsewhere. The secondary meaning of the word, and the meaning in the passage before us, is “a stripe” or “blow inflicted by God”; calamity or punishment. The word “last” means those under which the order of things here referred to would terminate; the winding up of the affairs respecting the beast and his image - not necessarily the closing of the affairs of the world. Important events were to occur subsequent to the destruction of this anti-Christian power Rev. 19–22, but these were the plagues which would come finally upon the beast and his image, and which would terminate the existence of this formidable enemy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For in them is filled up the wrath of God - </b>That is, in regard to the beast and his image. All the expressions of the divine indignation toward that oppressive and persecuting power will be completed or exhausted by the pouring out of the contents of these vials. Compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span>, where the word rendered “filled up” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐτελέσθη</span></span> etelesthē - is rendered “finished.”</p>
