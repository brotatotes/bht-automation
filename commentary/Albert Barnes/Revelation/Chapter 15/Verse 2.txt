<p style=" "><b>And I saw as it were a sea of glass - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>, a similar vision is recorded - “And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like unto crystal.” See the notes on that passage. The sea of glass here means a sea clear, pellucid, like glass: an expanse that seemed to be made of glass. There it was entirely clear; here it is mingled with fire.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Mingled with fire - </b>That is, a portion of the sea was red like fire. It was not all clear and pellucid, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>, but it was as it were a tesselated expanse, composed in part of what seemed to be glass, and in part of a material of a red or fiery color. In the former case <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>, the emblem was designed to represent the pure worship of heaven without reference to any other symbolic design, and hence, the sea is wholly clear and pellucid; here, in connection with the purpose of furnishing an appropriate symbol of the divine majesty, there is united the idea of punishment on the foes of God, represented by the fiery or red color. If it is proper, from conjecture, to suggest the meaning of this as an emblem, it would be that the foundation - the main element - of all the divine dealings is justice or holiness - represented by the portion of the sea that seemed to be glass; and that there was, in this case, intermingled with that, the image of wrath or anger - represented by the portion that was fiery or red. The very sight of the pavement, therefore, on which they stood when worshipping God, would keep before their minds impressive views of his character and dealings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And them that had gotten the victory over the beast - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>. That is, they who had gained a victory in times of persecution and temptation; or they whom the “beast” had not been able, by arts or arms, to subdue. The persons referred to here, I suppose, are those who in the long dominion of the papal power, and amidst all its arts and corruptions - its threats and persecutions - had remained steadfast in the truth, and who might thus be said to have gained a victory - for such victories of piety, virtue, and truth, amidst the corrupting influences of sin and error, and the intimidations of power, are the most important that are gained in this world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And over his image - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14-15">Revelation 13:14-15</span>. The meaning is, that they had not been led to apostatize by the dread of the power represented here by the “image of the beast.” In all the attempts of that power to subdue them - to intimidate them - to induce them to give up their attachment to the truth as it is in Jesus - they had remained steadfast in the faith, and had triumphed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And over his mark - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>. Over all the attempts of the beast to fix his mark upon them, or to designate them as his own.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And over the number of his name - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:17-18">Revelation 13:17-18</span>. Over all the attempts to fix upon them that mysterious number which expressed his name. The general sense is, that in times of general error and corruption; when the true friends of Christ were exposed to persecution; when every effort was made to induce them to become the followers of the “beast,” and to yield to the corrupt system represented by the “beast,” they remained unmoved, and adhered firmly to the truth. The number of such in the aggregate was not small; and with great beauty and propriory they are here represented as rejoicing and giving thanks to God on the overthrow of that corrupt and formidable power.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Stand on the sea of glass - </b>That is, before God. They are now seen in heaven, redeemed and triumphant.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having the harps of God - </b>Harps that pertained to the worship of God; harps to be employed in his praise. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span>.</p>
