<p style=" "><b>And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God - </b>A song of thanksgiving and praise, such as Moses taught the Hebrew people to sing after their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:0">Exodus 15:0</span>. The meaning here is, not that they would sing that identical song, but that, as Moses taught the people to celebrate their deliverance with an appropriate hymn of praise, the redeemed would celebrate their delivery and redemption in a similar manner. There is an obvious propriety here in referring to the “song of Moses,” because the circumstances are very similar; the occasion of the redemption from that formidable anti-Christian power here referred to, had a strong resemblance to the rescue from Egyptian bondage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the song of the Lamb - </b>The hymn which is sung in honor of the Lamb, as their great deliverer. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9-10">Revelation 5:9-10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12-13">Revelation 5:12-13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Saying, Great and marvelous are thy works - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>. The meaning is, that great power was evinced in redeeming them; and that the interposition of the divine goodness in doing it was marvelous, or was such as to excite wonder and admiration.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lord God Almighty - </b>This would seem to mean the same thing as the expression so common in the Old Testament, “Yahweh, God of hosts.” The union of these appellations give solemnity and impressiveness to the ascription of praise, for it brings into view the fact, that he whose praise is celebrated is Lord - Yahweh - -the uncreated and eternal One; that he is God the creator, upholder, and sovereign of all things; and that he is Almighty - having all power in all worlds. All these names and attributes are suggested when we think of redemption; for all the perfections of a glorious God are suggested in the redemption of the soul from death. It is the Lord the Ruler of all worlds; it is God - the Maker of the race, and the Father of the race, who performs the work of redemption; and it is a work which could be accomplished only by one who is Almighty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Just and true - </b>The attributes of justice and truth are brought prominently into view also in the redemption of man. The fact that God is just, and that in all this work he has been careful to maintain his justice <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>; and the fact that he is true to himself, true to the creation, true to the fulfillment of all his promises, are prominent in this work, and it is proper that these attributes should be celebrated in the songs of praise in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are thy ways - </b>Thy ways or dealings with us, and with the enemies of the church. That is, all the acts or “ways” of God in the redemption of his people had been characterized by justice and truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou King of saints - </b>King of those who are holy; of all who are redeemed and sanctified. The more approved reading here, however, is “King of nations” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν ἐθνῶν</span></span> ho basileus tōn ethnōn - instead of “King of saints” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὼν ἁγιῶν</span></span> tōn hagiōn. So it is read in the critical editions of Griesbach, Tittmann, and Hahn. The sense is not materially affected by the difference in the reading.</p>
