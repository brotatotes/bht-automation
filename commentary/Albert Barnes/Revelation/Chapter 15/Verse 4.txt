<p style=" "><b>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord - </b>Reverence and adore thee; for the word “fear,” in the Scriptures, is commonly used in this sense when applied to God. The sense here is, that the judgments about to be inflicted on the beast and his image should and would teach people to reverence and adore God. There is, perhaps, included here also the idea of awe, inasmuch as this would be the effect of punishment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And glorify thy name - </b>Honor thee - the name being put for the person who bare it. The sense is, that, as a consequence of these judgments, men would be brought to honor God, and to acknowledge him as the Ruler of the earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For thou only art holy - </b>That is, in these judgments he would show himself to be a holy God; a God hating sin, and loving righteousness and truth. When it is said that he “only” is holy, the expression is used, of course, in a comparative sense. He is so pure that it may be said that, in comparison with him, no one else is holy.

<p style=" "><b>For all nations shall come and worship before thee - </b>That is, as the result of these punishments inflicted on this dread anti-Christian power, they shalt come and worship thee. Everywhere in the New Testament the destruction of that power is connected with the promise of the speedy conversion of the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For thy judgments are made manifest - </b>To wit, on the beast. That formidable power is overthrown, and the grand hindrance to the universal spread of the true religion is now taken away.
