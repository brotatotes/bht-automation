<p style=" "><b>And after that I looked - </b>After I had seen in vision the redeemed thus referred to, celebrating the praises of God, I saw the preparation made for the execution of these purposes of judgment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony - </b>Not the whole temple, but only that part to which this name was given. The word “tabernacle” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνή</span></span> skēnē - means properly a booth, hut, tent, and was the name commonly given to the tent or tabernacle that was erected in the wilderness for the service of God. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:44">Acts 7:44</span>. The same word came naturally to be applied to the temple that was reared for the same purpose in Jerusalem. It is called the “tabernacle of testimony,” because it was a testimony or witness of the presence of God among the people - that is, it served to keep up the remembrance of him. See the notes as above on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:44">Acts 7:44</span>, where the same Greek phrase is used as here - rendered there “tabernacle of witness.” The word “temple” here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναὸς</span></span> naos - does not refer to the whole of the building called the “temple,” but to the holy of holies. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:3">Hebrews 9:3</span>. This was regarded as the unique dwelling-place of God; and it was this sacred place, usually closed from all access, that now seemed to be opened, implying that the command to execute these purposes came directly from God himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In heaven - </b>That is, that part of heaven which corresponds to the most holy place in the temple was opened; to wit, what is the unique residence of God himself.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was opened - </b>Was thrown open to the viewer John, so that he was permitted to look, as it were, upon the very dwelling-place of God. From his holy presence now came forth the angels to execute his purposes of judgment on that anti-Christian power which had so long corrupted religion and oppressed the world.</p>
