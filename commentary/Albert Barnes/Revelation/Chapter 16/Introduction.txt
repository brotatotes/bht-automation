<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">The previous chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1-8">Revelation 15:1-8</span> had described the preparation for the last plagues that were to come upon that mighty anti-Christian power to which this series of prophetic visions refers. All is now ready; and this chapter contains the description of those seven last “plagues” under which this power would reel and fall. These “plagues” are described as if they were a succession of physical calamities that would come upon this anti-Christian power, and bring it to an end; though perhaps it is not necessary to look for a literal infliction of such calamities. The course of the exposition thus far will lead us to regard this chapter as a description of the successive blows by which the papacy will fall. A part of this is still undoubtedly future, though perhaps not far distant; and, in reference to this, and to some portions of the remainder of the book, there may be more difficulty in satisfying the mind than in the portions which pertain to past events.</p>
<p style=" ">The chapter comprises statements on the following points:</p>
<p style=" ">A command is issued from the temple to the seven angels, to go and execute the commission with which they were entrusted, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:1">Revelation 16:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The first angel pours out his vial upon the earth followed by a plague upon those who had worshipped the beast and his image, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The second angel pours out his vial upon the sea - followed by the death of all that were in the sea, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:3">Revelation 16:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The third angel pours out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters, and they become blood. This is followed by an ascription of praise from the angel of the waters, because God had given to those who had shed the blood of the saints blood to drink, with a response from the altar that this was just, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:4-7">Revelation 16:4-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The fourth angel pours out his vial upon the sun, and an intenser heat is given to it to scorch people. The consequence is, that they blaspheme the name of God, but repent not of their sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:8-9">Revelation 16:8-9</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The fifth angel pours out his vial upon the very seat of the beast, and his kingdom is full of darkness. People still blaspheme the name of God and repent not of their sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:10-11">Revelation 16:10-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The sixth angel pours out his vial upon the great river Euphrates. The consequence is, that the waters of the river are dried up, so that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared. The writer sees also, in this connection, three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, that go forth into all the earth to gather all nations to the great day of the battle of God Almighty, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:12-16">Revelation 16:12-16</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The seventh angel pours out his vial into the air, and a voice is heard answering that “it is done:” the time of the consummation has come - the formidable anti-Christian power is to come to an end. The great city is divided into three parts; the cities of the nations fall; great Babylon thus comes up in remembrance before God to receive the punishment which is her due. This terrific scene is accompanied with voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake, and with great hail - a tempest of wrath beating upon that formidable power that had so long stood up against God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17-21">Revelation 16:17-21</span>. The detail of the actual destruction of this power is carried forward in the subsequent chapters.</p>
