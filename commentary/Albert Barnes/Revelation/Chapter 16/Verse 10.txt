<p style=" "><b>And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast - </b>The previous judgments had been preparatory to this. They all had a bearing on this, and were all preliminary to it; but the “seat” - the home, the center of the power of the beast - had not yet been reached. Here, however, there was a direct blow aimed at that power, still not such yet as to secure its final overthrow, for that is reserved for the pouring out of the last vial, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17-21">Revelation 16:17-21</span>. All that is represented here is a heavy judgment which was merely preliminary to to that final overthrow, but which affected the very seat of the beast. The phrase “the seat of the beast” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὸν θρόνον τοῦ θηρίου</span></span> ton thronon tou thēriou - means the “seat” or “throne” which the representative of that power occupied, the central point of the Anti-christian dominion. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</span>. I understand this as referring to the very seat of the papal power - Rome - the Vatican.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his kingdom was full of darkness - </b>Confusion - disorder - distress, for darkness is often the emblem of calamity, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:9-10">Isaiah 59:9-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:16">Jeremiah 13:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+30:18">Ezekiel 30:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:7-8">Ezekiel 32:7-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:12">Ezekiel 34:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:2">Joel 2:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they gnawed their tongues for pain - </b>This is a “most significant expression of the writhings of anguish.” The word rendered here “gnawed” does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, nor is the expression elsewhere used in the Bible; but its meaning is plain - it indicates deep anguish.</p>
