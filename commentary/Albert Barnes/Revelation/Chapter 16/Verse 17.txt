And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air - This introduces the final catastrophe in regard to the “beast” - his complete and utter overthrow, accompanied with tremendous judgments. Why the vial was poured into the air is not stated. The most probable supposition as to the idea intended to be represented is, that, as storms and tempests seem to be engendered in the air, so this destruction would come from some supernatural cause, as if the whole atmosphere should be filled with wind and storm; and a furious and desolating whirlwind should be aroused by some invisible power.And there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven - The voice of God. See the notes on Revelation 11:19.From the throne - See the notes on Revelation 4:2. This shows that it was the voice of God, and not the voice of an angel.Saying, It is done - The series of judgments is about to be completed; the dominion of the beast is about to come to an end forever. The meaning here is, that that destruction was so certain, that it might be spoken of as now actually accomplished.
