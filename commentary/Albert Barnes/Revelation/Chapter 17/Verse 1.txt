<p style=" "><b>And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7">Revelation 15:7</span>. Reference is again made to these angels in the same manner in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>, where one of them says that he would show to John “the bride, the Lamb’s wife.” No particular one is specified. The general idea seems to be, that to those seven angels was entrusted the execution of the last things, or the winding up of affairs introductory to the reign of God, and that the communications respecting those last events were properly made through them. It is clearly quite immaterial by which of these it is done. The expression “which had the seven vials,” would seem to imply that though they had emptied the vials in the manner stated in the previous chapter, they still retained them in their hands.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And talked with me - </b>Spake to me. The word “talk” would imply a more protracted conversation than occurred here.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Come hither - </b>Greek, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεῦρο</span></span> deuro - “Here, hither.” This is a word merely calling the attention, as we should say now, “Here.” It does not imply that John was to leave the place where he was.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I will shew unto thee - </b>Partly by symbols, and partly by express statements; for this is the way in which, in fact, he showed him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The judgment - </b>The condemnation and calamity that will come upon her.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the great whore - </b>It is not uncommon in the Scriptures to represent a city under the image of a woman - a pure and holy city under the image of a virgin or chaste female; a corrupt, idolatrous, and wicked city under the image of an abandoned or lewd woman. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:21">Isaiah 1:21</span>; “How is the faithful city become an harlot!” Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:8">Isaiah 1:8</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:18">Revelation 17:18</span>, it is expressly said that “this woman is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth” - that is, as I suppose, papal Rome; and the design here is to represent it as resembling an abandoned female - fit representative of an apostate, corrupt, unfaithful church. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:21">Revelation 9:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That sitteth upon many waters - </b>An image drawn either from Babylon, situated on the Euphrates, and encompassed by the many artificial rivers which had been made to irrigate the country, or Rome, situated on the Tiber. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span> these waters are said to represent the peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues over which the government symbolized by the woman ruled. See the notes on that verse. Waters are often used to symbolize nations.</p>
