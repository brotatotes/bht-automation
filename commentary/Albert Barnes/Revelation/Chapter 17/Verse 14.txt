<p style=" "><b>These shall make war with the Lamb - </b>The Lamb of God - the Lord Jesus (See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>); that is, they would combine with the papacy in opposing evangelical religion. It is not meant that they would openly and avowedly proclaim war against the Son of God, but that they would practically do this in sustaining a persecuting power. It is unnecessary to show how true this has been in history; how entirely they sustained the papacy in all its measures of persecution.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the Lamb shall overcome them - </b>Shall ultimately gain the victory over them. The meaning is, that they would not be able to extinguish the true religion. In spite of all opposition and persecution, that would still live in the world, until it would be said that a complete triumph was gained.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For he is Lord of lords, and King of kings - </b>He has supreme power over all the earth, and all kings and princes are subject to his control. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they that are with him - </b>The reference is to the persecuted saints who have adhered to him as his faithful followers in all these protracted conflicts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are called - </b>That is, called by him to be his followers; as if he had selected them out of the world to maintain his cause. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And chosen - </b>See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span> note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span> note. In their steadfast adherence to the truth, they had shown that they were truly chosen by the Saviour, and could be relied on in the warfare against the powers of evil.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And faithful - </b>They had shown themselves faithful to him in times of persecution, and in the hour of darkness.</p>
