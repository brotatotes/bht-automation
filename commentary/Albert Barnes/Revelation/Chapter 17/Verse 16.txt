<p style=" "><b>And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span>. The ten powers or kingdoms represented by those horns. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12">Revelation 17:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>These shall hate the whore - </b>There seems to be some incongruity between this statement and what was previously made. In the former <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12-14">Revelation 17:12-14</span>, these ten governments are represented as in alliance with the beast; as “giving all their power and strength” unto it; and as uniting with it in making war with the Lamb. What is here said must, therefore, refer to some subsequent period, indicating some great change in their feelings and policy. We have seen the evidence of the fulfillment of the former statements. This statement will be accomplished if these same powers, represented by the ten horns, that were formerly in alliance with the papacy, shall become its enemy, and contribute to its final overthrow. That is, it will be accomplished if the nations of Europe, embraced within the limits of those ten kingdoms, shall become hostile to the papacy, and shall combine for its overthrow. Is anything more probable than this? France (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:0">Revelation 16:0</span>) has already struck more than one heavy blow on that power; England has been detached from it; many of the states of Italy are weary of it, and are ready to rise up against it; and nothing is more probable than that Spain, Portugal, France, Lombardy, and the papal States themselves, will yet throw off the yoke forever, and put an end to a power that has so long ruled over people. It was with the utmost difficulty, in 1848, that the papal power was sustained, and this was done only by foreign swords; the papacy could not probably be protected in another such outbreak. And this passage leads us to anticipate that the period will come - and that probably not far in the future - when those powers that have for so many ages sustained the papacy will become its determined foes, and will rise in their might and bring it forever to an end.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And shall make her desolate and naked - </b>Strip her of all her power and all her attractiveness. That is, applied to papal Rome, all that is so gorgeous and alluring - her wealth, and pomp, and splendor - shall be taken away, and she will be seen as she is, without anything to dazzle the eye or to blind the mind.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And shall eat her flesh - </b>Shall completely destroy her - as if her flesh were consumed. Perhaps the image is taken from the practice of cannibals eating the flesh of their enemies slain in battle. If so, nothing could give a more impressive idea of the utter destruction of this formidable power, or of the feelings of those by whom its end would be brought about.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And burn her with fire - </b>Another image of total destruction. Perhaps the meaning may be, that after her flesh was eaten, such parts of her as remained would be thrown into the fire and consumed. If this be the meaning, the image is a very impressive one to denote absolute and total destruction.
