<p style=" "><b>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication - </b>Spiritual adultery. The meaning is, that papal Rome, unfaithful to God, and idolatrous and corrupt, had seduced the rulers of the earth, and led them into the same kind of unfaithfulness, idolatry, and corruption. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:8-9">Jeremiah 3:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+5:7">Jeremiah 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:27">Jeremiah 13:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:14">Jeremiah 23:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:32">Ezekiel 16:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+23:37">Ezekiel 23:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>. How true this is in history need not be stated. All the princes and kings of Europe in the dark ages, and for many centuries were, and not a few of them are now, entirely under the influence of papal Rome.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication - </b>The alluring cup which, as an harlot, she had extended to them. See this image explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>. There it is said that Babylon - referring to the same thing - had “made them drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication”; that is, of the cup that led to wrath or punishment. Here it is said that the harlot had made them “drunk with the wine of her fornication”; that is, they had been, as it were, intoxicated by the alluring cup held out to them. What could better describe the influence of Rome on the people of the world, in making them, under these delusions, incapable of sober judgment, and in completely fascinating and controlling all their powers?</p>
