<p style=" "><b>And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour - </b>On the nature of the scarlet color, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span>. The purple color - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορφύρα</span></span> porphura - was obtained from a species of shellfish found on the coasts of the Mediterranean, which yielded a reddish-purple dye, much prized by the ancients. Robes dyed in that color were commonly worn by persons of rank and wealth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:20">Mark 15:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:19">Luke 16:19</span>. The purple color contains more blue than the crimson, though the limits are not very accurately defined, and the words are sometimes interchanged. Thus the mock robe put on the Saviour is called in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:20">Mark 15:20</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορφύραν</span></span> porphuran - “purple,” and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:28">Matthew 27:28</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοκκίνην</span></span> kokkinēn - “crimson.” On the applicability of this to the papacy, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And decked with gold - </b>After the manner of an harlot, with rich jewelry.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And precious stones - </b>Sparkling diamonds, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And pearls - </b>Also a much-valued female ornament. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:46">Matthew 13:46</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having a golden cup in her hand - </b>As if to entice lovers. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Full of abominations - </b>Of abominable things; of things suited to excite abhorrence and disgust; things unlawful and forbidden. The word, in the Scriptures, is commonly used to denote the impurities and abominations of idolatry. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:27">Daniel 9:27</span>. The meaning here is, that it seemed to be a cup filled with wine, but it was in fact a cup full of all abominable drugs, leading to all kinds of corruption. How much in accordance this is with the fascinations of the papacy, it is not necessary now to say, after the ample illustrations of the same thing already furnished in these notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And filthiness of her fornication - </b>The image here is that of papal Rome, represented as an abandoned woman in gorgeous attire, alluring by her arts the nations of the earth, and seducing them into all kinds of pollution and abomination. It is a most remarkable fact that the papacy, as if designing to furnish a fulfillment of this prophecy, has chosen to represent itself almost precisely in this manner - as a female extending an alluring cup to passers by - as will be seen by the engraving on this page. Far as the design of striking this medal may have been from confirming this portion of the Book of Revelation, yet no one can fail to see that if this had been the design, no more happy illustration could have been adopted. Apostate churches, and guilty nations, often furnish the very proofs necessary to confirm the truth of the Scriptures.</p>
