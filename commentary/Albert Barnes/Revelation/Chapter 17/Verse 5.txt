<p style=" "><b>And upon her forehead - </b>In a circlet around her forehead. That is, it was made prominent and public, as if written on the forehead in blazing capitals. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span> it is said that “the name of blasphemy” was written on the “heads” of the beast. The meaning in both places is substantially the same, that it was prominent, and unmistakable. See the notes on that verse. Compare the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was a name written - </b>A title, or something that would properly indicate her character.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Mystery - </b>It is proper to remark that there is nothing in the original as written by John, so far as now known, that corresponded with what is implied in placing this inscription in capital letters; and the same remark may be made of the “title” or inscription that was placed over the head of the Saviour on the cross, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:37">Matthew 27:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:26">Mark 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:38">Luke 23:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:19">John 19:19</span>. Our translators have adopted this form, apparently for the sole purpose of denoting that it was an inscription or title. On the meaning of the word “mystery,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>. Here it seems to be used to denote that there was something hidden, obscure, or enigmatical, under the title adopted; that is, the word “Babylon,” and the word “mother,” were symbolical. Our translators have printed and pointed the word “mystery” as if it were part of the inscription. It would probably be better to regard it as referring to the inscription, thus: “a name was written - a mysterious name, to wit, Babylon,” etc. Or, “a name was written mysteriously.” According to this, it would mean, not that there was any wonderful “mystery” about the thing itself, whatever might be true on that point, but that the name was enigmatical or symbolical; or that there was something hidden or concealed under the name. It was not to be literally understood.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Babylon the great - </b>papal Rome, the nominal head of the Christian world, as Babylon had been of the pagan world. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The mother of harlots - </b> </p>
<p style=" "><b>And abominations of the earth - </b>Abominable things that prevail on the earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span>. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20-21">Revelation 9:20-21</span>.</p>
