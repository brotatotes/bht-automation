<p style=" "><b>And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints - </b>A reeling, intoxicated harlot, for that is the image which is kept up all along. In regard to the phrase “drunken with blood,” compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+46:10">Jeremiah 46:10</span>. “The phraseology is derived from the barbarous custom (still extant among many pagan nations) of drinking the blood of the enemies slain in the way of revenge. The effect of drinking blood is said to be to exasperate, and to intoxicate with passion and a desire of revenge” (Prof. Stuart, in loco). The meaning here is, that the persecuting power referred to had shed the blood of the saints; and that, in its fury, it had, as it were, drunk the blood of the slain, and had become, by drinking that blood, intoxicated and infuriated. No one need say how applicable this has been to the papacy. Compare, however, the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:21">Daniel 7:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:13-14">Revelation 12:13-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:15">Revelation 13:15</span> notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus - </b>Especially with their blood. The meaning is, that the warfare, in which so much blood was shed, was directed against the saints as such, and that, in fact, it terminated particularly on those who, amidst cruel sufferings, were faithful witnesses for the Lord Jesus, and deserved to be called, by way of eminence, “martyrs.” Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:5">Revelation 11:5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span>. How applicable this is to the papacy, let the blood shed in the valleys of Piedmont; the blood shed in the Low Countries by the Duke of Alva; the blood shed on Bartholomew’s day; and the blood shed in the Inquisition, testify.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration - </b>I was astonished at her appearance, at her apparel, and at the things which were so significantly symbolized by her.</p>
