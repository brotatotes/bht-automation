<p style=" "><b>And here is the mind which hath wisdom - </b>Here is what requires wisdom to interpret it; or, here is a case in which the mind that shows itself able to explain it will evince true sagacity. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>. See the notes on that place. Prof. Stuart renders this, “Here is a meaning which compriseth wisdom.” It is undoubtedly implied that the symbol might be understood - whether in the time of John, or afterward, he does not say; but it was a matter which could not be determined by ordinary minds, or without an earnest application of the understanding.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The seven heads are seven mountains - </b>Referring, undoubtedly, to Rome - the seven-hilled city - Septicollis Roma. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>. (d).</p>
<p style=" "><b>On which the woman sitteth - </b>The city represented as a woman, in accordance with a common usage in the Scriptures. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:8">Isaiah 1:8</span>.</p>
