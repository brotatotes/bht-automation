<p style=" "><b>And after these things - </b>After the vision referred to in the previous chapter.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I saw another angel come down from heaven - </b>Different from the one that had last appeared, and therefore coming to make a new communication to him. It is not unusual in this book that different communications should be entrusted to different angels. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8-9">Revelation 14:8-9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:15">Revelation 14:15</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17-18">Revelation 14:17-18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having great power - </b>That is, he was one of the higher rank or order of angels.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the earth was lightened with his glory - </b>The usual representation respecting the heavenly beings. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:16">Exodus 24:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:3">Acts 9:3</span>. This would, of course, add greatly to the magnificence of the scene.</p>
