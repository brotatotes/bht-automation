And the fruits that thy soul lusted after - Literally, “the fruits of the desire of thy soul.” The word rendered “fruits” - ὀπώρα opōra - properly means, “late summer; dog-days,” the time when Sirius, or the Dog-star, is predominant. In the East this is the season when the fruits ripen, and hence the word comes to denote fruit. The reference is to any kind of fruit that would be brought for traffic into a great city, and that would be regarded as an article of luxury.Are departed from thee - That is, they are no more brought for sale into the city.And all things which were dainty and goodly - These words “characterize all kinds of furniture and clothing which were gilt, or plated, or embroidered, and therefore were bright or splendid” (Prof. Stuart).And thou shalt find them no more at all - The address here is decidedly to the city itself. The meaning is, that they would no more be found there.
