<p style=" "><b>For in one hour - </b>In a very brief period - so short, that it seemed to them to be but one hour. In the prediction <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:8">Revelation 18:8</span>, it is said that it would be “in one day” (see the notes on that place); here it is said that, to the on-lookers, it seemed to be but an hour. There is no inconsistency, therefore, between the two statements.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So great riches is come to nought - </b>All the accumulated wealth of so great and rich a city. This should have been united with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:16">Revelation 18:16</span>, as it is a part of the lamentation of the merchants, and as the lamentation of the mariners commences in the other part of the verse. It is so divided in the Greek Testaments.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And every ship-master - </b>This introduces the lamentation of the mariners, who would, of course, be deeply interested in the destruction of a city with which they had been accustomed to trade, and by carrying merchandise to which they had been enriched. The word “ship-master” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυβερνήτης</span></span> kubernētēs - means, properly, a “governor”; then a governor of a ship - the “steersman” or “pilot,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:11">Acts 27:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And all the company in ships - </b>Prof. Stuart renders this “coasters.” There is here, however, an important difference in the reading of the text. The commonly received text is, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πᾶς ἐπὶ τῶν πλοίων ὁ ὅμιλος</span></span> pas epi tōn ploiōn ho homilos - “the whole company in ships,” as in our common version; the reading which is now commonly adopted, and which is found in Griesbach, Hahn, and Tittmann, is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὁ ἐπὶ τόπον πλέων</span></span> ho epi topon pleōn - “he who sails to a place”; that is, he who sails from one place to another along the coast, or who does not venture out far to sea; and thus the phrase would denote a secondary class of sea-captains or officers - those less venturesome, or experienced, or bold than others. There can be little doubt that this is the correct reading (compare Wetatein, in loco); and hence the class of seamen here referred to is “coasters.” Such seamen would naturally be employed where there was a great and luxurious maritime city, and would have a deep interest in its fall.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And sailors - </b>Common seamen.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And as many as trade by sea - </b>In any kind of craft, whether employed in a near or a remote trade.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Stood afar off - </b>notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:10">Revelation 18:10</span>.</p>
