See the notes on Job 2:12.By reason of her costliness - The word rendered “costliness” - τιμιότητος timiotētos - means, properly, “preciousness, costliness”; their magnificence, costly merchandise. The luxury of a great city enriches many individuals, however much it may impoverish itself.For in one hour is she made desolate - So it seemed to them. See the notes on Revelation 18:17.
