<p style=" "><b>And he cried mightily - </b>Literally, “he cried with a strong great voice.” See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:3">Revelation 10:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>. The proclamation here is substantially the same as in that place, and no doubt the same thing is referred to.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And is become the habitation of devils - </b>Of demons - in allusion to the common opinion that the demons inhabited abandoned cities, old ruins, and deserts. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:43-45">Matthew 12:43-45</span>. The language here is taken from the description of Babylon in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:20-22">Isaiah 13:20-22</span>; and for a full illustration of the meaning, see the notes on that passage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the hold of every foul spirit - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλακὴ</span></span> phulakē. A watch-post, station, haunt of such spirits - That is, they, as it were, kept guard there; were stationed there; haunted the place.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And a cage of every unclean and hateful bird - </b>That is, they would resort there, and abide there as in a cage. The word translated “cage” is the same which is rendered “hold” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλακὴ</span></span> phulakē. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:21">Isaiah 13:21</span>, it is said, “and owls shall dwell there”; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:23">Isaiah 14:23</span>, it is said that it would be a “possession for the bittern.” The idea is that of utter desolation; and the meaning here is, that spiritual Babylon - papal Rome <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span> - will be reduced to a state of utter desolation resembling that of the real Babylon. It is not necessary to suppose this of the city of Rome itself - for that is not the object of the representation. It is the papacy, represented under the image of the city, and having its seat there. That is to be destroyed as utterly as was Babylon of old; that will become as odious, and loathsome, and detestable as the literal Babylon, the abode of monsters is.</p>
