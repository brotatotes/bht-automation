<p style=" "><b>And the voice of harpers - </b>Those who play on the harp. This was usually accompanied with singing. The idea, in this verse and the following, is substantially the same as in the previous parts of the chapter, that the mystical Babylon - papal Rome - would be brought to utter desolation. This thought is here exhibited under another form - that all which constituted festivity, joy, and amusement, and all that indicated thrift and prosperity, would disappear. Of course, in a great and “fun” city, there would be all kinds of music; and when it is said that this would be heard there no more it is a most striking image of utter desolation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And musicians - </b>Musicians in general; but perhaps here singers, as distinguished from those who played on instruments.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of pipers - </b>Those who played on pipes or flutes. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:7">1 Corinthians 14:7</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:17">Matthew 11:17</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And trumpeters - </b>Trumpets were common instruments of music, employed on festival occasions, in war, and in worship. Only the principal instruments of music are mentioned here, as representatives of the rest. The general idea is, that the sound of music, as an indication of festivity and joy, would cease.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be heard no more at all in thee - </b>It would become utterly and permanently desolate.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And no craftsman, of whatsoever craft - </b>That is, artificers of all kinds would cease to ply their trades there. The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεχνίτης</span></span> technitēs - would include all artisans or mechanics, all who were engaged in any kind of trade or craft. The meaning here is, that all these would disappear, an image, of course, of utter decay.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more - </b>Taylor (Frag. to Calmet, Dictionary vol. iv. p. 346) supposes that this may refer not so much to the rattle of the mill as to the voice of singing, which usually accompanied grinding. The sound of a mill is cheerful, and indicates prosperity; its ceasing is an image of decline.</p>
