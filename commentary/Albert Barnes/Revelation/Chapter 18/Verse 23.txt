<p style=" "><b>And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee - </b>Another image of desolation, as if every light were put out, and there were total darkness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee - </b>The merry and cheerful voice of the marriage procession in the streets (notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1-7">Matthew 25:1-7</span>), or the cheerful, glad voice of the newly-married couple in their own dwelling (notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>).</p>
<p style=" "><b>For thy merchants were the great men of the earth - </b>Those who dealt with thee were the rich, and among them were even nobles and princes; and now that they trade with thee no more there is occasion for lamentation and sorrow. The contrast is great between the time when distinguished foreigners crowded thy marts, and now, when none of any kind come to traffic with thee. The origin of this representation is probably the description of Tyre in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+27:0">Ezekiel 27:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived - </b>This is stated as a reason for the ruin that had come upon her. It is a common representation of papal Rome that she has deceived or deluded the nations of the earth (see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>), and no representation ever made accords more with facts as they have occurred. The word “sorceries” here refers to the various arts the tricks impostures, and false pretences by which this has been done. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:21">Revelation 9:21</span>.</p>
