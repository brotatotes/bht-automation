<p style=" "><b>Reward her even as she rewarded you - </b>It is not said to whom this command is addressed, but it would seem to be to those who had been persecuted and wronged. Applied to mystical Babylon - papal Rome - it would seem to be a call on the nations that had been so long under her sway, and among whom, from time to time, so much blood had been shed by her, to arise now in their might, and to inflict deserved vengeance. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:16-17">Revelation 17:16-17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And double unto her double according to her works - </b>That is, bring upon her double the amount of calamity which she has brought upon others; take ample vengeance upon her. Compare for similar language, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:2">Isaiah 40:2</span>, “She hath received of the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.” “For your shame ye shall have double,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:7">Isaiah 61:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the cup which she hath filled - </b>To bring wrath on others. See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fill to her double - </b>Let her drink abundantly of the wine of the wrath of God - double what she has dealt out to others. That is, either let the quantity administered to her be doubled, or let the ingredients in the cup be doubled in intensity.</p>
