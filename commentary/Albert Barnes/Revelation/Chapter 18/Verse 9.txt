<p style=" "><b>And the kings of the earth - </b>This verse commences the description of the lamentation over the fall of the mystical Babylon (see the Analysis of the chapter).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who have committed fornication - </b>That is, who have been seduced by her from the true God, and have been led into practical idolatry. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>. The kings of the earth seem to be represented as among the chief mourners, because they had derived important aid from the power which was now to be reduced to ruin. As a matter of fact, the kings of Europe have owed much of their influence and power to the support which has been derived from the papacy, and when that power shall fall, there will fall much that has contributed to sustain oppressive and arbitrary governments, and that has prevented the extension of popular liberty. In fact, Europe might have been long since free, if it had not been for the support which despotic governments have derived from the papacy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And lived deliciously with her - </b>In the same kind of luxury and dissoluteness of manners. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3">Revelation 18:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:7">Revelation 18:7</span>. The courts of Europe, under the papacy, have had the same general character for dissoluteness and licentiousness as Rome itself. The same views of religion produce the same effects everywhere.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall bewail her, and lament for her - </b>Because their ally is destroyed, and the source of their power is taken away. The fall of the papacy will be the signal for a general overturning of the thrones of Europe.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When they shall see the smoke of her burning - </b>When they shall see her on fire, and her smoke ascending toward heaven. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:11">Revelation 14:11</span>.</p>
