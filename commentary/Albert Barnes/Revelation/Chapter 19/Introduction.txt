The chapter consists of the following parts:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> I. A hymn of the heavenly hosts in view of the destruction of the mystical Babylon, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1-7">Revelation 19:1-7</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (e)The mighty shout of Hallelujah is echoed and repeated from unnumbered hosts, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:6-7">Revelation 19:6-7</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> II. The marriage of the Lamb, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:8-9">Revelation 19:8-9</span>. The Lamb of God is united to his bride - the church - never more to be separated; and after all the persecutions, conflicts, and embarrassments which had existed, this long-desired union is consummated, and the glorious triumph of the church is described under the image of a joyous wedding ceremony.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> III. John is so overcome with this representation, that in his transports of feeling he prostrates himself before the angel who shows him all this, ready to worship one who discloses such bright and glorious scenes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>. He is gently rebuked for allowing himself to be so overcome that he would render divine homage to any creature, and is told that he who communicates this to him is but a fellow-servant, and that God only is to be worshipped.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> IV. The final conquest over the beast and the false prophet, and the subjugation of all the foes of the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11-21">Revelation 19:11-21</span>;</p>
