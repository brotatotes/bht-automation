Analysis Of The ChapterThis chapter Revelation 19:0, as well as the last Revelation 18:0, is an episode, delaying the final catastrophe, and describing more fully the effect of the destruction of the mystical Babylon. The chapter consists of the following parts: I. A hymn of the heavenly hosts in view of the destruction of the mystical Babylon, Revelation 19:1-7; (e)The mighty shout of Hallelujah is echoed and repeated from unnumbered hosts, Revelation 19:6-7. II. The marriage of the Lamb, Revelation 19:8-9. The Lamb of God is united to his bride - the church - never more to be separated; and after all the persecutions, conflicts, and embarrassments which had existed, this long-desired union is consummated, and the glorious triumph of the church is described under the image of a joyous wedding ceremony.

IV. The final conquest over the beast and the false prophet, and the subjugation of all the foes of the church, Revelation 19:11-21;
