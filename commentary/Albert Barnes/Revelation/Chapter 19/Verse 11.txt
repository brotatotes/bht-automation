<p style=" "><b>And I saw heaven opened - </b>He saw a new vision, as if an opening were made through the sky, and he was permitted to look into heaven. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And behold, a white horse - </b>On the white horse as a symbol, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>. He is here the symbol of the final victory that is to be obtained over the beast and the false prophet <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>, and of the final triumph of the church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True - </b>He is not designated here by his usual and real name, but by his attributes. There can be no doubt that the Messiah is intended, as he goes forth to the subjugation of the world to himself. The attributes here referred to - faithful and true - are especially appropriate, for they are not only strongly marked attributes of his character, but they would be particularly manifested in the events that are described. He would thus show that he was faithful - or worthy of the confidence of his church in delivering it from all its enemies; and true to all the promises that he has made to it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And in righteousness he doth judge - </b>All his acts of judgment in determining the destiny of people are righteous. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:3-5">Isaiah 11:3-5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And make war - </b>That is, the war which he wages is not a war of ambition; it is not for the mere purpose of conquest; it is to save the righteous, and to punish the wicked.</p>
