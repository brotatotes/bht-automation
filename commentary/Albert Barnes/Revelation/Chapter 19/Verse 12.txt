<p style=" "><b>His eyes were as a flame of fire - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:14">Revelation 1:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And on his head were many crowns - </b>Many diadems, indicative of his universal reign. It is not said how these were worn or arranged on his head - perhaps the various diadems worn by kings were in some way wreathed into one.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he had a name written - </b>That is, probably on the frontlet of this compound diadem. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>.</p>

This cannot here mean that no one could read the name, but the idea is, that no one but himself could fully understand its import. It involved a depth of meaning, and a degree of sacredness, and a relation to the Father, which he alone could apprehend in its true import. This is true of the name here designated - “the Word of God” - the “Logos” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λόγος</span></span> Logos; and it is true of all the names which he bears. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>.
