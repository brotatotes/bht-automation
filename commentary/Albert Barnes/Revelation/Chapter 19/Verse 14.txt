<p style=" "><b>And the armies which were in heaven followed him - </b>The heavenly hosts; particularly, it would seem, the redeemed, as there would be some incongruity in representing the angels as riding in this manner. Doubtless the original of this picture is <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:3">Isaiah 63:3</span>; “I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the people there was none with me.” These hosts of the redeemed on white horses accompany him to be witnesses of his victory, and to participate in the joy of the triumph, not to engage in the work of blood.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Upon white horses - </b>Emblems of triumph or victory. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Clothed in fine linen, white and clean - </b>The usual raiment of those who are in heaven, as everywhere represented in this book.
