<p style=" "><b>And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>. In that place the sword seems to be an emblem of his words or doctrines, as penetrating the hearts of people; here it is the emblem of a work of destruction worked on his foes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That with it he should smite the nations - </b>The nations that were opposed to him; to wit, those especially who were represented by the beast and the false prophet, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:18-20">Revelation 19:18-20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:5">Revelation 12:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God - </b>This language is probably derived from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:1-4">Isaiah 63:1-4</span>. See it explained in the notes on that place, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:19-20">Revelation 14:19-20</span>. It means here that his enemies would be certainly crushed before him - as grapes are crushed under the feet of him that treads in the winevat.</p>
