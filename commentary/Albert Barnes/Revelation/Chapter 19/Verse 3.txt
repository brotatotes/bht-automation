And again they said, Alleluia - See the notes on Revelation 19:1. The event was so glorious and so important; the final destruction of the great enemy of the church was of so much moment in its bearing on the welfare of the world, as to call forth repeated expressions of praise.And her smoke rose up forever and ever - See the notes on Revelation 14:11. This is an image of final ruin; the image being derived probably from the description in Genesis of the smoke that ascended from the cities of the plain, Genesis 19:28. On the joy expressed here in her destruction, compare the notes on Revelation 18:20.
