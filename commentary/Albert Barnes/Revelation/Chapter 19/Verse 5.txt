And a voice came out of the throne - A voice seemed to come from the very midst of the throne. It is not said by whom this voice was uttered. It cannot be supposed, however, that it was uttered by God himself, for the command which it gave was this: “Praise our God,” etc. For the same reason it seems hardly probable that it was the voice of the Messiah, unless it be supposed that he here identifies himself with the redeemed church, and speaks of God as his God and hers. It would seem rather that it was a responsive voice that came from those nearest the throne, calling on all to unite in praising God in view of what was done. The meaning then will be, that all heaven was interested in the triumph of the church, and that one portion of the dwellers there called on the others to unite in offering thanksgiving.Praise our God - The God that we worship.All ye his servants - All in heaven and earth; all have occasion for thankfulness.And ye that fear him - That reverence and obey him. The fear of the Lord is a common expression in the Scriptures to denote true piety.Both small and great - All of every class and condition - poor and rich - young and old; those of humble and those of exalted rank. Compare Psalms 148:7-13.
