<p style=" "><b>Let us be glad and rejoice - </b>Let all in heaven rejoice - for all have an interest in the triumph of truth; all should be glad that the government of God is set up over an apostate world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And give honour to him - </b>Because the work is glorious; and became it is by his power alone that it has been accomplished. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the marriage of the Lamb is come - </b>Of the Lamb of God - the Redeemer of the world. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. The relation of God, and especially of the Messiah, to the church, is often in the Scriptures represented under the image of marriage. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:4-6">Isaiah 54:4-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:4-5">Isaiah 62:4-5</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:23-33">Ephesians 5:23-33</span> note. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:14">Jeremiah 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:32">Jeremiah 31:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:19-20">Hosea 2:19-20</span>. The idea is also said to be common in Arabic and Persian poetry. It is to be remembered, also, that papal Rome has just been represented as a frivolous and meretricious woman; and there is a propriety, therefore, in representing the true church as a pure bride, the Lambâ€™s wife, and the final triumph of that church as a joyous marriage. The meaning is, that the church was now to triumph and rejoice as if in permanent union with her glorious head and Lord.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his wife hath made herself ready - </b>By putting on her beautiful apparel and ornaments. All the preparations had been made for a permanent and uninterrupted union with its Redeemer, and the church was henceforward to be recognized as his beautiful bride, and was no more to appear as a decorated harlot - as it had during the papal supremacy. Between the church under the papacy, and the church in its true form, there is all the difference which there is between an abandoned woman gaily decked with gold and jewels, and a pure virgin chastely and modestly adorned, about to be led to be united in bonds of love to a virtuous husband,</p>
