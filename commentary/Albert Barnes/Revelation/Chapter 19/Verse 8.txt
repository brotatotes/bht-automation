<p style=" "><b>And to her was granted - </b>It is not said here by whom this was granted, but it is perhaps implied that this was conferred by the Saviour himself on his bride.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:4-5">Revelation 3:4-5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:18">Revelation 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:13">Revelation 7:13</span>. White has, perhaps, in all countries been the usual color of the bridal dress - as an emblem of innocence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints - </b>Represents the righteousness of the saints; or is an emblem of it. It should be remarked, however, that it is implied here, as it is everywhere in the Scriptures, that this is not their own righteousness, for it is said that this was “given” to the bride - to the saints. It is the gracious bestowment of their Lord; and the reference here must be to that righteousness which they obtain by faith - the righteousness which results from justification through the merits of the Redeemer. Of this Paul speaks, when he says <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:9">Philippians 3:9</span>, “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but what is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.” Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25-26">Romans 3:25-26</span>.</p>
