<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:0">Revelation 2:0</span> comprises four of the seven epistles addressed to the seven churches; those addressed to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, and Thyatira. A particular view of the contents of the epistles will be more appropriate as they come separately to be considered, than in this place. There are some general remarks in regard to their structure, however, which may be properly made here:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) They all begin with a reference to some of the attributes of the Saviour, in general some attribute that had been noted in the first chapter; and while they are all adapted to make a deep impression on the mind, perhaps each one was selected in such a way as to have a special propriety in reference to each particular church. Thus, in the address to the church at Ephesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span>, the allusion is to the fact that he who speaks to them “holds the seven stars in his right hand, and walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks”; in the epistle to the church at Smyrna <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:8">Revelation 2:8</span>, it is he who “is the first and the last, who was dead and is alive”; in the epistle to the church at Pergamos <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:12">Revelation 2:12</span>, it is he “which hath the sharp sword with the two edges”; in the epistle to the church at Thyatira <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:18">Revelation 2:18</span>, it is “the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass”; in the epistle to the church at Sardis <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>, it is he who “hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars”; in the epistle to the church at Philadelphia <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>, it is “he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth”; in the epistle to the church at Laodicea <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>, it is he who is the “Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.”</p>
<p style=" ">(2) These introductions are followed with the formula, “I know thy works.” The special characteristics, then, of each church are referred to, with a sentiment of approbation or disapprobation expressed in regard to their conduct. Of two of the churches, that at Smyrna <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:9">Revelation 2:9</span>, and that at Philadelphia <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>, he expresses his entire approbation; to the churches of Sardis <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:3">Revelation 3:3</span>, and Laodicea <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:15-18">Revelation 3:15-18</span>, he administers a decided rebuke; to the churches of Ephesus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:3-6">Revelation 2:3-6</span>, Pergamos <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13-16">Revelation 2:13-16</span>, and Thyatira <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:19-20">Revelation 3:19-20</span>, he intermingles praise and rebuke, for he saw much to commend, but, at the same time, not a little that was reprehensible. In all cases, however, the approbation precedes the blame; showing that he was more disposed to find what was good than what was evil.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) After the statement of their characteristics, there follows in each case counsel, advice, admonition, or promises, such as their circumstances demanded - encouragement in trial, and injunctions to put away their sins. The admonitions are addressed to the churches as if Christ were - at hand, and would ere long come and sit in judgment on them and their deeds.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) There is a solemn admonition to hear what the Spirit has to say to the churches. This is in each case expressed in the same manner, “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:11">Revelation 2:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:29">Revelation 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:6">Revelation 3:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:13">Revelation 3:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:22">Revelation 3:22</span>. These admonitions were designed to call the attention of the churches to these things, and, at the same time, they seemed designed to show that they were not intended for them alone. They are addressed to anyone who “has an ear,” and therefore had some principles of general application to others, and to which all should attend who were disposed to learn the will of the Redeemer. What was addressed to one church, at any time, would be equally applicable to all churches in the same circumstances; what was adapted to rebuke, elevate, or comfort Christians in any one age or land, would be adapted to be useful to Christians of all ages and lands.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) There then is, either following or preceding that call on all the churches to hear, some promise or assurance designed to encourage the church, and urge it forward in the discharge of duty, or in enduring trial. This is found in each one of the epistles, though not always in the same relative position.</p>
