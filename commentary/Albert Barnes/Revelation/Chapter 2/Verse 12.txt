<p style=" "><b>These things saith he which hath the sharp sword, ... - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ec+12:11">Ecclesiastes 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:2">Isaiah 49:2</span>. Prof. Stuart suggests that when the Saviour, as represented in the vision, “uttered words, as they proceeded from his mouth, the halitus which accompanied them assumed, in the view of John, the form of an igneous two-edged sword.” It is more probable, however, that the words which proceeded from his mouth did not assume anything like a form or substance, but John means to represent them as if they were a sharp sword. His words cut and penetrate deep, and it was easy to picture him as having a sword proceeding from his mouth; that is, his words were as piercing as a sharp sword. As he was about to reprove the church at Pergamos, there was a propriety in referring to this power of the Saviour. Reproof cuts deep; and this is the idea represented here.</p>
