<p style=" "><b>But I have a few things against thee - </b>As against the church at Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:4">Revelation 2:4</span>. The charge against this church, however, is somewhat different from that against the church at Ephesus. The charge there was, that they had “left their first love”; but it is spoken in commendation of them that they “hated the deeds of the Nicolaitanes,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span>. Here the charge is, that they tolerated that sect among them, and that they had among them also those who held the doctrine of Balaam. Their general course had been such that the Saviour could approve it; he did not approve, however, of their tolerating those who held to pernicious practical error - error that tended to sap the very foundation of morals.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam - </b>It is not necessary to suppose that they professedly held to the same opinion as Balaam, or openly taught the same doctrines. The meaning is, that they taught substantially the same doctrine which Balaam did, and deserved to be classed with him. What that doctrine was is stated in the subsequent part of the verse.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who taught Balac to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel - </b>The word “stumbling-block” properly means anything over which one falls or stumbles, and then anything over which anyone may fall into sin, or which becomes the occasion of one’s falling into sin. The meaning here is, that it was through the instructions of Balaam that Balak learned the way by which the Israelites might be led into sin, and might thus bring upon themselves the divine malediction. The main circumstances in the case were these:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Balak, king of Moab, when the children of Israel approached his borders, felt that he could not contend successfully against so great a host, for his people were dispirited and disheartened at their numbers, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:3-4">Numbers 22:3-4</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) In these circumstances he resolved to send for one who had a distinguished reputation as a prophet, that he might “curse” that people, or might utter a malediction over them, in order, at the same time, to ensure their destruction, and to inspirit his own people in making war on them: in accordance with a prevalent opinion of ancient times, that prophets had the power of blighting anything by their curse. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+3:8">Job 3:8</span>. For this purpose he sent messengers to Balaam to invite him to come and perform this service, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:5-6">Numbers 22:5-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Balaam professed to be a prophet of the Lord, and it was obviously proper that he should inquire of the Lord whether he should comply with this request. He did so, and was positively forbidden to go, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:12">Numbers 22:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) When the answer of Balaam was reported to Balak, he supposed that he might be prevailed to come by the offer of rewards, and he sent more distinguished messengers with an offer of ample honor if he would come, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:15-17">Numbers 22:15-17</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) Balaam was evidently strongly inclined to go, but, in accordance with his character as a prophet, he said that if Balak would give him his house full of silver and gold he could do no more, and say no more, than the Lord permitted, and he proposed again to consult the Lord, to see if he could obtain permission to go with the messengers of Balak. He obtained permission, but with the express injunction that he was only to utter what God should say; and when he came to Balak, notwithstanding his own manifest desire to comply with the wish of Balak, and notwithstanding all the offers which Balak made to him to induce him to do the contrary, he only continued to bless the Hebrew people, until, in disgust and indignation, Balak sent him away again to his own land, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:0">Numbers 22:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+23:0">Numbers 23:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:10">Numbers 24:10</span> ff.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) Balaam returned to his own house, but evidently with a desire still to gratify Balak. Being forbidden to curse the people of Israel; having been overruled in all his purposes to do it; having been, contrary to his own desires, constrained to bless them when he was himself more than willing to curse them; and having still a desire to comply with the wishes of the King of Moab, he cast about for some way in which the object might yet he accomplished - that is, in which the curse of God might in fact rest upon the Hebrew people, and they might become exposed to the divine displeasure. To do this, no way occurred so plausible, and that had such probability of success, as to lead them into idolatry, and into the sinful and corrupt practices connected with idolatry. It was, therefore, resolved to make use of the charms of the females of Moab, that through their influence the Hebrews might be drawn into licentiousness. This was done. The abominations of idolatry spread through the camp of Israel; licentiousness everywhere prevailed, and God sent a plague upon them to punish them, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:1">Numbers 25:1</span> ff. That also this was planned and instigated by Balaam is apparent from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:16">Numbers 31:16</span>; “Behold these (women) caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord, in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.” The attitude of Balaam’s mind in the matter was this:</p>
<p style=" ">I. He had a strong desire to do what he knew was wrong, and which was forbidden expressly by God.</p>
<p style=" ">II. He was restrained by internal checks and remonstrances, and prevented from doing what he wished to do.</p>
<p style=" ">III. He cast about for some way in which he might do it, notwithstanding these internal checks and remonstrances, and finally accomplished the same thing in fact, though in form different from that which he had first prepared. This is not an unfair description of what often occurs in the plans and purposes of a wicked man. The meaning in the passage before us is, that in the church at Pergamos there were those who taught, substantially, the same thing that Balaam did; that is, the tendency of whose teaching was to lead people into idolatry, and the ordinary accompaniment of idolatry - licentiousness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To eat things sacrificed unto idols - </b>Balaam taught the Hebrews to do this - perhaps in some way securing their attendance on the riotous and gluttonous feasts of idolatry celebrated among the people among whom they sojourned. Such feasts were commonly held in idol temples, and they usually led to scenes of dissipation and corruption. By plausibly teaching that there could be no harm in eating what had been offered in sacrifice - since an idol was nothing, and the flesh of animals offered in sacrifice was the same as if slaughtered for some other purpose, it would seem that these teachers at Pergamos had induced professing Christians to attend on those feasts - thus lending their countenance to idolatry, and exposing themselves to all the corruption and licentiousness that commonly attended such celebrations. See the banefulness of thus eating the meat offered in sacrifice to idols considered in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:0">1 Corinthians 8:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to commit fornication - </b>Balaam taught this; and that was the tendency of the doctrines inculcated at Pergamos. On what pretence this was done is not said; but it is clear that the church had regarded this in a lenient manner. So accustomed had the pagan world been to this vice, that many who had been converted from idolatry might be disposed to look on it with less severity than we do now, and there was a necessity of incessant watchfulness lest the members of the church should fall into it.
