<p style=" "><b>So hast thou also them ... - </b>That is, there are those among you who hold those doctrines. The meaning here may be, either that, in addition to those who held the doctrine of Balaam, they had also another class who held the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes; or that the Nicolaitanes held the same doctrine, and taught the same thing as Balaam. If but one class is referred to, and it is meant that the Nicolaitanes held the doctrines of Balaam, then we know what constituted their teaching; if two classes of false teachers are referred to, then we have no means of knowing what was the uniqueness of the teaching of the Nicolaitanes. The more natural and obvious construction, it seems to me, is to suppose that the speaker means to say that the Nicolaitanes taught the same things which Balaam did - to wit, that they led the people into corrupt and licentious practices. This interpretation seems to be demanded by the proper use of the word “so” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οὕτως</span></span> houtōs - meaning, “in this manner on this wise, thus”; and usually referring to what precedes. If this be the correct interpretation, then we have, in fact, a description of what the Nicolaitanes held, agreeing with all the accounts given of them by the ancient fathers. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span>. If this is so, also, then it is clear that the same kind of doctrines was held at Smyrna, at Pergamos, and at Thyatira <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>, though mentioned in somewhat different forms. It is not quite certain, however, that this is the correct interpretation, or that the writer does not mean to say that, in addition to those who held the doctrine of Balaam, they had also another class of errorists who held the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which thing I hate - </b>So the common Greek text - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὅ μισῶ</span></span> ho misō. But the best-supported reading, and the one adopted by Griesbach, Tittmann, and Hahn, is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὁμοίως</span></span> homoiōs - “in like manner”; that is, “as Balak retained a false prophet who misled the Hebrews, so thou retainest those who teach things like to those which Balaam taught.”</p>
