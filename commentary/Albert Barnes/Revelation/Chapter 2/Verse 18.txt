<p style=" "><b>These things saith the Son of God - </b>This is the first time, in these epistles, that the name of the speaker is referred to. In each other instance there is merely some attribute of the Saviour mentioned. Perhaps the severity of the rebuke contemplated here made it proper that there should be a more impressive reference to the authority of the speaker; and hence he is introduced as the “Son of God.” It is not a reference to him as the “Son of man “the common appellation which he gave to himself when on earth - for that might have suggested his humanity only, and would not have conveyed the same impression in regard to his authority; but it is to himself as sustaining the rank, and having the authority, of the Son of God - one who, therefore, has a right to speak, and a right to demand that what he says shall be heard.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire - </b>Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:14">Revelation 1:14</span>. Before the glance of his eye all is light, and nothing can be concealed from his view. Nothing would be better suited to inspire awe then, as nothing should be now, than such a reference to the Son of God as being able to penetrate the secret recesses of the heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his feet are like fine brass - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:15">Revelation 1:15</span>. Perhaps indicative of majesty and glory as he walked in the midst of the churches.</p>
