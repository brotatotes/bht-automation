<p style=" "><b>Because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel - </b>Thou dost tolerate, or countenance her. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14">Revelation 2:14</span>. Who the individual here referred to by the name Jezebel was, is not known. It is by no means probable that this was her real name, but seems to have been given to her as expressive of her character and influence. Jezebel was the wife of Ahab; a woman of vast influence over her husband - an influence which was uniformly exerted for evil. She was a daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre and Sidon, and lived about 918 years before Christ. She was an idolater, and induced her weak husband not only to connive at her introducing the worship of her native idols, but to become an idolater himself, and to use all the means in his power to establish the worship of idols instead of the worship of the true God. She was highly gifted, persuasive, and artful; was resolute in the accomplishment of her purposes; ambitious of extending and perpetuating her power, and unscrupulous in the means which she employed to execute her designs. See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+16:31">1 Kings 16:31</span> ff.</p>
<p style=" ">The kind of character, therefore, which would be designated by the term as used here, would be that of a woman who was artful and persuasive in her manner; who was capable of exerting a wide influence over others; who had talents of a high order; who was a thorough advocate of error; who was unscrupulous in the means which she employed for accomplishing her ends; and the tendency of whose influence was to lead the people into the abominable practices of idolatry. The opinions which she held, and the practices into which she led others, appear to have been the same which are referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14-15">Revelation 2:14-15</span> of this chapter. The difference was, that the teacher in this case was a woman - a circumstance which by no means lessened the enormity of the offence; for, besides the fact that it was contrary to the whole genius of Christianity that a woman should be a public teacher, there was a special incongruity that she should be an advocate of such abominable opinions and practices. Every sentiment of our nature makes us feel that it is right to expect that if a woman teaches at all in a public manner, she should inculcate only what is true and holy - she should be an advocate of a pure life. We are shocked; we feel that there is a violation of every principle of our nature, and an insult done to our common humanity, if it is otherwise. We have in a manner become accustomed to the fact that man should be a teacher of pollution and error, so that we do not shrink from it with horror; we never can be reconciled to the fact that a woman should.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which calleth herself a prophetess - </b>Many persons set up the claim to be prophets in the times when the gospel was first preached, and it is not improbable that many females would lay claim to such a character, after the example of Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14">Revelation 2:14</span>. Whether she herself practiced what she taught is not expressly affirmed, but seems to be implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:22">Revelation 2:22</span>. It is not often that persons teach these doctrines without practicing what they teach; and the fact that they desire and design to live in this manner will commonly account for the fact that they inculcate such views.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to eat things sacrificed unto idols - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14">Revelation 2:14</span>. The custom of attending on the festivals of idols led commonly to licentiousness, and they who were gross and sensual in their lives were fit subjects to be persuaded to attend on idol feasts - for nowhere else would they find more unlimited toleration for the indulgence of their passions.</p>
