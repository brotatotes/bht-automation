<p style=" "><b>Behold, I will cast her into a bed - </b>Not into a bed of ease, but a bed of pain. There is evidently a purpose to contrast this with her former condition. The harlot’s bed and a sick-bed are thus brought together, as they are often, in fact, in the dispensations of Providence and the righteous judgments of God. One cannot be indulged without leading on, sooner or later, to the horrid sufferings of the other: and how soon no one knows.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And them that commit adultery with her - </b>Those who are seduced by her doctrines into this sin; either they who commit it with her literally, or who are led into the same kind of life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into great tribulation - </b>Great suffering; disease of body or tortures of the soul. How often - how almost uniformly is this the case with those who thus live! Sooner or later, sorrow always comes upon the licentious; and God has evinced by some of his severest judgments, in forms of frightful disease, his displeasure at the violation of the laws of purity. There is no sin that produces a mere withering and desolating effect upon the soul than what is here referred to; none which is more certain to be followed with sorrow.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Except they repent of their deeds - </b>It is only by repentance that we can avoid the consequences of sin. The word “repent” here evidently includes both sorrow for the past, and abandonment of the evil course of life.</p>
