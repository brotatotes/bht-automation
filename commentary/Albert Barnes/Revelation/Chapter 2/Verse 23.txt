<p style=" "><b>And I will kill her children with death - </b>A strong Hebraistic mode of expression, meaning that he would certainly destroy them. It has been made a question whether the word “children” here is to be taken literally or figuratively. The word itself would admit of either interpretation; and there is nothing in the connection by which its meaning here can be determined. If it is to be taken literally, it is in accordance with what is often threatened in the Scriptures, that children shall be visited with calamity for the sins of parents, and with what often occurs in fact, that they do thus suffer. For it is no uncommon thing that whole families are made desolate on account of the sin and folly of the parent. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:19">Romans 5:19</span>. If it is to be taken figuratively, then it refers to those who had imbibed her doctrines, and who, of course, would suffer in the punishment which would follow from the propagation of such doctrines. The reference in the word “death” here would seem to be to some heavy judgment, by plague, famine, or sword, by which they would be cut off.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And all the churches shall know, ... - </b>That is, the design of this judgment will be so apparent that it will convince all that I know what is in the hearts of people, even the secret acts of wickedness that are concealed from human view.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts - </b>This is clearly a claim to omniscience; and as it is the Lord Jesus who speaks in all these epistles, it is a full proof that he claims this for himself. There is nothing which more clearly pertains to God than the power of searching the heart, and nothing that is more constantly claimed by him as his special prerogative, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+28:9">1 Chronicles 28:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+7:9">Psalms 7:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+11:4">Psalms 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+44:21">Psalms 44:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:2">Psalms 139:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+15:3">Proverbs 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+11:20">Jeremiah 11:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:10">Jeremiah 17:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+20:12">Jeremiah 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+32:19">Jeremiah 32:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:13">Hebrews 4:13</span>. The word “reins” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεφροὺς</span></span> nephrous - means, literally, “the kidney,” and is commonly used in the plural to denote the kidneys, or the loins. In the Scriptures it is used to denote the inmost mind, the secrets of the soul; probably because the parts referred to by the word are as hidden as any other part of the frame, and would seem to be the repository of the more secret affections of the mind. It is not to be supposed that it is taught in the Scriptures that the reins are the real seat of any of the affections or passions; but there is no more impropriety in using the term in a popular signification than there is in using the word “heart,” which all continue to use, to denote the seat of love.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I will give unto every one of you according to your works - </b>To every one of you; not only to those who have embraced these opinions, but to all the church. This is the uniform rule laid down in the Bible by which God will judge people.</p>
