And he that overcometh - notes on Revelation 2:7.And keepeth my works unto the end - The works that I command and that I require, to the end of his life. Compare John 13:1.To him will I give power over the nations - The evident meaning of what is said here, and in the next verse, is, that in accordance with the uniform promise made to the redeemed in the New Testament, they would partake of the final triumph anal glory of the Saviour, and be associated with him. It is not said that they would have exclusive power over the nations, or that they would hold offices of trust under him during a personal reign on the earth; but the meaning is, that they would be associated with him in his future glory. Compare the Romans 8:17 note; 1 Corinthians 6:2-3 notes.
