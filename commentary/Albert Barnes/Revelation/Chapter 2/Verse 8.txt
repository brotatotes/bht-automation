<p style=" "><b>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write - </b>On the meaning of the word “angel,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>.</p>

<p style=" "><b>Which was dead, and is alive - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>. The idea is, that he is a Living Saviour; and there was a propriety in referring to that fact here from the nature of the promise which he was about to make to the church at Smyrna: “He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:11">Revelation 2:11</span>. As he had himself triumphed over death in all its forms, and was now alive forever, it was appropriate that he should promise to his true friends the same protection from the second death. He who was wholly beyond the reach of death could give the assurance that they who put their trust in him should come off victorious.</p>
