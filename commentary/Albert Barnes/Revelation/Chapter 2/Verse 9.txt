<p style=" "><b>I know thy works - </b>The uniform method of introducing these epistles, implying a most intimate acquaintance with all that pertained to the church. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And tribulation - </b>This word is of a general signification, and probably includes all that they suffered in any form, whether from persecution, poverty, or the blasphemy of opposers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And poverty - </b>It would seem that this church, at that time, was eminently poor, for this is not specified in regard to any one of the others. No reason is suggested why they were particularly poor. It was not, indeed, an uncommon characteristic of early Christians (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26-28">1 Corinthians 1:26-28</span>), but there might have Been some special reasons why that church was eminently so. It is, however, the only church of the seven which has survived, and perhaps in the end its poverty was no disadvantage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But thou art rich - </b>Not in this world’s goods, but in a more important respect - in the grace and favor of God. These things are not infrequently united. Poverty is no hindrance to the favor of God, and there are some things in it which are favorable to the promotion of a right spirit toward God which are not found where there is abundant wealth. The Saviour was eminently poor, and not a few of his most devoted and useful followers have had as little of this world’s goods as he had. The poor should always be cheerful and happy, if they can hear their Saviour saying unto them, “I know thy poverty - but thou art rich.” However keen the feeling arising from the reflection “I am a poor man,” the edge of the sorrow is taken off if the mind can be turned to a brighter image - “but thou art rich.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I know the blasphemy - </b>The reproaches; the harsh and bitter revilings. On the word “blasphemy,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:3">Matthew 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:65">Matthew 26:65</span>. The word here does not seem to refer to blasphemy against God, but to bitter reproaches against themselves. The reason of these reproaches is not stated, but it was doubtless on account of their religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of them which say they are Jews - </b>Who profess to be Jews. The idea seems to be that though they were of Jewish extraction, and professed to be Jews, they were not true Jews; they indulged in a bitterness of reproach, and a severity of language, which showed that they had not the spirit of the Jewish religion; they had nothing which became those who were under the guidance of the spirit of their own Scriptures. That would have inculcated and fostered a milder temper; and the meaning here is, that although they were of Jewish origin, they were not worthy of the name. That spirit of bitter opposition was indeed often manifested in their treatment of Christians, as it had been of the Saviour, but still it was foreign to the true nature of their religion. There were Jews in all parts of Asia Minor, and the apostles often encountered them in their journeyings, but it would seem that there was something which had particularly embittered those of Smyrna against Christianity. What this was is now unknown.</p>
<p style=" ">It may throw some light on the passage, however, to remark that at a somewhat later period - in the time of the martyrdom of Polycarp - the Jews of Smyrna were among the most bitter of the enemies of Christians, and among the most violent in demanding the death of Polycarp. Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. 4:15) says,. that when Polycarp was apprehended, and brought before the proconsul at Smyrna, the Jews were the most furious of all in demanding his condemnation. When the mob, after his condemnation to death, set about gathering fuel to burn him, “the Jews,” says he, “being especially zealous, as was their custom - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μάλιστα προθύμως, ὡς ἔθος αὐτοῖς</span></span> malista prothumōs, hōs ethos autois - ran to procure fuel.” And when, as the burning failed, the martyr was transfixed with weapons, the Jews urged and besought the magistrate that his body might not be given up to Christians. Possibly at the time when this epistle was directed to be sent to Smyrna, there were Jews there who manifested the same spirit which those of their countrymen did afterward, who urged on the death of Polycarp.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But are the synagogue of Satan - </b>Deserve rather to be called the synagogue of Satan. The synagogue was a Jewish place of worship (compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>), but the word originally denoted “the assembly” or “the congregation.” The meaning here is plain, that though they worshipped in a synagogue, and professed to be the worshippers of God, yet they were not worthy of the name, and deserved rather to be regarded as in the service of Satan. “Satan” is the word that is properly applied to the great evil spirit, elsewhere called the devil. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3">Luke 22:3</span> note, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:6">Job 1:6</span> note.</p>
