<p style=" "><b>And the sea gave up the dead which were in it - </b>All that had been buried in the depths of ocean. This number in the aggregate will be great. If we include all who were swept off by the flood, and all who have perished by shipwreck, and all who have been killed in naval battles and buried in the sea, and all who have been swept away by inundations of the ocean, and all who have peacefully died at sea, as sailors, or in the pursuits of commerce or benevolence, the number in the aggregate will be immense - a number so vast that it was proper to notice them particularly in the account of the general resurrection and the last judgment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them - </b>That is, all the dead came, from all regions where they were scattered - on the land and in the ocean - in this world and in the invisible world. “Death and hell” are here personified, and are represented as having dominion over the dead, and as now “delivering” up, or “surrendering” those who were held tinder them. On the meaning of the words used here, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>. Compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+10:21-22">Job 10:21-22</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:9">Isaiah 14:9</span> note. This whole representation is entirely inconsistent with the supposition that a large part of the dead had been already raised up at the beginning of the millennial period, and had been permitted, in their glorified bodies, to reign with Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they were judged, ... - </b>All these were judged - the righteous and the wicked; those buried at sea, and those buried on the land; the small and the great; the dead, in whatever world they may have been.</p>
