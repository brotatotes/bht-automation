<p style=" "><b>And I saw thrones - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρόνους</span></span> thronous See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3-4">Revelation 4:3-4</span>. John here simply says, that he saw in vision thrones, with persons sitting on them, but without intreating who they were that sat on them. It is not the throne of God that is now revealed, for the word is in the plural number, though the writer does not hint how “many” thrones there were. It is intimated, however, that these thrones were placed with some reference to pronouncing a judgment, or determining the destiny of some portion of mankind, for it is immediately added, “and judgment was given unto them.” There is considerable resemblance, in many respects, between this and the statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:9">Daniel 7:9</span>; “I beheld until the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit”; or, as it should be rendered, “I beheld” - that is, I continued to look - “until the thrones were placed or set,” to wit, for the purposes of judgment. See the notes on that passage. So John here sees, as the termination of human affairs approaches, thrones placed with reference to a determination of the destiny of some portion of the race, “as if” they were now to have a trial, and to receive a sentence of acquittal or condemnation. The “persons” on whom this judgment is to pass are specified, in the course of the verse, as those who were “beheaded for the witness of Jesus, who had the Word of God, who had not worshipped the beast,” etc. The “time” when this was to occur manifestly was at the Beginning of the thousand years.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they sat upon them - </b>Who sat on them is not mentioned. The natural construction is, that “judges” sat on them, or that persons sat on them to whom judgment was entrusted. The language is such as would be used on the supposition either that he had mentioned the subject before, so that he would be readily understood, or that, from some other cause, it was so well understood that there was no necessity for mentioning who they were. John seems to have assumed that it would be understood who were meant. And yet to us it is not entirely clear; for John has not before this given us any such intimation that we can determine with certainty what is intended. The probable construction is, that those are referred to to whom it appropriately belonged to occupy such seats of judgment, and who they are is to be determined from other parts of the Scriptures. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>, the Saviour says to his apostles, “When the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span>, Paul asks the question, “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?” The meaning as thus explained is, that Christians will, in some way, be employed in judging the world; that is, that they will be exalted to the right hand of the Judge, and be elevated to a station of honor, as if they were associated with the Son of God in the judgment. Something of that kind is, doubtless, referred to here; and John probably means to say that he saw the thrones placed on which those will sit who will be employed in judging the world. If the apostles are specially referred to, it was natural that John, eminent for modesty, should not particularly mention them, as he was one of them, and as the true allusion would be readily understood.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And judgment was given unto them - </b>The power of pronouncing sentence in the case referred to was conferred on them, and they proceeded to exercise that power. This was not in relation to the whole race of mankind, but to the martyrs, and to those who, amidst many temptations and trials, had kept themselves pure. The sentence which is to be passed would seem to be that in consequence of which they are to be permitted to “live and reign with Christ a thousand years.” The “form” of this expressed approval is that of a resurrection and judgment; whether this be the “literal” mode is another inquiry, and will properly be considered when the exposition of the passage shall have been given.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I saw the souls of them - </b>This is a very important expression in regard to the meaning of the whole passage. John says he saw “the souls” - not “the bodies.” If the obvious meaning of this be the correct meaning; if he saw the “souls” of the martyrs, not the “bodies,” this would seem to exclude the notion of a “literal” resurrection, and consequently overturn many of the theories of a literal resurrection, and of a literal reign of the saints with Christ during the thousand years of the millennium. The doctrine of the last resurrection, as everywhere stated in the Scripture, is, that the “body” will be raised up, and not merely that the “soul will live” (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:0">1 Corinthians 15:0</span>, and the notes on that chapter); and consequently John must mean to refer in this place to something different from that resurrection, or to “any” proper resurrection of the dead as the expression is commonly understood.</p>
<p style=" ">The doctrine which has been held, and is held, by those who maintain that there will be a “literal resurrection” of the saints to reign with Christ during a thousand years, can receive no support from this passage, for there is no ambiguity respecting the word “souls” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχὰς</span></span> psuchas - as used here. By no possible construction can it mean the “bodies” of the saints. If John had intended to state that the saints, as such, would be raised as they will be at the last day, it is clear that he would not have used this language, but would have employed the common language of the New Testament to denote it. The language here does not express the doctrine of the resurrection of the body; and if no other language but this had been used in the New Testament, the doctrine of the resurrection, as now taught and received, could not be established. These considerations make it clear to my mind that John did not mean to teach that there would be a literal resurrection of the saints, that they might live and reign with Christ personally during the period of a thousand years.</p>
<p style=" ">There was undoubtedly something that might be “compared” with the resurrection, and that might, in some proper sense, be “called” a resurrection <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5-6">Revelation 20:5-6</span>, but there is not the slightest intheation that it would be a resurrection of the “body,” or that it would be identical with the “final” resurrection. John undoubtedly intends to describe some honor conferred on the “spirits or souls” of the saints and martyrs during this long period, as if they were raised from the dead, or which might be represented by a resurrection from the dead. What that honor is to be, is expressed by their “living and reigning with Christ.” The meaning of this will be explained in the exposition of these words; but the word used here is fatal to the notion of a literal resurrection and a personal reign with Christ on the earth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That were beheaded - </b>The word used here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πελεκίζω</span></span> pelekizō - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means, “to axe,” that is, to hew or cut with an axe - from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πέλεκυς</span></span> pelekus, “axe.” Hence it means to behead with an axe. This was a common mode of execution among the Romans, and doubtless many of the Christian martyrs suffered in this manner; but “it cannot be supposed to have been the intention of the writer to confine the rewards of martyrs to those who suffered in this particular way; for this specific and ignominious method of punishment is designated merely as the symbol of any and every kind of martyrdom” (Prof. Stuart).</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the witness of Jesus - </b>As witnesses of Jesus; or bearing in this way their testimony to the truth of his religion. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And for the Word of God - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>. “Which had not worshipped the beast.” Who had remained faithful to the principles of the true religion, and had resisted all the attempts made to seduce them from the faith, even the temptations and allurements in the times of the papacy. See this language explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:4">Revelation 13:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither his image - </b>notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14-15">Revelation 13:14-15</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they lived - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἔζησαν</span></span> ezēsan, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζάω</span></span> zaō, “to live.” Very much, in the whole passage, depends on this word. The meanings given to the word by Prof. Robinson (<i>Lexicon</i>) are the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)To live, to have life, spoken of physical life and existence;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)To live, that is, to sustain life, to live on or by anything;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (c)To live in any way, to pass one’s life in any manner;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (d)To live and prosper; to be blessed.</p>
<p style=" ">It may be applied to those who were before dead <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:18">Matthew 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:11">Mark 16:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:23">Luke 24:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:41">Acts 9:41</span>, but it does not necessarily imply this, nor does the mere use of the word “suggest” it. It is the proper notion of living, or having life “now,” whatever was the former state - whether nonexistence, death, sickness, or health. The mind, in the use of this word, is fixed on the “present as a state of living.” It is not necessarily in contrast with a former state “as dead,” but it is on the fact that they are now alive. As, however, there is reference, in the passage before us, to the fact that a portion of those mentioned had been “beheaded for the witness of Jesus,” it is to be admitted that the word here refers, in some sense, to that fact. They were put to death in the body, but their “souls” were now seen to be alive. They had not ceased to be, but they lived and reigned with Christ as if they had been raised up from the dead. And when this is said of the “souls” of those who were beheaded, and who were seen to reign with Christ, it cannot mean:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)That their “souls” came to life again, for there is no intimation that they had for a moment ceased to exist; nor,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)That they then became “immortal,” for that was always true of them; nor,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (c)That there was any literal “resurrection of the body,” as Prof. Stuart (2:360, 475, 476) supposes, and as is supposed by those who hold to a literal reign of Christ on the earth, for there is no intimation of the resurrection of the “body.”</p>
<p style=" ">The meaning, then, so far as the language is concerned, must be, that there would exist, at the time of the thousand years, a state of things as if the martyrs were raised up from the dead - an honoring of the martyrs as if they should live and reign with Christ. Their names would be vindicated; their principles would be revived; they would be exalted in public estimation above other men; they would be raised from the low rank in which they were held by the world in times of persecution to a state which might well be represented by their sitting with Christ on the throne of government, and by their being made visible attendants on his glorious kingdom.</p>
<p style=" ">This would not occur in respect to the rest of the dead - even the pious dead <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5">Revelation 20:5</span> - for “their” honors and rewards would be reserved for the great day when all the dead should be judged according to their deeds. In this view of the meaning of this passage there is nothing that forbids us to suppose that the martyrs will be “conscious” of the honor thus done to their names, their memory, and their principles on earth, or that this consciousness will increase their joy even in heaven. This sense of the passage is thus expressed, substantially, by Dr. Whately (Essays on the Future State): “It may signify not the literal raising of dead men, but the raising up of an increased Christian zeal and holiness; the revival in the Christian church, or in some considerable portion of it, of the “spirit and energy” of the noble martyrs of old (even as John the Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elias), so that Christian principles shall be displayed in action throughout the world in an infinitely greater degree than ever before.”</p>
<p style=" ">This view of the signification of the word “lived” is sustained by its use elsewhere in the Scriptures and by its common use among people. Thus in this very book, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:11">Revelation 11:11</span>; “And after three days and a half, the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.” So in Ezekiel, in speaking of the restoration of the Jews: “Thus saith the Lord God, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves,” and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, and brought you up out of your graves, and shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:12-14">Ezekiel 37:12-14</span>. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:2">Hosea 6:2</span>; “After two days he will “revive” us (cause us to live again); in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall “live” in his sight.” So in the parable of the prodigal son: “This thy brother was dead, and is alive again,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:32">Luke 15:32</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">So in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+26:19">Isaiah 26:19</span>; “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.” The following extract, from D’Aubigne’s “History of the Reformation,” will show how natural it is to use the very language employed here when the idea is intended to be conveyed of reviving former principles as if the people who held them should be raised to life again. It is the language of the martyr John Huss, who, in speaking of himself in view of a remarkable dream that he had, said, “I am no dreamer, but I maintain this for certain, that the image of Christ will never be effaced. They (his enemies) have wished to destroy it, but it shall be painted afresh in all hearts by much better preachers than myself. The nation that loves Christ will rejoice at this. And I, awaking from among the dead, and rising, so to speak, from my grave, shall leap with great joy.” So a Brief addressed by Pope Adrian to the Diet at Nuremberg contains these words: “The heretics Huss and Jerome are now alive again in the person of Martin Luther.” For a further illustration of the passage see the remarks which follow (section b) on the state of things which may be expected to exist in the time referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4-6">Revelation 20:4-6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And reigned with Christ - </b>Were exalted in their principles, and in their personal happiness in heaven, as if they occupied the throne with him, and personally shared his honors and his triumphs. Who can tell, also, whether they may not be employed in special services of mercy, in administering the affairs of his government during that bright and happy period?</p>
<p style=" "><b>A thousand years - </b>During the period when Satan will be bound, and when the true religion will have the ascendency in the earth. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2">Revelation 20:2</span>.</p>
