<p style=" "><b>But the rest of the dead - </b>In contradistinction from the beheaded martyrs, and from those who had kept themselves pure in the times of great temptation. The phrase “rest of the dead” here would most naturally refer to the “same general class” which was before mentioned - the pious dead. The meaning is, that the martyrs would be honored as if they were raised up and the others not - that is, that special respect would be shown to their principles, their memory, and their character. In other words, “special” honor would be shown “to a spirit of eminent piety” during that period above the “common and ordinary” piety which has been manifested in the church. The “rest of the dead” - the pious dead - would indeed be raised up and rewarded, but they would occupy comparatively humble places, as if they did not partake in the exalted triumphs when the world should be subdued to the Saviour. Their places in honor, in rank, and in reward would be “beneath” that of those who in fiery times had maintained unshaken fidelity to the cause of truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Lived not - </b>On the word “lived,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>. That is, they “lived” not during that period in the special sense in which it is said <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span> that the eminent saints and martyrs lived. They did not come into remembrance; their principles were not what then characterized the church; they did not see, as the martyrs did, their principles and mode of life in the ascendency, and consequently they had not the augmented happiness and honor which the more eminent saints and martyrs had.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Until the thousand years were finished - </b>Then all who were truly the children of God, though some might be less eminent than others had been, would come into remembrance, and would have their proper place in the rewards of heaven. The “language” here is not necessarily to be interpreted as meaning that they would be raised up then, or would live then, whatever may be true on that point. It is merely an emphatic mode of affirming that “up to float period they would not live” in the sense in which it is affirmed that the others would. But it is not affirmed that they would even then “live” immediately. A “long” interval might elapse before that would occur in the general resurrection of the dead. See the Analysis of the chapter.</p>
<p style=" "><b>This is the first resurrection - </b>The resurrection of the saints and martyrs, as specified in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>. It is called the “first” resurrection in contradistinction from the second and last - the general resurrection - when all the dead will be “literally” raised up from their graves and assembled for the judgment, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span>. It is not necessary to suppose that what is called here the “first resurrection” will resemble the real and literal resurrection in every respect. All that is meant is, that there will be such a resemblance as to make it proper to call it a resurrection - a coming to life again. This will be, as explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>, in the honor done to the martyrs, in the restoration of their principles as the great actuating principles of the church, and perhaps in the increased happiness conferred on them in heaven, and in their being employed in promoting the cause of truth in the world.</p>
