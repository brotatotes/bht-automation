<p style=" "><b>Having the glory of God - </b>A glory or splendor such as became the dwelling place of God. The nature of that splendor is described in the following verses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And her light - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span> it is said that “the glory of God did lighten it.” That is, it was made light by the visible symbol of the Deity - the “Shekinah.” See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:3">Acts 9:3</span> note. The word here rendered “light” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωστὴρ</span></span> phōstēr - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament except in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>. It means, properly, a light, a lightgiver, and, in profane writers, means commonly a “window.” It is used here to denote the brightness or shining of the divine glory, as supplying the place of the sun, or of a window.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Like unto a stone most precious - </b>A stone of the richest or most costly nature.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even like a jasper stone - </b>On the jasper, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span>. It is used there for the same purpose as here, to illustrate the majesty and glory of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Clear as crystal - </b>Pellucid or resplendent like crystal. There are various kinds of jasper - as red, yellow, and brown, brownish yellow, etc. The stone is essentially a quartz, and the word “crystal” here is used to show that the form of it referred to by John was clear and bright.</p>
