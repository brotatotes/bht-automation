<p style=" "><b>And he that talked with me - </b>The angel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had a golden reed to measure the city - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span>. The reed, or measuring rod, here, is of gold, because all about the city is of the most rich and costly materials. The rod is thus suited to the personage who uses it, and to the occasion. Compare a similar description in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:3-5">Ezekiel 40:3-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+43:16">Ezekiel 43:16</span>. The object of this measuring is to show that the city has proper architectural proportions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the gates thereof, ... - </b>To measure every part of the city, and to ascertain its exact dimensions.</p>
