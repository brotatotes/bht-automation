<p style=" "><b>And the foundations of the wall of the city - </b>notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:14">Revelation 21:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Were garnished - </b>Were adorned, or decorated. That is, the foundations were composed of precious stones, giving them this highly ornamented and brilliant appearance.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The first foundation - </b>The first “row, layer, or course.” notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:14">Revelation 21:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was jasper - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The second, sapphire - </b>This stone is not elsewhere mentioned in the New Testament. It is a precious stone, next in hardness to the diamond, usually of an azure or sky-blue color, but of various shades.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The third, a chalcedony - </b>This word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The stone referred to is an uncrystallized translucent variety of quartz, having a whitish color, and of a luster nearly like wax. It is found covering the sides of cavities, and is a deposit from filtrated silicious waters. When it is arranged in “stripes,” it constitutes “agate”; and if the stripes are horizontal, it is the “onyx.” The modern “carnelian” is a variety of this. The carnelian is of a deep flesh red, or reddishwhite color. The name chalcedony is from “Chalcedon,” a town in Asia Minor, opposite to Byzantium, or Constantinople, where this stone was probably first known (Webster’s Dictionary).</p>
<p style=" "><b>The fourth, an emerald - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span>. The emerald is green.</p>
