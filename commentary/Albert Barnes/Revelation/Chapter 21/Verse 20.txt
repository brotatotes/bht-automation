<p style=" "><b>The fifth, sardonyx - </b>This word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The “name” is derived from “Sardis,” a city in Asia Minor (notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>), and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὄνυξ</span></span> onux, a nail - so named, according to Pliny, from the resemblance of its color to the flesh and the nail. It is a silicious stone or gem, nearly allied to the onyx. The color is a reddish yellow, nearly orange (Webster, Dictionary).</p>
<p style=" "><b>The sixth, sardius - </b>This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It is also derived from “Sardis,” and the name was probably given to the gem because it was found there. It is a stone of a blood-red or flesh color, and is commonly known as a “carnelian.” It is the same as the sardine stone mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span>. See the notes on that place.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The seventh, chrysolite - </b>This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It is derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσὸς</span></span> chrusos, “gold,” and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λίθος</span></span> lithos, “stone,” and means “golden stone,” and was applied by the ancients to all gems of a golden or yellow color, probably designating particularly the topaz of the moderns (Robinson, Lexicon). But in Webster’s Dictionary it is said that its prevalent color is green. It is sometimes transparent. This is the “modern” chrysolite. The ancients undoubtedly understood by the name a “yellow” gem.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The eighth, beryl - </b>This word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The beryl is a mineral of great hardness, and is of a green or bluish-green color. It is identical with the emerald, except in the color, the emerald having a purer and richer green color, proceeding from a trace of oxide of chrome. Prisms of beryl are sometimes found nearly two feet in diameter in the state of New Hampshire (Webster).</p>
<p style=" "><b>The ninth, a topaz - </b>This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The topaz is a well-known mineral, said to be so called from “Topazos,” a small island in the Arabian Gulf. It is generally of a yellowish color, and pellucid, but it is also found of greenish, bluish, or brownish shades.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The tenth, a chrysoprasus - </b>This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσόπρασος</span></span> chrusoprasos does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It is derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσὸς</span></span> chrusos, “gold,” and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πράσον</span></span> prason, “a leek,” and denotes a precious stone of greenish golden color, like a leek; that is, “apple-green passing into a grass-green” (Robinson, Lexicon). “It is a variety of quartz. It is commonly apple-green, and often extremely beautiful. It is translucent, or sometimes semi-transparent; its hardness little inferior to flint” (Webster, Dictionary).</p>
<p style=" "><b>The eleventh, a jacinth - </b>The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It is the same word as “hyacinth” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὑάκινθος</span></span> huakinthos - and denotes properly the well-known flower of that name, usually of a deep purple or reddish blue. Here it denotes a gem of this color. It is a red variety of “zircon.” See Webster’s Dictionary under the word “hyacinth.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>The twelfth, an amethyst - </b>This word, also, is found only in this place in the New Testament. It denotes a gem of a deep purple or violet color. The word is derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> a, the alpha privative (“not”), and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθύω</span></span> methuō, to be intoxicated, because this gem was supposed to be an antidote against drunkenness. It is a species of quartz, and is used in jewelry.</p>
