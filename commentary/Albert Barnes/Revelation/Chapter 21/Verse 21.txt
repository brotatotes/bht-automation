<p style=" "><b>Were twelve pearls - </b>See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:46">Matthew 13:46</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Every several gate was of one pearl - </b>Each gate. Of course, this is not to be understood literally. The idea is that of ornament and beauty, and nothing could give a more striking view of the magnificence of the future abode of the saints.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the street of the city was pure gold - </b>Was paved with gold; that is, all the vacant space that was not occupied with buildings was of pure gold. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:18">Revelation 21:18</span>.</p>
