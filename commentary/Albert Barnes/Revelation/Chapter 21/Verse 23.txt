<p style=" "><b>And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it - </b>This imagery seems to be derived from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:19-20">Isaiah 9:19-20</span>. See notes on those verses. No language could give a more striking or beautiful representation of the heavenly state than what is here employed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the glory of God did lighten it - </b>By the visible splendor of his glory. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:11">Revelation 21:11</span>. That supplied the place of the sun and the moon.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the Lamb is the light thereof - </b>The Son of God; the Messiah. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:19">Isaiah 60:19</span> note.</p>
