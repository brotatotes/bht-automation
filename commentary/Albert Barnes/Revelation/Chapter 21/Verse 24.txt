<p style=" "><b>And the nations of them which are saved - </b>All the nations that are saved; or all the saved considered as nations. This imagery is doubtless derived from that in Isaiah, particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3-9">Isaiah 60:3-9</span>. See the notes on that passage.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall walk in the light of it - </b>Shall enjoy its splendor, and be continually in its light.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it - </b>All that they consider as constituting their glory, treasures, crowns, scepters, robes. The idea is, that all these will be devoted to God in the future days of the church in its glory, and will be, as it were, brought and laid down at the feet of the Saviour in heaven. The language is derived, doubtless, from the description in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3-14">Isaiah 60:3-14</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:23">Isaiah 49:23</span>.</p>
