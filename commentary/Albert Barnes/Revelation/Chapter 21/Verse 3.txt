And I heard a great voice out of heaven - As if uttered by God himself or the voice, of angels.Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men - The tabernacle, as that word is commonly used in the Scriptures, referring to the sacred “tent” erected in the wilderness, was regarded as the unique dwelling-place of God among his people - as the temple was afterward, which was also called a “tabernacle.” See the notes on Hebrews 9:2. The meaning here is, that God would now dwell with the redeemed, as if in a tabernacle, or in a house specially prepared for his residence among them. It is not said that this would be “on the earth,” although that may be; for it is possible that the earth, as well as other worlds, may yet become the abode of the redeemed. See the notes on 2 Peter 3:13.And he will dwell with them - As in a tent, or tabernacle - σκηνώσει skēnōsei. This is a common idea in the Scriptures.And they shall be his people - He will acknowledge them in this public way as his own, and will dwell with them as such.And God himself shall be with them - Shall be permanently with them; shall never leave them.And be their God - Shall manifest himself as such, in such a manner that there shall be no doubt.
