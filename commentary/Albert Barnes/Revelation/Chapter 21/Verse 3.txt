<p style=" "><b>And I heard a great voice out of heaven - </b>As if uttered by God himself or the voice, of angels.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men - </b>The tabernacle, as that word is commonly used in the Scriptures, referring to the sacred “tent” erected in the wilderness, was regarded as the unique dwelling-place of God among his people - as the temple was afterward, which was also called a “tabernacle.” See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span>. The meaning here is, that God would now dwell with the redeemed, as if in a tabernacle, or in a house specially prepared for his residence among them. It is not said that this would be “on the earth,” although that may be; for it is possible that the earth, as well as other worlds, may yet become the abode of the redeemed. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:13">2 Peter 3:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And he will dwell with them - </b>As in a tent, or tabernacle - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνώσει</span></span> skēnōsei. This is a common idea in the Scriptures.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And they shall be his people - </b>He will acknowledge them in this public way as his own, and will dwell with them as such.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And God himself shall be with them - </b>Shall be permanently with them; shall never leave them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And be their God - </b>Shall manifest himself as such, in such a manner that there shall be no doubt.</p>
