<p style=" "><b>But the fearful - </b>Having stated, in general terms, who they were who would be admitted into that blessed world, he now states explicitly who would not. The “fearful” denote those who had not firmness boldly to maintain their professed principles, or who were afraid to avow themselves as the friends of God in a wicked world. They stand in contrast with those who “overcome,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:7">Revelation 21:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And unbelieving - </b>Those who have not true faith; avowed infidels; infidels at heart; and all who have not the sincere faith of the gospel. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the abominable - </b>The verb from which this word is derived means to excite disgust; to feel disgust at; to abominate or abhor; and hence the participle - “the abominable” - refers to all who are detestable, to wit, on account of their sins; all whose conduct is offensive to God. Thus it would include those who live in open sin; who practice detestable vices; whose conduct is suited to excite disgust and abhorrence. These must all, of course, be excluded from a pure and holy world; and this description, alas! would embrace a lamentably large portion of the world as it has hitherto been.

<p style=" "><b>And all liars - </b>All who are false in their statements, their promises, their contracts. The word would embrace all who are false toward God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:1-3">Acts 5:1-3</span>, and false toward human beings.
