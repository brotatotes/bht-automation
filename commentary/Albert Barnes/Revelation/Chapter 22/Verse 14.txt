Blessed are they that do his commandments - See the notes on Revelation 1:3; Revelation 22:7.That they may have right - That they may be entitled to approach the tree of life; that this privilege may be granted to them. It is not a right in the sense that they have merited it, but in the sense that the privilege is conferred on them as one of the rewards of God, and that, in virtue of the divine arrangements, they will be entitled to this honor. So the word used here - ἐξουσία exousia - means in John 1:12, rendered “power.” The reason why this right or privilege is conferred is not implied in the use of the word. In this case it is by grace, and all the right which they have to the tree of life is founded on the fact that God has been pleased graciously to confer it on them.To the tree of life - See the notes on Revelation 22:2. They would not be forbidden to approach that tree as Adam was, but would be permitted always to partake of it, and would live forever.And may enter in through the gates into the city - The New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:2. They would have free access there; they would be permitted to abide there forever.
