<p style=" "><b>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy - </b>If he shall reject the book altogether; if he shall, in transcribing it, designedly strike any part of it out. It is conceivable that, from the remarkable nature of the communications made in this book, and the fact that they seemed to be unintelligible, John supposed there might be those who would be inclined to omit some portions as improbable, or that he apprehended that when the portions which describe antichrist were fulfilled in distant ages, those to whom those portions applied would be disposed to strike them from the sacred volume, or to corrupt them. He thought proper to guard against this by this solemn declaration of the consequence which would follow such an act. The whole book was to be received - with all its fearful truths - as a revelation from God; and however obscure it might seem, in due time it would be made plain; however faithfully it might depict a fearful apostasy, it was important, both to show the truth of divine inspiration and to save the church, that these disclosures should be in their native purity in the possession of the people of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God shall take away his part out of the book of life - </b>Perhaps there is here an intimation that this would be most likely to be done by those who professed to be Christians, and who supposed that their names were in the book of life. In fact, most of the corruptions of the sacred Scriptures have been attempted by those who have professed some form of Christianity. Infidels have but little interest in attempting such changes, and but little influence to make them received by the church. It is most convenient for them, as it is most agreeable to their feelings, to reject the Bible altogether. When it said here that “God would take away his part out of the book of life,” the meaning is not that his name had been written in that book, but that he would take away the part which he might have had, or which he professed to have in that book. Such corruption of the divine oracles would show that they had no true religion, and would be excluded from heaven. On the phrase “book of life,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And out of the holy city - </b>Described in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:0">Revelation 21:0</span>. He would not be permitted to enter that city; he would have no part among the redeemed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And from the things which are written in this book - </b>The promises that are made; the glories that are described.</p>
