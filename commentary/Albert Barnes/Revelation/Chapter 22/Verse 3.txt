<p style=" "><b>And there shall be no more curse - </b>This is doubtless designed to be in strong contrast with our present abode; and it is affirmed that what now properly comes under the name of a curse, or whatever is part of the curse pronounced on man by the fall, will be there unknown. The earth will be no more cursed, and will produce no more thorns and thistles; man will be no more compelled to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow; woman will be no more doomed to bear the sufferings which she does now; and the abodes of the blessed will be no more cursed by sickness, sorrow, tears, and death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it - </b>God will reign there forever; the principles of purity and love which the Lamb of God came to establish, will pervade that blessed abode to all eternity.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And his servants shall serve him - </b>All his servants that are there; that is, all the inhabitants of that blessed world. For the meaning of this passage, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:15">Revelation 7:15</span>.</p>
