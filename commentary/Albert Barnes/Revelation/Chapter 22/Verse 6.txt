And he said unto me - The angel-interpreter, who had showed John the vision of the New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:9-10. As these visions are now at an end, the angel comes to John directly, and assures him that all these things are true - that there has been no deception of the senses in these visions, but that they were really divine disclosures of what would soon and certainly occur.These sayings are faithful and true - These communications - all that has been disclosed to you by symbols, or in direct language. See the notes on Revelation 21:5.And the Lord God of the holy prophets - The same God who inspired the ancient prophets.Sent his angel - See the notes on Revelation 1:1.To show unto his servants - To all his servants - that is, to all his people, by the instrumentality of John. The revelation was made to him, and he was to record it for the good of the whole church.The things which must shortly be done - The beginning of which must soon occur - though the series of events extended into distant ages, and even into eternity. See the notes on Revelation 1:1-3.
