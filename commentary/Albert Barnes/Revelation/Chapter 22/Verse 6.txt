<p style=" "><b>And he said unto me - </b>The angel-interpreter, who had showed John the vision of the New Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9-10">Revelation 21:9-10</span>. As these visions are now at an end, the angel comes to John directly, and assures him that all these things are true - that there has been no deception of the senses in these visions, but that they were really divine disclosures of what would soon and certainly occur.</p>
<p style=" "><b>These sayings are faithful and true - </b>These communications - all that has been disclosed to you by symbols, or in direct language. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the Lord God of the holy prophets - </b>The same God who inspired the ancient prophets.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sent his angel - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To show unto his servants - </b>To all his servants - that is, to all his people, by the instrumentality of John. The revelation was made to him, and he was to record it for the good of the whole church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The things which must shortly be done - </b>The beginning of which must soon occur - though the series of events extended into distant ages, and even into eternity. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1-3">Revelation 1:1-3</span>.</p>
