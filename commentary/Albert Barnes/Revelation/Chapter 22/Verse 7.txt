The meaning is, that they were used by the angel as the words of the Redeemer. See Revelation 22:12, Revelation 22:20.Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book - That receives them as a divine communication; that makes use of them to comfort himself in the days of darkness, persecution, and trial; and that is obedient to the precepts here enjoined. See the notes on Revelation 1:3.
