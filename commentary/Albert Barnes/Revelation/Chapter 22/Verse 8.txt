<p style=" "><b>And I John saw these things, and heard them - </b>That is, I saw the parts that were disclosed by pictures, visions, and symbols; I heard the parts that were communicated by direct revelation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel, ... - </b>As he had done on a former occasion. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>. John appears to have been entirely overcome by the extraordinary nature of the revelations made to him, and not improbably entertained some suspicion that it was the Redeemer himself who had manifested himself to him in this remarkable manner.</p>
