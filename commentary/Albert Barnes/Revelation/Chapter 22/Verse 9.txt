<p style=" "><b>And of thy brethren the prophets - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>, it is “of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus.” Here the angel says that, in the capacity in which he appeared to John, he belonged to the general rank of the prophets, and was no more entitled to worship than any of the prophets had been. Like them, he had merely been employed to disclose important truths in regard to the future; but as the prophets, even the most eminent of them, were not regarded as entitled to worship on account of the communications which they had made, no more was he.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of them which keep the sayings of this book - </b>“I am a mere creature of God.” I, like human beings, am under law, and am bound to observe the law of God. The “sayings of this book” which he says he kept, must be understood to mean those great principles of religion which it enjoined, and which are of equal obligation on human beings and angels.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Worship God - </b>Worship God only. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>.</p>
