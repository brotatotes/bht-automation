<p style=" "><b>Behold, I will make - </b>Greek, “I give” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δίδωμι</span></span> didōmi; that is, I will arrange matters so that this shall occur. The word implies that he had power to do this, and consequently proves that he has power over the heart of man, and Call secure such a result as he chooses.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews - </b>Who profess to be Jews, but are really of the synagogue of Satan. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:9">Revelation 2:9</span>. The meaning is, that, though they were of Jewish extraction, and boasted much of being Jews, yet they were really under the influence of Satan, and their assemblages deserved to be called his “synagogue.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And are not, but do lie - </b>It is a false profession altogether. Compare notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet - </b>The word rendered “worship” here, means, properly, to full prostrate; and then to do homage, or to worship in the proper sense, as this was commonly done by falling prostrate. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:2">Matthew 2:2</span>. So far as the word is concerned, it may refer either to spiritual homage, that is, the worship of God; or it may mean respect as shown to superiors. If it is used here in the sense of divine worship properly so called, it means that they would be constrained to come and worship “before them,” or in their very presence; if it is used in the more general signification, it means that they would be constrained to show them honor and respect. The latter is the probable meaning; that is, that they would be constrained to acknowledge that they were the children of God, or that God regarded them with his favor. It does not mean necessarily that they would themselves be converted to Christ, but that, as they had been accustomed to revile and oppose those who were true Christians, they would be constrained to come and render them the respect due to those who were sincerely endeavoring to serve their Maker. The truth taught here is, that it is in the power of the Lord Jesus so to turn the hearts of all the enemies of religion that they shall be brought to show respect to it; so to incline the minds of all people that they shall honor the church, or be at least outwardly its friends. Such homage the world shall yet be constrained to pay to it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to know that I have loved thee - </b>This explains what he had just said, and shows that he means that the enemies of his church will yet be constrained to acknowledge that it enjoys the smiles of God, and that instead of being persecuted and reviled, it should be respected and loved.</p>
