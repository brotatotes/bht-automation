<p style=" "><b>The four and twenty elders fall down before him ... - </b>The representatives of the redeemed church in heaven (see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>) also unite in the praise. The meaning, if the explanation of the symbol be correct, is, that the church universal unites in praise to God for all that characterizes his administration. In the connection in which this stands here, the sense would be, that as often as there is any new manifestation of the principles of the divine government, the church ascribes new praise to God. Whatever may be thought of this explanation of the meaning of the symbols, of the fact here stated there can be no doubt. The church of God always rejoices when there is any new manifestation of the principles of the divine administration. As all these acts, in reality, bring glory and honor to God, the church, as often as there is any new manifestation of the divine character and purposes, renders praise anew. Nor can it be doubted that the view here taken is one that is every way appropriate to the general character of this book. The great design was to disclose what God was to do in future times, in the various revolutions that were to take place on the earth, until his government should be firmly established, and the principles of his administration should everywhere prevail; and there was a propriety, therefore, in describing the representatives of the church as taking part in this universal praise, and as casting every crown at the feet of Him who sits upon the throne.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And cast their crowns before the throne - </b>They are described as “crowned” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>, that is, as triumphant, and as kings (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span>), and they are here represented as casting their crowns at his feet, in token that they owe their triumph to Him. To his providential dealings, to his wise and merciful government, they owe it that they are crowned at all; and there is, therefore, a propriety that they should acknowledge this in a proper manner by placing their crowns at his feet.</p>
