<p style=" "><b>And immediately I was in the Spirit - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>. He does not affirm that he was caught up into heaven, nor does he say what impression was on his own mind, if any, as to the place where he was; but he was at once absorbed in the contemplation of the visions before him. He was doubtless still in Patmos, and these things were made to pass before his mind as a reality; that is, they appeared as real to him as if he saw them, and they were in fact a real symbolical representation of things occurring in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And, behold, a throne was set in heaven - </b>That is, a throne was placed there. The first thing that arrested his attention was a throne. Tiffs was “in heaven” - an expression which proves that the scene of the vision was not the temple in Jerusalem, as some have supposed. There is no allusion to the temple, and no imagery drawn from the temple. Isaiah had his vision <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:1-13">Isaiah 6:1-13</span> in the holy of holies of the temple; Ezekiel <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:1">Ezekiel 1:1</span>, by the river Chebar; but John looked directly into heaven, and saw the throne of God, and the encircling worshippers there.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And one sat on the throne - </b>It is remarkable that John gives no description of him who sat on the throne, nor does he indicate who he was by name. Neither do Isaiah or Ezekiel attempt to describe the appearance of the Deity, nor are there any intimations of that appearance given from which a picture or an image could be formed. So much do their representations accord with what is demanded by correct taste; and so sedulously have they guarded against any encouragement of idolatry.</p>
