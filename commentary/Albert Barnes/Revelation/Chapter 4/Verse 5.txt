<p style=" "><b>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices - </b>Expressive of the majesty and glory of Him that sat upon it. We are at once reminded by this representation of the sublime scene that occurred at Sinai <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:16">Exodus 19:16</span>, where “there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud.” Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:13">Ezekiel 1:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:24">Ezekiel 1:24</span>. So Milton:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> “Forth rushed with whirlwind sound.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> The chariot of Paternal Deity,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Flashing thick flames.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “And from about him fierce effusion rolled.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Of smoke, and lightning flame, and sparkles dire.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.5em;  "> <i>Par. Lost,</i> b. vi.</p>
<p style=" ">The word “<i>voices</i>” here connected with “<i>thunders</i>” perhaps means “voices even thunders” - referring to the sound made by the thunder. The meaning is, that these were echoing and re-echoing sounds, as it were a multitude of voices that seemed to speak on every side.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne - </b>Seven burning lamps that constantly shone there, illuminating the whole scene. These steadily burning lamps would add much to the beauty of the vision.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which are the seven Spirits of God - </b>Which represent, or are emblematic of, the seven Spirits of God. On the meaning of the phrase, “the seven Spirits of God,” see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>. If these lamps are designed to be symbols of the Holy Spirit, according to the interpretation proposed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>, it may be perhaps in the following respects:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)They may denote that all the operations of that Spirit are of the nature of <i>light</i>, dissipating darkness, and vivifying and animating all things.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)<i>Perhaps</i> their being placed here before the throne, in the midst of thunder and lightning, may be designed to represent the idea that - amidst all the scenes of magnificence and grandeur; all the storms, agitations, and tempests on the earth; all the political changes; all the convulsions of empire under the providence of God; and all the commotions in the soul of man, produced by the thunders of the law - the Spirit of God beams calmly and serenely, shedding a steady influence over all, like lamps burning in the very midst of lightnings, and thunderings, and voices. In all the scenes of majesty and commotion that occur on the earth, the Spirit of God is present, shedding a constant light, and undisturbed in his influence by all the agitations that are abroad.</p>
