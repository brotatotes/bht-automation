<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1-14">Revelation 5:1-14</span> introduces the disclosure of future events. It is done in a manner eminently suited to impress the mind with a sense of the importance of the revelations about to be made. The proper state of mind for appreciating this chapter is that when we look on the future, and are sensible that important events are about to occur; when we feel that that future is wholly impenetrable to us; and when the efforts of the highest created minds fail to lift the mysterious veil which hides those events from our view; it is in accordance with our nature that the mind should be impressed with solemn awe under such circumstances; it is not a violation of the laws of our nature that one who had an earnest desire to penetrate that future, and who saw the volume before him which contained the mysterious revelation, and who yet felt that there was no one in heaven or earth who could break the seals, and disclose what was to come, should weep. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:4">Revelation 5:4</span>. The design of the whole chapter is evidently to honor the Lamb of God, by showing that the power was entrusted to him which was confided to no one else in heaven or earth, of disclosing what is to come. Nothing else would better illustrate this than the fact that he alone could break the mysterious seals which barred out the knowledge of the future from all created eyes; and nothing would be better adapted to impress this on the mind than the representation in this chapter - the exhibition of a mysterious book in the hand of God; the proclamation of the angel, calling on any who could do it to open the book; the fact that no one in heaven or earth could do it; the tears shed by John when it was found that no one could do it; the assurance of one of the elders that the Lion of the tribe of Judah had power to do it; and the profound adoration of all in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth in view of the power entrusted to him of breaking these mysterious seals.</p>
<p style=" ">The main points in the chapter are these:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Having in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1-11">Revelation 4:1-11</span> described God as sitting on a throne, John here <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span> represents himself as seeing in his right hand a mysterious volume; written all over on the inside and the outside, yet sealed with seven seals; a volume manifestly referring to the future, and containing important disclosures respecting coming events.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) A mighty angel is introduced making a proclamation, and asking who is worthy to open that book, and to break those seals; evidently implying that none unless of exalted rank could do it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:2">Revelation 5:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) There is a pause: no one in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth, approaches to do it, or claims the right to do it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:3">Revelation 5:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) John, giving way to the expressions of natural emotion - indicative of the longing and intense desire in the human soul to be made acquainted with the secrets of the future - pours forth a flood of tears because no one is found who is worthy to open the seals of this mysterious book, or to read what was recorded there, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:4">Revelation 5:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) In his state of suspense and of grief, one of the elders - the representatives of that church for whose benefit these revelations of the future were to be made (note on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>) - approaches him and says that there is one who is able to open the book; one who has the power to loose its seals, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>. This is the Messiah - the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David - coming now to make the disclosure for which the whole book was given, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) Immediately the attention of John is attracted by the Messiah, appearing as a Lamb in the midst of the throne; with horns, the symbols of strength; and eyes, the symbols of all-pervading intelligence. He approaches and takes the book from the hand of Him that sits on the throne; symbolical of the fact that it is the province of the Messiah to make known to the church and the world the events which are to occur, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6-7">Revelation 5:6-7</span>. He appears here in a different form from that in which he manifested himself in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:0">Revelation 1:0</span>, for the purpose is different. There he appears clothed in majesty, to impress the mind with a sense of his essential glory. Here he appears in a form that recalls the memory of his sacrifice; to denote, perhaps, that it is in virtue of his atonement that the future is to be disclosed; and that therefore there is a special propriety that he should appear and do what no other one in heaven or earth could do.</p>
<p style=" ">(7) The approach of the Messiah to unfold the mysteries in the book, the fact that he had “prevailed” to accomplish what there was so strong a desire should be accomplished, furnishes an occasion for exalted thanksgiving and praise, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8-10">Revelation 5:8-10</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(8) This ascription of praise in heaven is instantly responded to, and echoed back, from all parts of the universe - all joining in acknowledging the Lamb as worthy of the exalted office to which he was raised, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:11-13">Revelation 5:11-13</span>. The angels around the throne - amounting to thousands of myriads - unite with the living creatures and the elders; and to these are joined the voices of every creature in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, and in the sea, ascribing to Him that sits upon the throne and the Lamb universal praise.</p>
<p style=" ">(9) To this loud ascription of praise from far-distant worlds the living creatures respond with a hearty “Amen,” and the elders fall down and worship him that lives forever and ever, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:14">Revelation 5:14</span>. The universe is held in wondering expectation of the disclosures which are to be made, and from all parts of the universe there is an acknowledgment that the Lamb of God alone has the right to break the mysterious seals. The importance of the developments justifies the magnificence of this representation; and it would not be possible to imagine a more sublime introduction to these great events.</p>
