<p style=" "><b>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And we shall reign on the earth - </b>The redeemed, of whom we are the representatives. The idea clearly is, in accordance with what is so frequently said in the Scriptures, that the dominion on the earth will be given to the saints; that is, that there will be such a prevalence of true religion, and the redeemed will be so much in the ascendency, that the affairs of the nations will be in their hands. Righteous people will hold the offices; will fill places of trust and responsibility; will have a controlling voice in all that pertains to human affairs. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:27">Daniel 7:27</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:1-6">Revelation 20:1-6</span> notes. To such a prevalence of religion all things are tending; and to this, in all the disorder and sin which now exist, are we permitted to look forward. It is not said that this will be a reign under the Saviour in a literal kingdom on the earth; nor is it said that the saints will descend from heaven, and occupy thrones of power under Christ as a visible king. The simple affirmation is, that they will reign on the earth; and as this seems to be spoken in the name of the redeemed, all that is necessary to be understood is, that there will be such a prevalence of true religion on the earth that it will become a vast kingdom of holiness, and that, instead of being in the minority, the saints will everywhere have the ascendency.</p>
