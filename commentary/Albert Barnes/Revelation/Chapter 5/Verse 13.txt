<p style=" "><b>And every creature which is in heaven - </b>The meaning of this verse is, that all created things seemed to unite in rendering honor to Him who sat on the throne, and to the Lamb. in the previous verse a certain number - a vast host - of angels are designated as rendering praise as they stood round the area occupied by the throne, the elders, and the living creatures; here it is added that all who were in heaven united in this ascription of praise.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And on the earth - </b>All the universe was heard by John ascribing praise to God. A voice was heard from the heavens, from all parts of the earth, from under the earth, and from the depths of the sea, as if the entire universe joined in the adoration. It is not necessary to press the language literally, and still less, is it necessary to understand by it, as Prof. Stuart does, that the angels who presided over the earth, over the under-world, and over the sea, are intended. It is evidently popular language; and the sense is, that John heard a universal ascription of praise. All worlds seemed to join in it; all the dwellers on the earth, and under the earth, and in the sea, partook of the spirit of heaven in rendering honor to the Redeemer.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Under the earth - </b>Supposed to be inhabited by the shades of the dead. See the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+10:21-22">Job 10:21-22</span> notes; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:9">Isaiah 14:9</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And such as are in the sea - </b>All that dwell in the ocean. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+148:7-10">Psalms 148:7-10</span>, “dragons, and all deeps; beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl,” are called on to praise the Lord; and there is no more incongruity or impropriety in one description than in the other. In the Psalm, the universe is called on to render praise; in the passage before us it is described as actually doing it. The hills, the streams, the floods; the fowls of the air, the dwellers in the deep, and the beasts that roam over the earth; the songsters in the grove, and the insects that play in the sunbeam, in fact, declare the glory of their Creator; and it requires no very strong effort of the fancy to imagine the universe as sending up a constant voice of thanksgiving.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Blessing, and honour, ... - </b>There is a slight change here from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span>, but it is the same thing substantially. It is an ascription of all glory to God and to the Lamb.</p>
