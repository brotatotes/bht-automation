<p style=" "><b>And no man in heaven - </b>No one - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οὐδεὶς</span></span> oudeis. There is no limitation in the original to man. The idea is, that there was no one in heaven - evidently alluding to the created beings there - who could open the volume. Is it not taught here that angels cannot penetrate the future, and disclose what is to come? Are not their faculties limited in this respect like those of man?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor in earth - </b>Among all classes of people - sages, divines, prophets, philosophers - who among those have ever been able to penetrate the future, and disclose what is to come?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither under the earth - </b>These divisions compose, in common language, the universe: what is in heaven above; what is on the earth; and whatever there is under the earth - the abodes of the dead. May there not be an allusion here to the supposed science of necromancy, and an assertion that even the dead cannot penetrate the future, and disclose what is to come? Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:19">Isaiah 8:19</span>. In all these great realms no one advanced who was qualified to undertake the office of making a disclosure of what the mysterious scroll might contain.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was able to open the book - </b>Had ability - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἠδύνατε</span></span> ēdunate - to do it. It was a task beyond their power. Even if anyone had been found who had a rank and a moral character which might have seemed to justify the effort, there was no one who had the power of reading what was recorded respecting coming events.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither to look thereon - </b>That is, so to open the seals as to have a view of what was written therein. That it was not beyond their power merely to see the book is apparent from the fact that John himself saw it in the hand of him that sat on the throne; and it is evident also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span> that in that sense the elders saw it. But no one could prevail to inspect the contents, or so have access to the interior of the volume as to be able to see what was written there. It could be seen, indeed <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span>, that it was written on both sides of the parchment, but what the writing was no one could know.</p>
