<p style=" "><b>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne - </b>We are not to suppose that he was in the center of the throne itself, but he was a conspicuous object when the throne and the elders and the living beings were seen. He was so placed as to seem to be in the midst of the group made up of the throne, the living beings, and the elders.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And of the four beasts - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Stood a Lamb - </b>An appellation often given to the Messiah, for two reasons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1)Because the lamb was an emblem of innocence and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Because a lamb was offered commonly in sacrifice. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As it had been slain - </b>That is, in some way having the appearance of having been slain; having some marks or indications about it that it had been slain. What those were the writer does not specify. If it were covered with blood, or there were marks of mortal wounds, it would be all that the representation demands. The great work which the Redeemer performed - that of making an atonement for sin - was thus represented to John in such a way that he at once recognized him, and saw the reason why the office of breaking the seals was entrusted to him. It should be remarked that this representation is merely symbolic, and we are not to suppose that the Redeemer really assumed this form, or that he appears in this form in heaven. We should no more suppose that the Redeemer appear: literally as a lamb in heaven with numerous eyes and horns, than that there is a literal throne and a sea of glass there; that there are “seats” there, and “elders,” and “crowns of gold.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having seven horns - </b>Emblems of authority and power - for the horn is a symbol of power and dominion. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:17">Deuteronomy 33:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:11">1 Kings 22:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+48:25">Jeremiah 48:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:18">Zechariah 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:24">Daniel 7:24</span>. The propriety of this symbol is laid in the fact that the strength of an animal is in the horn, and that it is by this that he obtains a victory over other animals. The number seven here seems to be designed, as in other places, to denote completeness. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>. The meaning is, that he had so large a number as to denote complete dominion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And seven eyes - </b>Symbols of intelligence. The number seven here also denotes completeness; and the idea is, that he is able to survey all things. John does not say anything as to the relative arrangement of the horns and eyes on the “Lamb,” and it is vain to attempt to conjecture how it was. The whole representation is symbolical, and we may understand the meaning of the symbol without being able to form an exact conception of the figure as it appeared to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>. That is, which represent the seven Spirits of God; or the manifold operations of the one Divine Spirit. As the eye is the symbol of intelligence - outward objects being made visible to us by that - so it may well represent an all-pervading spirit that surveys and sees all things. The eye, in this view, among the Egyptians was an emblem of the Deity. By the “seven Spirits” here the same thing is doubtless intended as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; and if, as there supposed, the reference is to the Holy Spirit considered with respect to his manifold operations, the meaning here is, that the operations of that Spirit are to be regarded as connected with the work of the Redeemer. Thus, all the operations of the Spirit are connected with, and are a part of, the work of redemption. The expression “sent forth into all the earth,” refers to the fact that that Spirit prevades all things The Spirit of God is often represented as sent or poured out; and the meaning here is, that his operations are as if he was sent out to survey all things and to operate everywhere.
