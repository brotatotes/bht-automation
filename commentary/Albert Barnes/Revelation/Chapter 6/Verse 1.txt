<p style=" "><b>And I saw - </b>Or, I looked. He fixed his eye attentively on what was passing, as promising important disclosures. No one had been found in the universe who could open the seals but the Lamb of God <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:2-4">Revelation 5:2-4</span>; and it was natural for John, therefore, to look upon the transaction with profound interest.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When the Lamb opened one of the seals - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>. This was the first or outermost of the seals, and its being broken would permit a certain portion of the volume to be unrolled and read. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span>. The representation in this place is, therefore, that of a volume with a small portion unrolled, and written on both sides of the parchment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I heard, as it were the noise of thunder - </b>One of the four living creatures speaking as with a voice of thunder, or with a loud voice.</p>
<p style=" "><b>One of the four beasts - </b>notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6-7">Revelation 4:6-7</span>. The particular one is not mentioned, though what is said in the subsequent verses leaves no doubt that it was the first in order as seen by John - the one like a lion, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>. In the opening of the three following seals, it is expressly said that it was the second, the third, and the fourth of the living creatures that drew near, and hence the conclusion is certain that the one here referred to was the first. If the four living creatures be understood to be emblematic of the divine providential administration, then there was a propriety that they should be represented as summoning John to witness what was to be disclosed. These events pertained to the developments of the divine purposes, and these emblematic beings would therefore be interested in what was occurring.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Come and see - </b>Addressed evidently to John. He was requested to approach and see with his own eyes what was disclosed in the portion of the volume now unrolled. He had wept much <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:4">Revelation 5:4</span> that no one was found who was worthy to open that book, but he was now called on to approach and see for himself. Some have supposed (Lord, in loco) that the address here was not to John, but to the horse and his rider, and that the command to them was not to “come and see,” but to come forth, and appear on the stage, and that the act of the Redeemer in breaking the seal, and unrolling the scroll, was nothing more than an emblem signifying that it was by his act that the divine purposes were to be unfolded. But, in order to this interpretation, it would be necessary to omit from the Received Text the words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καὶ βλέπε</span></span> kai blepe - “and see.” This is done, indeed, by Hahn and Tittmann, and this reading is followed by Prof. Stuart, though he says that the received text has “probability” in its favor, and is followed by some of the critical editions. The most natural interpretation, however, is that the words were addressed to John. John saw the Lamb open the seal; he heard the loud voice; he looked and beheld a white horse - that is, evidently, he looked on the unfolding volume, and saw the representation of a horse and his rider. That the voice was addressed to John is the common interpretation, is the most natural, and is liable to no real objection.</p>
