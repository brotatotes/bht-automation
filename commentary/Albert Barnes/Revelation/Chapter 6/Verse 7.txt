And when he had opened the fourth seal - See the notes at Revelation 5:1.I heard the voice of the fourth beast say - The flying eagle. See the notes at Revelation 15:7. As in the other cases, there does not appear to have been any particular reason why the fourth of the living creatures should have made this proclamation rather than either of the others. It was poetic and appropriate to represent each one in his turn as making proclamation.Come and see - See the notes at Revelation 6:1.
