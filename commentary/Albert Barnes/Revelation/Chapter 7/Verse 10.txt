<p style=" "><b>And cried with a loud voice - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:7">Zechariah 4:7</span>. This is expressive of the greatness of their joy; the ardor and earnestness of their praise.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Salvation to our God - </b>The word rendered “salvation” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηρία</span></span> sōtēria - means properly “safety, deliverance, preservation”; then welfare or prosperity; then victory; then, in a Christian sense, deliverance from punishment and admission to eternal life. Here the idea seems to be that their deliverance from sin, danger, persecution, and death, was to be ascribed solely to God. It cannot be meant, as the words would seem to imply, that they desired that God might have salvation; but the sense is, that their salvation was to be attributed entirely to him. This will undoubtedly be the song of the released forever, and all who reach the heavenly world will feel that they owe their deliverance from eternal death, and their admission to glory, wholly to him. Prof. Robinson (Lexicon) renders the word “victory” here. The fair meaning is, that whatever is included in the word “salvation” will be due to God alone - the deliverance from sin, danger, and death; the triumph over every foe; the resurrection from the grave; the rescue from eternal burnings; the admission to a holy heaven - victory in all that that word implies will be due to God.</p>

<p style=" "><b>And unto the Lamb - </b>notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. God the Father, and He who is the Lamb of God, alike claim, the honor of salvation. It is observable here that the redeemed ascribe their salvation to the Lamb as well as to Him who is on the throne. Could they do this if he who is referred to as the “Lamb” were a mere man? Could they if he were an angel? Could they if he were not equal with the Father? Do those who are in heaven worship a creature? Will they unite a created being with the Anointed One in acts of solemn adoration and praise?</p>
