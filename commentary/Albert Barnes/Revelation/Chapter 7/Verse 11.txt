And all the angels stood round about the throne - notes on Revelation 5:11.And about the elders - notes on Revelation 4:4.And the four beasts - notes on Revelation 4:6. The meaning is, that the angels stood in the outer circle, or outside of the elders and the four living creatures. The redeemed, it is manifest, occupied the inner circle, and were near the throne, though their precise location is not mentioned. The angels sympathize with the church redeemed and triumphant, as they did with the church in its conflicts and trials, and they now appropriately unite with that church in adoring and praising God. They see in that redemption new displays of the character of God, and they rejoice that that church is rescued from its troubles, and is now brought triumphant to heaven.And fell before the throne on their faces - The usual position of profound adoration, Revelation 4:10; Revelation 5:8.And worshipped God - notes on Revelation 5:11-12.
