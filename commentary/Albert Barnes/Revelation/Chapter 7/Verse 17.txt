<p style=" "><b>For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne - </b>notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. He is still the great agent in promoting the happiness of the redeemed in heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall feed them - </b>Rather, shall exercise over them the office of a shepherd - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμανεῖ</span></span> poimainō. This includes much more than mere feeding. It embraces all the care which a shepherd takes of his flock - watching them, providing for them, guarding them from danger. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+23:1-2">Psalms 23:1-2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+23:5">Psalms 23:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:8">Psalms 36:8</span>. See this fully illustrated in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:11">Isaiah 40:11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And shall lead them unto living fountains of waters - </b>Living fountains refer to running streams, as contrasted with standing water and stagnant pools. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:10">John 4:10</span>. The allusion is undoubtedly to the happiness of heaven, represented as fresh and everflowing, like streams in the desert. No image of happiness, perhaps, is more vivid, or would be more striking to an Oriental, than that of such fountains flowing in sandy and burning wastes. The word “living” here must refer to the fact that that happiness will be perennial. These fountains will always bubble; these streams will never dry up. The thirst for salvation will always be gratified; the soul will always be made happy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes - </b>This is a new image of happiness taken from another place in Isaiah <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span>, “The Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.” The expression is one of exquisite tenderness and beauty. The poet Burns said that he could never read this without being affected to weeping. Of all the negative descriptions of heaven, there is no one perhaps that would be better adapted to produce consolation than this. This is a world of weeping - a vale of tears. Philosophers have sought a brief definition of man, and have sought in vain. Would there be any better description of him, as representing the reality of his condition here, than to say that he is one who weeps? Who is there of the human family that has not shed a tear? Who that has not wept over the grave of a friend; over his own losses and cares; over his disappointments; over the treatment he has received from others; over his sins; over the follies, vices, and woes of his fellow-men?</p>
<p style=" ">And what a change would it make in our world if it could be said that henceforward not another tear would be shed; not a head would ever be bowed again in grief! Yet this is to be the condition of heaven. In that world there is to be no pain, no disappointment, no bereavement. No friend is to lie in dreadful agony on a sick-bed; no grave is to be opened to receive a parent, a wife, a child; no gloomy prospect of death is to draw tears of sorrow from the eyes. To that blessed world, when our eyes run down with tears, are we permitted to look forward; and the prospect of such a world should contribute to wipe away our tears here - for all our sorrows will soon be over. As already remarked, there was a beautiful propriety, at a time when such calamities impended over the church and the world - when there was such a certainty of persecution and sorrow - in permitting the mind to rest on the contemplation of these happy scenes in heaven, where all the redeemed, in white robes, and with palms of victory in their hands, would be gathered before the throne. To us also now, amidst the trials of the present life - when friends leave us; when sickness comes; when our hopes are blasted; when calumnies and reproaches come upon us; when, standing on the verge of the grave, and looking down into the cold tomb, the eyes pour forth floods of tears - it is a blessed privilege to be permitted to look forward to that brighter scene in heaven, where not a pang shall ever be felt, and not a tear shall ever be shed.</p>
