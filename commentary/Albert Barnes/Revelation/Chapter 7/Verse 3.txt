<p style=" "><b>Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea ... - </b>Let the winds be restrained until what is here designated shall be done. These destroying angels were commanded to suspend the work of destruction until the servants of God could be rendered secure. The division here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:1">Revelation 7:1</span>, of the “earth, the sea, and the trees,” seems to include everything - water, land, and the productions of the earth. Nothing was to be injured until the angel should designate the true servants of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Till we have sealed the servants of our God - </b>The use of the plural “we” seems to denote that he did not expect to do it alone. Who were to be associated with him, whether angels or human beings, he does not intimate; but the work was evidently such that it demanded the agency of more than one.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In their foreheads - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:2">Revelation 7:2</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+9:4-5">Ezekiel 9:4-5</span>. A mark thus placed on the forehead would be conspicuous, and would be something which could at once be recognized if destruction should spread over the world. The fulfillment of this is to be found in two things:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (a)In something which would be conspicuous or prominent - so that it could be seen; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (b)In the mark being of such a nature or character that it would be a proper designation of the fact that they were the true servants of God.</p>
