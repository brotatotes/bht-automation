<p style=" "><b>And I beheld - </b>My attention was attracted by a new vision.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And heard an angel flying, ... - </b>I heard the voice of an angel making this proclamation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Woe, woe, woe - </b>That is, there will be great woe. The repetition of the word is intensive, and the idea is, that the sounding of the three remaining trumpets would indicate great and fearful calamities. These three are grouped together as if they pertained to a similar series of events, as the first four had been. The two classes are separated from each other by this interval and by this proclamation - implying that the first series had been completed, and that there would be some interval, either of space or time, before the other series would come upon the world. All that is fairly implied here would be fulfilled by the supposition that the former referred to the West, and that the latter pertained to the East, and were to follow when those should have been completed.</p>
