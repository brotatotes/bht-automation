<p align="CENTER">Analysis Of The Chapter</p>
<p style=" ">The three remaining trumpets Rev. 9–11 are usually called the woe-trumpets, in reference to the proclamation of woes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span> (Prof. Stuart). The three extend, as I suppose, to the end of time, or, as it is supposed by the writer himself <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>, to the period when “the kingdoms of this world shall have become the kingdoms of Christ,” embracing a succinct view of the most material events that were to occur, particularly in a secular point of view. See the Analysis prefixed to the book. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>, as I understand it, a new view is commenced, referring to the church internally; the rise of Antichrist, and the effect of the rise of that formidable power on the internal history of the church, to the time of its overthrow, and the triumphant establishment of the kingdom of God. This, of course, synchronizes in its beginning and its close with the portion already passed over, but with a different view. See the Analysis prefixed to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span> ff.</p>
<p style=" ">This chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:0">Revelation 9:0</span> contains properly three parts. First, a description of the first of those trumpets, or the fifth in the order of the whole, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1-12">Revelation 9:1-12</span>. This woe is represented under the figure of calamities brought upon the earth by an immense army of locusts. A star is seen to fall from heaven representing some mighty chieftain, and to him is given the key of the bottomless pit. He opens the pit, and then comes forth an innumerable swarm of locusts that darken the heavens, and they go forth upon the earth. They have a command given them to do a certain work. They are not to hurt the earth, or any green thing, but they are sent against those people which have not the seal of God on their foreheads. Their main business, however, was not to kill them, but to torment them for a limited time - for five months. A description of the appearance of the locusts then follows. Though they are called locusts, because in their general appearance, and in the ravages they commit, they resemble them, yet, in the main, they are imaginary beings, and combine in themselves qualities which are never found united in reality.</p>
<p style=" ">They had a strong resemblance to horses prepared for battle; they wore on their heads crowns of gold; they had the faces of men but the hair of women and the teeth of lions. They had breastplates of iron, and tails like scorpions, with stings in their tails. They had a mighty king at their head, with a name significant of the destruction which he would bring upon the world. These mysterious beings had their origin in the bottomless pit, and they are summoned forth to spread desolation upon the earth. Second, a description of the second of these trumpets, the sixth in order, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:13-19">Revelation 9:13-19</span>. When this is sounded, a voice is heard from the four horns of the altar which is before God. The angel is commanded to loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. These angels are loosed - angels which had been prepared for a definite period - a day, and a month, and a year, to slay the third part of people.</p>
<p style=" ">The number of the army that would appear - composed of cavalry - is stated to amount to two hundred thousand, and the uniqueness qualities of these horsemen are then stated. They are remarkable for having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone; the heads of the horses resemble lions; and they breathe forth fire and brimstone. A third part of people fall before them, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone. Their power is in their mouth and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents. Third, a statement of the effect of the judgments brought upon the world under these trumpets, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20-21">Revelation 9:20-21</span>. The effect, so far as the reasonable result could have been anticipated, is lost. The nations are not turned from idolatry. Wickedness still abounds, and there is no disposition to repent of the abominations which had been so long practiced on the earth.</p>
