<p style=" "><b>And the fifth angel sounded - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:6-7">Revelation 8:6-7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth - </b>This denotes, as was shown in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:10">Revelation 8:10</span>, a leader, a military chieftain, a warrior. In the fulfillment of this, as in the former case, we look for the appearance of some mighty prince and warrior, to whom is given power, as it were, to open the bottomless pit, and to summon forth its legions. That some such agent is denoted by the star is further apparent from the fact that it is immediately added, that “to him (the star) was given the key of the bottomless pit.” It could not be meant that a key would be given to a literal star, and we naturally suppose, therefore, that some intelligent being of exalted rank, and of baleful influence, is here referred to Angels, good and bad, are often called stars; but the reference here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:10">Revelation 8:10</span>, seems to me not to be to angels, but to some mighty leader of armies, who was to collect his hosts, and to go through the world in the work of destruction.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to him was given the key of the bottomless pit - </b>Of the under-world, considered particularly of the abode of the wicked. This is represented often as a dark prison-house, enclosed with walls, and accessible by gates or doors. These gates or doors are fastened, so that none of the inmates can come out, and the key is in the hand of the keeper or guardian. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span> it is said that the keys of that world are in the hand of the Saviour (compare the notes on that passage); here it is said that for a time, and for a temporary purpose, they are committed to another. The word “pit” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρέαρ</span></span> phrear - denotes properly a well, or a pit for water dug in the earth; and then any pit, cave, abyss. The reference here is doubtless to the nether world, considered as the abode of the wicked dead, the prison-house of the guilty. The word “bottomless,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀβύσσος</span></span> abussos - whence our word “abyss” means properly “without any bottom” (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Α</span></span> a, the alpha privative (not), and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βύθος</span></span> buthos, depth, bottom). It would be applied properly to the ocean, or to any deep and dark dell, or to any obscure place whose depth was unknown. Here it refers to Hades - the region of the dead the abode of wicked spirits - as a deep, dark place, whose bottom was unknown. Having the key to this, is to have the power to confine those who are there, or to permit them to go at large. The meaning here is, that this master-spirit would have power to evoke the dead from these dark regions; and it would be fulfilled if some mighty genius, that could be compared with a fallen star, or a lurid meteor, should summon forth followers which would appear like the dwellers in the nether world called forth to spread desolation over the earth.</p>
