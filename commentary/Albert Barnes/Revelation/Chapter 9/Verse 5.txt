<p style=" "><b>And to them it was given - </b>There is here the same indefiniteness as in the former verse, the impersonal verb being here also used. The writer does not say by whom this power was given, whether by God, or by the leader of the host. It may be admitted, however, that the most natural interpretation is to suppose that it was given them by God, and that this was the execution of his purpose in this case. Still it is remarkable that this is not directly affirmed, and that the language is so general as to admit of the other application. The fact that they did not kill them, but tormented them - if such a fact should be found to exist - would be in every sense a fulfillment of what is here said.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That they should not kill them - </b>This is in accordance with the nature of the symbol. The locusts do not themselves destroy any living creature; and the sting of the scorpion, though exceedingly painful, is not usually fatal. The proper fulfillment of this would be found in what would not be generally fatal, but which would diffuse misery and wretchedness. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:6">Revelation 9:6</span>.) Perhaps all that would be necessarily meant by this would be, not that individual people would not be killed, but that they would be sent to inflict plagues and torments rather than to take life, and that the characteristic effects of their appearing would be distress and suffering rather than death. There may be included in the fair interpretation of the words, “general distress” and “sorrow”; acts of oppression, cruelty, and violence; such a condition of public suffering that people would regard death as a relief if they could find it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But that they should be tormented - </b>That is, that they should be subjected to ills and troubles which might be properly compared with the sting of a scorpion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Five months - </b>So far as the words here are concerned this might be taken literally, denoting five months or one hundred and fifty days; or as a prophetic reckoning, where a day stands for a year. Compare the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span> ff. The latter is undoubtedly the correct interpretation here, for it is the character of the book thus to reckon time. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:15">Revelation 9:15</span>. If this be the true method of reckoning here, then it will be necessary to find some events which will embrace about the period of one hundred and fifty years, during which this distress and sorrow would continue. The proper laws of interpretation demand that one or the other of these periods should be found - either that of five months literally, or that of 150 years. It may be true, as Prof. Stuart suggests (in loco), that “the usual time of locusts is from May to September inclusive - five months.” It may be true, also, that this symbol was chosen partly because that was the fact, and they would, from that fact, be well adapted to symbolize a period that could be spoken of as “five months”; but still the meaning must be more than simply it was “a short period,” as he supposes. The phrase a few months might designate such a period; but if that had been the writer’s intention, he would not have selected the definite number five.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, ... - </b>See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:3">Revelation 9:3</span>. That is, it would be painful, severe, dangerous.</p>
