<p style=" "><b>Paul - </b>The original name of the author of this Epistle was “Saul.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:1">Acts 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>, etc. This was changed to Paul (see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span>), and by this name he is generally known in the New Testament. The reason why he assumed this name is not certainly known. It was, however, in accordance with the custom of the times; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span>. The name Saul was Hebrew; the name Paul was Roman. In addressing a letter to the Romans, he would naturally make use of the name to which they were accustomed, and which would excite no prejudice among them. The ancient custom was to begin an epistle with the name of the writer, as Cicero to Varro, etc. We record the name at the end. It may be remarked, however, that the placing the name of the writer at the beginning of an epistle was always done, and is still, when the letter was one of authority, or when it conferred any special privileges. Thus, in the proclamation of Cyrus <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+1:2">Ezra 1:2</span>, “Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia,” etc.; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+4:11">Ezra 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+7:12">Ezra 7:12</span>. “Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest,” etc. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+4:1">Daniel 4:1</span>. The commencement of a letter by an apostle to a Christian church in this manner was especially proper as indicating authority.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A servant - </b>This name was what the Lord Jesus himself directed His disciples to use, as their general appellation; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:25">Matthew 10:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:27">Matthew 20:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:44">Mark 10:44</span>. And it was the customary name which they assumed; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Col 4:12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:1">Jude 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>. The proper meaning of this word servant, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοῦλος</span></span> doulos, is slave, one who is not free. It expresses the condition of one who has a master, or who is at the control of another. It is often, however, applied to courtiers, or the officers that serve under a king: because in an eastern monarchy the relation of an absolute king to his courtiers corresponded nearly to that of a master and a slave. Thus, the word is expressive of dignity and honor; and the servants of a king denote officers of a high rank and station. It is applied to the prophets as those who were honored by God, or especially entrusted by him with office; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+34:5">Deuteronomy 34:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jos+1:2">Joshua 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:4">Jeremiah 25:4</span>. The name is also given to the Messiah, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</span>, “Behold my servant in whom my soul delighteth,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span>, “shall my righteous servant justify many.” The apostle uses it here evidently to denote his acknowledging Jesus Christ as his master; as indicating his dignity, as especially appointed by him to his great work; and as showing that in this Epistle he intended to assume no authority of his own, but simply to declare the will of his master, and theirs.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Called to be an apostle - </b>This word called means here not merely to be invited, but has the sense of appointed. It indicates that he had not assumed the office himself, but that he was set apart to it by the authority of Christ himself. It was important for Paul to state this,</p>
<p style=" ">It was of consequence for him therefore, to affirm that he had not taken this high office to himself, but that he had been called to it by the authority of Jesus Christ. His appointment to this office he not infrequently takes occasion to vindicate; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>, etc.: <span class="_0000ff"><u>Gal 1:12-24</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:7">1 Timothy 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:11">2 Timothy 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>An apostle - </b>One sent to execute a commission. It is applied because the apostles were sent out by Jesus Christ to preach his gospel, and to establish his church; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:2">Matthew 10:2</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span> note.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Separated - </b>The word translated “separated unto,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀφορίζω</span></span> aphorizō, means to designate, to mark out by fixed limits, to bound as a field, etc. It denotes those who are “separated,” or called out from the common mass; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Act 19:9</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:17">2 Corinthians 6:17</span>. The meaning here does not materially differ from the expression, “called to be an apostle,” except that perhaps this includes the notion of the purpose or designation of God to this work. Thus, Paul uses the same word respecting himself; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>, “God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,” that is, God designated me; marked me out; or designed that I should be an apostle from my infancy. In the same way Jeremiah was designated to be a prophet; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+1:5">Jeremiah 1:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto the gospel of God - </b>Designated or designed by God that I should make it “my business” to preach the gospel. Set apart to this, as the special, great work of my life; as having no other object for which I should live. For the meaning of the word “gospel,” see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. It is called the gospel of God because it is his appointment; it has been originated by him, and has his authority. The function of an apostle was to preach the gospel Paul regarded himself as separated to this work. It was not to live in splendor, wealth, and ease, but to devote himself to this great business of proclaiming good news, that God was reconciled to people in his Son. This is the sole business of all ministers of “religion.”</p>
