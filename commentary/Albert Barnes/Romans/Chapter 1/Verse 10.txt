<p style=" "><b>Making request - </b>It was his earnest desire to see them, and he presented the subject before God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If by any means - </b>This shows the earnest desire which he had to see them, and implies that be had designed it, and had been hindered; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Now at length - </b>He had purposed it a long time, but had been hindered. He doubtless cherished this purpose for years. The expressions in the Greek imply an earnest wish that this long-cherished purpose might be accomplished before long.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A prosperous journey - </b>A safe, pleasant journey. It is right to regard all success in traveling as depending on God, and to pray for success and safety from danger. Yet all such prayers are not answered according to the letter of the petition. The prayer of Paul that be might see the Romans was granted, but in a remarkable way. He was persecuted by the Jews, and arraigned before King Agrippa. He appealed to the Roman emperor, and was taken there in chains as a prisoner. Yet the journey might in this way have a more deep effect on the Romans, than if he had gone in any other way. In so mysterious a manner does God often hear the prayers of his people; and though their prayers are answered, yet it is in his own time and way; see the last chapters of the Acts .</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the will of God - </b>If God shall grant it; if God will by his mercy grant me the great favor of my coming to you. This is a proper model of a prayer; and is in accordance with the direction of the Bible; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:14-15">James 4:14-15</span>.</p>
