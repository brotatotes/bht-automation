<p style=" "><b>For I long to see you - </b>I earnestly desire to see you; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:23">Romans 15:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:32">Romans 15:32</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That I may impart - </b>That I may “give,” or communicate to you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Some spiritual gift - </b>Some have understood this as referring to “miraculous gifts,” which it was supposed the apostles had the power of conferring on others. But this interpretation is forced and unnatural. There is no instance where this expression denotes the power of working miracles. Besides, the apostle in the next verse explains his meaning, “That I may be comforted together by the mutual faith,” etc. From this it appears that he desired to be among them to exercise the office of the ministry, to establish them in the gospel and to confirm their hopes. He expected that the preaching of the gospel would be the means of confirming them in the faith; and he desired to be the means of doing it. It was a wish of benevolence, and accords with what he says respecting his intended visit in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:29">Romans 15:29</span>, “And I am sure that when I come, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.” To make known to them more fully the blessings of the gospel, and thus to impart spiritual gifts, was the design he had in view.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the end ... - </b>With the design, or purpose.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye may be established - </b>That is, that they might be “confirmed” in the truths of the gospel. This was one design of the ministry, that Christians may be established, or strengthened, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>. It is not to have dominion ever their faith, but to be “helpers of their joy,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:24">2 Corinthians 1:24</span>. Paul did not doubt that this part of his office might be fulfilled among the Romans, and he was desirous there also of making full proof of his ministry. His wish was to preach not simply where he must, but where he might. This is the nature of this work.</p>
