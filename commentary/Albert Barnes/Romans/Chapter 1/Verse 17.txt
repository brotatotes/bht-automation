<p style=" "><b>For - </b>This word implies that he is now about to give a “reason” for what he had just said, a reason why he was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. That reason is stated in this verse. It embodies the substance of all that is contained in the Epistle. It is the doctrine which he seeks to establish; and there is not perhaps a more important passage in the Bible than this verse; or one more difficult to be understood.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Therein - </b>In it, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν οὕτῳ</span></span> en houtō, that is, in the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is the righteousness of God - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span></span> dikaiosunē Theou. There is not a more important expression to be found in the Epistle than this. It is capable of only the following interpretations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) Some have said that it means that the attribute of God which is denominated righteousness or justice, is here displayed. It has been supposed that this was the design of the gospel to make this known; or to evince his justice in his way of saving people. There is an important sense in which this is true <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>. But this does not seem to be the meaning in the passage before us. For,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) A second interpretation which has been affixed to it is, to make it the same as goodness, the benevolence of God is revealed, etc. But to this there are still stronger objections. For.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) The phrase “righteousness of God” is equivalent to God’s “plan of justifying people; his scheme of declaring them just in the sight of the Law; or of acquitting them from punishment, and admitting them to favor.” In this sense it stands opposed to man’s plan of justification, that is, by his own works: God’s plan is by faith. The way in which that is done is revealed in the gospel. The object contemplated to be done is to treat people as if they were righteous. Man attempted to accomplish this by obedience to the Law. The plan of God was to arrive at it by faith. Here the two schemes differ; and the great design of this Epistle is to show that man cannot be justified on his own plan, to wit, by works; and that the plan of God is the only way, and a wise and glorious way of making man just in the eye of the Law. No small part of the perplexity usually attending this subject will be avoided if it is remembered that the discussion in this Epistle pertains to the question, “how can mortal man be just with God?” The apostle shows that it cannot be by works; and that it “can be” by faith. This latter is what he calls the “righteousness of God” which is revealed in the gospel.</p>
<p style=" ">To see that this is the meaning, it is needful only to look at the connection; and at the usual meaning of the words. The word to “justify,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιόω</span></span> dikaioō, means properly “to be just, to be innocent, to be righteous.” It then means to “declare,” or treat as righteous; as when a man is charged with an offence. and is acquitted. If the crime alleged is not proved against him, he is declared by the Law to be innocent. It then means to “treat as if innocent, to regard as innocent;” that is, to pardon, to forgive, and consequently to treat as if the offence had not occurred. It does not mean that the man did not commit the offence; or that the Law might not have held him answerable for it; but that the offence is forgiven; and it is consistent to receive the offender into favor, and treat him as if he had not committed it. In what way this may be done rests with him who has the pardoning power. And in regard to the salvation of man, it rests solely with God. and must be done in that way only which he appoints and approves. The design of Paul in this Epistle is to show how this is done, or to show that it is done by faith. It may be remarked here that the expression before us does not imply any particular manner in which it is done; it does not touch the question whether it is by imputed righteousness or not; it does not say that it is on legal principles; it simply affirms “that the gospel contains God’s plan of justifying people by faith.”</p>
<p style=" ">The primary meaning of the word is, therefore, “to be innocent, pure, etc.” and hence, the name means “righteousness” in general. For this use of the word, see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:15">Matthew 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6">Matthew 5:6</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:32">Matthew 21:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:75">Luke 1:75</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:35">Acts 10:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:10">Acts 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:26">Romans 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" ">In the sense of pardoning sin, or of treating people as if they were innocent, on the condition of faith, it is used often, and especially in this Epistle; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:30">Romans 3:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21-22">Romans 3:21-22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:6">Romans 4:6</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:13">Romans 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" ">It is called “God’s” righteousness, because it is God’s plan, in distinction from all the plans set up by people. It was originated by him; it differs from all others; and it claims him as its author, and tends to his glory. It is called his righteousness, as it is the way by which he receives and treats people as righteous. The same plan was foretold in various places where the word “righteousness” is nearly synonymous with “salvation;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:5">Isaiah 56:5</span> “My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:6">Isaiah 56:6</span>, “My salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:1">Isaiah 56:1</span>, “My salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>, “To make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness.”</p>
<p style=" ">(There is yet another sense lying on the very surface of the passage, and adopted by nearly all the evangelical expositors, according to which “the righteousness of God” is that righteousness, which Christ worked out in his active and passive obedience. This is a righteousness which God hath devised, procured, and accepted. It is therefore eminently His. It is imputed to believers, and on account of it they are held righteous in the sight of God. It is of the highest importance that the true meaning of this leading expression be preserved; for if it be explained away, the doctrine of imputed righteousness is materially affected, as will appear in a subsequent note.</p>
<p style=" ">That the phrase is to be understood of the righteousness which Christ has procured by his obedience and death, appears from the general sense of the original term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσύνη</span></span> dikaiosunē. Mr. Haldane in a long and elaborate comment on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span>, has satisfactorily shown that it signifies “righteousness in the abstract, and also conformity to law,” and that “Wherever it refers to the subject of man’s salvation, and is not merely a personal attribute of Deity, it signifies that righteousness which, in conformity with his justice, God has appointed and provided.”</p>
<p style=" ">Besides, if the expression be understood of “God’s plan of justifying men,” we shall have great difficulty in explaining the parallel passages. They will not bend to any such principle of interpretation, In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>, this righteousness is spoken of as a “gift” which we “receive,” and in the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:19">Romans 5:19</span> verses, the “righteousness of one” and “the obedience of one,” are used as convertible terms. Now it is easy to understand how the righteousness which Christ has procured by his obedience, becomes “a gift,” but “a plan of justification” is appropriately said to be declared, or promulgated. It cannot be spoken of in the light of a gift received. The same observation applies with still greater force to the passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>, “For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” How would this passage appear, if “plan of justification” were substituted for righteousness of God?</p>
<p style=" ">In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:9">Philippians 3:9</span>, Paul desires to be found in Christ, “not having his own righteousness, which is of the land, but what is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.” Is not his own righteousness what he could attain to by his works or obedience, and is not the righteousness of Christ what Jesus had procured by his obedience?</p>
<p style=" ">Lastly, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:3">Romans 10:3</span>, the righteousness of God is thus opposed to the righteousness of man, “they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.” Now what is that righteousness which natural people seek to establish, and which is especially called “their own?” Doubtless it is a righteousness founded on their own works, and therefore what is here properly opposed to it is a righteousness founded on the “work of God. See Haldane, Hodge, Scott, Guyse, etc.” This meaning of the term furnishes a key to unlock “all” the passages in which it is used in connection with the sinner’s justification, whereas any other sense, however it may suit a few places, will be found generally inapplicable.)</p>
<p style=" ">In regard to this plan it may be observed;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)It is not to take part with the sinner, and to mitigate his offences. It admits them to their full extent; and makes him feel them also.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)It is not that we become partakers of the essential righteousness of God. That is impossible.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)It is not that his righteousness becomes ours. This is not true; and there is no intelligible sense in which that can be understood.</p>
<p style=" ">(It is true indeed that the righteousness of Christ cannot be called ours in the sense of our having actually accomplished it in our own persons. This is a view of imputation easily held up to ridicule, yet there is a sense in which the righteousness of Christ may be ours. Though we have not achieved it, yet it may be so placed to our account that we shall be held righteous, and treated as such. I have said, first, we shall be held righteous, and then treated as such; for God treats none as righteous who in some sense or other are not really so. See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>.)</p>
<p style=" ">But it is God’s plan for pardoning sin, and for treating us as if we had not committed it; that is, adopting us as his children, and admitting us to heaven on the ground of what the Lord Jesus has done in our stead. This is God’s plan. People seek to save themselves by their own works. God’s plan is to save them by the merits of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Revealed - </b>Made known, and communicated. The gospel states the fact that God has such a plan of justification; and shows the way or manner in which it might be done. The fact seems to have been understood by Abraham, and the patriarchs <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:0">Hebrews 11:0</span>, but the full mode or manner in which it was to be accomplished, was not revealed until it was done in the gospel of Christ. And because this great and glorious truth was thus made known, Paul was not ashamed of the gospel. Nor should we be.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From faith - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐκ πίστεως</span></span> ek pisteōs. This phrase I take to be connected with the expression, “the righteousness of God.” Thus, the righteousness of God, or God’s plan of justifying people by faith, is revealed in the gospel. Here the great truth of the gospel is brought out, that people are justified by faith, and not by the deeds of the Law. The common interpretation of the passage has been, that the righteousness of God in this is revealed from one degree of faith to another. But to this interpretation there are many objections.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (1) It is not true. The gospel was not designed for this. It did not “suppose” that people had a certain degree of faith by nature which needed only to be strengthened in order that they might be saved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2) It does not make good sense. To say that the righteousness of God, meaning, as is commonly understood, his essential justice, is revealed from one degree of faith to another, is to use words without any meaning.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3) The connection of the passage does not admit of this interpretation. The design of the passage is evidently to set forth the doctrine of justification as the grand theme of remark, and it does not comport with that design to introduce here the advance from one degree of faith to another, as the main topic.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4) The Epistle is intended clearly to establish the fact that people are justified by faith. This is the grand idea which is kept up; and to show how this may be done is the main purpose before the apostle; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:30">Romans 3:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:32">Romans 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6">Romans 10:6</span>, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5) The passage which he immediately quotes shows that he did not speak of different degrees of faith, but of the doctrine that people are to be justified by faith.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To faith - </b>Unto those who believe (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span>); or to everyone that believeth, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>. The abstract is here put for the concrete. It is designed to express the idea, “that God’s plan of justifying people is revealed in the gospel, which plan is by faith, and the benefits of which plan shall be extended to all that have faith, or that believe.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>As it is written - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The just shall live by faith - </b>The Septuagint translate the passage in Habakkuk, ‘If any man shall draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him, but the just by my faith,” or by faith in me, “shall live.” The very words are used by them which are employed by the apostle, except they add the word “my,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μοῦ</span></span> mou, my faith. The Syriac renders it in a similar manner, “The just by faith shall live.” The meaning of the Hebrew in Habakkuk is the same. It does not refer originally to the doctrine of justification by faith; but its meaning is this, “The just man, or the righteous man, shall live by his confidence in God.” The prophet is speaking of the woes attending the Babylonish captivity. The Chaldeans were to come upon the land and destroy it, and remove the nation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:6-10">Romans 1:6-10</span>. But this was not to be perpetual. It should have an end <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:3">Romans 2:3</span>, and they who had confidence in God should live <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>; that is, should be restored to their country, should be blessed and made happy. Their confidence in God should sustain them, and preserve them. This did not refer primarily to the doctrine of justification by faith, nor did the apostle so quote it, but it expressed a general principle that those who had confidence in God should be happy, and be preserved and blessed. This would express the doctrine which Paul was defending. It was not by relying on his own merit that the Israelite would be delivered, but it was by confidence in God, by his strength and mercy. On the same principle would men be saved under the gospel. It was not by reliance on their own works or merit; it was by confidence in God, by faith, that they were to live.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall live - </b>In Habakkuk this means to be made happy, or blessed; shall find comfort, and support, and deliverance. So in the gospel the blessings of salvation are represented as life, eternal life. Sin is represented as death, and man by nature is represented as dead in trespasses and sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>. The gospel restores to life and salvation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:53">John 6:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31">John 20:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:28">Acts 2:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</span>. This expression, therefore, does not mean, as it is sometimes supposed, the “justified by faith” shall live; but it is expressive of a general principle in relation to people, that they shall be defended, preserved, made happy, not by their own merits, or strength, but by confidence in God. This principle is exactly applicable to the gospel plan of salvation. Those who rely on God the Saviour shall be justified, and saved.</p>
