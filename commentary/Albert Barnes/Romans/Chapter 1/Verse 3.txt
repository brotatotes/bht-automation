<p style=" "><b>Concerning his Son - </b>This is connected with the first verse, with the word “gospel.” The gospel of God concerning his Son. The design of the gospel was to make a communication relative to his Son Jesus Christ. This is the whole of it. There is no “good news” to man respecting salvation except what comes by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which was made - </b>The word translated “was made” means usually “to be,” or “to become.” It is used, however, in the sense of being born. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>, “God sent forth his Son made of a woman,” born of a woman. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>, “before Abraham was (born), I am.” In this sense it seems to be used here, who was born, or descended from the seed of David.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the seed of David - </b>Of the posterity or lineage of David. He was a descendant of David. David was perhaps the most illustrious of the kings of Israel. The promise to him was that there should not fail a man to sit on this throne; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:4">1 Kings 2:4</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ki 8:25</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+9:5">1 Kings 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+6:16">2 Chronicles 6:16</span>. This ancient promise was understood as referring to the Messiah, and hence, in the New Testament he is called the descendant of David, and so much pains is taken to show that he was of his line; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:27">Luke 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:27">Matthew 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:22">Matthew 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:23">Matthew 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:15">Matthew 21:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:42">Matthew 22:42</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:45">Matthew 22:45</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Joh 7:42</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:8">2 Timothy 2:8</span>. As the Jews universally believed that the Messiah would be descended from David <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:42">John 7:42</span>, it was of great importance for the sacred writers to make it out clearly that Jesus of Nazareth was of that line and family. Hence, it happened, that though our Saviour was humble, and poor, and obscure, yet he had that on which no small part of the world have been accustomed so much to pride themselves, an illustrious ancestry. To a Jew there could be scarcely any honor so high as to be descended from the best of their kings; and it shows how little the Lord Jesus esteemed the honors of this world, that he could always evince his deep humility in circumstances where people are usually proud; and that when he spoke of the honors of this world, and told how little they were worth, he was not denouncing what was not within his reach.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to the flesh - </b>The word “flesh,” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σάρξ</span></span> sarx, is used in the Scriptures in a great variety of significations.</p>
<p style=" ">(1) It denotes, as with us, the flesh literally of any living being; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:39">Luke 24:39</span>, “A spirit hath not flesh and bones,” etc.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The animal system, the body, including flesh and bones, the visible part of man, in distinction from the invisible, or the soul; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>, “Neither did his flesh (his body) “see corruption.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:39">1 Corinthians 15:39</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The man, the whole animated system, body and soul; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>, “In the likeness of sinful flesh. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:50">1 Corinthians 15:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:6">Luke 3:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) Human nature. As a man. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:30">Acts 2:30</span>, “God hath sworn with an oath that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh, that is, in his human nature, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>, “whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever.” The same is its meaning here. He was a descendant of David in his human nature, or as a man. This implies, of course, that he had another nature besides his human, or that while he was a man he was also something else; that there was a nature in which he was not descended from David.</p>
<p style=" ">That this is its meaning will still further appear by the following observations.</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The apostle expressly makes a contrast between his condition according to the flesh, and that according to the spirit of holiness.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The expression “according to the flesh” is applied to no other one in the New Testament but to Jesus Christ. Though the word “flesh” often occurs, and is often used to denote man, yet the special expression, “according to the flesh” occurs in no other connection.</p>
<p style=" ">In all the Scriptures it is never said of any prophet or apostle, any lawgiver or king, or any man in any capacity, that he came in the flesh, or that he was descended from certain ancestors according to the flesh. Nor is such an expression ever used any where else. If it were applied to a mere man, we should instantly ask in what other way could he come than in the flesh? Has he a higher nature? Is he an angel, or a seraph? The expression would be unmeaningful. And when, therefore, it is applied to Jesus Christ, it implies, if language has any meaning, that there was a sense in which Jesus was not descended from David. What that was, appears in the next verse.</p>
