<p style=" "><b>Among whom - </b>That is, among the Gentiles who had become obedient to the Christian faith in accordance with the design of the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>. This proves that the church at Rome was made up partly at least, if not mainly, of Gentiles or pagans. This is fully proved in the xvith. chapter by the names of the persons whom Paul salutes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The called of Jesus Christ - </b>Those whom Jesus Christ has called to be his followers. The word “called” (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>) denotes not merely an external invitation to privilege, but it also denotes the “internal” or “effectual” call which secures conformity to the will of him who calls, and is thus synonymous with the name Christians, or believers. That true Christians are contemplated by this address, is clear from the whole scope of the Epistle; see particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:0">Romans 8:0</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>.</p>
