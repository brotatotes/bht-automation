<p style=" "><b>For God is my witness - </b>The reason of this strong appeal to God is, to show to the Romans the deep interest which he felt in their welfare This interest was manifested in his prayers, and in his earnest desires to see them. A deep interest shown in this way was well suited to prepare them to receive what he had to say to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whom I serve - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:23">Acts 17:23</span>. The expression denotes that he was devoted to God in this manner; that he obeyed him; and had given himself to do his will in making known his gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With my spirit - </b>Greek, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐν</span></span> en, in my spirit, that is, with my “heart.” It is not an external service merely; it is internal, real, sincere. He was really and sincerely devoted to the service of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the gospel of his Son - </b>In making known the gospel, or as a minister of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That without ceasing - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀδιαλείπτως</span></span> adialeiptōs. This word means constantly, always, without intermission. It was not only once, but repeatedly. It had been the burden of his prayers. The same thing he also mentions in regard to other churches, <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Th 1:3</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I make mention - </b>I call you to remembrance, and present your case before God. This evinced his remarkable interest in a church which he had never seen, and it shows that Paul was a man of prayer; praying not for his friends and kindred only, but for those whom he had never seen. If with the same intensity of prayer all Christians, and Christian ministers, would remember the churches, what a different aspect would the Christian church soon assume!</p>
<p style=" "><b>Always - </b>This word should be connected with the following verse, “Always making request,” etc.</p>
