<p style=" "><b>For whosoever shall call ... - </b>This sentiment is found substantially in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:32">Joel 2:32</span>, “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered.” This is expressly applied to the times of the gospel, by Peter, in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:21">Acts 2:21</span>; see the note on that place. To call on the name of the Lord is the same as to call on the Lord himself. The word “name” is often used in this manner. “The name of the Lord is a strong tower, etc.;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+18:10">Proverbs 18:10</span>. “The name of the God of Jacob defend thee;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+20:1">Psalms 20:1</span>. That is, God himself is a strong tower, etc. It is clear from what follows, that the apostle applies this to Jesus Christ; and this is one of the numerous instances in which the writers of the New Testament apply to him expressions which in the Old Testament are applicable to God; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be saved - </b>This is the uniform promise; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:21">Acts 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>, “Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” This is proper and indispensable because,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Because he only can pardon us, and it is fit, that if we obtain pardon, we should ask it of God.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)To call upon him is to acknowledge him as our Sovereign, our Father, and our Friend; and it is right that we render him our homage.</p>
<p style=" ">It is implied in this, that we call upon him with right feelings; that is, with a humble sense of our sinfulness and our need of pardon, and with a willingness to receive eternal life as it is offered us in the gospel. And if this be done, this passage teaches us that all may be saved who will do it. He will cast none away who come in this manner. The invitation and the assurance extend to all nations and to people of all times.</p>
