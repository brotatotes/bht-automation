<p style=" "><b>But Esaias - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:1-2">Isaiah 65:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is very bold - </b>Expresses the doctrine openly, boldly, without any reserve. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀποτολμάω</span></span> apotolmaō means to dare, to be venturesome, to be bold. It means here that however unpopular the doctrine might be, or however dangerous it was to avow that the Jews were extremely wicked, and that God for their wickedness would cast them off, yet that Isaiah had long since done it. This was the point which Paul was establishing; and against this, the objection was urged, and all the Jewish prejudices excited. This is the reason why he so much insists on it, and is so anxious to defend every part by the writings of acknowledged authority among the Jews - the Old Testament. The quotation is made from the Septuagint, with only a slight change in the order of the phrases. The meaning is, that God was found, or the true knowledge of him was obtained, by those who had not sought after him; that is, by the Gentiles, who had worshipped idols, and who had not sought for the true God. This does not mean that we are to expect to find God if we do not seek for him; or that in fact any become Christians who do not seek for it, and make an effort. The contrary is abundantly taught in the Scriptures; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+28:8-9">1 Chronicles 28:8-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:33">Matthew 6:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:9">Luke 11:9</span>. But it means that the Gentiles, whose characteristic was not that they sought God, would have the gospel sent to them, and would embrace it. The phrase, “I was found,” in the past tense here, is in the present in the Hebrew, intimating that the time would come when God would say this of himself; that is, that the time would come when the Gentiles would be brought to the knowledge of the true God. This doctrine was one which Isaiah had constantly in his eye, and which he did not fear to bring openly before the Jews.</p>
