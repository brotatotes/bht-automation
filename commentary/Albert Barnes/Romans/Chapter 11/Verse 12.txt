<p style=" "><b>If the fall of them - </b>If their lapse, or falling. If their temporal rejection and being cast off for a time has already accomplished so much.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be the riches of the world - </b>The word “riches” means wealth, abundance of property; more than is necessary to the supply of our needs. Hence, it means also anything that may promote our comfort or happiness, as wealth is the means of securing our welfare. The gospel is called riches, as it is the means of our highest enjoyment, and eternal welfare. It is the means of conferring numberless spiritual blessings on the Gentile world; and as this was done by the fall of the Jews, so it could be said that their fall was the riches of the world. It was the occasion or means without which the blessings of the gospel could not be conferred on the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The diminishing of them - </b>Margin, “Decay.” “Loss” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἥττημα</span></span> hēttēma. This word means diminution, defect, what is lacked or missing. Hence, also judgment, condemnation. Here it means their degradation; the withdrawing of their special privileges; their rejection. It stands opposed to “their fulness.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>The riches of the Gentiles - </b>The means of conferring important blessings on the Gentiles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How much more their fulness - </b>The word “fulness” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλήρωμα</span></span> plērōma means what fills up, or completes anything. Thus, it is applied to what fills a vessel or cup; also to the piece of cloth which is put in to fill up the rent in a garment; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>. To the fragments which were left when Christ had fed the five thousand; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:20">Mark 8:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>. “Love is the fulfilling of the law,” that is, it is the filling up of the law, or what renders the obedience complete; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:14">Galatians 5:14</span>. Here it stands opposed to their fall, and their diminution, and evidently means their complete restoration to the favor of God; their recovery from unbelief and apostasy. That there will be such a recovery, the apostle proceeds to show. The sentiment of the passage then is, If their rejection and punishment; their being cut off from the favor of God, an event apparently so unlikely to promote the spread of true religion, if their being withrawn from all active influence in spreading the true knowledge of God, be yet the occasion of so many blessings to mankind as have attended the spread of the gospel in consequence of it; how much more shall we expect when they shall be restored; when the energy and zeal of the Jewish nation shall unite with the efforts of others in spreading the knowledge of the true Messiah. In what way, or when, this shall be, we know not. But it is easy to see, that if the Jewish people should be converted to the Christian faith, they would have facilities for spreading the truth, which the church has never had without them.</p>
<p style=" ">(1) They are scattered in all nations, and have access to all people.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Their conversion, after so long unbelief, would have all the power and influence of a miracle performed in view of all nations. It would be seen why they had been preserved, and their conversion would be a most striking fulfillment of the prophecies.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) They are familiar with the languages of the world, and their conversion would at once establish many Christian missionaries in the heart of all the kingdoms of the world. It would be kindling at once a thousand lights in all the dark parts of the earth.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) The Jews have shown that they are eminently suited to spread the true religion. It was by Jews converted to Christianity, that the gospel was first spread. Each of the apostles was a Jew; and they have lost none of the ardor, enterprise, and zeal that always characterized their nation. Their conversion would be, therefore, to give to the church a host of missionaries prepared for their work, familiar with all customs, languages, and climes, and already in the heart of all kingdoms, and with facilities for their work in advance, which others must gain only by the slow toil of many years.</p>
