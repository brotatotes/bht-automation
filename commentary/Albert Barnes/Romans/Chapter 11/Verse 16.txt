<p style=" "><b>For if the first-fruit be holy - </b>The word “first-fruit” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀπαρχή</span></span> aparchē used here denotes the firstling of fruit or grain which was separated from the mass and presented as an offering to God. The Jews were required to present such a portion of their harvest to God, as an expression of gratitude and of their sense of dependence; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:19-21">Numbers 15:19-21</span>. Until this was done, it was not lawful to partake of the harvest. The offering of this was regarded as rendering the mass holy, that is, it was lawful then to partake of it. The first-fruits were regarded as among the best portions of the harvest; and it was their duty to devote to God that which would be the best expression of their thanksgiving. This was the general practice in relation to all that the land produced. The expression here, however, has reference to the small portion of dough or kneaded meal that was offered to God; and then the mass or lump <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φύραμα</span></span> phurama was left for the use of him who made the offering; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:20">Numbers 15:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Be holy - </b>Be set apart, or consecrated to God, as he commanded.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The lump - </b>The mass. It refers here properly to the dough of which a part had been offered. The same was true also in relation to the harvest, after the waive-sheaf had been offered; of the flock, after the first male had been offered, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is also holy - </b>It is lawful then for the owner to partake of it. The offering of a part has consecrated the whole. By this illustration Paul doubtless means to say that the Jewish nation, as a people, were set apart to the service of God, and were so regarded by him. Some have supposed that by the first-fruit here the apostle intends to refer to the early converts, made to the Christian faith in the first preaching of the gospel. But it is more probable that he refers to the patriarchs, the pious people of old, as the first-fruits of the Jewish nation; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:28">Romans 11:28</span>. By their piety the nation was, in a manner, sanctified, or set apart to the service of God; implying that yet the great mass of them would be reclaimed and saved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If the root be holy - </b>This figure expresses the same thing as is denoted in the first part of the verse. The root of a tree is the source of nutritious juices necessary for its growth, and gives its character to the tree. If that be sound, pure, vigorous, we expect the same of the branches. A root bears a similar relation to the tree that the first-fruit does to the mass of bread. Perhaps there is allusion here to <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+11:16">Jeremiah 11:16</span>, where the Jewish nation is represented under the image of “a green olivetree, fair, and of goodly fruit.” In this place the reference is doubtless to Abraham and the patriarchs, as the root or founders of the Jewish nation. If they were holy, it is to be expected that the distant branches, or descendants, would also be so regarded. The mention of the root and branches of a tree gives the apostle occasion for an illustration of the relation at that time of the Jews and Gentiles to the church of Christ.</p>
