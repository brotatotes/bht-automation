<p style=" "><b>And they also - </b>The Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If they bide not ... - </b>If they do not continue in willful obstinacy and rejection of the Messiah. As their unbelief was the sole cause of their rejection, so if that be removed, they may be again restored to the divine favor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For God is able ... - </b>He has,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)He has not bound himself utterly to reject them, and forever to exclude them.</p>
<p style=" ">In this way the apostle reaches his purpose, which was to show them that God had not cast away his people or finally rejected the Jewish nation; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1-2">Romans 11:1-2</span>. That God has this power, the apostle proceeds to show in the next verse.</p>
