<p style=" "><b>For as ye - </b>You who were Gentiles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In times past - </b>Before the gospel was preached. This refers to the former idolatrous and sinful state of the pagan world; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:16">Acts 14:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have not believed God - </b>Or have not obeyed God. This was the character of all the pagan nations.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Yet have now obtained mercy - </b>Have been pardoned and admitted to the favor of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through their unbelief - </b>By means of the unbelief and rejection of the Jews; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>.</p>
