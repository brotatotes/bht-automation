For as ye - You who were Gentiles.In times past - Before the gospel was preached. This refers to the former idolatrous and sinful state of the pagan world; compare Ephesians 2:2; Acts 14:16.Have not believed God - Or have not obeyed God. This was the character of all the pagan nations.Yet have now obtained mercy - Have been pardoned and admitted to the favor of God.Through their unbelief - By means of the unbelief and rejection of the Jews; see the note at Romans 11:11.
