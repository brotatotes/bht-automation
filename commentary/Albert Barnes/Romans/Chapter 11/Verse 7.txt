<p style=" "><b>What then? - </b>What is the proper conclusion from this argument? “Israel hath not obtained.” That is, the Jews as a people have not obtained what they sought. They sought the favor of God by their own merit; and as it was impossible to obtain it in that manner, they have, as a people, failed of obtaining his favor at all, and will be rejected.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That which he seeketh for - </b>To wit, salvation by their own obedience to the Law.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The election hath - </b>The purpose of choosing on the part of God has obtained, or secured, what the seeking on the part of the Jews could not secure. Or the abstract here may be put for the concrete, and the word “election” may mean the same as the elect. The elect, the reserved, the chosen part of the people, have obtained the favor of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath obtained it - </b>That is, the favor, or mercy, of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The rest - </b>The great mass of the people who remained in unbelief, and had rejected the Messiah.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Were blinded - </b>The word in the original means also were hardened <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπωρώθησαν</span></span> epōrōthēsan. It comes from a word which signifies properly to become hard, as bones do which are broken and are then united; or as the joints sometimes do when they become callous or stiff. It was probably applied also to the formation of a hard substance in the eye, a cataract; and then means the same as to be blinded. Hence, applied to the mind, it means what is “hard, obdurate, insensible, stupid.” Thus, it is applied to the Jews, and means that they were blind and obstinate; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:52">Mark 6:52</span>, “Their heart was hardened;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:17">Mark 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:40">John 12:40</span>. The word does not occur in any other place in the New Testament. This verse affirms simply that “the rest were hardened,” but it does not affirm anything about the mode by which it was done. In regard to “the election,” it is affirmed that it was of God; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:4">Romans 11:4</span>. Of the remainder, the fact of their blindness is simply mentioned, without affirming anything of the cause; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:8">Romans 11:8</span>.</p>
