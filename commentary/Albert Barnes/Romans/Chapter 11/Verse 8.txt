<p style=" "><b>According as it is written - </b>That is, they are blinded in accordance with what is written. The fact and the manner accord with the ancient declaration. This is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:10">Isaiah 29:10</span>, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+29:4">Deuteronomy 29:4</span>. The same sentiment is found also substantially in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:9-10">Isaiah 6:9-10</span>. The principal place referred to here, however, is doubtless <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:10">Isaiah 29:10</span>, “For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your rulers hath he covered.” The quotation is not however literally made either from the Hebrew or the Septuagint; but the sense is preserved. The phrase “according as” means upon the same principle, or in the same manner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God hath given - </b>Expressions like this are common in the Scriptures, where God is represented as having an agency in producing the wickedness and stupidity of sinners; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:17-18">Romans 9:17-18</span>; see the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11-12">Mark 4:11-12</span> note; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:11">2 Thessalonians 2:11</span>. This quotation is not made literally. The Hebrew in Isaiah is, God has poured upon them the spirit of slumber. The sense, however, is retained.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The spirit of slumber - </b>The spirit of slumber is not different from slumber itself. The word “spirit” is often used thus. The word “slumber” here is a literal translation of the Hebrew. The Greek word, however <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανύξεως</span></span> katanuxeōs, implies also the notion of compunction, and hence in the margin it is rendered “remorse.” It means any emotion, or any influence whatever, that shall benumb the faculties, and make them insensible. Hence, it here means simply insensibility.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Eyes that they should not see ... - </b>This expression is not taken literally from any single place in the Old Testament; but expresses the general sense of several passages; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:10">Isaiah 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+29:4">Deuteronomy 29:4</span>. It denotes a state of mind not different from a spirit of slumber. When we sleep, the eyes are insensible to surrounding objects, and the ear to sounds. Though in themselves the organs may be perfect, yet the mind is as though they were not; and we have eyes which then do not see, and ears which do not hear. Thus, with the Jews. Though they had all the proper faculties for understanding and receiving the gospel, yet they rejected it. They were stupid and insensible to its claims and its truths.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto this day - </b>Until the day that Paul wrote. The characteristic of the Jews that existed in the time of Isaiah. existed also in the time of Paul. It was a trait of the people; and their insensibility to the demands of the gospel developed nothing new in them.</p>
