<p style=" "><b>If it be possible - </b>If it can be done. This expression implies that it could not always be done. Still it should be an object of desire; and we should endeavor to obtain it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As much as lieth in you - </b>This implies two things:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) We are to do our utmost endeavors to preserve peace, and to appease the anger and malice of others.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) We are not to “begin” or to “originate” a quarrel.</p>
<p style=" ">So far as “we” are concerned, we are to seek peace. But then it does not always depend on us. Others may oppose and persecute us; they will hate religion, and may slander, revile, and otherwise injure us; or they may commence an assault on our persons or property. For “their” assaults we are not answerable; but we are answerable for our conduct toward them; and on no occasion are we to commence a warfare with them. It may not be “possible” to prevent their injuring and opposing us; but it is possible not to begin a contention with them; and “when they” have commenced a strife, to seek peace, and to evince a Christian spirit. This command doubtless extends to everything connected with strife; and means that we are not to “provoke” them to controversy, or to prolong it when it is commenced; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+34:14">Psalms 34:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39-41">Matthew 5:39-41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>. If all Christians would follow this command, if they would never “provoke” to controversy, if they would injure no man by slander or by unfair dealing, if they would compel none to prosecute them in law by lack of punctuality in payment of debts or honesty in business, if they would do nothing to irritate, or to prolong a controversy when it is commenced, it would put an end to no small part of the strife that exists in the world.</p>
