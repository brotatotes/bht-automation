<p style=" "><b>Or ministry - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονίαν</span></span> diakonian. This word properly means service of any kind; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</span>. It is used in religion to denote the service which is rendered to Christ as the Master. It is applied to all classes of ministers in the New Testament, as denoting their being the servants of Christ; and it is used particularly to denote that class who from this word were called deacons, that is, those who had the care of the poor, who provided for the sick, and who watched over the external matters of the church. In the following places it is used to denote the ministry, or service, which Paul and the other apostles rendered in their public work; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:17">Acts 1:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:19">Acts 21:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:31">Romans 15:31</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 5:18</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:3">2 Corinthians 6:3</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Eph 4:12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span>. In a few places this word is used to denote the function which the deacons fulfilled; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span>. In this sense the word “deacon” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διάκονος</span></span> diakonos is most commonly used, as denoting the function which was performed in providing for the poor and administering the alms of the church. It is not easy to say in what sense it is used here. I am inclined to the opinion that he did not refer to those who were appropriately called deacons, but to those engaged in the function of the ministry of the word; whose business it was to preach, and thus to serve the churches. In this sense the word is often used in the New Testament, and the connection seems to demand the same interpretation here.</p>
<p style=" "><b>On our ministering - </b>Let us be wholly and diligently occupied in this. Let this be our great business, and let us give entire attention to it. Particularly the connection requires us to understand this as directing those who ministered not to aspire to the office and honors of those who prophesied. Let them not think of themselves more highly than they ought, but be engaged entirely in their own appropriate work.</p>
<p style=" "><b>He that teacheth - </b>This word denotes those who instruct, or communicate knowledge. It is clear that it is used to denote a class of persons different, in some respects, from those who prophesied and from those who exhorted. But in what this difference consisted, is not clear. Teachers are mentioned in the New Testament in the grade next to the prophets; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28-29">1 Corinthians 12:28-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>. Perhaps the difference between the prophets, the ministers, the teachers, and the exhorters was this, that the first spake by inspiration; the second engaged in all the functions of the ministry properly so called, including the administration of the sacraments; the teachers were employed in communicating instruction simply, teaching the doctrines of religion, but without assuming the function of ministers; and the fourth exhorted, or entreated Christians to lead a holy life, without making it a particular subject to teach, and without pretending to administer the ordinances of religion.</p>
<p style=" ">The fact that teachers are so often mentioned in the New Testament, shows that they were a class by themselves. It may be worthy of remark that the churches in New England had, at first, a class of people who were called teachers. One was appointed to this office in every church, distinct from the pastor, whose proper business it was to instruct the congregation in the doctrines of religion. The same thing exists substantially now in most churches, in the appointment of Sunday school teachers, whose main business it is to instruct the children in the doctrines of the Christian religion. It is an office of great importance to the church; and the exhortation of the apostle may be applied to them: that they should be assiduous, constant, diligent their teaching; that they should confine themselves to their appropriate place; and should feel that their office is of great importance in the church of God; and remember that this is his arrangement, designed to promote the edification of his people.</p>
