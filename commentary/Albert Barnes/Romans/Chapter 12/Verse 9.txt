<p style=" "><b>Let love - </b>The apostle proceeds to specify the duties of Christians in general, that they might secure the beauty and order of the church. The first which he specifies is love. This word here evidently refers to benevolence, or to good-will toward all mankind. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:10">Romans 12:10</span> he specifies the duty of brotherly love; and there can be no doubt that he here refers to the benevolence which we ought to cherish toward all people. A similar distinction is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:7">2 Peter 1:7</span>, “And to brotherly-kindness add charity,” that is, benevolence, or good will, and kind feelings to others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Without dissimulation - </b>Without hypocrisy. Let it be sincere and unfeigned. Let it not consist in words or professions only, but let it be manifested in acts of kindness and in deeds of charity; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:18">1 John 3:18</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>. Genuine benevolence is not what merely professes attachment, but which is evinced by acts of kindness and affection.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Abhor that which is evil - </b>The word “abhor” means to hate; to turn from; to avoid. The word “evil” here has reference to malice, or unkindness, rather than to evil in general. The apostle is exhorting to love, or kindness; and between the direction to love all people, and the particular direction about brotherly love, he places this general direction to abhor what is evil; what is evil in relation to the subject under discussion, that is, malice or unkindness. The word “evil” is not infrequently used in this limited sense to denote some particular or special evil; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37">Matthew 5:37</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span>, etc.; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+34:14">Psalms 34:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:10">Psalms 97:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:22">1 Thessalonians 5:22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cleave to that which is good - </b>The word rendered “cleave” to denotes properly the act of gluing, or uniting firmly by glue. It is then used to denote a very firm adherence to an object; to be firmly united to it. Here it means that Christians should be firmly attached to what is good, and not separate or part from it. The good here referred to is particularly what pertains to benevolence - to all people, and especially to Christians. It should not be occasional only, or irregular; but it should be constant, active, decided.</p>
