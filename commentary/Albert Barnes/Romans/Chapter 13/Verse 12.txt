<p style=" "><b>The night - </b>The word “night,” in the New Testament, is used to denote “night” literally (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:14">Matthew 2:14</span>, etc.); the starry heavens <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:12">Revelation 8:12</span>; and then it denotes a state of “ignorance” and “crime,” and is synonymous with the word “darkness,” as such deeds are committed commonly in the night; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:5">1 Thessalonians 5:5</span>. In this place it seems to denote our present imperfect and obscure condition in this world as contrasted with the pure light of heaven The “night,” the time of comparative obscurity and sin in which we live even under the gospel, is far gone in relation to us, and the pure splendors of heaven are at hand,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is far spent - </b>Literally, “is cut off.” It is becoming “short;” it is hastening to a close.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The day - </b>The full splendors and glory of redemption in heaven. Heaven is often thus represented as a place of pure and splendid day; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:25">Revelation 21:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>. The times of the “gospel” are represented as times of “light” (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1-2">Isaiah 60:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:19-20">Isaiah 60:19-20</span>, etc.); but the reference here seems to be rather to the still brighter glory and splendor of heaven, as the place of pure, unclouded, and eternal day.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is at hand - </b>Is near; or is drawing near. This is true respecting all Christians. The day is near, or the time when they shall be admitted to heaven is not remote. This is the uniform representation of the New Testament; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:7">1 Peter 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:8">James 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:10">Revelation 22:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:2-6">1 Thessalonians 5:2-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:5">Philippians 4:5</span>. That the apostle did not mean, however, that the end of the world was near, or that the day of judgment would come soon, is clear from his own explanations; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:2-6">1 Thessalonians 5:2-6</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:0">2 Thessalonians 2:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let us therefore - </b>As we are about to enter on the glories of that eternal day, we should be pure and holy. The “expectation” of it will teach us to “seek” purity; and a pure life alone will fit us to enter there; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cast off - </b>Lay aside, or put away.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The works of darkness - </b>Dark, wicked deeds, such as are specified in the next verse. They are called “works of darkness,” because darkness in the Scriptures is an emblem of crime, as well as of ignorance, and because such deeds are commonly committed in the night; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:7">1 Thessalonians 5:7</span>, “They that be drunken, are drunken in the night;” compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11-13">Ephesians 5:11-13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Let us put on - </b>Let us clothe ourselves with.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The armour of light - </b>The word “armor” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὅπλα</span></span> hopla properly means “arms,” or instruments of war, including the helmet, sword, shield, etc. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11-17">Ephesians 6:11-17</span>. It is used in the New Testament to denote the “aids” which the Christian has, or the “means of defense” in his warfare, where he is represented as a soldier contending with his foes, and includes truth, righteousness, faith, hope, etc. as the instruments by which he is to gain his victories. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:7">2 Corinthians 6:7</span>, it is called “the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left.” It is called armor of light, because it is not to accomplish any deeds of darkness or of crime; it is appropriate to one who is pure, and who is seeking a pure and noble object. Christians are represented as the “children of light;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:5">1 Thessalonians 5:5</span>; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span>. By the armor of light, therefore, the apostle means those graces which stand opposed to the deeds of darkness <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>; those graces of faith, hope, humility, etc. which shall be appropriate to those who are the children of the day, and which shall be their defense in their struggles with their spiritual foes. see the description in full in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11-17">Ephesians 4:11-17</span>.</p>
