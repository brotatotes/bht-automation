<p style=" "><b>But put ye on - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span>. The word rendered “put ye on” is the same used in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span>, and is commonly employed in reference to “clothing” or “apparel.” The phrase to “put on” a person, which seems a harsh expression in our language, was one not infrequently used by Greek writers, and means to imbibe his principles, to imitate his example, to copy his spirit, to become like him. Thus, in Dionysius Halicarnassus the expression occurs, “having put on or clothed themselves with Tarquin;” i. e., they imitated the example and morals of Tarquin. So Lucian says, “having put on Pythagoras;” having received him as a teacher and guide. So the Greek writers speak of putting on Plato, Socrates, etc. meaning to take them as instructors, to follow them as disciples. (See Schleusner.) Thus, to put on the Lord Jesus means to take him as a pattern and guide, to imitate his example, to obey his precepts, to become like him, etc. In “all” respects the Lord Jesus was unlike what had been specified in the previous verse. He was temperate, chaste, pure, peaceable, and meek; and to “put him on” was to imitate him in these respects; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:22">1 Peter 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9">Isaiah 53:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And make not provision - </b>The word “provision” here is what is used to denote “provident care,” or preparation for future needs. It means that we should not make it an object to gratify our lusts, or study to do this by laying up anything beforehand with reference to this design.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the flesh - </b>The word “flesh” is used here evidently to denote the corrupt propensities of the body, or those which he had specified in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To fulfil the lusts thereof - </b>With reference to its corrupt desires. The gratification of the flesh was the main object among the Romans. Living in luxury and licentiousness, they made it their great object of study to multiply and prolong the means of licentious indulgence. In respect to this, Christians were to be a separate people, and to show that they were influenced by a higher and purer desire than this grovelling propensity to minister to sensual gratification. It is right, it is a Christian duty, to labor to make provision for all the real needs of life. But the real wants are few; and with a heart disposed to be pure and temperate, the necessary wants of life are easily satisfied; and the mind may be devoted to higher and purer purposes.</p>
