<p style=" "><b>Whosoever therefore resisteth ... - </b>That is, they who rise up against “government itself;” who seek anarchy and confusion; and who oppose the regular execution of the laws. It is implied, however, that those laws shall not be such as to violate the rights of conscience, or oppose the laws of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Resisteth the ordinance of God - </b>What God has ordained, or appointed. This means clearly that we are to regard “government” as instituted by God, and as agreeable to his will. “When” established, we are not to be agitated about the “titles” of the rulers; not to enter into angry contentions, or to refuse to submit to them, because we are apprehensive of a defect in their “title,” or because they may have obtained it by oppression. If the government is established, and if its decisions are not a manifest violation of the laws of God, we are to submit to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall receive to themselves damnation - </b>The word “damnation” we apply now exclusively to the punishment of hell; to future torments. But this is not necessarily the meaning of the word which is used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρίμα</span></span> krima. It often simply denotes “punishment;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:10">Galatians 5:10</span>. In this place the word implies “guilt” or “criminality” in resisting the ordinance of God, and affirms that the man that does it shall be punished. Whether the apostle means that he shall be punished by “God,” or by the “magistrate,” is not quite clear. Probably the “latter,” however, is intended; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:4">Romans 13:4</span>. It is also true that such resistance shall be attended with the displeasure of God, and be punished by him.</p>
