<p style=" "><b>Wherefore - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διό</span></span> dio. The “reasons” why we should be subject, which the apostle had given, were two,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That violation of the laws would necessarily expose to punishment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ye must needs be - </b>It is “necessary” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀναγκή</span></span> anagkē to be. This is a word stronger than what implies mere “fitness” or propriety. It means that it is a matter of high obligation and of “necessity” to be subject to the civil ruler.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not only for wrath - </b>Not only on account of the “fear of punishment;” or the fact that wrath will be executed on evil doers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For conscience’ sake - </b>As a matter of conscience, or of “duty to God,” because “he” has appointed it, and made it necessary and proper. A good citizen yields obedience because it is the will of God; and a Christian makes it a part of his religion to maintain and obey the just laws of the land; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:21">Matthew 22:21</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ec+8:2">Ecclesiastes 8:2</span>, “I counsel them to keep the king’s commandments, and “that in regard of the oath of God.”</p>
