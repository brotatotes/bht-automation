<p style=" "><b>Render therefore ... - </b>This injunction is often repeated in the Bible; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:21">Matthew 22:21</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:25-27">Matthew 17:25-27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:13-17">1 Peter 2:13-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+24:21">Proverbs 24:21</span>. It is one of the most lovely and obvious of the duties of religion. Christianity is not designed to break in upon the proper order of society, but rather to establish and confirm that order. It does not rudely assail existing institutions: but it comes to put them on a proper footing, to diffuse a mild and pure influence over all, and to secure “such” an influence in all the relations of life as shall tend best to promote the happiness of man and the welfare of the community.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is due - </b>To whom it properly belongs by the law of the land, and according to the ordinance of God. It is represented here as a matter of “debt,” as something which is “due” to the ruler; a fair “compensation” to him for the service which he renders us by devoting his time and talents to advance “our” interests, and the welfare of the community. As taxes are a “debt,” a matter of strict and just obligation, they should be paid as conscientiously and as cheerfully as any other just debts, however contracted.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Custom - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τέλος</span></span> telos. The word rendered “tribute” means, as has been remarked, the tax which is paid by a tributary prince or dependent people; also the tax imposed on land or real estate. The word here translated “custom” means properly the revenue which is collected on “merchandise,” either imported or exported.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Fear - </b>See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:4">Romans 13:4</span>. We should stand in awe of those who wear the sword, and who are appointed to execute the laws of the land. Since the execution of their office is suited to excite “fear,” we should render to them that reverence which is appropriate to the execution of their function. It means a solicitous anxiety lest we do anything to offend them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Honour - </b>The difference between this and “fear” is, that this rather denotes “reverence, veneration, respect” for their names, offices, rank, etc. The former is the “fear” which arises from the dread of punishment. Religion gives to people all their just titles, recognizes their rank and function, and seeks to promote due subordination in a community. It was no part of the work of our Saviour, or of his apostles, to quarrel with the mere “titles” of people, or to withhold from them the customary tribute of respect and homage; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:3">Acts 24:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:25">Acts 26:25</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Luk 1:3</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:17">1 Peter 2:17</span>. In this verse there is summed up the duty which is owed to magistrates. It consists in rendering to them proper honor contributing cheerfully and conscientiously to the necessary expenses of the government; and in yielding obedience to the laws. These are made a part of the duty which we owe to God, and should be considered as enjoined by our religion.</p>
<p style=" ">On the subject discussed in these seven verses, the following “principles” seem to be settled by the authority of the Bible, and are now understood,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)The authority of God is superior to that of civil rulers. They have no right to make enactments which interfere with “his” authority.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)It is not the business of civil rulers to regulate or control religion. That is a distinct department, with which they have no concern, except to protect it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)The rights of all people are to be preserved. People are to be allowed to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, and to be protected in those rights, provided they do not violate the peace and order of the community.</p>
<p style=" ">In view of this subject we may remark,</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That the doctrines respecting the rights of civil rulers, and the line which is to be drawn between their powers and the rights of conscience, have been slow to be understood. The struggle has been long; and a thousand persecutions have shown the anxiety of the magistrate to rule the conscience, and to control religion. In pagan countries it has been conceded that the civil ruler had a right to control the “religion” of the people: church and state there have been one. The same thing was attempted under Christianity. The magistrate still claimed this right, and attempted to enforce it. Christianity resisted the claim, and asserted the independent and original rights of conscience. A conflict ensued, of course, and the magistrate resorted to persecutions, to “subdue” by force the claims of the new religion and the rights of conscience. Hence, the ten fiery and bloody persecutions of the primitive church. The blood of the early Christians flowed like water; thousands and tens of thousands went to the stake, until Christianity triumphed, and the right of religion to a free exercise was acknowledged throughout the empire.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It is matter of devout thanksgiving that the subject is now settled, and the principle is now understood. In our own land (America) there exists the happy and bright illustration of the true principle on this great subject. The rights of conscience are regarded, and the laws peacefully obeyed. The civil ruler understands his province; and Christians yield a cheerful and cordial obedience to the laws. The church and state move on in their own spheres, united only in the purpose to make men happy and good; and divided only as they relate to different departments, and contemplate, the one, the rights of civil society, the other, the interests of eternity. Here, every man worships God according to his own views of duty; and at the same time, here is rendered the most cordial and peaceful obedience to the laws of the land. Thanks should be rendered without ceasing to the God of our fathers for the wondrous train of events by which this contest has been conducted to its issue; and for the clear and full understanding which we now have of the different departments pertaining to the church and the state.</p>
