<p style=" "><b>For this - </b>“This” which follows is the sum of the laws. “This” is to regulate us in our conduct toward our neighbor. The word “this” here stands opposed to “that” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:11">Romans 13:11</span>. This law of love would prompt us to seek our neighbor’s good; “that” fact, that our salvation is near, would prompt us to be active and faithful in the discharge of all the duties we owe to him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou shalt not commit adultery - </b>All the commands which follow are designed as an illustration of the duty of loving our neighbor; see these commands considered in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:18-19">Matthew 19:18-19</span>. The apostle has not enumerated “all” the commands of the second table. He has shown generally what they required. The command to honor our parents he has omitted. The reason might have been that it was not so immediately to his purpose when discoursing of love to a “neighbor” - a word which does not immediately suggest the idea of near relatives. The expression, “Thou shalt not bear false witness,” is rejected by the best critics as of doubtful authority, but it does not materially affect the spirit of the passage. It is missing in many manuscripts and in the Syriac version.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If there be any other commandment - </b>The law respecting parents; or if there be any duty which does not seem to be “specified” by these laws, it is implied in the command to love our neighbor as ourselves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is briefly comprehended - </b>Greek, It may be reduced to “this head;” or it is summed up in this.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In this saying - </b>This word, or command,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou shalt love ... - </b>This is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span>. See it considered in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:19">Matthew 19:19</span>. If this command were fulfilled, it would prevent all fraud, injustice, oppression, falsehood, adultery, murder, theft, and covetousness. It is the same as our Saviour’s golden rule. And if every man would do to others as he would wish them to do to him, all the design of the Law would be at once fulfilled.</p>
