<p style=" "><b>But why ... - </b>Since we are all subjects and servants alike, and must all stand at the same tribunal, what right have we to sit in judgment on others?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thou judge - </b>Thou who art a “Jewish” convert, why dost thou attempt to arraign the “Gentile” disciple, as if he had violated a law of God? compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thy brother - </b>God has recognised him as his friend <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>, and he should be regarded by thee as “a brother” in the same family.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or why dost thou set at nought - </b>Despise <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>; why dost thou, who art a “Gentile” convert, despise the “Jewish” disciple as being unnecessarily scrupulous and superstitious?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Thy brother - </b>The Jewish convert is now a brother; and all the contempt which you Gentiles once cherished for the Jew should cease, from the fact that “he” is now “a Christian.” Nothing will do so much, on the one hand, to prevent a censorious disposition, and on the other, to prevent contempt for those who are in a different rank in life, as to remember that they are “Christians,” bought with the same blood, and going to the same heaven as ourselves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We must all stand ... - </b>That is, we must all be tried alike at the same tribunal; we must answer for our conduct, not to our-fellow man, but to Christ; and it does not become us to sit in judgment on each other.</p>
