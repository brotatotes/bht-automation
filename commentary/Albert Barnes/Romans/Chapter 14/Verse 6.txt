He that regardeth - Greek, “Thinketh of;” or pays attention to; that is, he that “observes” it as a festival, or as holy time.The day - Any of the days under discussion; the days that the Jews kept as religious occasions.Regardeth unto the Lord - Regards it as “holy,” or as set apart to the service of God. He believes that he is “required” by God to keep it, that is, that the laws of Moses in regard to such days are binding on him.He that regardeth not the day - Or who does not observe such distinctions of days as are demanded in the laws of Moses.To the Lord ... - That is, he does not believe that God “requires” such an observance.He that eateth - The Gentile Christian, who freely eats all kinds of meat; Romans 14:2.Eateth to the Lord - Because he believes that God does not forbid it; and because he desires, in doing it, to glorify God; 1 Corinthians 10:31. “To eat to the Lord,” in this case, is to do it believing that such is his will. In all other cases, it is to do it feeling that we receive our food from him; rendering thanks for his goodness, and desirous of being strengthened that we may do his commands.He giveth God thanks - This is an incidental proof that it is our duty to give God thanks at our meals for our food. It shows that it was the “practice” of the early Christians, and has the commendation of the apostle. It was, also, uniformly done by the Jews, and by the Lord Jesus; Matthew 14:19; Matthew 26:26; Mark 6:41; Mark 14:22; Luke 9:16; Luke 24:30.To the Lord he eateth not - He abstains from eating because he believes that God requires him to do it, and with a desire to obey and honor him.And giveth God thanks - That is, the Jew thanked God for the Law, and for the favor he had bestowed on him in giving him more light than he had the Gentiles. For this privilege they valued themselves highly, and this feeling, no doubt, the converted Jews would continue to retain; deeming themselves as specially favored in having a “special” acquaintance with the Law of God.
