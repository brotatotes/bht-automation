It may be of importance to state that between the last verse of the preceding chapter and the first verse of Romans 15:0, the Arabic version, some manuscripts and many of the Greek fathers, as Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, etc. have introduced Romans 16:25-27. Why this was done, has been a matter of controversy. The discussion, however, is of no practical importance, and most critics concur in the opinion that the present arrangement of the Greek text is genuine.
