<p style=" "><b>We then that are strong - </b>The apostle resumes the subject of the preceding chapter; and continues the exhortation to brotherly love and mutual kindness and forbearance. By the “strong” here he means the strong “in faith” in respect to the matters under discussion; those whose minds were free from doubts and perplexities. His own mind was free from doubt, and there were many others, particularly of the Gentile converts, that had the same views. But many also, particularly of the “Jewish” converts, had many doubts and scruples.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Ought to bear - </b>This word bear properly means to “lift up,” to “bear away,” to “remove.” But here it is used in a larger sense; “to bear with, to be indulgent to, to endure patiently, not to contend with;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>, “Thou canst not bear them that are evil.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>And not to please ourselves - </b>Not to make it our main object to gratify our own wills. We should be willing to deny ourselves, if by it we may promote the happiness of others. This refers particularly to “opinions” about meats and drinks; but it may be applied to Christian conduct generally, as denoting that we are not to make our own happiness or gratification the standard of our conduct, but are to seek the welfare of others; see the example of Paul, <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 9:19</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:22">1 Corinthians 9:22</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:4">Philippians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:5">1 Corinthians 13:5</span>, “Love seeketh not her own;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:24">1 Corinthians 10:24</span>, “Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth; also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span>.</p>
