<p style=" "><b>And again - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+117:1">Psalms 117:1</span>. The object in this quotation is the same as before. The apostle accumulates quotations to show that it was the common language of the Old Testament, and that he was not depending on a single expression for the truth of his doctrine.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All ye Gentiles - </b>In the psalm, “all ye nations;” but the original is the same.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And laud him - </b>“Praise” him. The psalm is directly in point. It is a call on “all” nations to praise God; the very point in the discussion of the apostle.</p>
