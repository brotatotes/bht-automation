<p style=" "><b>Nevertheless - </b>Notwithstanding my full persuasion of your knowledge and your purpose to do right. Perhaps he refers also to the fact that he was a stranger to them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The more boldly - </b>More boldly than might have been expected from a stranger. The reason why he showed this boldness in declaring his sentiments, he immediately states - that he had been especially called to the function of instructing the Gentiles.</p>

Some have supposed that he referred to a “party” at Rome - the Gentile party (Whitby). Some refer it to different “parts” of his epistle - on some subjects (Stuart).
