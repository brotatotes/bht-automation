<p style=" "><b>I have therefore ... - </b>I have cause of glorying. I have cause of rejoicing that God has made me a minister to the Gentiles, and that he has given me such success among them. The ground of this he states in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:18-22">Romans 15:18-22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Glory - </b>Of “boasting” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καύχησιν</span></span> kauchēsin, the word usually rendered “boasting”); <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:16">James 4:16</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Rom 3:27</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:14">2 Corinthians 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:24">2 Corinthians 8:24</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 9:3-4</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:15">2 Corinthians 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10">2 Corinthians 11:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:17">2 Corinthians 11:17</span>. It means also “praise, thanksgiving,” and “joy;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 1:12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Co 8:24</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>. This is its meaning here, that the apostle had great cause of “rejoicing” or “praise” that he had been so highly honored in the appointment to this office, and in his success in it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through Jesus Christ - </b>By the assistance of Jesus Christ; ascribing his success among the Gentiles to the aid which Jesus Christ had rendered him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In those things which pertain to God - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span>. The things of religion; the things which God has commanded, and which pertain to his honor and glory. They were not things which pertained to “Paul,” but to “God:” not worked by Paul, but by Jesus Christ; yet he might rejoice that he had been the means of diffusing so far those blessings. The success of a minister is not for “his own” praises, but for the honor of God; not by his skill or power, but by the aid of Jesus Christ; yet he may rejoice that “through” him such blessings are conferred upon people.</p>
