<p style=" "><b>For I will not dare to speak - </b>I should be restrained; I should be afraid to speak, if the thing were not as I have stated. I should be afraid to set up a claim beyond what is strictly in accordance with the truth.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which Christ hath not wrought by me - </b>I confine myself “strictly” to what I have done. I do not arrogate to myself what Christ has done by others. I do not exaggerate my own success, or claim what others have accomplished.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To make the Gentiles obedient - </b>To bring them to obey God in the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By word and deed - </b>By preaching, and by all other means; by miracle, by example, etc. The “deeds,” that is, the “lives” of Christian ministers are often as efficacious in bringing people to Christ as their public ministry.</p>
