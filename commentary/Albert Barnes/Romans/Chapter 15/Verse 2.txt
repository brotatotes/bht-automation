<p style=" "><b>Please his neighbour - </b>That is, all other persons, but especially the friends of the Redeemer. The word “neighbor” here has special reference to the members of the church. It is often used, however, in a much larger sense; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:36">Luke 10:36</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For his good - </b>Not seek to secure for him indulgence in those things which Would be injurious to him, but in all those things whereby his welfare would be promoted.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To edification - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:19">Romans 14:19</span>.</p>
