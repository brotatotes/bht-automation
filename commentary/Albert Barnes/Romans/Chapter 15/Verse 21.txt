<p style=" "><b>But as it is written - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:15">Isaiah 52:15</span>. This is not literally quoted, but the sense is retained. The design of quoting it is to justify the principle on which the apostle acted. It was revealed that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles; and he regarded it as a high honor to be the instrument of carrying this prediction into effect.</p>
