<p style=" "><b>For which cause - </b>I have been so entirely occupied in this leading purpose of my life, that I have not been able to come to you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Much hindered - </b>Many ways; not many times. I had so frequent and urgent demands on my time elsewhere, that I could not come to you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>From coming to you - </b>Where the gospel “has been” preached. I have desired to come, but have been unable to leave the vast region where I might preach the gospel to those who had never heard it.</p>
