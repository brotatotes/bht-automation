For which cause - I have been so entirely occupied in this leading purpose of my life, that I have not been able to come to you.Much hindered - Many ways; not many times. I had so frequent and urgent demands on my time elsewhere, that I could not come to you.From coming to you - Where the gospel “has been” preached. I have desired to come, but have been unable to leave the vast region where I might preach the gospel to those who had never heard it.
