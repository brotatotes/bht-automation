<p style=" "><b>Whensoever I take my journey into Spain - </b>Ancient Spain comprehended the modern kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, or the whole of the Spanish peninsula. It was then subject to the Romans. It is remarkable, even here, that the apostle does not say that his principal object was to visit the church at Rome, much as he desired that, but only to “take it in his way” in the fulfillment of his higher purpose to preach the gospel in regions where Christ was not named. Whether he ever fulfilled his purpose of visiting “Spain” is a matter of doubt. Some of the fathers, Theodoret (on <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:25">Philippians 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span>) among others, say that after he was released from his captivity when he was brought before Nero, he passed two years in Spain. If he was imprisoned a “second” time at Rome, such a visit is not improbable as having taken place “between” the two imprisonments. But there is no certain evidence of this. Paul probably projected “many” journeys which were never accomplished.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To be brought on my way ... - </b>To be assisted by you in regard to this journey; or to be accompanied by you. This was the custom of the churches; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:3">Acts 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14-15">Acts 17:14-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:38">Acts 20:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:5">Acts 21:5</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 16:6</u></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:11">1 Corinthians 16:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:8">3 John 1:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>If first ... - </b>If on my journey, before I go into Spain.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Somewhat - </b>Greek, “In part.” As though he could not be “fully” satisfied with their company, or could not hope to enjoy their society as fully and as long as he could desire. This is a very tender and delicate expression.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Filled - </b>This is a strong expression, meaning to be “satisfied,” to enjoy. To be “filled” with a thing is to have great satisfaction and joy in it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With your company - </b>Greek, With “you;” meaning in your society. The expression “to be filled” with one, in the sense of being “gratified,” is sometimes used in the classic writers. (See “Clarke” on this verse.)</p>
