<p style=" "><b>I am sure - </b>Greek, I know; expressing the fullest confidence, a confidence that was greatly confirmed by the success of his labors elsewhere.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the fulness of the blessings ... - </b>This is a Hebrew mode of expression, where one noun performs the purpose of an adjective, and means “with a full or abundant blessing.” This confidence he, expressed in other language in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11-12">Romans 1:11-12</span>; see the notes.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of the gospel of Christ - </b>Which the gospel of Christ is suited to impart. Thus, every minister of the gospel should wish to go. This should be his everburning desire in preaching. Paul went to Rome; but he went in bonds; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:0">Acts 27:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:0">Acts 28:0</span>. But though he went in this manner, he was permitted there to preach the gospel for at least two years, nor can we doubt that his ministry was attended with the anticipated success; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:30-31">Acts 28:30-31</span>. God may disappoint us in regard to the “mode” in which we purpose to do good; but if we really desire it, he will enable us to do it in “his own way.” It “may” be better to preach the gospel in “bonds” than at liberty; it “is” better to do it even in a prison, than not at all. Bunyan wrote the Pilgrim’s Progress to amuse his heavy hours during a twelve years’ cruel imprisonment. If he had been at liberty, he probably would not have written it at all. The great desire of his heart was accomplished, but a “prison” was the place in which to do it. Paul preached; but preached in chains.</p>
