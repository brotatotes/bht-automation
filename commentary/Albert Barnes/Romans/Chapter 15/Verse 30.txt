<p style=" "><b>For the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake - </b>Greek, By or through <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διά</span></span> dia our Lord Jesus Christ; It means probably out of love and regard to him; in order to promote his honor and glory, and to extend his kingdom among people. Paul desired to be delivered from the bands of the Jews, that he might promote the honor of Jesus Christ among the Gentiles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And for the love of the Spirit - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διά</span></span> dia. By the mutual love and sympathy which the Spirit of God produces in the minds of all who are the friends of God. I beseech you now to manifest that love by praying earnestly for me.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye strive together with me - </b>That you unite with me in earnest prayer. The word “strive” denotes intense “agony” or effort, such as was used by the wrestlers in the Greek games; and then the “agony,” or strong effort, which a man makes in prayer, who is earnestly desirous to be heard. The use of the word here denotes Paul’s earnest desire that they should make an “intense” effort in their prayers that he might be delivered. Christians, though at a distance from each other, may unite their prayers for a common object. Christians everywhere “should” wrestle in prayer for the ministers of the gospel, that they may be kept from temptations; and especially for those who are engaged, as the apostle was, in arduous efforts among the pagan, that they may be kept from the many dangers to which they are exposed in their journeying in pagan lands.</p>
