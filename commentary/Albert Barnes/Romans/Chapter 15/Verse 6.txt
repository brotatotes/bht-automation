<p style=" "><b>That ye may with one mind - </b>The word used here is translated “with one accord;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:24">Acts 4:24</span>. It means unitedly, with one purpose, without contentions, and strifes, and jars.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And one mouth - </b>This refers, doubtless, to their prayers and praises. That they might join without contention and unkind feeling, in the worship of God. Divisions, strife, and contention in the church prevent union in worship. Though the “body” may be there, and the church “professedly” engaged in public worship, yet it is a “divided” service; and the prayers of strife and contention are not heard; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:4">Isaiah 58:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Glorify God - </b>Praise or honor God. This would be done by their union, peace, and harmony; thus showing the tendency of the gospel to overcome the sources of strife and contention among people, and to bring them to peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Even the Father ... - </b>This is an addition designed to produce love.</p>
<p style=" ">(1) He is “a Father;” we then, his children, should regard him as pleased with the union and peace of his family.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) He is the Father of our Lord; our “common” Lord; our Lord who has commanded us to be united, and to love one another. By the desire of honoring “such” a Father, we should lay aside contentions, and be united in the bands of love.</p>
