<p style=" "><b>Wherefore - </b>In view of all the considerations tending to produce unity and love, which have been presented. He refers to the various arguments in this and the preceding chapter.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Receive ye one another - </b>Acknowledge one another as Christians, and treat one another as such, though you may differ in opinion about many smaller matters; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As Christ also received us - </b>That is, received us as his friends and followers; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the glory of God - </b>In order to promote his glory. He has redeemed us, and renewed us, in order to promote the honor of God; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>. As Christ has received us in order to promote the glory of God, so ought we to treat each other in a similar manner for a similar purpose. The exhortation in tiffs verse is to those who had been divided on various points pertaining to rites and ceremonies; to those who had been converted from among “Gentiles” and “Jews;” and the apostle here says that Christ had received “both.” In order to enforce this, and especially to show the “Jewish” converts that they ought to receive and acknowledge their “Gentile” brethren, he proceeds to show, in the following verses, that Christ had reference to “both” in his work. He shows this in reference to the “Jews” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>, and to the “Gentiles” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:9-12">Romans 15:9-12</span>. Thus, he draws all his arguments from the work of Christ.</p>
