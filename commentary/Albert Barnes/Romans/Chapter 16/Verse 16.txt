<p style=" "><b>Salute one another - </b>Greet one another in an affectionate mannner; that is, treat each other with kindness and love, and evince all proper marks of affection.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With an holy kiss - </b>This mode of salutation has been practiced at all times; and particularly in eastern nations. It was even practiced by “men;” see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:47-48">Luke 22:47-48</span>. The use of the word “holy” here serves to denote that Paul intended it as an expression of “Christian” affection; and to guard against all improper familiarity and scandal. It was common, according to Justin Martyr (<i>Apology</i>), for the early Christians to practice it in their religious assemblies.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The churches of Christ - </b>That is, the churches in the vicinity of the place where the apostle wrote this Epistle; probably the churches particularly in Achaia.</p>
