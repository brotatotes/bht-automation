<p style=" "><b>Serve not - </b>Obey not. Though they are professedly, yet they are not his real friends and followers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But their own belly - </b>Their own “lusts;” their own private interests; they do this to obtain support. The authors of parties and divisions, in church and state, have this usually in view. It is for the indulgence of some earthly appetite; to obtain function or property; or to gratify the love of dominion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And by good words - </b>Mild, fair, plausible speeches; with an appearance of great sincerity, and regard for the truth; compare <span class="_0000ff"><u>Col 2:4</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:3">2 Peter 3:3</span>. People who cause divisions commonly make great pretensions to peculiar love of truth and orthodoxy; and put on the appearance of great sincerity, sanctity, and humility.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And fair speeches - </b>Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εὐλογίας</span></span> eulogias, eulogy, praise, flattery. This is another very common art. “Flattery” is one of the most powerful means of forming parties in the church; and “a little special attention,” or promise of an office, or commendation for talents or acquirements, will secure “many” to the purposes of party whom no regard for truth or orthodoxy could influence a moment.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Deceive the hearts of the simple - </b>The minds of the unsuspecting, or those who are without guile <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τῶν ἀκάκων</span></span> tōn akakōn. The apostle means to designate those who are simple-hearted, without any disposition to deceive others themselves, and of course without any suspicions of the “designs” of others. He has thus drawn the art of making parties with the hand of a master. First, there are smooth, plausible pretences, as of great love for truth. Then, an artful mingling of attentions and flatteries; and all this practiced on the minds of the unsuspecting, drawing their “hearts” and “affections” toward themselves. Happy would it have been if the art had been confined to his own times.</p>
