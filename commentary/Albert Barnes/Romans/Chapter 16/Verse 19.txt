<p style=" "><b>For your obedience ... - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>. Your mild, obedient disposition to learn, and to obey the precepts of the teachers of religion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I am glad ... - </b>I rejoice that you evince such a disposition. But he immediately adds, that “this” was just the temper to be imposed upon, and cautions them against that danger.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Wise unto that which is good - </b>Evince understanding of what is adapted to promote good and worthy ends.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Simple concerning evil - </b>Greek, “harmless.” Not disposed to do wrong; having no plan and yielding to none of the allurements of evil. You have shown your wisdom in “obeying” the gospel. I would have you still evince wisdom toward “every good” design; but to be unacquainted with “any” plan of evil. Do not yield to those plans, or follow those who would lead you into them.</p>
