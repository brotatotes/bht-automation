For your obedience ... - Romans 1:8. Your mild, obedient disposition to learn, and to obey the precepts of the teachers of religion.I am glad ... - I rejoice that you evince such a disposition. But he immediately adds, that “this” was just the temper to be imposed upon, and cautions them against that danger.Wise unto that which is good - Evince understanding of what is adapted to promote good and worthy ends.Simple concerning evil - Greek, “harmless.” Not disposed to do wrong; having no plan and yielding to none of the allurements of evil. You have shown your wisdom in “obeying” the gospel. I would have you still evince wisdom toward “every good” design; but to be unacquainted with “any” plan of evil. Do not yield to those plans, or follow those who would lead you into them.
