<p style=" "><b>That ye receive her ... - </b>That you acknowledge her as being in the Lord, or as being a servant of the Lord; that is, as a Christian; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:3">Romans 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:29">Philippians 2:29</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As becometh saints - </b>As it is proper that Christians should treat their brethren.</p>
<p style=" "><b>She hath been a succourer of many - </b>The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προστάτις</span></span> prostatis, means properly “a patron, a help,” and was applied by the Greeks to one who “presided” over an assembly; to one who became “a patron” of others; who aided or defended them in their cause; and especially to one who undertook to manage the cause of “strangers” and foreigners before the courts. It was, therefore, an honorable appellation. Applied to Phebe, it means probably that she had shown great kindness in various ways to the apostle, and to other Christians; probably by receiving them into her house; by administering to the sick, etc. Such persons have a claim on the respect and Christian attentions of others.</p>
