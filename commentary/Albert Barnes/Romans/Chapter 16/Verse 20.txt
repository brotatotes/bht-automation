<p style=" "><b>And the God of peace - </b>The God who promotes peace; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:33">Romans 15:33</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Will bruise - </b>The “language” here refers to the prediction in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>. It here means to “subdue, to gain the victory over.” It denotes Paul’s confidence that they “would” gain the victory, and would be able to overcome all the arts of those who were endeavoring to sow discord and contention among them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Satan - </b>The word “Satan” is Hebrew, meaning originally “an accuser, a calumniator,” and then “an enemy.” It is given to the prince of evil spirits from this enmity to God and human beings. He is here regarded as the “author” of all attempts to promote discord in the church, by whomsoever those attempts were made. Hence, they who attempt to produce divisions are called “his ministers;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:15">2 Corinthians 11:15</span>. God would disappoint their malignant purposes, and promote the prevalence of peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The grace - </b>The favor; the mercy, etc. The Lord Jesus is the Prince of peace (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>), and this expression is “a prayer” to him, or an earnest wish expressed, that the design of his coming might be accomplished in promoting the prevalence of order and peace; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:23">1 Corinthians 16:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:21">Revelation 22:21</span>.</p>
