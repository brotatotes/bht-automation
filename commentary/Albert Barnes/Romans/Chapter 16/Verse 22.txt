<p style=" "><b>I Tertius - </b>Of Tertius nothing more is known than is mentioned here.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who wrote this - </b>It is evident that Paul employed an amanuensis to write this Epistle, and perhaps he commonly did it. Tertius, who thus wrote it, joins with the apostle in affectionate salutations to the brethren at Rome. To the Epistle, Paul signed his own name, and added a salutation in his own hand-writing. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>, “The salutation by the hand of me Paul;” and in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>, he says that this was done in every epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the Lord - </b>As Christian brethren.</p>
