But now is made manifest - Is revealed, or made known; that which was so long concealed is now divulged, that is, God’s plan of saving people is now made known to all nations.And by the Scriptures ... - By the “writings” of the prophets. The prophetic writings contained the doctrines, obscurely indeed, but so as to be an important means of disseminating and confirming the truth that the Gentiles should be made acquainted with the gospel. To those writings the apostle had repeatedly appealed in his defense of the proposition that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentile word; Romans 10:0; Romans 11:0; Romans 15:0. The prophetic writings; moreover, were extensively scattered among the Gentile nations, and thus were readily appealed to in defense of this position. Their writings being thus translated, and read, were an important means of propagating the truths of the Christian religion.According to the commandment ... - By his command through Jesus Christ; made known in the gospel of his Son.The everlasting God - God who is eternal, and therefore unchanged. He who has indeed concealed this truth, but who has always intended that it should be revealed.To all nations - Matthew 28:19; compare Colossians 1:23.For the obedience of faith - To produce obedience to the requirements of the gospel; see the note at Romans 1:5.
