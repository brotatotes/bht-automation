To God only wise - The apostle here resumes the doxology which had been interrupted by the parenthesis. The attribute of “wisdom” is here brought into view, because it had been particularly displayed in this plan which was now revealed. It evinced, in an eminent degree, the “wisdom” of God. That wisdom was evinced in devising the plan; in adapting it to the renewing of the heart; the justification of the sinner; his preservation, guidance, and sanctification; and in the manner in which the divine attributes had all been seen to harmonize. All this the apostle had illustrated in the previous parts of the Epistle; and now, full of the convictions of this wisdom, he desires that all the praise and honor should be to God. The “tendency” of the plan is to promote his glory. The “obligation” on all who are benefitted by it is to give him praise.Be glory - Praise; honor.Through Jesus Christ - By means of the work which Jesus Christ has performed; through him now as mediator and intercessor in the heavens.The subscription, “written to the Romans,” etc. is evidently added by some other hand, but by whom is unknown. Paul assuredly would not write this to inform the Romans that it was sent by Phebe, whom he had just commended to their kindness. It has been shown, moreover, that no reliance is to be placed on any of the subscriptions to the Epistles. Some of them are known to be false. By whom they were added is unknown. In this case, however, the fact which it states is correct, that it was written from Corinth and sent by Phoebe.
