<p style=" "><b>Who have for my life - </b>In order to save my life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Laid down their own necks - </b>To “lay down the neck” is to lay the head on a block to be cut off with the axe; or to bow down the head as when the neck was exposed to be cut off by the sword of the executioner. The meaning is, that they had hazarded their lives, had exposed themselves to imminent danger, to save the life of Paul. On what occasion this was done, is not known, as it is not referred to in the New Testament elsewhere. As Paul, however, lived with them <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span>, and as he was often persecuted by the Jews, it is probable that he refers to some such period when he was persecuted, when Aquila and Priscilla took him into their house at the imminent hazard of their lives.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All the churches of the Gentiles - </b>All the churches that had been founded by the apostles. They “felt” their deep obligation to them for having saved the life of him who had been their founder, and who was their spiritual father.</p>
