<p style=" "><b>The church that is in their house - </b>Aquila and Priscilla are mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:26">Acts 18:26</span> as having received “Apollos” into their family, to instruct him more perfectly. The church in their house is also mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>. This may mean either the church that was accustomed to assemble for worship at their hospitable mansion; or it may mean their own family with their guests, regarded as a “church.” In those times Christians had no houses erected for public worship, and were therefore compelled to meet in their private dwellings.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Salute - </b>The same word before translated “greet.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who is the first-fruits - </b>One who first embraced Christianity under my preaching in Achaia. The “first-fruits” were a small part of the harvest, which was first gathered and offered to the Lord; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:29">Exodus 22:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:16">Exodus 23:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+2:12">Leviticus 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:4">Deuteronomy 18:4</span>. In allusion to this, Paul calls Epenetus the first-fruits of the great spiritual harvest which had been gathered in Achaia.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Achaia - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:26">Romans 15:26</span>. This name and those which follow are chiefly “Greek,” but we know little of the persons mentioned, except what is here recorded.</p>
