<p style=" "><b>Thou therefore ... - </b>He who is a teacher of others may be expected to be learned himself. They ought to be found to be possessed of superior knowledge; and by this question the apostle impliedly reproves them for their ignorance. The form of a question is chosen because it conveys the truth with greater force. He puts the question as if it were undeniable that they were grossly ignorant; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:3">Matthew 23:3</span>, “They say, and do not,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That preachest - </b>This word means to proclaim in any manner, whether in the synagogue, or in any place of public teaching.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Dost thou steal? - </b>It cannot be proved, perhaps, that the Jews were extensively guilty of this crime. It is introduced partly, no doubt, to make the inconsistency of their conduct mere apparent. We expect a man to set an example of what he means by his public instruction.</p>
