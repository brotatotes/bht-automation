<p style=" "><b>But he is a Jew - </b>He comes up to the design of the Jewish institution; he manifests truly what it is to be a Jew.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is one inwardly - </b>Who is “in heart” a Jew. Who has the true spirit, and fulfils the design of their being separated as a special people. This passage proves that the design of separating them was not merely to perform certain external rites, or to conform to external observances, but to be a people holy in heart and in life. It cannot be denied that this design was not generally understood in the time of the apostles; but it was abundantly declared in the Old Testament: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:5">Deuteronomy 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:12-13">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:20">Deuteronomy 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+30:14">Deuteronomy 30:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:11-20">Isaiah 1:11-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mic+6:8">Micah 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:16-17">Psalms 51:16-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+50:7-23">Psalms 50:7-23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And circumcision is that of the heart - </b>That is, that circumcision which is acceptable to God. and which meets the design of the institution, is what is attended with holiness of heart; with the cutting off of sins; and with a pure life. The design of circumcision was to be a sign of separation from the pagan world, and of consecration to the holy God. And this design implied the renunciation and forsaking of all sins; or the cutting off of everything that was offensive to God. This was a work especially of the heart. This design was often stated and enforced in the writings of the Old Testament; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:16">Deuteronomy 10:16</span>, “Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:4">Jeremiah 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+30:6">Deuteronomy 30:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the spirit - </b>This is an expression explaining further what he had just said. It does not mean by the Holy Spirit, but that the work was to take place in the soul, and not in the body only. It was to be an internal, spiritual work, and not merely an external service.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And not in the letter - </b>That is, not only according to the literal, external command,</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whose praise ... - </b>Whose object is not to secure the praise of human beings. One of the main characteristics of the Jews in the time of Christ was, a desire to secure honor among men, as being exactly scrupulous in the performance of all the duties of their religion. They prided themselves on their descent from Abraham, and on their regular conformity to the precepts of the Law of Moses; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5">Matthew 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:10-12">Luke 18:10-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But of God - </b>“Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:7">1 Samuel 16:7</span>. The praise of God can be bestowed only on those who conform really, and not externally only, to his requirements.</p>
<p style=" ">The remarks which are made here respecting the Jews, are also strictly applicable to professing Christians, and we may learn,</p>
