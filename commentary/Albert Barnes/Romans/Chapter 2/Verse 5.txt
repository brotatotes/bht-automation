<p style=" "><b>But after thy hardness - </b>The word “after” here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατά</span></span> kata means in respect to, or you act according to the direct tendency of a hard heart in treasuring up wrath. The word “hardness” is used to denote insensibility of mind. It properly means what is insensible to the touch, or on which no impression is made by contact, as a stone, etc. Hence, it is applied to the mind, to denote a state where no motives make an impression; which is insensible to all the appeals made to it; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:24">Matthew 25:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:8">Matthew 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>. And here it expresses a state of mind where the goodness and forbearance of God have no effect. The man still remains obdurate, to use a word which has precisely the meaning of the Greek in this place. It is implied in this expression that the direct tendency, or the inevitable result, of that state of mind was to treasure up wrath, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Impenitent heart - </b>A heart which is not affected with sorrow for sin, in view of the mercy and goodness of God. This is an explanation of what he meant by hardness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Treasurest up - </b>To treasure up, or to lay up treasure, commonly denotes a laying by in a place of security of property that may be of use to us at some future period. In this place it is used, however, in a more general sense, to accumulate, to increase. It still has the idea of hoarding up, carries the thought beautifully and impressively onward to future times. Wrath, like wealth treasured up, is not exhausted at present, and hence, the sinner becomes bolder in sin. But it exists, for future use; it is kept in store (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:7">2 Peter 3:7</span>) against future times; and the man who commits sin is only increasing this by every act of transgression. The same sentiment is taught in a most solemn manner in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:34-35">Deuteronomy 32:34-35</span>. It may be remarked here, that most people have an immense treasure of this kind in store, which eternal ages of pain will not exhaust or diminish! Stores of wrath are thus reserved for a guilty world, and in due time it “will come upon man to the uttermost,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:16">1 Thessalonians 2:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto thyself - </b>For thyself, and not for another; to be exhausted on thee, and not on your fellow-man. This is the case with every sinner, as really and as certainly as though he were the only solitary mortal in existence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Wrath - </b>Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Day of wrath - </b>The day when God shall show or execute his wrath against sinners; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:17">Revelation 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:6">Ephesians 5:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And revelation - </b>On the day when the righteous judgment of God will be revealed, or made known. Here we learn:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That the punishment of the wicked will be just. It will not he a judgment of caprice or tyranny, but a righteous judgment, that is, such a judgment as it will be right to render, or as ought to be rendered, and therefore such as God will render, for he will do right; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:6">2 Thessalonians 1:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The punishment of the wicked is future. It is not exhausted in this life. It is treasured up for a future day, and that day is a day of wrath. How contrary to this text are the pretences of those who maintain that all punishment is executed in this life.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) How foolish as well as wicked is it to lay up such a treasure for the future; to have the only inheritance in the eternal world, an inheritance of wrath and wo!</p>
