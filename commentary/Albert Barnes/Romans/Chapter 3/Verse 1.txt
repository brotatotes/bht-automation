<p style=" "><b>What advantage ... - </b>The design of the first part of this chapter is to answer some of the objections which might be offered by a Jew to the statements in the last chapter. The first objection is stated in this verse. A Jew would naturally ask, if the view which the apostle had given were correct, what special benefit could the Jew derive from his religion? The objection would arise particularly from the position advanced <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:25-26">Romans 2:25-26</span>, that if a pagan should do the things required by the Law, he would be treated as “if” he had been circumcised. Hence, the question, “what profit is there of circumcision?”</p>
