<p style=" "><b>Their throat ... - </b>This expression is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+5:9">Psalms 5:9</span>, literally from the Septuagint. The design of the psalm is to reprove those who were false, traitorous, slanderous, etc. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+5:6">Psalms 5:6</span>. The psalmist has the sin of deceit, and falsehood, and slander particularly in his eye. The expressions here are to be interpreted in accordance with that. The sentiment here may be, as the grave is ever open to receive all into it, that is, into destruction, so the mouth or the throat of the slanderer is ever open to swallow up the peace and happiness of all. Or it may mean, as from an open sepulchre there proceeds an offensive and pestilential vapor, so from the mouths of slanderous persons there proceed noisome and ruinous words. “(Stuart.)” I think the connection demands the former interpretation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With their tongues ... - </b>In their conversation, their promises, etc., they have been false, treacherous, and unfaithful.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The poison of asps - </b>This is taken literally from the Septuagint of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+140:3">Psalms 140:3</span>. The asp, or adder, is a species of serpent whose poison is of such active operation that it kills almost the instant that it penetrates, and that without remedy. It is small, and commonly lies concealed, often in the “sand” in a road, and strikes the traveler before he sees it. It is found chiefly in Egypt and Lybia. It is said by ancient writers that the celebrated Cleopatra, rather than be carried a captive to Rome by Augustus, suffered an asp to bite her in the arm, by which she soon died. The precise species of serpent which is here meant by the psalmist, however, cannot be ascertained. All that is necessary to understand the passage is, that it refers to a serpent whose bite was deadly, and rapid in its execution.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is under their lips - </b>The poison of the serpent is contained in a small bag which is concealed at the root of the tooth. When the tooth is struck into the flesh, the poison is pressed out, through a small hole in the tooth, into the wound. Whether the psalmist was acquainted with that fact, or referred to it, cannot be known: his words do not of necessity imply it. The sentiment is, that as the poison of the asp is rapid, certain, spreading quickly through the system, and producing death; so the words of the slanderer are deadly, pestiferous, quickly destroying the reputation and happiness of man. They are as subtle, as insinuating, and as deadly to the reputation, as the poison of the adder is to the body. Wicked people in the Bible are often compared to serpents; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:33">Matthew 23:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:17">Genesis 49:17</span>.</p>
