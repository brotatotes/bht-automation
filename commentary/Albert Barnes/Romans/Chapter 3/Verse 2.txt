<p style=" "><b>Much every way - </b>Or, in every respect. This is the answer of the apostle to the objection in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1">Romans 3:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Chiefly - </b>That is, this is the principal advantage, and one including all others. The main benefit of being a Jew is, to possess the sacred Scriptures and their instructions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto them were committed - </b>Or were intrusted, were confided. The word translated “were committed,” is what is commonly employed to express “faith” or “confidence,” and it implied “confidence” in them on the part of God in intrusting his oracles to them; a confidence which was not misplaced, for no people ever guarded a sacred trust or deposit with more fidelity, than the Jews did the Sacred Scriptures.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The oracles - </b>The word “oracle” among the pagan meant properly the answer or response of a god, or of some priest supposed to be inspired, to an inquiry of importance, usually expressed in a brief sententious way, and often with great ambiguity. The place from which such a response was usually obtained was also called an oracle, as the oracle at Delphi, etc. These oracles were frequent among the pagan, and affairs of great importance were usually submitted to them. The word rendered “oracles” occurs in the New Testament but four times, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Heb 5:12</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>. It is evidently used here to denote the Scriptures, as being what was spoken by God, and particularly perhaps the divine promises. To possess these was of course an eminent privilege, and included all others, as they instructed them in their duty, and were their guide in everything that pertained to them in this life and the life to come. They contained, besides, many precious promises respecting the future dignity of the nation in reference to the Messiah. No higher favor can be conferred on a people than to be put in possession of the sacred Scriptures. And this fact should excite us to gratitude, and lead us to endeavor to extend them also to other nations; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+4:7-8">Deuteronomy 4:7-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+147:19-20">Psalms 147:19-20</span>.</p>
