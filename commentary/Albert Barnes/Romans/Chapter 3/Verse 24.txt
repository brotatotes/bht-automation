<p style=" "><b>Being justified - </b>Being treated as if righteous; that is, being regarded and treated as if they had kept the Law. The apostle has shown that they could not be so regarded and treated by any merit of their own, or by personal obedience to the Law. He now affirms that if they were so treated, it must be by mere favor, and as a matter not of right, but of gift. This is the essence of the gospel. And to show this, and the way in which it is done, is the main design of this Epistle. The expression here is to be understood as referring to all who are justified; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span>. The righteousness of God by faith in Jesus Christ, is “upon all who believe,” who are all “justified freely by his grace.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Freely - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεὰν</span></span> dōrean. This word stands opposed to what is purchased, or which is obtained by labor, or which is a matter of claim. It is a free, undeserved gift, not merited by our obedience to the Law, and not that to which we have any claim. The apostle uses the word here in reference to those who are justified. To them it is a mere undeserved gift, It does not mean that it has been obtained, however, without any price or merit from anyone, for the Lord Jesus has purchased it with his own blood, and to him it becomes a matter of justice that those who were given to him should be justified, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 7:23</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>.

We have no offering to bring, and no claim. To us, therefore, it is entirely a matter of gift.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By his grace - </b>By his favor; by his mere undeserved mercy; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the redemption - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διὰ τῆς ἀπολυτρώσεως</span></span> dia tēs apolutrōseōs. The word used here occurs only 10 times in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:14">Colossians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:35">Hebrews 11:35</span>. Its root (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λύτρον</span></span> lutron) properly denotes the price which is paid for a prisoner of war; the ransom, or stipulated purchase-money, which being paid, the captive is set free. The word used here is then employed to denote liberation from bondage, captivity, or evil of any kind, usually keeping up the idea of a price, or a ransom paid, in consequence of which the delivery is effected. It is sometimes used in a large sense, to denote simple deliverance by any means, without reference to a price paid, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>. That this is not the sense here, however, is apparent. For the apostle in the next verse proceeds to specify the price which has been paid, or the means by which this redemption has been effected. The word here denotes that deliverance from sin, and from the evil consequences of sin, which has been effected by the offering of Jesus Christ as a propitiation; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That is in Christ Jesus - </b>Or, that has been effected by Christ Jesus; that of which he is the author and procurer; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>.</p>
