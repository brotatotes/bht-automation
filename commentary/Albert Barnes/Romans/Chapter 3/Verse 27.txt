<p style=" "><b>Where is boasting then? - </b>Where is there ground or occasion of boasting or pride? Since all have sinned, and since all have failed of being able to justify themselves by obeying the Law, and since all are alike dependent on the mere mercy of God in Christ, all ground of boasting is of course taken away. This refers particularly to the Jews, who were much addicted to boasting of their special privileges; See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1">Romans 3:1</span>, etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By what law? - </b>The word “law “here is used in the sense of “arrangement, rule, or economy.” By what arrangement, or by the operation of what rule, is boasting excluded? “(Stuart).” See <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:21">Galatians 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:20">Acts 21:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of works - </b>The Law which commands works, and on which the Jews relied. If this were complied with, and they were thereby justified, they would have had ground of self-confidence, or boasting, as being justified by their own merits. But a plan which led to this, which ended in boasting, and self-satisfaction, and pride, could not be true.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nay - </b>No.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The law of faith - </b>The rule, or arrangement which proclaims that we have no merit; that we are lost sinners; and that we are to be justified only by faith.</p>
