<p style=" "><b>What then? - </b>This is another remark supposed to be made by a Jewish objector. â€œWhat follows? or are we to infer that we are better than others?</p>
<p style=" "><b>Are we better than they? - </b>Are we Jews better than the Gentiles? Or rather, have we any preference, or advantage as to character and prospects, over the Gentiles? These questions refer only to the great point in debate, to wit, about justification before God. The apostle had admitted <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span> that the Jews had important advantages in some respects, but he now affirms that those advantages did not make a difference between them and the Gentiles about justification.</p>
<p style=" "><b>No, in no wise - </b>Not at all. That is, the Jews have no preference or advantage over the Gentiles in regard to the subject of justification before God. They have failed to keep the Law; they are sinners; and if they are justified, it must be in the same way as the rest of the world.</p>
