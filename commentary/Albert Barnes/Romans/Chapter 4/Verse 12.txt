<p style=" "><b>And the father of circumcision - </b>The father, that is, the ancestor, exemplar, or model of those who are circumcised, and who possess the same faith that he did. Not only the father of all believers <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>, but in a special sense the father of the Jewish people. In this, the apostle intimates that though all who believed would be saved as he was, yet the Jews had a special proprietorship in Abraham; they had special favors and privileges from the fact that he was their ancestor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not of the circumcision only - </b>Who are not merely circumcised, but who possess his spirit and his faith. Mere circumcision would not avail; but circumcision connected with faith like his, showed that they were especially his descendants; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:25">Romans 2:25</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who walk in the steps ... - </b>Who imitate his example; who imbibe his spirit; who have his faith.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being yet uncircumcised - </b>Before he was circumcised. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span>, with <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:0">Genesis 17:0</span>.</p>
