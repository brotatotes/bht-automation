<p style=" "><b>Because the law - </b>All law. It is the tendency of law.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Worketh wrath - </b>Produces or causes wrath. While man is fallen, and a sinner, its tendency, so far from justifying him, and producing peace, is just the reverse. It condemns, denounces wrath, and produces suffering. The word “wrath” here is to be taken in the sense of punishment. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:8">Romans 2:8</span>. And the meaning is, that the Law of God, demanding perfect purity, and denouncing every sin condemns the sinner, and consigns him to punishment. As the apostle had proved <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:0">Romans 1:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:0">Romans 2:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:0">Romans 3:0</span> that all were sinners, so it followed that if any attempted to be justified by the Law, they would be involved only in condemnation and wrath.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For where no law is ... - </b>This is a general principle; a maxim of common justice and of common sense. Law is a rule of conduct. If no such rule is given and known, there can be no crime. Law expresses what may be done, and what may not be done. If there is no command to pursue a certain course, no injunction to forbid certain conduct, actions will be innocent. The connection in which this declaration is made here, seems to imply that as the Jews had a multitude of clear laws, and as the Gentiles had the laws of nature, there could be no hope of escape from the charge of their violation. Since human nature was depraved, and people were prone to sin, the more just and reasonable the laws, the less hope was there of being justified by the Law, and the more certainty was there that the Law would produce wrath and condemnation.</p>
