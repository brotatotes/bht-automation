<p style=" "><b>Therefore - </b>In view of the course of reasoning which has been pursued. We have come to this conclusion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is of faith - </b>Justification is by faith; or the plan which God has devised of saving people is by faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That it might be by grace - </b>As a matter of mere undeserved mercy. If people were justified by law, it would be by their own merits; now it is of mere unmerited favor.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the end - </b>For the purpose, or design.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The promise ... - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:13">Romans 4:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Might be sure - </b>Might be firm, or established. On any other ground, it could not be established. If it had depended on entire conformity to the Law, the promise would never have been established, for none would have yielded such obedience. But now it may be secured to all the posterity of Abraham.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To all the seed - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:13">Romans 4:13</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not to that only - </b>Not to that part of his descendants alone who were Jews, or who had the Law.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But to that ... - </b>To all who should possess the same faith as Abraham. The father of us all. Of all who believe, whether they be Jews or Gentiles.</p>
