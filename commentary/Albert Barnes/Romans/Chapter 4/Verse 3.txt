<p style=" "><b>For what saith the Scripture? - </b>The inspired account of Abraham’s justification. This account was final, and was to settle the question. This account is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Abraham believed God - </b>In the Hebrew, “Abraham believed Yahweh.” The sense is substantially the same, as the argument turns on the act of believing. The faith which Abraham exercised was, that his posterity should be like the stars of heaven in number. This promise was made to him when he had no child, and of course when he had no prospect of such a posterity. See the strength and nature of this faith further illustrated in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16-21">Romans 4:16-21</span>. The reason why it was counted to him for righteousness was, that it was such a strong, direct, and unwavering act of confidence in the promise of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And it - </b>The word “it” here evidently refers to the act of believing It does not refer to the righteousness of another - of God, or of the Messiah; but the discussion is solely of the strong act of Abraham’s faith. which in some sense was counted to him for righteousness. In what sense this was, is explained directly after. All that is material to remark here is, that the act of Abraham, the strong confidence of his mind in the promises of God, his unwavering assurance that what God had promised he would perform, was reckoned for righteousness. The same thing is more fully expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:18-22">Romans 4:18-22</span>. When therefore it is said that the righteousness of Christ is accounted or imputed to us; when it is said that his merits are transferred and reckoned as ours; whatever may be the truth of the doctrine, it cannot be defended by “this” passage of Scripture.</p>
<p style=" ">Faith is uniformly an act of the mind. It is not a created essence which is placed within the mind. It is not a substance created independently of the soul, and placed within it by almighty power. It is not a principle, for the expression a principle of faith, is as unmeaningful as a principle of joy, or a principle of sorrow, or a principle of remorse. God promises; the man believes; and this is the whole of it.</p>
<p style=" ">(A principle is the “element or original cause,” out of which certain consequences arise, and to which they may be traced. And if faith be the root of all acceptable obedience, then certainly, in this sense, it is a principle. But whatever faith be, it is not here asserted that it is imputed for, or instead of, righteousness. See the note above.)</p>
<p style=" ">While the word “faith” is sometimes used to denote religious doctrine, or the system that is to be believed (<span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:8">Romans 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Eph 4:5</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:7">1 Timothy 2:7</span>, etc.); yet, when it is used to denote that which is required of people, it always denotes an acting of the mind exercised in relation to some object, or some promise, or threatening, or declaration of some other being; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Was counted - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐλογίσθη</span></span> elogigisthē. The same word in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:22">Romans 4:22</span>, is is rendered “it was imputed.” The word occurs frequently in the Scriptures. In the Old Testament, the verb <span class="_800000">חשׁב</span> chaashab, which which is translated by the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογίζομαι</span></span> logizomai, means literally, “to think, to intend,” or “purpose; to imagine, invent,” or “devise; to reckon,” or “account; to esteem; to impute,” that is, to impute to a man what belongs to himself, or what “ought” to be imputed to him. It occurs only in the following places: <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:2">Psalms 32:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+35:4">Psalms 35:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:7">Isaiah 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+19:11">Job 19:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+33:10">Job 33:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+16:6">Genesis 16:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:15">Genesis 38:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:13">1 Samuel 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+52:4">Psalms 52:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:18">Jeremiah 18:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="zec+7:10">Zechariah 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+6:26">Job 6:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+19:16">Job 19:16</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>Isa 13:17</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+10:21">1 Kings 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:27">Numbers 18:27</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:30">Numbers 18:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+88:4">Psalms 88:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:17">Isaiah 40:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="la+4:2">Lamentations 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:15">Isaiah 40:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:16">Genesis 31:16</span>. I have examined all the passages, and as the result of my examination have come to the conclusion, that there is not one in which the word is used in the sense of reckoning or imputing to a man what does not strictly belong to him; or of charging on him what ought not to be charged on him as a matter of personal right. The word is never used to denote imputing in the sense of transferring, or of charging that on one which does not properly belong to him. The same is the case in the New Testament. The word occurs about forty times (see “Schmidius’ Concord),” and, in a similar signification. No doctrine of transferring, or of setting over to a man what does not properly belong to him, be it sin or holiness, can be derived, therefore, from this word. Whatever is meant by it here, it evidently is declared that the act of believing is what is intended, both by Moses and by Paul.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For righteousness - </b>In order to justification; or to regard and treat him in connection with this as a righteous man; as one who was admitted to the favor and friendship of God. In reference to this we may remark,</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That it is evidently not intended that the act of believing, on the part of Abraham, was the meritorious ground of acceptance; for then it would have been a work. Faith was as much his own act, as any act of obedience to the Law.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The design of the apostle was to show that by the Law, or by works, man could not be justified; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:2">Romans 4:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Faith was not what the Law required. It demanded complete and perfect obedience; and if a man was justified by faith, it was in some other way than by the Law.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) As the Law did not demand this; and as faith was something different from the demand of the Law; so if a man were justified by that, it was on a principle altogether different from justification by works. It was not by personal merit. It was not by complying with the Law. It was in a mode entirely different.</p>
<p style=" ">(5) In being justified by faith, it is meant, therefore, that we are treated as righteous; that we are forgiven; that we are admitted to the favor of God, and treated as his friends.</p>
<p style=" ">(6) In this act, faith, is a mere instrument, an antecedent, a “sine qua non,” what God has been pleased to appoint as a condition on which men may be treated as righteous. It expresses a state of mind which is demonstrative of love to God; of affection for his cause and character; of reconciliation and friendship; and is therefore that state to which he has been graciously pleased to promise pardon and acceptance.</p>
<p style=" ">(7) Since this is not a matter of law; since the Law could not be said to demand it; as it is on a different principle; and as the acceptance of faith, or of a believer, cannot be a matter of merit or claim, so justification is of grace, or mere favor. It is in no sense a matter of merit on our part, and thus stands distinguished entirely from justification by works, or by conformity to the Law. From beginning to end, it is, so far as we are concerned, a matter of grace. The merit by which all this is obtained, is the work of the Lord Jesus Christ, through whom this plan is proposed, and by whose atonement alone God can consistently pardon and treat as righteous those who are in themselves ungodly; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>. In this place we have also evidence that faith is always substantially of the same character. In the case of Abraham it was confidence in God and his promises. All faith has the same nature, whether it be confidence in the Messiah, or in any of the divine promises or truths. As this confidence evinces the same state of mind, so it was as consistent to justify Abraham by it, as it is to justify him who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ under the gospel; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:0">Hebrews 11:0</span>.</p>
