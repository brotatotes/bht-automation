<p style=" "><b>Blessed - </b>Happy are they: they are highly favored; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Whose sins are covered - </b>Are concealed; or hidden from the view. On which God will no more look, and which he will no more remember. “By these words,” says Calvin (in loco), “we are taught that justification with Paul is nothing else but pardon of sin.” The word “cover” here has no reference to the atonement, but is expressive of hiding, or concealing that is, of forgiving sin.</p>
