<p style=" "><b>Therefore - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οὖν</span></span> oun Since we are thus justified, or as a consequence of being justified, we have peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being justified by faith - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We - </b>That is, all who are justified. The apostle is evidently speaking of true Christians.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have peace with God - </b>see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>. True religion is often represented as peace with God; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:36">Acts 10:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:15">Romans 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+32:17">Isaiah 32:17</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “And the work of righteousness shall be peace,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> And the effect of righteousness.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Quietness and assurance forever:”</p>
<p style=" ">This is called peace, because,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)The state of a sinner’s mind is far from peace. He is often agitated, alarmed, trembling. He feels that he is alienated from God. For,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “The wicked are like the troubled sea.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> For it never can be at rest;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Whose waters cast up mire and dirt.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4.25em;  "> <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:20">Isaiah 57:20</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The sinner in this state regards God as his enemy. He trembles when he thinks of his Law; fears his judgments; is alarmed when he thinks of hell. His bosom is a stranger to peace. This has been felt in all lands, alike under the thunders of the Law of Sinai among the Jews; in the pagan world; and in lands where the gospel is preached. It is the effect of an alarmed and troubled conscience.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) The plan of salvation by Christ reveals God as willing to be reconciled. He is ready to pardon, and to be at peace. If the sinner repents and believes, God can now consistently forgive him, and admit him to favor. It is therefore a plan by which the mind of God and of the sinner can become reconciled, or united in feeling and in purpose. The obstacles on the part of God to reconciliation, arising from his justice and Law, have been removed, and he is now willing to be at peace. The obstacles on the part of man, arising from his sin, his rebellion, and his conscious guilt, may be taken away, and he can now regard God as his friend.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) The effect of this plan, when the sinner embraces it, is to produce peace in his own mind. He experiences peace; a peace which the world gives not, and which the world cannot take away, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>. Usually in the work of conversion to God, this peace is the first evidence that is felt of the change of heart. Before, the sinner was agitated and troubled. But often suddenly, a peace and calmness is felt, which is before unknown. The alarm subsides; the heart is calm; the fears die away, like the waves of the ocean after a storm. A sweet tranquillity visits the heart - a pure shining light, like the sunbeams that break through the opening clouds after a tempest. The views, the feelings, the desires are changed; and the bosom that was just before filled with agitation and alarm, that regarded God as its enemy, is now at peace with him, and with all the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through our Lord Jesus Christ - </b>By means of the atonement of the Lord Jesus. It is his mediation that has procured it.</p>
