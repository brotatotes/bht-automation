<p style=" "><b>For if - </b>The idea in this verse is simply a repetition and enlargement of that in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:9">Romans 5:9</span>. The apostle dwells on the thought, and places it in a new light, furnishing thus a strong confirmation of his position.</p>
<p style=" "><b>When we were enemies - </b>The work was undertaken while we were enemies. From being enemies we were changed to friends by that work. Thus, it was commenced by God; its foundation was laid while we were still hostile to it; it evinced, therefore, a determined purpose on the part of God to perform it; and he has thus given a pledge that it shall be perfected.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We were reconciled - </b>Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:24">Matthew 5:24</span>. We are brought to an agreement; to a state of friendship and union. We became his friends, laid aside our opposition, and embraced him as our friend and portion. To effect this is the great design of the plan of salvation; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1-20">2 Corinthians 5:1-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:21">Colossians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:16">Ephesians 2:16</span>. It means that there were obstacles existing on both sides to a reconciliation; and that these have been removed by the death of Christ; and that a union has thus been effected. This has been done in removing the obstacles on the part of God - by maintaining the honor of his Law; showing his hatred of sin; upholding his justice, and maintaining his truth, at the same time that he pardons; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>. And on the part of man, by removing his unwillingness to be reconciled; by subduing, changing, and sanctifying his heart; by overcoming his hatred of God, and of his Law; and bringing him into submission to the government of God. So that the Christian is in fact reconciled to God; he is his friend; he is pleased with his Law, his character, and his plan of salvation. And all this has been accomplished by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus as an offering in our place.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Much more - </b>It is much more to be expected; there are still stronger and more striking considerations to show it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By his life - </b>We were reconciled by his death. Death may include possibly his low, humble, and suffering condition. Death has the appearance of great feebleness; the death of Christ had the appearance of the defeat of his plans. His enemies triumphed and rejoiced over him on the cross, and in the tomb. Yet the effect of this feeble, low, and humiliating state was to reconcile us to God. If in this state, when humble, despised, dying, dead, he had power to accomplish so great a work as to reconcile us to God, how much more may we expect that he will be able to keep us now that he is a living, exalted, and triumphant Redeemer. If his fainting powers in dying were such as to reconcile us, how much more shall his full, vigorous powers as an exalted Redeemer, be sufficient to keep and save us. This argument is but an expansion of what the Saviour himself said; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>, “Because I live, ye shall live also.”</p>
