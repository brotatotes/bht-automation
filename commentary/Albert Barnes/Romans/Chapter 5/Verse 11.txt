<p style=" ">The Greek word which denotes the expiatory offering by which a reconciliation is effected, is different from the one here; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>. The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλαγὴ</span></span> katallagē is never used to denote such an offering, but denotes the reconciliation itself.</p>
