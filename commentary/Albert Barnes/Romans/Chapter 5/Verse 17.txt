<p style=" "><b>For if - </b>This verse contains the same idea as before presented, but in a varied form. It is condensing the whole subject, and presenting it in a single view.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By one man’s offence - </b>Or, by one offence. Margin. The reading of the text is the more correct. “If, under the administration of a just and merciful Being, it has occurred, that by the offence of one, death hath exerted so wide a dominion; we have reason much more to expect under that administration, that they who are brought under his plan of saving mercy shall be brought under a dispensation of life.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Death reigned - </b>Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By one - </b>By means of one man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Much more - </b>We have much more reason to expect it. It evidently accords much more with the administration of a Being of infinite goodness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They which receive abundance of grace - </b>The abundant favor; the mercy that shall counterbalance and surpass the evils introduced by the sin of Adam. That favor shall be more than sufficient to counterbalance all those evils. This is particularly true of the redeemed, of whom the apostle in this verse is speaking. The evils which they suffer in consequence of the sin of Adam bear no comparison with the mercies of eternal life that shall flow to them from the work of the Saviour.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The gift of righteousness - </b>This stands opposed to the evils introduced by Adam. As the effect of his sin was to produce condemnation, so here the gift of righteousness refers to the opposite, to pardon, to justification, to acceptance with God. To show that people were thus justified by the gospel, was the leading design of the apostle; and the argument here is, that if by one man’s sin, death reigned over those who were under condemnation in consequence of it, we have much more reason to suppose that they who are delivered from sin by the death of Christ, and accepted of God, shall reign with him in life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall reign - </b>The word “reign” is often applied to the condition of saints in heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12">2 Timothy 2:12</span>, “If we suffer, we shall also reign with him;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>. It means that they shall be exalted to a glorious state of happiness in heaven; that they shall be triumphant over all their enemies; shall gain an ultimate victory; and shall partake with the Captain of their salvation in the splendors of his dominion above, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In life - </b>This stands opposed to the death that reigned as the consequence of the sin of Adam. It denotes complete freedom from condemnation; from temporal death; from sickness, pain, and sin. It is the usual expression to denote the complete bliss of the saints in glory; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By one, Jesus Christ - </b>As the consequence of his work. The apostle here does not state the mode or manner in which this was done; nor does he say that it was perfectly parallel in the mode with the effects of the sin of Adam. He is comparing the results or consequences of the sin of the one and of the work of the other. There is a similarity in the consequences. The way in which the work of Christ had contributed to this he had stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>.</p>
