<p style=" "><b>We have access - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>, “I am the way,” etc. Doddridge renders it, “by whom we have been introduced,” etc. It means, “by whom we have the privilege of obtaining the favor of God which we enjoy when we are justified.” The word rendered “access” occurs but in two other places in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:18">Ephesians 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</span>. By Jesus Christ the way is opened for us to obtain the favor of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By faith - </b>By means of faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Into this grace - </b>Into this favor of reconciliation with God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Wherein we stand - </b>In which we now are in consequence of being justified.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And rejoice - </b>Religion is often represented as producing joy, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:3">Isaiah 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:10">Isaiah 35:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:9">Isaiah 52:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:3">Isaiah 61:3</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:7">Isaiah 61:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:14">Isaiah 65:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:18">Isaiah 65:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:24">John 16:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:52">Acts 13:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span>. The sources or steps of this joy are these:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) We are justified, or regarded by God as righteous.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) We are admitted into his favor, and abide there.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) We have the prospect of still higher and richer blessings in the fulness of his glory when we are admitted to heaven.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In hope - </b>In the earnest desire and expectation of obtaining that glory. Hope is a complex emotion made up of a desire for an object; and an expectation of obtaining it. Where either of these is lacking, there is not hope. Where they are mingled in improper proportions, there is not peace. But where the desire of obtaining an object is attended with an expectation of obtaining it, in proportion to that desire, there exists that peaceful, happy state of mind which we denominate hope And the apostle here implies that the Christian has an earnest desire for that glory; and that he has a confident expectation of obtaining it. The result of that he immediately states to be, that we are by it sustained in our afflictions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The glory of God - </b>The glory that God will bestow on us. The word “glory” usually means splendor, magnificence, honor; and the apostle here refers to that honor and dignity which will be conferred on the redeemed when they are raised up to the full honors of redemption; when they shall triumph in the completion of the work: and be freed from sin, and pain, and tears, and permitted to participate in the full splendors that shall encompass the throne of God in the heavens; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:22-24">Revelation 21:22-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:19-20">Isaiah 60:19-20</span>.</p>
