<p style=" "><b>And hope maketh not ashamed - </b>That is, this hope will not disappoint, or deceive. When we hope for an object which we do not obtain, we are conscious of disappointment; perhaps sometimes of a feeling of shame. But the apostle says that the Christian hope is such that it will be fulfilled; it will not disappoint; what we hope for we shall certainly obtain; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>. The expression used here is probably taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:4-5">Psalms 22:4-5</span>;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Our fathers trusted in thee;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> They trusted; and thou didst deliver them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> They cried unto thee,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> And were delivered;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> They trusted in thee,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> And were not confounded (ashamed).</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because the love of God - </b>Love toward God. There is produced an abundant, an overflowing love to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Is shed abroad - </b>Is diffused; is poured out; is abundantly produced <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐκκέχυται</span></span> ekkechutai. This word is properly applied to water, or to any other liquid that is poured out, or diffused. It is used also to denote imparting, or communicating freely or abundantly, and is thus expressive of the influence of the Holy Spirit poured down, or abundantly imparted to people; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:45">Acts 10:45</span>. Here it means that love toward God is copiously or abundantly given to a Christian; his heart is conscious of high and abundant love to God, and by this he is sustained in his afflictions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By the Holy Ghost - </b>It is produced by the influence of the Holy Spirit. All Christian graces are traced to his influence; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>, “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is given unto us - </b>Which Spirit is given or imparted to us. The Holy Spirit is thus represented as dwelling in the hearts of believers; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span>; <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Co 3:16</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>. In all these places it is meant that Christians are under his sanctifying influence; that he produces in their hearts the Christian graces; and fills their minds with peace, and love, and joy.</p>
