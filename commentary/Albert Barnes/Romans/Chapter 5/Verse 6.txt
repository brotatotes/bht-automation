<p style=" "><b>For when ... - </b>This opens a new view of the subject, or it is a new argument to show that our hope will not make ashamed, or will not disappoint us. The first argument he had stated in the previous verse, that the Holy Spirit was given to us. The next, which he now states, is, that God had given the most ample proof that he would save us by giving his Son when we were sinners; and that he who had done so much for us when we were enemies, would not now fail us when we are his friends; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6-10">Romans 5:6-10</span>. He has performed the more difficult part of the work by reconciling us when we were enemies; and he will not now forsake us, but will carry forward and complete what he has begun.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We were yet without strength - </b>The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀσθενῶν</span></span> asthenōn is usually applied to those who are sick and feeble, deprived of strength by disease; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:38">Matthew 25:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:9">Luke 10:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:9">Acts 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span>. But it is also used in a moral sense, to denote inability or feebleness with regard to any undertaking or duty. Here it means that we were without strength “in regard to the case which the apostle was considering;” that is, we had no power to devise a scheme of justification, to make an atonement, or to put away the wrath of God, etc. While all hope of man’s being saved by any plan of his own was thus taken away; while he was thus lying exposed to divine justice, and dependent on the mere mercy of God; God provided a plan which met the case, and secured his salvation. The remark of the apostle here has reference only to the condition of the race before an atonement is made. It does not pertain to the question whether man has strength to repent and to believe after an atonement is made, which is a very different inquiry.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In due time - </b>Margin “According to the time” <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατὰ καιρὸν</span></span> kata kairon. In a timely manner; at the proper time; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>, “But when the fulness of time was come,” etc. This may mean,</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That it was a fit or proper time. All experiments had failed to save people. For four thousand years the trial had been made under the Law among the Jews: and by the aid of the most enlightened reason in Greece and Rome; and still it was in vain. No scheme had been devised to meet the maladies of the world, and to save people from death. It was then time that a better plan should be presented to people.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) It was the time fixed and appointed by God for the Messiah to come; the time which had been designated by the prophets; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:10">Genesis 49:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</span>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) It was a most favorable time for the spread of the gospel. The world was expecting such an event; was at peace; and was subjected mainly to the Roman power; and furnished facilities never before experienced for introducing the gospel rapidly into every land; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1-2">Matthew 2:1-2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For the ungodly - </b>Those who do not worship God. It here means sinners in general, and does not differ materially from what is meant by the word translated “without strength;” see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>.</p>
