<p style=" "><b>But God commendeth ... - </b>God has exhibited or showed his love in this unusual and remarkable manner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His love - </b>His kind feeling; his beneficence; his willingness to submit to sacrifice to do good to others.</p>
<p style=" "><b>While we were yet sinners - </b>And of course his enemies. In this, his love surpasses all that has ever been manifested among people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Christ died for us - </b>In our stead; to save us from death. He took our place; and by dying himself on the cross, saved us from dying eternally in hell.</p>
