But God commendeth ... - God has exhibited or showed his love in this unusual and remarkable manner.His love - His kind feeling; his beneficence; his willingness to submit to sacrifice to do good to others.While we were yet sinners - And of course his enemies. In this, his love surpasses all that has ever been manifested among people.Christ died for us - In our stead; to save us from death. He took our place; and by dying himself on the cross, saved us from dying eternally in hell.
