<p style=" "><b>Much more, then - </b>It is much more reasonable to expect it. There are fewer obstacles in the way. If, when we were enemies, he overcame all that was in the way of our salvation; much more have we reason to expect that he will afford us protection now that we are his friends. This is one ground of the hope expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Being now justified - </b>Pardoned; accepted as his friends.</p>
<p style=" "><b>By his blood - </b>By his death; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>. The fact that we are purchased by his blood, and sanctified by it, renders us sacred in the eye of God; bestows a value on us proportionate to the worth of the price of our redemption; and is a pledge that he will keep what has been so dearly bought.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Saved from wrath - </b>From hell; from the punishment due to sin; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:8">Romans 2:8</span>.</p>
