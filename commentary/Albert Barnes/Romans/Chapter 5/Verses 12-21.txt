<p style=" "><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12-21">Romans 5:12-21</span> has been usually regarded as the most difficult part of the New Testament. It is not the design of these notes to enter into a minute criticism of contested points like this. They who wish to see a full discussion of the passage, may find it in the professedly critical commentaries; and especially in the commentaries of Tholuck and of Professor Stuart on the Romans. The meaning of the passage in its general bearing is not difficult; and probably the whole passage would have been found far less difficult if it had not been attached to a philosophical theory on the subject of man’s sin, and if a strenuous and indefatigable effort had not been made to prove that it teaches what it was never designed to teach. The plain and obvious design of the passage is this, to show one of the benefits of the doctrine of justification by faith. The apostle had shown,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (a)By the regular tendency of afflictions under the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3-4">Romans 5:3-4</span>; and,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.75em;  "> (b)By the fact that the Holy Spirit was imparted to the believer.</p>
<p style=" ">He now proceeds to show the bearing on that great mass of evil which had been introduced into the world by sin, and to prove that the benefits of the atonement were far greater than the evils which had been introduced by the acknowledged effects of the sin of Adam. “The design is to exalt our views of the work of Christ, and of the plan of justification through him, by comparing them with the evil consequences of the sin of our first father, and by showing that the blessings in question not only extend to the removal of these evils, but far beyond this, so that the grace of the gospel has not only abounded, but superabounded.” (Prof. Stuart.) In doing this, the apostle admits, as an undoubted and well-understood fact:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 1. That sin came into the world by one man, and death as the consequence. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 2. That death had passed on all; even on those who had not the light of revelation, and the express commands of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13-14">Romans 5:13-14</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 3. That Adam was the figure, the type of him that was to come; that there was some sort of analogy or resemblance between the results of his act and the results of the work of Christ. That analogy consisted in the fact that the effects of his doings did not terminate on himself, but extended to numberless other persons, and that it was thus with the work of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span>. But he shows,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> 4. That there were very material and important differences in the two cases. There was not a perfect parallelism. The effects of the work of Christ were far more than simply to counteract the evil introduced by the sin of Adam. The differences between the effect of his act and the work of Christ are these.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For until the law ... - </b>This verse, with the following verses to the 17th, is usually regarded as a parenthesis. The Law here evidently means the Law given by Moses. “Until the commencement of that administration, or state of things under the law.” To see the reason why he referred to this period between Adam and the Law, we should recall the design of the apostle, which is, to show the exceeding grace of God in the gospel, abounding, and superabounding, as a complete remedy for all the evils introduced by sin. For this purpose he introduces three leading conditions, or states, where people sinned, and where the effects of sin were seen; in regard to each and all of which the grace of the gospel superabounded. The first was that of Adam, with its attendant train of ills <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>, which ills were all met by the death of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15-18">Romans 5:15-18</span>. The second period or condition was that long interval in which men had only the light of nature, that period occurring between Adam and Moses. This was a fair representation of the condition of the world without revelation, and without law, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13-14">Romans 5:13-14</span>. Sin then reigned - reigned everywhere where there was no law. But the grace of the gospel abounded over the evils of this state of man. The third was under the Law, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>. The Law entered, and sin was increased, and its evils abounded. But the gospel of Christ abounded even over this, and grace triumphantly reigned. So that the plan of justification met all the evils of sin, and was adapted to remove them; sin and its consequences as flowing from Adam; sin and its consequences when there was no written revelation; and sin and its consequences under the light and terrors of the Law.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Sin was in the world - </b>People sinned. They did what was evil.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But sin is not imputed - </b>Is not charged against people, or they are not held guilty of it where there is no law. This is a self-evident proposition, for sin is a violation of law; and if there is no law, there can be no wrong. Assuming this as a self-evident proposition, the connection is, that there must have been a law of some kind; a “law written on their hearts,” since sin was in the world, and people could not be charged with sin, or treated as sinners, unless there was some law. The passage here states a great and important principle, that people will not be held to be guilty unless there is a law which binds them of which they are apprized, and which they voluntarily transgress; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>. This verse, therefore, meets an objection that might be started from what had been said in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>. The apostle had affirmed that “where no law is there is no transgression.” He here stated that all were sinners. It might be objected, that as during this long period of time they had no law, they could not be stoners. To meet this, he says that people were then in fact sinners, and were treated as such, which showed that there must have been a law.</p>
