<p style=" ">The argument commenced in this chapter is continued through the two following. The general design is the same - “to show that the scheme of justification which God had adopted does not lead people to sin, but on the contrary to holiness.” This is introduced by answering an objection, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>. The apostle pursues this subject by various arguments and illustrations, all tending to show that the design and bearing of the scheme of justification was to produce the hatred of sin, and the love and practice of holiness. In this chapter, the argument is mainly drawn from the following sources:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) From the baptism of Christians, by which they have professed to be dead to sin, and to be bound to live to God, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2-13">Romans 6:2-13</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) From the fact that they were now the servants of God, and under obligation, by the laws of servitude, to obey him, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15-20">Romans 6:15-20</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) From their former experience of the evil of sin, from its tendency to produce misery and death, and from the fact that by the gospel they had been made ashamed of those things, and had now given themselves to the pure service of God. By these various considerations, he repels the charge that the tendency of the doctrine was to produce licentiousness, but affirms that it was a system of purity and peace. The argument is continued in the two following chapters, showing still further the purifying tendency of the gospel.</p>
