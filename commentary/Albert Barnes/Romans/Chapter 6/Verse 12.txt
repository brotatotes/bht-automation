<p style=" "><b>Let not sin therefore - </b>This is a conclusion drawn from the previous train of reasoning. The result of all these considerations is, that sin should not be suffered to reign in us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Reign - </b>Have dominion; obtain the ascendency, or rule.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In your mortal body - </b>In you. The apostle uses the word “mortal” here, perhaps, for these reasons,</p>
<p style=" "><b>That ye should obey it - </b>That sin should get such an ascendency as to rule entirely over you, and make you the slave.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the lusts thereof - </b>In its desires, or propensities.</p>
