<p style=" "><b>Likewise - </b>In like manner. This is an exhortation drawn from the argument in the previous verses. It shows the design and tendency of the Christian scheme.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Reckon ye yourselves - </b>Judge, or esteem yourselves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To be dead indeed unto sin - </b>So that sin shall have no influence or control ever you, any more than the objects of this world have ever the dead in their graves; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2">Romans 6:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But alive unto God - </b>Bound to live to promote his glory; to make this the great and sole object of your living.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through Jesus Christ - </b>By means of the death, and resurrection, and example of Jesus Christ. The apostle regards all our disposition to live to God as resulting from the work of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
