<p style=" "><b>Know ye not - </b>This is an appeal to their own observation respecting the relation between husband and wife. The illustration <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2-3">Romans 7:2-3</span> is designed simply to show that as when a man dies, and the connection between him and his wife is dissolved, his Law ceases to be binding on her, so also a separation has taken place between Christians and the Law, in which they have become dead to it, and they are not now to attempt to draw their life and peace from it, but from that new source with which they are connected by the gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For I speak to them ... - </b>Probably the apostle refers here more particularly to the Jewish members of the Roman church, who were qualified particularly to understand the nature of the Law, and to appreciate the argument. That there were many Jews in the church at Rome has been shown (see Introduction); but the illustration has no exclusive reference to them. The Law to which he appeals is sufficiently general to make the illustration intelligible to all people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That the law - </b>The immediate reference here is probably to the Mosaic Law. But what is here affirmed is equally true of all laws.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath dominion - </b>Greek, Rules; exercises lordship. The Law is here personified, and represented as setting up a lordship over a man, and exacting obedience.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Over a man - </b>Over the man who is under it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As long as he liveth - </b>The Greek here may mean either “as he liveth,” or” as it liveth,” that is, the law. But our translation has evidently expressed the sense. The sense is, that death releases a man from the laws by which he was bound in life. It is a general principle, relating to the laws of the land, the law of a parent, the law of a contract, etc. This general principle the apostle proceeds to apply in regard to the Law of God.</p>
