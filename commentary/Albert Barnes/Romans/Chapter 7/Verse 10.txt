<p style=" "><b>And the commandment - </b>The Law to which he had referred before.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which was ordained to life - </b>Which was intended to produce life, or happiness. Life here stands opposed to death, and means felicity, peace, eternal bliss; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>. When the apostle says that it was ordained to life, he probably has reference to the numerous passages in the Old Testament which speak of the Law in this manner, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="le+18:5">Leviticus 18:5</span>, “Ye shall keep my statutes and my judgments; which if a man do, he shall live in them,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:11">Ezekiel 20:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:13">Ezekiel 20:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:21">Ezekiel 20:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+18:9">Ezekiel 18:9</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+18:21">Ezekiel 18:21</span>. The meaning of these passages, in connection with this declaration of Paul, may be thus expressed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)If man was pure, and it was obeyed perfectly, it would produce life and happiness only. On those who have obeyed it in heaven, it has produced only happiness.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)For this it was ordained; it is adapted to it; and when perfectly obeyed, it produces no other effect. But,</p>
<p style=" ">It crosses the inclination of man, and instead of producing peace and life, as it would on a being perfectly holy, it produces only woe and crime. The law of a parent may be good, and may be appointed to promote the happiness of his children; it may be admirably suited to it if all were obedient; yet in the family there may be one obstinate, self-willed, and stubborn child, resolved to indulge his evil passions, and the results to him would be woe and despair. The commandment, which was ordained for the good of the family, and which would be adapted to promote their welfare, he alone, of all the number, would find to be unto death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I found - </b>It was to me. It produced this effect.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto death - </b>Producing aggravated guilt and condemnation, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:9">Romans 7:9</span>.</p>
