<p style=" "><b>For sin - </b>This verse is a repetition, with a little variation of the sentiment in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Deceived me - </b>The word used here properly means to lead or seduce from the right way; and then to deceive, solicit to sin, cause to err from the way of virtue, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:18">Romans 16:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:18">1 Corinthians 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span>, “The serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>. The meaning here seems to be, that his corrupt and rebellious propensities, excited by the Law, led him astray; caused him more and more to sin; practiced a species of deception on him by urging him on headlong, and without deliberation, into aggravated transgression. In this sense, all sinners are deceived. Their passions urge them on, deluding them, and leading them further and further from happiness, and involving them, before they are aware, in crime and death. No being in the universe is more deladed than a sinner in the indulgence of evil passions. The description of Solomon in a particular case will apply to all, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+7:21-23">Proverbs 7:21-23</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> “With much fair speech she caused him to yield,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> With the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> He goeth after her straightway,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> As an ox goeth to the slaughter,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> Till a dart strike through his liver,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.0em;  "> As a bird hasteth to the snare.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>By it - </b>By the Law, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Slew me - </b>Meaning the same as “I died,” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>.</p>
