Wherefore - So that. The conclusion to which we come is, that the Law is not to be blamed, though these are its effects under existing circumstances. The source of all this is not the Law, but the corrupt nature of man. The Law is good; and yet the position of the apostle is true, that it is not adapted to purify the heart of fallen man. Its tendency is to excite increased guilt, conflict, alarm, and despair. This verse contains an answer to the question in Romans 7:7, “Is the law sin?”Is holy - Is not sin; compare Romans 7:7. It is pure in its nature.And the commandment - The word “commandment” is here synonymous with the Law. It properly means what is enjoined.Holy - Pure.Just - Righteous in its claims and penalties. It is not unequal in its exactions.Good - In itself good; and in its own nature tending to produce happiness. The sin and condemnation of the guilty is not the fault of the Law. If obeyed, it would produce happiness everywhere. See a most beautiful description of the law of God in Psalms 19:7-11.
