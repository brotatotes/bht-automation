For the woman - This verse is a specific illustration of the general principle in Romans 7:1, that death dissolves those connections and relations which make law binding in life. It is a simple illustration; and if this had been kept in mind, it would have saved much of the perplexity which has been felt by many commentators, and much of their wild vagaries in endeavoring to show that “men are the wife, the law of the former husband, and Christ the new one;” or that “the old man is the wife, sinful desires the husband, sins the children.” Beza. (See Stuart.) Such expositions are sufficient to humble us, and to make us mourn over the puerile and fanciful interpretations which even wise and good people often give to the Bible.Is bound by the law ... - See the same sentiment in 1 Corinthians 7:39.To her husband - She is united to him; and is under his authority as the head of the household. To him is particularly committed the headship of the family, and the wife is subject to his law, in the Lord, Ephesians 5:23, Ephesians 5:33.She is loosed ... - The husband has no more authority. The connection from which obligation resulted is dissolved.
