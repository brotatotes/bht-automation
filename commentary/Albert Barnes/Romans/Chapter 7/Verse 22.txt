<p style=" "><b>For I delight - </b>The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συνήδομαι</span></span> Sunēdomai, occurs no where else in the New Testament. It properly means to rejoice with anyone; and expresses not only approbation of the understanding, as the expression, “I consent unto the law,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:16">Romans 7:16</span>, but more than that it denotes sensible pleasure in the heart. It indicates not only intellectual assent, but emotion, an emotion of pleasure in the contemplation of the Law. And this shows that the apostle is not speaking of an unrenewed man. Of such a man it might be said that his conscience approved the Law; that his understanding was convinced that the Law was good; but never yet did it occur that an impenitent sinner found emotions of pleasure in the contemplation of the pure and spiritual Law of God. If this expression can be applied to an unrenewed man, there is, perhaps, not a single mark of a pious mind which may not with equal propriety be so applied. It is the natural, obvious, and usual mode of denoting the feelings of piety, an assent to the divine Law followed with emotions of sensible delight in the contemplation. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:97">Psalms 119:97</span>, “O how love I thy law; it is my meditation all the day.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:2">Psalms 1:2</span>, “but his delight is in the law of the Lord.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:7-11">Psalms 19:7-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="job+23:12">Job 23:12</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the law of God - </b>The word “law” here is used in a large sense, to denote all the communications which God had made to control man. The sense is, that the apostle was pleased with the whole. One mark of genuine piety is to be pleased with the whole of the divine requirements.</p>
<p style=" "><b>After the inward man - </b>In respect to the inward man. The expression “the inward man” is used sometimes to denote the rational part of man as opposed to the sensual; sometimes the mind as opposed to the body (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:4">1 Peter 3:4</span>). It is thus used by the Greek classic writers. Here it is used evidently in opposition to a carnal and corrupt nature; to the evil passions and desires of the soul in an unrenewed state; to what is called elsewhere “the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>. The “inward man” is called elsewhere “the new man” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>; and denotes not the mere intellect, or conscience, but is a personification of the principles of action by which a Christian is governed; the new nature; the holy disposition; the inclination of the heart that is renewed.</p>
