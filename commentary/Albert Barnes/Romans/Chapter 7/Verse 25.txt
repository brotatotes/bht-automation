<p style=" "><b>I thank God - </b>That is, I thank God for effecting a deliverance to which I am myself incompetent. There is a way of rescue, and I trace it altogether to his mercy in the Lord Jesus Christ. What conscience could not do, what the Law could not do, what unaided human strength could not do, has been accomplished by the plan of the gospel; and complete deliverance can be expected there, and there alone. This is the point to which all his reasoning had tended; and having thus shown that the Law was insufficient to effect this deliverance. he is now prepared to utter the language of Christian thankfulness that it can be effected by the gospel. The superiority of the gospel to the Law in overcoming all the evils under which man labors, is thus triumphantly established; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:57">1 Corinthians 15:57</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>So then - </b>As the result of the whole inquiry we have come to this conclusion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With the mind - </b>With the understanding, the conscience, the purposes, or intentions of the soul. This is a characteristic of the renewed nature. Of no impenitent sinner could it be ever affirmed that with his mind he served the Law of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>I myself - </b>It is still the same person, though acting in this apparently contradictory manner.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Serve the law of God - </b>Do honor to it as a just and holy law <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:12">Romans 7:12</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:16">Romans 7:16</span>, and am inclined to obey it, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22">Romans 7:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But with the flesh - </b>The corrupt propensities and lusts, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>,</p>
<p style=" "><b>The law of sin - </b>That is, in the members. The flesh throughout, in all its native propensities and passions, leads to sin; it has no tendency to holiness; and its corruptions can be overcome only by the grace of God. We have thus,</p>
