<p style=" "><b>For when ... - </b>The illustration in this verse and the following is designed to show more at length the effect of the Law, whenever and whereever applied; whether in a state of nature or of grace. It was always the same. It was the occasion of agitation and conflict in a man’s own mind. This was true when a sinner was under conviction; and it was true when a man was a Christian. In all circumstances where the Law was applied to the corrupt mind of man, it produced this agitation and conflict. Even in the Christian’s mind it produced this agitation <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14-24">Romans 7:14-24</span>, as it had done and would do in the mind of a sinner under conviction <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-12">Romans 7:7-12</span>, and consequently there was no hope of release but in the delivering and sanctifying power of the gospel <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1-3">Romans 8:1-3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In the flesh - </b>Unconverted; subject to the controlling passions and propensities of a corrupt nature; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:8-9">Romans 8:8-9</span>. The connection shows that this must be the meaning here, and the design of this illustration is to show the effect of the Law before a man is converted, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5-12">Romans 7:5-12</span>. This is the obvious meaning, and all the laws of interpretation require us so to understand it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The motions of sins - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παθήματα</span></span> ta pathēmata.) This translation is unhappy. The expression “motions of sins” conveys no idea. The original means simply the passions, the evil affections, the corrupt desires; see the margin. The expression, passions of sins, is a Hebraism meaning sinful passions, and refers here to the corrupt propensities and inclinations of the unrenewed heart.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which were by the law - </b>Not that they were originated or created by the Law; for a law does not originate evil propensities, and a holy law would not cause sinful passions; but they were excited, called up, inflamed by the Law, which forbids their indulgence.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Did work in our members - </b>In our body; that is, in us. Those sinful propensities made use of our members as instruments, to secure gratification; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:12-13">Romans 6:12-13</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>To bring forth fruit unto death - </b>To produce crime, agitation, conflict, distress, and to lead to death. We were brought under the dominion of death; and the consequence of the indulgence of those passions would be fatal; compare the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:21">Romans 6:21</span>.</p>
