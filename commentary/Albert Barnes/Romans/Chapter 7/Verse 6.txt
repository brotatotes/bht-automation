<p style=" "><b>But now - </b>Under the gospel. This verse states the consequences of the gospel, in distinction from the effects of the Law. The way in which this is accomplished, the apostle illustrates more at length in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:0">Romans 8:0</span> with which this verse is properly connected. The remainder of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:0">Romans 7:0</span> is occupied in illustrating the statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>, of the effects of the Law; and after having shown that its effects always were to increase crime and distress, he is prepared in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:0">Romans 8:0</span> to take up the proposition in this verse, and to show the superiority of the gospel in producing peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We are delivered - </b>We who are Christians. Delivered from it as a means of justification, as a source of sanctification, as a bondage to which we were subjected, and which tended to produce pain and death. It does not mean that Christians are freed from it as a rule of duty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That being dead - </b>Margin, “Being dead to that.” There is a variation here in the manuscripts. Some read it, as in the text, as if the Law was dead; others, as in the margin. as if we were dead. The majority is in favor of the reading as in the margin; and the connection requires us to understand it in this sense. So the Syriac, the Arabic, the Vulgate, AEthiopic. The sentiment here, that we are dead to the Law, is what is expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Wherein we were held - </b>That is, as captives, or as slaves. We were held in bondage to it; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:1">Romans 7:1</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That we should serve - </b>That we may now serve or obey God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In newness of spirit - </b>In a new spirit; or in a new and spiritual manner. This is a form of expression implying,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That it was to be of a spiritual nature, as distinguished from that practiced by the Jews; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28-29">Romans 2:28-29</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The worship required under the gospel is uniformly described as that of the spirit and the heart, rather than that of form and ceremony; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:23">John 4:23</span>, “The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And not in the oldness of the letter - </b>Not in the old letter. It is implied here in this,</p>
<p style=" ">To understand this, it is necessary to remember that the Law which prescribed the forms of worship among the Jews, was regarded by the apostle as destitute of that efficacy and power in renewing the heart which he attributed to the gospel. It was a service consisting in external forms and ceremonies; in the offering of sacrifices and of incense, according to the literal requirements of the Law rather than the sincere offering of the heart; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>, “The letter killeth; the spirit giveth life;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:63">John 6:63</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1-4">Hebrews 10:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9-10">Hebrews 9:9-10</span>. It is not to be denied that there were many holy persons under the Law, and that there were many spiritual offerings presented, but it is at the same time true that the great mass of the people rested in the mere form; and that the service offered was the mere service of the letter, and not of the heart. The main idea is, that the services under the gospel are purely and entirely spiritual, the offering of the heart, and not the service rendered by external forms and rites.</p>
<p style=" ">(But the contrast here is not between services required under the legal and gospel dispensations respectively, but between service yielded in the opposite states of nature and grace. In the former state, we are “under the law” though we live in gospel times, and in the latter, we are “delivered from the law” as a covenant of works, or of life, just as pious Jews might be though they lived under the dispensation of Moses. The design of God in delivering us from the Law, is, that we might “serve him in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter,” that is, in such a spiritual way as the new state requires, and from such spiritual motives and aids as it furnishes; and not in the manner we were accustomed to do, under our old condition of subjection to the Law, in which we could yield only an external and forced obedience. “It is evident,” says Prof. Hodge that the clause “in the oldness of the letter is substituted by the apostle, for ‘under the law’ and ‘in the flesh;’ all which he uses to describe the legal and corrupt condition of people, prior to the believing reception of the gospel.”)</p>
