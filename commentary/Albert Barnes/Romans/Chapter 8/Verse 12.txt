<p style=" "><b>We are debtors - </b>We owe it as a matter of solemn obligation. This obligation arises,</p>
<p style=" "><b>To the flesh - </b>To the corrupt propensities and passions. We are not bound to indulge them because the end of such indulgence is death and ruin; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:21-22">Romans 7:21-22</span>. But we are bound to live to God, and to follow the leadings of his Spirit, for the end is life and peace; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22-23">Romans 7:22-23</span>. The reason for this is stated in the following verse.</p>
