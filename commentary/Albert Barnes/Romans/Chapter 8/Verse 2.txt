<p style=" "><b>For the law - </b>The word “law” here means that “rule, command, or influence” which “the Spirit of life” produces. That exerts a control which is here called a law, for a law often means anything by which we are ruled or governed; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:21">Romans 7:21</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>. Of the Spirit. I see no reason to doubt here that this refers to the Holy Spirit. Evidently, at the close of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>, the word has this reference. The phrase “the Spirit of life” then means the Holy Spirit producing or giving life; that is, giving peace, joy, activity, salvation; in opposition to the law spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:0">Romans 7:0</span> that produced death and condemnation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Christ Jesus - </b>Under the Christian religion; or sent by Christ to apply his work to people. <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7-14">John 16:7-14</span>. The Spirit is sent by Christ; his influence is a part of the Christian scheme; and his power accomplishes what the Law could not do.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Hath made me free - </b>That is, has delivered me from the predominating influence and control of sin. He cannot mean that he was perfect, for the whole tenor of his reasoning is opposed to that. But the design, the tendency, and the spirit of the gospel was to produce this freedom from what the Law could not deliver; and he was now brought under the general power of this scheme. In the former state he was under a most bitter and galling bondage; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-11">Romans 7:7-11</span>. Now, he was brought under the influence of a scheme which contemplated freedom, and which produced it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The law of sin and death - </b>The controlling influence of sin, leading to death and condemnation; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5-11">Romans 7:5-11</span>.</p>
