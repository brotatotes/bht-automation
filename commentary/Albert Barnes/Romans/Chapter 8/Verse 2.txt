For the law - The word “law” here means that “rule, command, or influence” which “the Spirit of life” produces. That exerts a control which is here called a law, for a law often means anything by which we are ruled or governed; see the notes at Romans 7:21, Romans 7:23. Of the Spirit.

The phrase “the Spirit of life” then means the Holy Spirit producing or giving life; that is, giving peace, joy, activity, salvation; in opposition to the law spoken of in Romans 7:0 that produced death and condemnation.In Christ Jesus - Under the Christian religion; or sent by Christ to apply his work to people. John 16:7-14.

Now, he was brought under the influence of a scheme which contemplated freedom, and which produced it.The law of sin and death - The controlling influence of sin, leading to death and condemnation; Romans 7:5-11.
