<p style=" "><b>For the creature - </b>The renewed creature; the Christian mind. This is given as a reason for its aspiring to the full privileges of adoption, that the present state is not one of choice, or one which is preferred, but one to which it has been subjected for wise reasons by God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Subject to vanity - </b>The word “subject to” means placed in such a state; subjected to it by the appointment of another, as a soldier has his rank and place assigned him in an army. The word “vanity” here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματαιότης</span></span> mataiotēs is descriptive of the present condition of the Christian, as frail and dying; as exposed to trials, temptations, and cares; as in the midst of conflicts, and of a world which may be emphatically pronounced vanity. More or less, the Christian is brought under this influence; his joys are marred; his peace is discomposed; his affections wander; his life is a life of vanity and vexation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not willingly - </b>Not voluntarily. It is not a matter of choice. It is not what is congenial to his renewed nature. That would aspire to perfect holiness and peace. But this subjection is one that is contrary to it, and from which he desires to be delivered. This describes substantially the same condition as <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:15-24">Romans 7:15-24</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But by reason - </b>By him <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διά</span></span> dia. It is the appointment of God, who has chosen to place his people in this condition; and who for wise purposes retains them in it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who hath subjected the same - </b>Who has appointed his people to this condition. It is his wise arrangement. Here we may observe,</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That the instinctive feelings of Christians lead them to desire a purer and a happier world, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) That it is not what they desire, to be subjected to the toils of this life, and to the temptations and vanities of this world. They sigh for deliverance.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) Their lot in life; their being subjected to this state of vanity, is the arrangement of God. Why it is, he has not seen fit to inform us fully. He might have taken his people at once to heaven as soon as they are converted. But though we know not all the reasons why they are continued here in this state of vanity, we can see some of them:</p>
<p style=" "><b>In hope - </b>See the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span>. Hope has reference to the future; and in this state of the Christian, he sighs for deliverance, and expects it.</p>
