<p style=" "><b>Likewise the Spirit - </b>This introduces a new source of consolation and support, what is derived from the Spirit. It is a continuation of the argument of the apostle, to show the sustaining power of the Christian religion. The “Spirit” here undoubtedly refers to the Holy Spirit, who dwells in us, and who strengthens us.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Helpeth - </b>This word properly means, to sustain with us; to aid us in supporting. It is applied usually to those who unite in supporting or carrying a burden. The meaning may be thus expressed: “he greatly assists or aids us.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Our infirmities - </b>Assists us in our infirmities, or aids us to bear them. The word “infirmities” refers to the weaknesses to which we are subject, and to our various trials in this life. The Spirit helps us in this,</p>
<p style=" "><b>For we know not ... - </b>This is a specification of the aid which the Holy Spirit, renders us. The reasons why Christians do not know what to pray for may be,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)They do not know what God might be willing to grant them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)They are to a great extent ignorant of the character of God, the reason of his dealings, the principles of his government, and their own real needs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)They are often in real, deep perplexity. They are encompassed with trials, exposed to temptations, feeble by disease, and subject to calamities. In these circumstances, if left alone, they would neither be able to bear their trials, nor know what to ask at the hand of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But the Spirit itself - </b>The Holy Spirit; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9-11">Romans 8:9-11</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Maketh intercession - </b>The word used here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ὑπερεντυνγχάνει</span></span> huperentungchanei, occurs no where else in the New Testament. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐντυνγχάνω</span></span> entungchanō, however, is used several times. It means properly to be present with anyone for the purpose of aiding, as an advocate does in a court of justice; hence, to intercede for anyone, or to aid or assist in any manner. In this place it simply means that the Holy Spirit greatly assists or aids us; not by praying for us, but in our prayers and infirmities.</p>
<p style=" "><b>With groanings - </b>With sighs, or that deep feeling and intense anxiety which exists in the oppressed and burdened heart of the Christian.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which cannot be uttered - </b>Or rather, perhaps, which is not uttered; those emotions which are too deep for utterance, or for expression in articulate language. This does not mean that the Spirit produces these groanings; but that in these deep-felt emotions, when the soul is oppressed and overwhelmed, he lends us his assistance and sustains us. The phrase may be thus translated: “The Spirit greatly aids or supports us in those deep emotions, those intense feelings, those inward sighs which cannot be expressed in language, but which he enables us to bear, and which are understood by Him that searcheth the hearts.”</p>
