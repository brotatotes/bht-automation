<p style=" "><b>And he that searcheth the hearts - </b>God. To search the heart is one of his attributes which cannot be communicated to a creature; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:10">Jeremiah 17:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit - </b>Knows the desires which the Holy Spirit excites and produces in the heart. He does not need that those deep emotions should be expressed in words; he does not need the eloquence of language to induce him to hear; but he sees the anxious feelings of the soul, and is ready to aid and to bless.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Maketh intercession for the saints - </b>Aids and directs Christians.</p>
<p style=" "><b>According to the will of God - </b>Greek, “According to God.” It is according to his will in the following respects:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) The Spirit is given according to his will. It is his gracious purpose to grant his aid to all who truly love him.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The desires which he excites in the heart of the Christian are those which are according to his will; they are such as God wishes to exist; the contrite, humble, and penitent pleading of sinners for mercy.</p>
<p style=" ">(3) He superintends and guards Christians in their prayers.</p>
<p style=" ">It is not meant that they are infallible, or that they never make an improper petition, or have an improper desire; but that he has a general superintendence over their minds, and that so far as they will yield themselves to his direction, they shall not be led into error That man is most safe who yields himself most entirely to the influence of the Holy Spirit. And the doctrine here stated is one that is full of consolation to the Christian. We are poor, and needy, and ignorant, and blind; we are the creatures of a day, and are crushed before the moth. But in the midst of our feebleness we may look to God for the aid of his Spirit, and rejoice in his presence, and in his power to sustain us in our sighings, and to guide us in our wanderings.</p>
