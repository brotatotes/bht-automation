<p style=" "><b>For what the law could not do - </b>The Law of God, the moral law. It could not free from sin and condemnation. This the apostle had fully shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:0">Romans 7:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In that - </b>Because.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It was weak - </b>It was feeble and inefficacious. It could not accomplish it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through the flesh - </b>In consequence of the strength of sin, and of the evil and corrupt desires of the unrenewed heart. The fault was not in the Law, which was good <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:12">Romans 7:12</span>, but it was owing to the strength of the natural passions and the sinfulness of the unrenewed heart; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-11">Romans 7:7-11</span>, where this influence is fully explained.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God, sending his own Son - </b>That is, God did, or accomplished, that, by sending his Son, which the Law could not do. The word did, or accomplished, it is necessary to understand here, in order to complete the sense.<b>In the likeness of sinful flesh - </b>That is, he so far resembled sinful flesh that he partook of flesh, or the nature of man, but without any of its sinful propensities or desires. It was not human nature; not, as the Docetae taught, human nature in appearance only; but it was human nature Without any of its corruptions.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And for sin - </b>Margin, “By a sacrifice for sin.” The expression evidently means, by an Offering for sin, or that he was given as a Sacrifice on account of sin. His being given had respect to sin.<b>Condemned sin in the flesh - </b>The flesh is regarded as the source of sin; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>. The flesh being the seat and origin of transgression, the atoning sacrifice was made in the likeness of sinful flesh, that thus he might meet sin, as it were, on its own ground, and destroy it. He may be said to have condemned sin in this manner,</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Because the fact that he was given for it, and died on its account, was a condemnation of it. If sin had been approved by God he would not have made an atonement to secure its destruction. The depth and intensity of the woes of Christ on its account show the degree of abhorrence with which it is regarded by God.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The word “condemn” may be used in the sense of destroying, overcoming, or subduing; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span>, “And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow.” In this sense the sacrifice of Christ has no; only condemned sin as being evil, but has weakened its power and destroyed its influence, and will finally annihilate its existence in all who are saved by that death.</p>
<p style=" ">(By the sacrifice of Christ, God indeed showed his abhorrence of sin, and secured its final overthrow. It is not, however, of the sanctifying influence of this sacrifice, that the apostle seems here to speak, but of its justifying power. The sense, therefore, is that God passed a judicial sentence on sin, in the person of Christ, on account of which, that has been effected which the Law could not effect, (justification namely). Sin being condemned in the human nature of Christ, cannot be condemned and punished in the persons of those represented by him. They must be justified.</p>
<p style=" ">This view gives consistency to the whole passage, from the first verse to the fourth inclusive. The apostle clearly begins with the subject of justification, when, in the first verse, he affirms, that to them who are in Christ Jesus, there is no condemnation. If the question be put, Why is this? the second verse gives for answer, that believers are delivered from the Law as a covenant of works. (See the foregoing supplementary note). If the question again be put, Whence this deliverance? the third verse points to the sacrifice of Christ, which, the fourth verse assures us, was offered with the very design “that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us.” This clause, according to the principle of interpretation laid down above, does not relate to the believer’s obedience to the righteous requirements of the Law. The apostle has in view a more immediate design of the sacrifice of Christ. The right or demand of the Law <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαίωμα</span></span> dikaiōma was satisfaction to its injured honor. Its penalty must be borne, as well as its precept obeyed. The sacrifice of Christ answered every claim. And as believers are one with him, the righteousness of the Law has been “fulfilled in them.”</p>
<p style=" ">The whole passage is thus consistently explained of justification.)</p>
