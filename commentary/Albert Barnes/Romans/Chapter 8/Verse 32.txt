<p style=" "><b>He that spared not - </b>Who did not retain, or keep from suffering and death.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His own Son - </b>Who thus gave the highest proof of love that a father could give, and the highest demonstration of his willingness to do good to those for whom he gave him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But delivered him up - </b>Gave him into the hands of men, and to a cruel death; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>For us all - </b>For all Christians. The connection requires that this expression should be understood here with this limitation. The argument for the security of all Christians is here derived from the fact, that God had shown them equal love in giving his Son for them. It was not merely for the apostles; not only for the rich, and the great; but for the most humble and obscure of the flock of Christ. For them he endured as severe pangs, and expressed as much love, as for the rich and the great that shall be redeemed. The most humble and obscure believer may derive consolation from the fact that Christ died for him, and that God has expressed the highest love for him which we can conceive to be possible.</p>
<p style=" "><b>How shall he not - </b>His giving his Son is a proof that he will give to us all things that we need. The argument is from the greater to the less. He that has given the greater gift will not withhold the less.</p>
<p style=" "><b>All things - </b>All things that may be needful for our welfare. These things he will give freely; without money and without price. His first great gift, that of his Son, was a free gift; and all others that we may need will be given in a similar manner. It is not by money, nor by our merit, but it is by the mere mercy of God; so that from the beginning to the end of the work it is all of grace. We see here,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)He has evidence that God will continue to be his friend. He that has given his Son to die for his people will not withdraw the lesser mercies that may be necessary to secure their salvation. The argument of the apostle here, therefore, is one that strongly shows that God will not forsake his children, but will keep them to eternal life.</p>
