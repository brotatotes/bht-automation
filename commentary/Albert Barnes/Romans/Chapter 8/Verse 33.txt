<p style=" "><b>Who shall lay anything to the charge - </b>This expression is taken from courts of law, and means, who shall accuse, or condemn, or so charge with crime before the tribunal of God as to cause their condemnation?</p>
<p style=" "><b>God’s elect - </b>His chosen people. Those who have been chosen according to his eternal purpose; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>. As they are the chosen of God, they are dear to him; and as he purposed to save them, he will do it in such a way as that none can bring against them a charge that would condemn them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>It is God that justifieth - </b>That is, who has pardoned them, and admitted them to his favor; and pronounced them just in his sight; Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>. It would be absurd to suppose that he would again condemn them. The fact that he has justified them is, therefore, a strong proof that they will be saved. This may be read with more force as a question, “Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? Shall God who justifieth?” The Greek will bear either mode of rendering. The passage implies that there would be a high degree of absurdity in supposing that the same being would both justify and condemn the same individual. The Christian, therefore, is secure.</p>
