<p style=" "><b>Nay - </b>But. Notwithstanding our severe pressures and trials.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In all these things - </b>In the very midst of them; while we are enduring them we are able to triumph; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:57">1 Corinthians 15:57</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We are more than conquerors - </b>We gain the victory. That is, they have not power to subdue us; to alienate our love and confidence; to produce apostasy. We are the victors, not they. Our faith is not destroyed; our love is not diminished; our hope is not blasted. But it is not simple victory; it is not mere life, and continuance of what we had before; it is more than simple triumph; it augments our faith, increases our strength, expands our love to Christ. The word used here is a strong, emphatic expression, such as the apostle Paul often employs (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:17">2 Corinthians 4:17</span>), and which is used with great force and appropriateness here.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Through him ... - </b>Not by their own strength or power. It was by the might of the Saviour, and by his power pledged to them, and confirmed by the love evinced when he gave himself for them; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:13">Philippians 4:13</span>, “I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me.”</p>
