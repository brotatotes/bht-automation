<p style=" "><b>For I am persuaded - </b>I have a strong and unwavering confidence. Latin Vulgate, “I am certain.” The expression here implies unwavering certainty.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Neither death - </b>Neither the fear of death, nor all the pains and tortures of the dying scene, even in the most painful trials of persecution; death in no form.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor life - </b>Nor the hope of life; the love of life; the offer of life made to us by our persecutors, on condition of abjuring our Christian faith. The words evidently refer to times of persecution; and it was not uncommon for persecutors to offer life to Christians, on condition of their renouncing attachment to the Saviour, and offering sacrifice to idols. All that was demanded in the times of persecution under the Roman emperors was, that they should throw a few grains of incense on the altar of a pagan god, as expressive of homage to the idol. But even this they would not do. The hope of life on so very easy terms would not, could not alienate them from the love of Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor angels - </b>It seems to be apparent that “good angels” cannot be intended here. The apostle was saying that nothing would separate Christians from the love of Christ. Of course, it would be implied that the things which he specifies might be supposed to have some power or tendency to do it. But it is not conceivable that good angels, who are “sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>, should seek to alienate the minds of Christians from the Saviour, or that their influence should have any such tendency. It seems to be clear, therefore, that he refers to the designs and temptations of evil spirits. The word “angels” is applied to evil spirits in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor principalities - </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀρχαὶ</span></span> archai). This word usually refers to magistrates and civil rulers. But it is also applied to evil angels, as having dominion over people; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>, “For we wrestle against ...principalities;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>, “And having spoiled principalities:” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>, “When he shall have put down all rule;” Greek, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀρχήν</span></span> archēn. Some have supposed that it refers here to magistrates and those in authority who persecuted Christians; but the connection of the word with angels seems to require us to understand it of evil spirits.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor powers - </b>This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνάμεις</span></span> dunameis is often applied to magistrates; but it is also applied to evil spirits that have dominion over men; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>. The ancient Rabbis also give the name powers to evil angels. (Schleusner.) There can be no doubt that the Jews were accustomed to divide the angels of heaven into various ranks and orders, traces of which custom we find often in the Scriptures. And there is also reason to suppose that they made such a division with reference to evil angels, regarding Satan as their leader, and other evil spirits, divided into various ranks, as subordinate to him; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>. To such a division there is probably reference here; and the meaning is, that no order of evil angels, however powerful, artful, or numerous, would be able to alienate the hearts of Christians from their Redeemer.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor things present - </b>Calamities and persecutions to which we are now subject.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor things to come - </b>Trials to which we may be yet exposed. It evinced strong confidence to say that no possible trials should be sufficient to destroy their love for Christ.</p>
