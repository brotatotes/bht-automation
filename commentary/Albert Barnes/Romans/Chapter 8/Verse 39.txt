<p style=" "><b>Nor height - </b>This has been variously understood. Some have regarded it as referring to evil spirits in the air; others, to high and lofty speculation in doctrine; others, to heaven - to all that is in heaven. I regard it here as a synonymous with prosperity, honor, elevation in this life. The meaning is, that “no possible circumstances” in which Christians could be placed, though surrounded with wealth, honor, splendor, and though elevated to rank and function, could alienate them from the love of Christ. The tendency of these things to alienate the mind, to engross the affections, and to occupy the time, all know; but the apostle says that even these would not be sufficient to withdraw their strong love from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor depth - </b>Nor the lowest circumstances of depression, poverty, contempt, and want; the very lowest rank of life.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Nor any other creature - </b>Nor any other created thing; any other thing in the universe; anything that can occur. This expresses the most unwavering confidence that all who were Christians would certainly continue to love the Lord Jesus, and be saved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Shall be able - </b>Shall have power to do it. The love to Christ is stronger than any influence which they can exert on the mind.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The love of God - </b>The love which we have to God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is in Christ Jesus - </b>Which is produced and secured by his work. Of which he is the bond, the connecting link. It was caused by his mediation; it is secured by his influence; it is in and through him, and him alone, that people love God. There is no true love of God which is not produced by the work of Christ. There is no man who truly loves the Father, who does not do it in, and by the Son.</p>
<p style=" ">Perhaps there is no chapter in the Bible on the whole so interesting and consoling to the Christian as this; and there certainly is not to be found any where a specimen of more elevated, animated, and lofty eloquence and argumentation. We may remark in view of it,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)Our trials in this life are scarcely worth regarding in comparison with our future glory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)Calamities should be borne without a complaint; nay, without a sigh.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)The Christian has every possible security for his safety. The purposes of God, the work of Christ, the aid of the Holy Spirit, and the tendency of all events under the direction of his Father and Friend, conspire to secure his welfare and salvation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (5)With what thankfulness, then, should we approach the God of mercy.</p>
<p style=" ">In the gospel, we have a blessed and cheering hope which nothing else can produce, and which nothing can destroy. Safe in the hands of God our Redeemer, we may commit our way to him, whether it lead through persecutions, or trials, or sickness, or a martyr’s grave: and triumphantly we may wait until the day of our complete adoption, the entire redemption of soul and body, shall fully come.</p>
