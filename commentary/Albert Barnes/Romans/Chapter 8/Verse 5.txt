<p style=" "><b>For they that are after the flesh - </b>They that are under the influence of the corrupt and sinful desires of the flesh; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19-21">Galatians 5:19-21</span>. Those who are unrenewed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Do mind the things of the flesh - </b>They are supremely devoted to the gratification of their corrupt desires.</p>
<p style=" "><b>But they that are after the Spirit - </b>Who are under its influence; who are led by the Spirit.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The things of the Spirit - </b>Those things which the Spirit produces, or which he effects in the mind, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:21-23">Galatians 5:21-23</span>. This verse is for the purpose of illustration, and is designed to show that the tendency of religion is to produce as entire a devotedness to the service of God as people had before rendered to sin; that is, that they Would be fully engaged in that to which they had devoted themselves. As the Christian therefore, had devoted himself to the service of the Spirit, and had been brought under his influence, it was to be expected that he would make it his great and only object to cherish and cultivate the graces which that Spirit would produce.</p>
