<p style=" "><b>So then - </b>It follows; it leads to this conclusion.</p>
<p style=" "><b>They that are in the flesh - </b>They who are unrenewed sinners; who are following supremely the desires of the flesh; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span>. Those are meant here who follow fleshly appetites and desires, and who are not led by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cannot please God - </b>That is, while they are thus in the flesh; while they thus pursue the desires of their corrupt nature, they cannot please God. But this affirms nothing respecting their ability to turn from this course, and to pursue a different mode of life. That is a different question. A child may be obstinate, proud, and disobedient; and while in this state, it may be affirmed of him that he cannot please his parent. But whether he might not cease to be obstinate, and become obedient, is a very different inquiry; and the two subjects should never be be confounded. It follows from this,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That none of their actions while in this state can be acceptable to him, since he is pleased only with those who are spiritually minded.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)That those who are in this state should turn from it without delay; as it is desirable that every man should please God.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (4)That if the sinner does not turn from his course, he will be ruined.</p>
<p style=" ">With his present character he can never please him; neither in health nor sickness; neither in life nor death; neither on earth nor in hell. He is engaged in hostility against God; and if he does not himself forsake it, it will be endless, and involve his soul in all the evils of a personal, and direct, and eternal warfare with the Lord Almighty.</p>
