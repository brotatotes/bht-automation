So then - It follows; it leads to this conclusion.They that are in the flesh - They who are unrenewed sinners; who are following supremely the desires of the flesh; Romans 7:18. Those are meant here who follow fleshly appetites and desires, and who are not led by the Spirit of God.Cannot please God - That is, while they are thus in the flesh; while they thus pursue the desires of their corrupt nature, they cannot please God. But this affirms nothing respecting their ability to turn from this course, and to pursue a different mode of life. That is a different question. A child may be obstinate, proud, and disobedient; and while in this state, it may be affirmed of him that he cannot please his parent. But whether he might not cease to be obstinate, and become obedient, is a very different inquiry; and the two subjects should never be be confounded. It follows from this, (2)That none of their actions while in this state can be acceptable to him, since he is pleased only with those who are spiritually minded. (3)That those who are in this state should turn from it without delay; as it is desirable that every man should please God. (4)That if the sinner does not turn from his course, he will be ruined.With his present character he can never please him; neither in health nor sickness; neither in life nor death; neither on earth nor in hell. He is engaged in hostility against God; and if he does not himself forsake it, it will be endless, and involve his soul in all the evils of a personal, and direct, and eternal warfare with the Lord Almighty.
