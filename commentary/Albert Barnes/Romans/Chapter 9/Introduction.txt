<p style=" ">This chapter opens in some degree a new train of thought and argumentation. Its main design probably was to meet objections which would be alleged against the positions advanced and defended in the previous parts of the Epistle. In the previous chapters, Paul had defended the position that the barrier between the Jews and Gentiles had been removed; that the Jews could not be saved by any external advantages which they possessed; that all were alike guilty before God; and that there was but one way for Jews and Gentiles of salvation - by faith in Jesus Christ; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:0">Romans 1:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:0">Romans 2:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:0">Romans 3:0</span>. He had stated the benefits of this plan <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:0">Romans 5:0</span>, and showed its bearing in accomplishing what the Law of Moses could not effect in overcoming sin; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:0">Romans 6:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:0">Romans 7:0</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:0">Romans 8:0</span> he had stated also on what principles this was done; that it was according to the purpose of God - the principle of electing mercy applied indiscriminately to the mass of guilty Jews and Gentiles. To this statement two objections might arise: first, that it was unjust; and second, that the whole argument involved a departure from the promises made to the Jewish nation. It might further be supposed that the apostle had ceased to feel an interest in his countrymen, and had become the exclusive advocate of the Gentiles. To meet these objections and feelings, seems to have been the design of this chapter. He shows them,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)He shows them from their own writings that the principle of election had existed in former times - in the case of Isaac <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7-13">Romans 9:7-13</span>; in the writings of Moses <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:15">Romans 9:15</span>; in the case of Pharaoh <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:17">Romans 9:17</span>; and in the prophecies of Hosea and Isaiah <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:25-29">Romans 9:25-29</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)He takes occasion throughout the chapter to vindicate this principle of the divine administration; to answer objections; and to show that, on the acknowledged principles of the Old Testament, a part of the Jewish nation might be rejected; and that it was the purpose of God to call others to the privileges of the people of God; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:16">Romans 9:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:19-23">Romans 9:19-23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:25-26">Romans 9:25-26</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:29-33">Romans 9:29-33</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">The chapter, therefore, has not reference to national election, or to choice to external privileges, but has direct reference to the doctrine of the election to salvation which had been stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:0">Romans 8:0</span>. To suppose that it refers merely to external privileges and national distinctions, makes the whole discussion unconnected, unmeaningful, and unnecessary.</p>
