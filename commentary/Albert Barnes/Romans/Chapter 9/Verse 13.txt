<p style=" "><b>As it is written - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:2-3">Malachi 1:2-3</span>. That is, the distribution of favors is on the principle advanced by the prophet, and is in accordance with the declaration that God had in fact loved the one and hated the other.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Jacob - </b>This refers, doubtless, to the posterity of Jacob.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have I loved - </b>I have shown affection for that people; I have bestowed on them great privileges and blessings, as proofs of attachment. I have preferred Jacob to Esau.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Esau - </b>The descendants of Esau, the Edomites; see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:4">Malachi 1:4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Have I hated - </b>This does not mean any positive hatred; but that he had preferred Jacob, and had withheld from Esau those privileges and blessings which he had conferred on the posterity of Jacob. This is explained in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:3">Malachi 1:3</span>,” And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness;” compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+49:17-18">Jeremiah 49:17-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eze+35:6">Ezekiel 35:6</span>. It was common among the Hebrews to use the terms “love” and “hatred” in this comparative sense, where the former implied strong positive attachment, and the latter, not positive hatred, but merely a less love, or the withholding of the expressions of affection; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:30-31">Genesis 29:30-31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:24">Proverbs 13:24</span>, “He that spareth his rod hateth his son; but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>, “No man can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other,” etc.; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:26">Luke 14:26</span>, “if any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, etc.”</p>
