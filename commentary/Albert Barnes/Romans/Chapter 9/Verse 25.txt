<p style=" "><b>As he saith also - </b>The doctrine which he had established, he proceeds now to confirm by quotations from the writings of Jews, that he might remove every objection. The doctrine was,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)That he was bound by no promise and no principle of obligation to bestow salvation on all the Jews.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)That, therefore, it was right for him to reject any or all of the Jews, if he chose, and cut them off from their privileges as a people and from salvation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In Osee - </b>This is the Greek form of writing the Hebrew word Hosea. It means in the book of Hosea, as “in David” means in the book of David, or by David, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span>. The passage is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:23">Hosea 2:23</span>. This quotation is not made according to the letter, but the sense of the prophet is preserved. The meaning is the same in Hosea and in this place, that God would bring those into a covenant relation to himself, who were before deemed outcasts and strangers. Thus, he supports his main position that God would choose his people from among the Gentiles as well as the Jews, or would exercise toward both his right as a sovereign, bestowing or withholding his blessings as he pleases.</p>
