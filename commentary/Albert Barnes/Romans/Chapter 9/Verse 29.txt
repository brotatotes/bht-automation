<p style=" "><b>And as Esaias said - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:9">Isaiah 1:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before - </b>The apostle had just cited one prediction from the tenth chapter of Isaiah. He now says that Isaiah had affirmed the same thing in a previous part of his prophecy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Except the Lord of Sabaoth - </b>In Isaiah, the Lord of Hosts. The word “Sabaoth” is the Hebrew word rendered “hosts” (armies). It properly denotes armies or military hosts organized for war. Hence, it denotes the “hosts of heaven,” and means:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) “The angels” who are represented as marshalled or arranged into military orders; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:6">Jude 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:19">1 Kings 22:19</span>, “I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him;” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+103:21">Psalms 103:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+148:2">Psalms 148:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) The stars; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="jer+33:22">Jeremiah 33:22</span>, “As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, etc.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:26">Isaiah 40:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="de+4:19">Deuteronomy 4:19</span>, etc. God is called the Lord of hosts, as being at the head of all these armies; their King and their Commander. It is a phrase properly expressive of his majesty and power, and is appropriately introduced here, as the “act of saving” “the seed” was a signal “act of power” in the midst of great surrounding wickedness.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Had left - </b>Had preserved, or kept from destruction. Here their preservation is ascribed to God, and it is affirmed that if God had not interposed, “the whole nation” would have been cut off. This fully establishes the doctrine of the apostle, that God might cast off the Jews, and extend the blessings to the Gentiles.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A seed - </b>The Hebrew in Isaiah means “one surviving or escaping,” corresponding with the word “remnant.” The word “seed” commonly means in the Scriptures “descendants, posterity.” In this place it means “a part, a small portion; a remnant,” like the small portion of the harvest which is reserved for sowing.</p>
<p style=" "><b>We had been as Sodoma - </b>The nation was so wicked, that unless God had preserved a small number who were pious from the general corruption of the people, they would have been swept off by judgment, like Sodom and Gomorrah. We are told that ten righteous men would have saved Sodom; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:32">Genesis 18:32</span>. Among the Israelites, in a time of great general depravity, a small number of holy men were found who preserved the nation. The design of the apostle here was the same as in the previous verses - to show that it was settled in the Jewish history that God might cast off the people, and reject them from enjoying the special privileges of his friends. It is true that in Isaiah he has reference to the temporal punishments of the Jews. But it settles “a great principle,” for which Paul was contending, that God might cast off the nation consistently with his promises and his plans. We may learn here,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (2)It is owing to his mercy that “any men” are kept from sin, and any nation from destruction.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.0em;  "> (3)We see the value of religion and of pious people in a nation. Ten such would have saved Sodom; and a few such saved Judea; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13-14">Matthew 5:13-14</span>.</p>
