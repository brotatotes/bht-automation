<p style=" "><b>Whose are the fathers - </b>Who have been honored with so illustrious an ancestry. Who are descended from Abraham, Isaac, etc. On this they highly valued themselves, and in a certain sense not unjustly; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Of whom - </b>Of whose nation. This is placed as the crowning and most exalted privilege, that their nation had given birth to the long-expected Messiah, the hope of the world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As concerning the flesh - </b>So far as his human nature was concerned. The use of this language supposes that there was a higher nature in respect to which he was not of their nation; see the note at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Christ came - </b>He had already come; and it was their high honor that he was one of their nation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who is over all - </b>This is an appellation that belongs only to the true God. It implies supreme divinity; and is full proof that the Messiah is divine: Much effort has been made to show that this is not the true rendering, but without success. There are no various readings in the Greek manuscripts of any consequence; and the connection here evidently requires us to understand this of a nature that is not “according to the flesh,” i. e., as the apostle here shows, of the divine nature.</p>
<p style=" "><b>God blessed forever - </b>This is evidently applied to the Lord Jesus; and it proves that he is divine. If the translation is fairly made, and it has never been proved to be erroneous, it demonstrates that he is God as well as man. The doxology “blessed forever” was usually added by the Jewish writers after the mention of the name God, as an expression of reverence. (See the various interpretations that have been proposed on this passage examined in Prof. Stuart’s Notes on this verse.)</p>
