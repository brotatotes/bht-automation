<p style=" "><b>What if God ... - </b>If God does what the apostle supposes, what then? Is it not right? This is the second point in the answer to the objection in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:19">Romans 9:19</span>. The answer has respect to the “two classes” of people which actually exist on the earth - the righteous and the wicked. And the question is, whether “in regard to these two classes God does in fact do wrong?” If he does not, then the doctrine of the apostle is established, and the objection is not valid. It is assumed here, as it must be, that the world is “in fact” divided into two classes - saints and sinners. The apostle considers the case of sinners in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Willing - </b>Being disposed; having an inclination to. It denotes an inclination of mind toward the thing proposed. If the thing itself was right; if it was proper to “show his wrath,” then it was proper to be willing to do it. If it is right to do a thing, it is right to purpose or intend to do it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>His wrath - </b><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τὴν ὀργὴν</span></span> tēn orgēn. This word occurs thirty-five times in the New Testament. Its meaning is derived from the idea of earnestly desiring or reaching for an object, and properly denotes, in its general sense, a vehement desire of attaining anything. Hence, it comes to denote an earnest desire of revenge, or of inflicting suffering on those who have injured us; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:31">Ephesians 4:31</span>, “Let all bitterness and wrath, etc.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:8">1 Timothy 2:8</span>. Hence, it denotes indignation in general, which is not joined with a desire of revenge; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>, “He looked round about on them with anger.” It also denotes punishment for sin; the anger or displeasure of God against transgression; Note, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:23">Luke 21:23</span>, etc. In this place it is evidently used to denote “severe displeasure against sin.”sin is an evil of so great magnitude, “it is right” for God to be willing to evince his displeasure against it; and just in proportion to the extent of the evil. This displeasure, or wrath, it is proper that God should always be willing to show; nay, it would not be right for him not to show it, for that would be the same thing as to be indifferent to it, or to approve it. In this place, however, it is not affirmed,</p>
<p style=" "><b>And that he might make known - </b>That he might manifest or display. The apostle had shown (in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>) that the dealings of God toward the wicked were not liable to the objection made in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:19">Romans 9:19</span>. In this verse he proceeds to show that the objection could not lie against his dealings with the other class of people - the righteous. If his dealings toward neither were liable to the objection, then he has “met the whole case,” and the divine government is vindicated. This he proves by showing that for God to show the riches of his glory toward those whom he has prepared for it, cannot be regarded as unjust.</p>
<p style=" "><b>The riches of his glory - </b>This is a form of expression common among the Hebrews, meaning the same as his rich or “his abundant glory.” The same expression occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>On the vessels of mercy - </b>People toward whom his mercy was to be displayed (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>); that is, on those toward whom he has purposed to display his mercy.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Mercy - </b>Favor, or pity shown to the miserable. Grace is favor to the undeserving; mercy, favor to those in distress. This distinction is not, however, always strictly observed by the sacred writers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which he had afore prepared - </b>We are here brought to a remarkable difference between God’s mode of dealing with them and with the wicked. Here it is expressly affirmed that God himself had prepared them for glory. In regard to the wicked, it is simply affirmed that they “were fitted” for destruction, without affirming anything of the agency by which it was done. That God prepares his people for glory - commences and continues the work of their redemption - is abundantly taught in the Scriptures; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span>, “God hath appointed us, to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>, “who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.” See also <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4-5">Ephesians 1:4-5</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28-30">Romans 8:28-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:48">Acts 13:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:13">John 1:13</span>. As the renewing of the heart and the sanctifying of the soul is an act of goodness, it is worthy of God, and of course no objection could lie against it. No man could complain of a course of dealings designed to make people better; and as this is the sole design of the electing love of God, his deal, ings with this class of people are easily vindicated. No Christian can complain that God has chosen him, renewed him, and made him pure and happy. And as this was an important part of the plan of God, it is easily defended from the objection in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:19">Romans 9:19</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Unto glory - </b>To happiness; and especially to the happiness of heaven <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>, “It became him, in bringing many sons unto glory, etc.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>, “we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:17">2 Corinthians 4:17</span>, “our light affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,” <span class="_0000ff"><u>2Th 2:14</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:10">2 Timothy 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>. This eternal state is called “glory,” because it blends together everything that constitutes honor, dignity, purity, love, and happiness. All these significations are in various places attached to this word, and all mingle in the eternal state of the righteous. We may remark here,</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That this word “glory” is not used in the Scriptures to denote any “external national privileges;” or to describe any external call of the gospel. No such instance is to be found. Of course the apostle here by vessels of mercy meant individuals destined to eternal life, and not nations externally called to the gospel. No instance can be found where God speaks of nations called to external privileges, and speaks of them as “prepared unto glory.”</p>
<p style=" ">(2) As this word refers to the future state of individuals, it shows what is meant by the word “destruction” in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>. That term stands contrasted with glory; and describes, therefore, the future condition of individual wicked people. This is also its uniform meaning in the New Testament.</p>
<p style=" ">On this vindication of the apostle we may observe:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) That all people will be treated as they ought to be treated. People will be dealt with according to their characters at the end of life.</p>
<p style=" ">(2) If people will suffer no injustice, then this is the same as saying that they will be treated justly. But what is this? That the wicked shall be treated as they deserve. What they deserve God has told us in the Scriptures. “These shall go away into everlasting punishment.”</p>
<p style=" ">(3) God has a right to bestow his blessings as he chooses. Where all are undeserving, where none have any claim, he may confer his favors on whom he pleases.</p>
<p style=" ">(4) He actually does deal with people in this way. The apostle takes this for granted. He does not deny it. He most evidently believes it, and labors to show that it is right to do so. If he did not believe it, and meant to teach it, he would have said so. It would have met the objection at once, and saved all argument. He reasons as if he did believe it; and this settles the question that the doctrine is true.</p>
