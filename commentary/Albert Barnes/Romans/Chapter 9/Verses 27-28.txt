<p style=" "><b>He will finish the work - </b>This is taken from the Septuagint translation of <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:23">Isaiah 10:23</span>. The Hebrew is, “The Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.” Or, as it may be rendered, “Destruction is decreed which shall make justice overflow; yea, destruction is verily determined on; the Lord Yahweh will execute it in the midst of all the land.” (Stuart.) The Septuagint and the apostle adhere to “the sense” of the passage, but do not follow the words. The phrase, “will finish the work,” means “he will bring the thing to an end,” or will accomplish it. It is an expression applicable to a firm purpose to accomplish an object. It refers here to his threat of cutting off the people; and means that he will fulfil it.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cut it short - </b>This word here means to “execute it speedily.” The destruction shall not be delayed.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In righteousness - </b>So as to manifest his own justice. The work, though apparently severe, yet shall be a just expression of God’s abhorrence of the sins of the people.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Because a short work - </b>The word here rendered “short” means properly that which is “determined on or decreed.” This is the sense of the Hebrew; and the phrase here denotes “the purpose which was determined on” in relation to the Jews.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Upon the earth - </b>Upon the land of Israel; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:4">Matthew 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span>. The design for which the apostle introduces this passage is to show that God of old destroyed many of the Jews for their sin; and that, therefore, the doctrine of the apostle was no new thing, that “the Jews” might be excluded from the special privileges of the children of God.</p>
