<p style=" ">This chapter embraces the following points:</p>
<p style=" ">1. The usual inscription and salutation; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1-4">Titus 1:1-4</span>. In this Paul declares himself to be the author of the epistle, and asserts in the strongest manner his claims to the apostleship. He alludes to the great cause in which, as an apostle, he was engaged - as acting under the eternal plan of God for the salvation of the elect, and appointed to communicate the glorious truths of that system which had been now revealed to mankind. The object of this seems to be to impress the mind of Titus with his right to give him instruction.</p>
<p style=" ">2. A statement of the object for which Titus had been left in Crete, and the general character of the work which he was to perform there; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">3. The qualifications of those who were to be ordained to the ministry; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6-9">Titus 1:6-9</span>. The characteristics laid down are substantially the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:0">1 Timothy 3:0</span>.</p>
<p style=" ">4. Reasons for great caution and prudence in thus appointing elders over the churches; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:10-13">Titus 1:10-13</span>. Those reasons arose from the character of the Cretans. There were many deceivers there, and the character of the Cretans was such that there was great danger that they who professed to be Christians would be hypocritical, and if put into the eldership that they would do great injury to the cause.</p>
<p style=" ">5. A solemn charge to Titus to rebuke them faithfully for their prevailing and characteristic vices, and to avoid giving any countenance to that for which they were so much distinguished; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:13-16">Titus 1:13-16</span>.</p>
