The meaning of the word rendered here, “according to” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατὰ</span></span> kata - is, probably, with reference to; that is, he was appointed to be an apostle with respect to the faith of those whom God had chosen, or, in order that they might be led to believe the gospel. God had chosen them to salvation, but he intended that it should be in connection with their believing, and, in order to that, he had appointed Paul to be an apostle that he might go and make known to them the gospel. It is the purpose of God to save His people, but he does not mean to save them as infidels, or unbelievers. He intends that they shall be believers first - and hence he sends his ministers that they may become such.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And the acknowledging of the truth - </b>In order to secure the acknowledgment or recognition of the truth. The object of the apostleship, as it is of the ministry in general, is to secure the proper acknowledgment of the truth among men.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which is after godliness - </b>Which tends to promote piety towards God. On the word rendered godliness, see the notes at <span class="_0000ff"><u>1Ti 2:2</u></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>. - The truth, the acknowledgment of which Paul was appointed to secure, was not scientific, historical, or political truth: it was that of religion - that which was adapted to lead men to a holy life, and to prepare them for a holy heaven.</p>
