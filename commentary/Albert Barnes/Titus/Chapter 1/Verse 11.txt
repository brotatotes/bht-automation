<p style=" "><b>Whose mouths must be stopped - </b>The word here rendered stopped - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπιστομιζειν</span></span> epistomizein - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, to check, or curb, as with a bridle; to restrain, or bridle in; and then, to put to silence. It is, of course, implied here that this was to be done in a proper way, and in accordance with the spirit of the gospel. The apostle gives Timothy no civil power to do it, nor does he direct him to call in the aid of the civil arm. All the agency which he specifies as proper for this, is that of argument and exhortation. These are the proper means of silencing the advocates of error; and the history of the church shows that the ministers of religion can be safely entrusted with no other; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:8-9">Psalms 32:8-9</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Who subvert whole houses - </b>Whole families; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:14">Matthew 23:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:6">2 Timothy 3:6</span>. That is, they turn them aside from the faith.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake - </b>For gain. That is, they inculcate such doctrines as will make themselves popular, and as will give them access to the confidence of the people. They make it their first object to acquire influence as ministers of religion, and then abuse that in order to obtain money from the people. This they would doubtless do under many pretences; such as that it was needful for the support of the gospel, or for the relief of the poor, or perhaps for the assistance of distant Christians in persecution. Religion is the most powerful principle that ever governs the mind; and if a man has the control of that, it is no difficult thing to induce men to give up their worldly possessions. In all ages, there have been impostors who have taken advantage of the powerful principle of religion to obtain money from their deluded followers. No people can be too vigilant in regard to pretended religious teachers; and while it is undoubtedly their duty to contribute liberally for the support of the gospel, and the promotion of every good cause, it is no less their duty to examine with care every proposed object of benevolence, and to watch with an eagle eye those who have the disbursement of the charities of the church. It is very rare that ministers ought to have much to do with disposing of the funds given for benevolent purposes; and when they do, they should in all cases be associated with their lay brethren; see Paley’s <i>Horae Paulinae</i>, chap. iv., No. 1, 3, note; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>. On the phrase “filthy lucre,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>.</p>
