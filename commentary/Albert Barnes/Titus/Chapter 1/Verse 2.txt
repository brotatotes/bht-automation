<p style=" "><b>In hope of eternal life - </b>Margin, for. Greek, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπ ̓ ἐλπίδι</span></span> ep' elpidi. This does not mean that Paul cherished the hope of eternal life, but that the “faith of the elect,” which he aimed to secure, was in order that people might have the hope of eternal life. The whole system which he was appointed to preach was designed to secure to man a well-founded hope of salvation; compare the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Which God, that cannot lie - </b>On the phrase” cannot lie,” see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:13">Hebrews 6:13</span>. The fact that God cannot lie; that it is his nature always to speak the truth; and that no circumstances can ever occur in which He will depart from it, is the foundation of all our hopes of salvation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Promised - </b>The only hope of salvation is in the promise of God. It is only as we can have evidence that He has assured us that we may be saved, that we are authorized to cherish any hope of salvation. That promise is not made to us as individuals, or by name, but it becomes ours:</p>
<p style=" ">(1) Because He has made a general promise that they who repent and believe shall be saved; and,</p>
<p style=" ">(2) Because, we may have evidence that we have repented, and do believe the gospel. If this is so, we fairly come under the promise of salvation, and may apply it to ourselves.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Before the world began - </b>That is, the purpose was then formed, and the promise may be considered as in fact then made; - for a purpose in the mind of God, though it is not as yet made known, is equivalent to a promise; compare the <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span> note; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span> note.</p>
