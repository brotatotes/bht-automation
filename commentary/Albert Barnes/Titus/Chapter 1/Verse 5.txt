<p style=" "><b>For this cause left I thee in Crete - </b>Compare the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>. On the situation of Crete, see the Introduction, Section 2.</p>
<p style=" "><b>That thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting - </b>Margin, “left undone.” The Greek is: “the things that are left;” that is, those which were left unfinished; referring, doubtless, to arrangements which had been commenced, but which for some cause had been left incomplete. Whether this had occurred because he had been driven away by persecution, or called away by important duties demanding his attention elsewhere, cannot now be determined. The word rendered “set in order”, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐπιδιορθώσῃ</span></span> epidiorthōsē, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, “to make straight upon, and then to put further to rights, to arrange further.” Robinson, Lexicon - There were things left unfinished which he was to complete. One of these things, and perhaps the principal, was to appoint elders in the various cities where the gospel had been preached.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And ordain - </b>The word “ordain” has now acquired a technical signification which it cannot be shown that it has in the New Testament. It means, in common usage, to “invest with a ministerial function or sacerdotal power; to introduce, and establish, and settle in the pastoral office with the customary forms and solemnities” (Webster); and it may be added, with the idea always connected with it, of the imposition of hands. But the word used here does not necessarily convey this meaning, or imply that Titus was to go through what would now be called an ordination service. It means to set, place, or constitute; then, to set over anything, as a steward or other officer (see <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:45">Matthew 24:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>), though without reference to any particular mode of investment with an office; see the word, “ordain,” explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>. Titus was to appoint or set them over the churches, though with what ceremony is now unknown. There is no reason to suppose that he did this except as the result of the choice of the people; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Elders - </b>Greek: Presbyters; see the word explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>. These “elders,” or “Presbyters,” were also called “bishops” (compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span>), for Paul immediately, in describing their qualifications, calls them bishops: - “ordain elders in every city - if any be blameless - for a bishop must be blameless,” etc. If the elders and bishops in the times of the apostles were of different ranks, this direction would be wholly unmeaningful. It would be the same as if the following direction were given to one who was authorized to appoint officers over an army: “Appoint captains over each company, who shall be of good character, and acquainted with military tactics, for a Brigadier General must be of good character, and acquainted with the rules of war.” - That the same rank is denoted also by the terms Presbyter and Bishop here, is further apparent because the qualifications which Paul states as requisite for the “bishop” are not those which pertain to a prelate or a diocesan bishop, but to one who was a pastor of a church, or an evangelist. It is clear, from <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>, that those whom Titus was to appoint were “bishops,” and yet it is absurd to suppose that the apostle meant prelatical bishops, for no one can believe that such bishops were to be appointed in “every city” of the island. According to all modern notions of Episcopacy, one such bishop would have been enough for such an island as Crete, and indeed it has been not infrequently maintained that Titus himself was in fact the Bishop of that Diocese. But if these were not prelates who were to be ordained by Titus, then it is clear that the term “bishop” in the New Testament is given to the Presbyters or elders; that is, to all ministers of the gospel. That usage should never have been departed from.</p>
<p style=" "><b>In every city - </b>Crete was anciently celebrated for the number of its cities. In one passage Homer ascribes to the island 100 cities (<i>Iliad</i> ii. 649), in another, 90 cities (<i>Odyssey</i> xix. 174). It may be presumed that many of these cities were towns of not very considerable size, and yet it would seem probable that each one was large enough to have a church, and to maintain the gospel. Paul, doubtless, expected that Titus would travel over the whole island, and endeavor to introduce the gospel in every important place.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As I had appointed thee - </b>As I commanded thee, or gave thee direction - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεταξάμην</span></span> dietaxamēn - This is a different word from the one used in the former part of the verse - and rendered “ordain” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθίστημι</span></span> kathistēmi. It does not mean that Titus was to ordain elders in the same manner as Paul had ordained him, but that he was to set them over the cities as he had directed him to do. He had, doubtless, given him oral instructions, when he left him, as to the way in which it was to be done.</p>
