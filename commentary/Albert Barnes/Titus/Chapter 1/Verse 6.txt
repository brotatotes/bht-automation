<p style=" "><b>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Having faithful children - </b>See the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4-5">1 Timothy 3:4-5</span>. That is, having a family well-governed, and well-trained in religion. The word here - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστὰ</span></span> pista - applied to the children, and rendered faithful, does not necessarily mean that they should be truly pious, but it is descriptive of those who had been well-trained, and were in due subordination. If a man’s family were not of his character - if his children were insubordinate, and opposed to religion - if they were decided infidels or scoffers, it would show that there was such a deficiency in the head of the family that he could not be safely entrusted with the government of the church; compare the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:5">1 Timothy 3:5</span>. It is probably true, also, that the preachers at that time would be selected, as far as practicable, from those whose families were all Christians. There might be great impropriety in placing a man over a church, a part of whose family were Jews or heathens.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not accused of riot - </b>That is, whose children were not accused of riot. This explains what is meant by faithful. The word rendered “riot” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἀσωτία</span></span> asōtia - is translated excess in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:18">Ephesians 5:18</span>, and riot in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:4">1 Peter 4:4</span>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament, though the word riotous is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:13">Luke 15:13</span>; see it explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:18">Ephesians 5:18</span>. The meaning here is, that they should not be justly accused of this; this should not be their character. It would, doubtless, be a good reason now why a man should not be ordained to the ministry that he had a dissipated and disorderly family.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Or unruly - </b>Insubordinate; ungoverned; see the notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:9">1 Timothy 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:4">Luke 3:4</span>.</p>
