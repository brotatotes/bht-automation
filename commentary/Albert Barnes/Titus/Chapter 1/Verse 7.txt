<p style=" "><b>For a bishop must be blameless - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>As the steward of God - </b>See notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:1-2">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</span>. A man, in order to perform the duties of such an office, should be one against whom no accusation could lie.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not self-willed - </b>Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>. The word - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αὐθάδης</span></span> authadēs - does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, properly, self-complacent; and then, assuming, arrogant, imperious; Robinson, Lexicon - The gist of the offence - the very “head and front” - is that of being self-complacent; a trait of character which, of necessity, makes a man imperious, dogmatical, impatient of contradiction, and unyielding. Such a man, evidently, is not fit for the office of a minister of the gospel.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not soon angry - </b>See notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>, and the margin there.</p>

<p style=" "><b>No striker - </b>Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not given to filthy lucre - </b>In <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:0">1 Timothy 3:0</span>, “Not given of filthy lucre.” The same Greek word is used.</p>
