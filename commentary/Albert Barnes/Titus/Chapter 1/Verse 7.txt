For a bishop must be blameless - 1 Timothy 3:2.As the steward of God - See notes, 1 Corinthians 4:1-2. A man, in order to perform the duties of such an office, should be one against whom no accusation could lie.Not self-willed - Compare 2 Peter 2:10. The word - αὐθάδης authadēs - does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, properly, self-complacent; and then, assuming, arrogant, imperious; Robinson, Lexicon - The gist of the offence - the very “head and front” - is that of being self-complacent; a trait of character which, of necessity, makes a man imperious, dogmatical, impatient of contradiction, and unyielding. Such a man, evidently, is not fit for the office of a minister of the gospel.Not soon angry - See notes, 1 Timothy 3:2, and the margin there.Not given to wine - Notes, 1 Timothy 3:3.No striker - Notes, 1 Timothy 3:3.Not given to filthy lucre - In 1 Timothy 3:0, “Not given of filthy lucre.” The same Greek word is used.
