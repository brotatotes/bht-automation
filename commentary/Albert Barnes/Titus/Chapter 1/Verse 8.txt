But a lover of hospitality - Notes, 1 Timothy 3:2.A lover of good men - Margin, “or things.” The Greek (φιλάγαθος philagathos) means, a lover of good, and may apply to any thing that is good. It may refer to good men, as included under the general term good; and there is no more essential qualification of a bishop than this. A man who sustains the office of a minister of the gospel, should love every good object, and be ever ready to promote it; and he should love every good man, no matter in what denomination or country he may be found - no matter what his complexion, and no matter what his rank in life; compare the notes at Philippians 4:8.Sober - Notes, 1 Timothy 1:2.Just - Upright in his dealings with all. A minister can do little good who is not; compare the notes at Philippians 4:8.Holy - Pious, or devout. Faithful in all his duties to God; Notes, 1 Timothy 2:8.Temperate - ἐγκρατῆ egkratē. Having power or control over all his passions. We apply the term now with reference to abstinence from intoxicating liquors. In the Scriptures, it includes not only that, but also much more. It implies control over all our passions and appetites. See it explained in the notes at Acts 24:25; compare 1 Corinthians 7:9; 1 Corinthians 9:25; Galatians 5:23.
