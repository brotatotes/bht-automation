<p style=" ">(2) “Unto himself;” that is, they are no longer to be regarded as their own, but as redeemed for his own service, and for the promotion of his glory; - Notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19-20">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>A peculiar people - </b><span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>. The word here used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιούσιος</span></span> periousios) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, having abundance; and then one’s own, what is special, or peculiar (Robinson, Lexicon), and here means that they were to be regarded as belonging to the Lord Jesus. It does not mean, as the word would seem to imply - and as is undoubtedly true - that they are to be a unique people in the sense that they are to be unlike others, or to have views and principles unique to themselves; but that they belong to the Saviour in contradistinction from belonging to themselves - “peculiar” or his own in the sense that a man’s property is his own, and does not belong to others. This passage, therefore, should not be used to prove that Christians should be unlike others in their manner of living, but that they belong to Christ as his redeemed people. From that it may indeed be inferred that they should be unlike others, but that is not the direct teaching of the passage.</p>
