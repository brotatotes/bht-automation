In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works - Not merely teaching others, but showing them by example how they ought to live. On the word rendered “pattern” (τύπον tupon, type), see the Hebrews 9:5 note; 1 Corinthians 10:6 note; Philippians 3:17 note.In doctrine - In your manner of teaching; notes, 1 Timothy 4:16.Showing uncorruptness - The word here used does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means, here, the same as purity - that which is not erroneous, and which does not tend to corrupt or vitiate the morals of others, or to endanger their salvation. Everything in his teaching was to be such as to make men purer and better.Gravity - See this word explained in the notes at 1 Timothy 2:2, where it is rendered “honesty;” compare the notes at 1 Timothy 3:4, where it is rendered “gravity.” It does not elsewhere occur; see the use of the adjective, however, in Philippians 4:8; 1 Timothy 3:8, 1 Timothy 3:11; Titus 2:9. The word properly means “venerableness;” then, whatever will insure respect, in character, opinions, deportment. The sense here is, that the manner in which a preacher delivers his message, should be such as to command respect. He should evince good sense, undoubted piety, an acquaintance with his subject, simplicity, seriousness, and earnestness, in his manner.Sincerity - See this word (ἀφθαρσία aphtharsia) explained in the notes at Ephesians 6:24. It is rendered immortality in Romans 2:7; 2 Timothy 1:10; incorruption, in 1 Corinthians 15:42, 1 Corinthians 15:50, 1 Corinthians 15:53-54; and sincerity, Ephesians 6:24, and in the place before us. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means incorruption, incapacity of decay; and, therefore, would be here synonymous with purity. It should be said, however, that it is wanting in many msS, and is rejected in the later editions of the New Testament by Wetstein, Tittman, and Hahn.
