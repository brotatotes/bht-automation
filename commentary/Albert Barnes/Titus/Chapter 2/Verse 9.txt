<p style=" "><b>Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters - </b>See this explained in the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>, following, and <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1-4">1 Timothy 6:1-4</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>And to please them well in all things - </b>That is, so far as they lawfully may, or in those things which are not contrary to the will of God; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:6">Ephesians 6:6</span>. It should be an object with one who is a servant, to meet the approbation of his master, as long as this relation continues. This rule would not, however, go to the extent to require him to please his master in doing anything that is contrary to the law of God, or that is morally wrong.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Not answering again - </b>Margin, “gainsaying.” Not contradicting, or not disobeying. They were to do what the master required, if it did not interfere with the rights of conscience, without attempting to argue the matter - without disputing with the master - and without advancing their own opinions. Where this relation exists, no one can doubt that this is a proper frame of mind for a servant. It may be observed, however, that all that is here said would be equally appropriate, whether the servitude was voluntary or involuntary. A man who becomes voluntarily a servant, binds himself to obey his master cheerfully and quietly, without gainsaying, and without attempting to reason the matter with him, or propounding his own opinions, even though they may be much wiser than those of his employer. He makes a contract to obey his master, not to reason with him, or to instruct him.</p>
