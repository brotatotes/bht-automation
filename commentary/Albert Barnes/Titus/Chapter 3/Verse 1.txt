Put them in mind to be subject ... - See the duty here enjoined, explained in the notes at Romans 13:1, following.Principalities and powers - See these words explained in the notes at Romans 8:38. The word here rendered “powers” (ἐξουσίαις exousiais), is not, indeed, the same as that which is found there (δυνάμεις dunameis), but the same idea is conveyed; compare the notes at Ephesians 1:21.To obey magistrates - That is, to obey them in all that was not contrary to the word of God; Romans 13:1 note, following; Acts 4:19-20 notes.To be ready to every good work - “To be prepared for” (ἑτοίμους hetoimous); prompt to perform all that is good; Notes, Philippians 4:8. A Christian should be always ready to do good as far as he is able. He should not need to be urged, or coaxed, or persuaded, but should be so ready always to do good that he will count it a privilege to have the opportunity to do it.
