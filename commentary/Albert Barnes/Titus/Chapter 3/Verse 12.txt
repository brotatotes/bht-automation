When I shall send Artemas unto thee - This person is not elsewhere mentioned in the New Testament, and nothing more is known of him.Or Tychicus - Notes, Acts 20:4.Be diligent - Notes, 2 Timothy 4:9. “To come unto me to Nicopolis.” It was at this place, probably, that this epistle was written. In regard to its situation, see Introduction, Section 4.For I have determined there to winter - Why Paul designed to spend the winter there, or what he purposed to do there, are questions on which no light can now be thrown. There is no evidence that he organized a church there, though it may be presumed that he preached the gospel, and that he did not do it without success. His requesting Titus to leave his important post and to come to him, looks as if his aid were needed in the work of the ministry there, and as if Paul supposed there was a promising field of labor there.
