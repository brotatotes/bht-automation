And let ours - Our friends; that is, those who were Christians Paul had just directed Titus to aid Zenas and Apollos himself, and he here adds that he wished that others who were Christians would be char acterized by good works of all kinds.To maintain good works - Margin, profess honest trades. The Greek will admit of the interpretation in the margin, or will include that, but there is no reason why the direction should be supposed to have any special reference to an honest mode of livelihood, or why it should be confined to that. It rather means, that they should be distinguished for good works, including benevolent deeds, acts of charity, honest toil, and whatever would enter into the conception of an upright life; see the notes at Titus 3:8.For necessary uses - Such as are required by their duty to their families, and by the demands of charity; see Titus 3:8.That they be not unfruitful -  - That it may be seen that their religion is not barren and worthless, but that it produces a happy effect on themselves and on society; compare the John 15:16 note; Ephesians 4:28 note.
