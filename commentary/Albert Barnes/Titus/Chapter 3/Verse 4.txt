The act of redeeming us was one of great kindness, or goodness.And love of God - Margin, “pity.” The Greek word is φιλανθρωπία philanthrōpia - “philanthropy - the love of man.” The plan of salvation was founded on love to man, and was the highest expression of that love; the notes at John 3:16. The Greek of this verse is, “When the kindness and love of God our Saviour to man was manifested, he saved us” Titus 3:5, to wit, from those sins of which we had before been guilty.
