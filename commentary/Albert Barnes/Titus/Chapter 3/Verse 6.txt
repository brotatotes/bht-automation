<p style=" "><b>Which he shed on us - </b>Greek, “Which he poured out on us” - <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ἐξέχην</span></span> exechēn; see the notes at <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>. The same Greek word is used there as here. It occurs also in the same sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:18">Acts 2:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="bnb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33">Acts 2:33</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Abundantly - </b>Margin, as in Greek, “richly.” The meaning is, that the Holy Spirit had been imparted in copious measure in order to convert them from their former wickedness. There is no particular allusion here to the day of Pentecost, but the sense is, that the Holy Spirit had been imparted richly to all who were converted, at any time or place, from the error of their ways. What the apostle says here is true of all who become Christians, and can be applied to all who become believers in any age or land,</p>
