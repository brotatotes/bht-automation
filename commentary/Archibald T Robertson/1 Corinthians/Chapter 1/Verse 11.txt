 For it hath been signified unto me  (εδηλωθη γαρ μο). First aorist passive indicative of δηλοω and difficult to render into English. Literally, It was signified to me.By them of Chloe  (υπο των Χλοης). Ablative case of the masculine plural article των, by the (folks) of Chloe (genitive case). The words "which are of the household" are not in the Greek, though they correctly interpret the Greek, "those of Chloe." Whether the children, the kinspeople, or the servants of Chloe we do not know. It is uncertain also whether Chloe lived in Corinth or Ephesus, probably Ephesus because to name her if in Corinth might get her into trouble (Heinrici). Already Christianity was working a social revolution in the position of women and slaves. The nameChloe  means tender verdure and was one of the epithets of Demeter the goddess of agriculture and for that reason Lightfoot thinks that she was a member of the freedman class like Phoebe (Romans 16:1), Hermes (Romans 16:14), Nereus (Romans 16:15). It is even possible that Stephanas, Fortunatus, Achaicus (1 Corinthians 16:17) may have been those who brought Chloe the news of the schisms in Corinth.Contentions  (εριδες). Unseemly wranglings (as opposed to discussing, διαλεγομα) that were leading to theschisms . Listed in works of the flesh (Galatians 5:19) and the catalogues of vices (2 Corinthians 12:20; Romans 1:19; 1 Timothy 6:4).
