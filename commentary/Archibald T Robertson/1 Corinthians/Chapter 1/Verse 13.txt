 Is Christ divided?  (μεμεριστα ο Χριστοσ;). Perfect passive indicative, Does Christ stand divided? It is not certain, though probable, that this is interrogative like the following clauses. Hofmann calls the assertory form a "rhetorical impossibility." The absence of μη here merely allows an affirmative answer which is true. The fourth or Christ party claimed to possess Christ in a sense not true of the others. Perhaps the leaders of this Christ party with their arrogant assumptions of superiority are the false apostles, ministers of Satan posing as angels of light (2 Corinthians 11:12-15).Was Paul crucified for you?  (Μη Παυλος εσταυρωθη υπερ υμων;). An indignant "No" is demanded by μη. Paul shows his tact by employing himself as the illustration, rather than Apollos or Cephas. Probably υπερ, over, in behalf of, rather than περ (concerning, around) is genuine, though either makes good sense here. In the Koine υπερ encroaches on περ as in 2 Thessalonians 2:1.Were ye baptized into the name of Paul?  (εις το ονομα Παυλου εβαπτισθητε;). It is unnecessary to sayinto  for εις rather thanin  since εις is the same preposition originally as εν and both are used with βαπτιζω as in Acts 8:16; Acts 10:48 with no difference in idea (Robertson, Grammar, p. 592). Paul evidently knows the idea in Matthew 28:19 and scouts the notion of being put on a par with Christ or the Trinity. He is no rival of Christ. This use of ονομα for the person is not only in the LXX, but the papyri, ostraca, and inscriptions give numerous examples of the name of the king or the god for the power and authority of the king or god (Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 146ff., 196ff.; Light from the Ancient East, p. 121).
