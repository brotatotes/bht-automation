 Also the household of Stephanas  (κα τον Στεφανα οικον). Mentioned as an afterthought. Robertson and Plummer suggest that Paul's amanuensis reminded him of this case. Paul calls him a first-fruit of Achaia (1 Corinthians 16:15) and so earlier than Crispus and he was one of the three who came to Paul from Corinth (1 Corinthians 16:17), clearly a family that justified Paul's personal attention about baptism.Besides  (λοιπον). Accusative of general reference, "as for anything else." Added to make clear that he is not meaning to omit any one who deserves mention. See also 1 Thessalonians 4:1; 1 Corinthians 4:2; 2 Corinthians 13:11; 2 Timothy 4:8. Ellicott insists on a sharp distinction from το λοιπον "as for the rest" (2 Thessalonians 3:1; Philippians 3:1; Philippians 4:8; Ephesians 6:10). Paul casts no reflection on baptism, for he could not with his conception of it as the picture of the new life in Christ (Romans 6:2-6), but he clearly denies here that he considers baptism essential to the remission of sin or the means of obtaining forgiveness.
