 That no flesh should glory before God  (οπως μη καυχησητα πασα σαρξ ενωπιον του θεου). This is the further purpose expressed by οπως for variety and appeals to God's ultimate choice in all three instances. The first aorist middle of the old verb καυχαομα, to boast, brings out sharply that not a single boast is to be made. The papyri give numerous examples of ενωπιον as a preposition in the vernacular, from adjective εν-ωπιος, in the eye of God. One should turn to 2 Corinthians 4:7 for Paul's further statement about our having this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.
