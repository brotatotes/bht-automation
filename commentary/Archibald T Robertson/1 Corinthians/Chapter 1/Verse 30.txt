 Of him  (εξ αυτου). Out of God. He chose you.In Christ Jesus  (εν Χριστω Ιησου). In the sphere of Christ Jesus the choice was made. This is God's wisdom.Who was made unto us wisdom from God  (ος εγενηθη σοφια ημιν απο θεου). Note εγενηθη, became (first aorist passive and indicative), not ην, was, the Incarnation, Cross, and Resurrection. Christ is the wisdom of God (Colossians 2:2) "both righteousness and sanctification and redemption" (δικαιοσυνη τε κα αγιασμος κα απολυτρωσις), as is made plain by the use of τε--και--κα. The three words (δικαιοσυνη, αγιασμοσ, απολυτρωσις) are thus shown to be an epexegesis of σοφια (Lightfoot). All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ Jesus. We are made righteous, holy, and redeemed in Christ Jesus. Redemption comes here last for emphasis though the foundation of the other two. In Romans 1:17 we see clearly Paul's idea of the God kind of righteousness (δικαιοσυνη) in Christ. In Romans 3:24 we have Paul's conception of redemption (απολυτρωσις, setting free as a ransomed slave) in Christ. In Romans 6:19 we have Paul's notion of holiness or sanctification (αγιασμος) in Christ. These great theological terms will call for full discussion in Romans, but they must not be overlooked here.
