 God is faithful  (πιστος ο θεος). This is the ground of Paul's confidence as he loves to say (1 Thessalonians 5:24; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Romans 8:36; Philippians 1:16). God will do what he has promised.Through whom  (δι' ου). God is the agent (δι') of their call as in Romans 11:36 and also the ground or reason for their call (δι' ον) in Hebrews 2:10.Into the fellowship  (εις κοινωνιαν). Old word from κοινωνος, partner for partnership, participation as here and 2 Corinthians 13:13; Philippians 2:1; Philippians 3:10. Then it means fellowship or intimacy as in Acts 2:42; Galatians 2:9; 2 Corinthians 6:14; 1 John 1:3; 1 John 1:7. And particularly as shown by contribution as in 2 Corinthians 8:4; 2 Corinthians 9:13; Philippians 1:5. It is high fellowship with Christ both here and hereafter.
