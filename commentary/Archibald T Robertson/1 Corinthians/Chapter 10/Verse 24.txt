 Let no man seek his own  (μηδεις το εαυτου ζητειτω). This is Paul's rule for social relations (1 Corinthians 13:5; Galatians 6:2; Romans 14:7; Romans 15:2; Philippians 2:1) and is the way to do what is expedient and what builds up.His neighbour's good  (το του ετερου). Literally, "the affair of the other man." Cf. τον ετερον in Romans 13:8 for this idea of ετερος like ο πλησιον (the nigh man, the neighbour) in Romans 15:2. This is loving your neighbour as yourself by preferring your neighbour's welfare to your own (Philippians 2:4).
