Paul carries on the supposed objective to his principle of love. Why incur the risk of being evil spoken of (βλασφημουμα) for the sake of maintaining one's liberty? Is it worth it? See Romans 14:6 where Paul justifies the conscience of one who eats the meat and of one who does not. Saying grace over food that one should not eat seems inconsistent. We have this very word blaspheme in English.
