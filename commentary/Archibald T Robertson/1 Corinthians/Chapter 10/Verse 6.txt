 Were our examples  (τυπο ημων εγενηθησαν). More exactly, examples for us (objective genitive ημων, not subjective genitive, of us). The word τυπο (our types) comes from τυπτω, to strike, and meant originally the mark of a blow as the print of the nails (John 20:25), then a figure formed by a blow like images of the gods (Acts 7:43), then an example to be imitated (1 Peter 5:3; 1 Timothy 4:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 3:9), or to be avoided as here, and finally a type in a doctrinal sense (Romans 5:14; Hebrews 9:24).To the intent we should not lust after  (εις το μη εινα ημας επιθυμητας). Purpose expressed by εις with the articular infinitive το εινα and the accusative of general reference with επιθυμητας (lusters) in the predicate.
