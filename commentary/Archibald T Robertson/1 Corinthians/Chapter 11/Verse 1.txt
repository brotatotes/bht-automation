 Imitators of me  (μιμητα μου). In the principle of considerate love as so clearly shown in chapters 1 Corinthians 11:1 and in so far as (καθως) Paul is himself an imitator of Christ. The preacher is a leader and is bound to set an example or pattern (τυπος) for others (Titus 2:7). This verse clearly belongs to the preceding chapter and not to chapter 11.
