The veil on the woman's head is the symbol of the authority that the man with the uncovered head has over her.

It is not preachers that Paul has in mind, nor evil angels who could be tempted (Genesis 6:1), but angels present in worship (cf. 1 Corinthians 4:9; Psalms 138:1) who would be shocked at the conduct of the women since the angels themselves veil their faces before Jehovah (Isaiah 6:2).
