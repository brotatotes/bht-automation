 Have long hair  (κομα). Present active subjunctive of κομαω (from κομη, hair), old verb, same contraction (-αηι=α) as the indicative (αε = α), but subjunctive here with εαν in third class condition. Long hair is a glory to a woman and a disgrace to a man (as we still feel). The long-haired man! There is a papyrus example of a priest accused of letting his hair grow long and of wearing woollen garments.For a covering  (αντ περιβολαιου). Old word from περιβαλλω to fling around, as a mantle (Hebrews 1:12) or a covering or veil as here. It is not in the place of a veil, but answering to (αντ, in the sense of αντ in John 1:16), as a permanent endowment (δεδοτα, perfect passive indicative).
