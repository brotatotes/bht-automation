 So also is Christ  (ουτως κα ο Χριστος). One would naturally expect Paul here to say ουτως κα το σωμα του Χριστου (so also is the body of Christ). He will later call Christ the Head of the Body the Church as in Colossians 1:18; Colossians 1:24; Ephesians 5:23; Ephesians 5:30. Aristotle had used σωμα of the state as the body politic. What Paul here means is Christ as the Head of the Church has a body composed of the members who have varied gifts and functions like the different members of the human body. They are all vitally connected with the Head of the body and with each other. This idea he now elaborates in a remarkable manner.
