 Were we all baptized into one body  (ημεις παντες εις εν σωμα εβαπτισθημεν). First aorist passive indicative of βαπτιζω and so a reference to a definite past event with each of them of different races, nations, classes, when each of them put on the outward badge of service to Christ, the symbol of the inward changes already wrought in them by the Holy Spirit (Galatians 3:27; Romans 6:2).And were all made to drink of one Spirit  (κα παντες εν πνευμα εποτισθημεν). First aorist passive indicative of ποτιζω, old verb, to give to drink. The accusative εν πνευμα is retained in the passive as often with verbs that in the active take two accusatives. The reference is to a definite act in the past, probably to the inward experience of the Holy Spirit symbolized by the act of baptism.
