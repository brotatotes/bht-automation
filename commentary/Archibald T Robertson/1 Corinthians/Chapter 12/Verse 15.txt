 If the foot shall say  (εαν ειπη ο πους). Condition of third class (εαν and second aorist subjunctive ειπη). In case the foot say.I am not of the body  (ουκ ειμ εκ του σωματος). I am independent of the body, not dependent on the body.It is not therefore not of the body  (ου παρα τουτο ουκ εστιν εκ του σωματος). Thinking or saying so does not change the fact. Παρα τουτο here means "alongside of this" (cf. IV Macc. 10:19) and so "because of," a rare use (Robertson, Grammar, p. 616). The two negatives (ου--ουκ) do not here destroy one another. Each retains its full force.
