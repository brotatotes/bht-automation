 God hath set some  (ους μεν εθετο ο θεος). See verse 1 Corinthians 12:18 for εθετο ο θεος. Note middle voice (for his own use). Paul begins as if he means to say ους μεν αποστολουσ, ους δε προφητας (some apostles, some prophets), but he changes the construction and has no ους δε, but instead πρωτον, δευτερον, επειτα (first, second, then, etc.).In the church  (εν τη εκκλησια). The general sense of εκκλησια as in Matthew 16:18 and later in Colossians 1:18; Colossians 1:24; Ephesians 5:23; Ephesians 5:32; Hebrews 12:23. See list also in Ephesians 4:11. See on Matthew 10:2 for αποστολους, the official title given the twelve by Jesus, and claimed by Paul though not one of the twelve.Prophets  (προφητας). For-speakers for God and Christ. See the list of prophets and teachers in Acts 13:1 with Barnabas first and Saul last. Prophets are needed today if men will let God's Spirit use them, men moved to utter the deep things of God.Teachers  (διδασκαλους). Old word from διδασκω, to teach. Used to the Baptist (Luke 3:12), to Jesus (John 3:10; John 13:13), and of Paul by himself along with αποστολος (1 Timothy 2:7). It is a calamity when the preacher is no longer a teacher, but only an exhorter. See Ephesians 4:11.Then miracles  (επειτα δυναμεις). Here a change is made from the concrete to the abstract. See the reverse in Romans 12:7. See these words (δυναμεισ, ιαμητων, γλωσσων) in verses 1 Corinthians 12:9; 1 Corinthians 12:10 with γλωσσων, last again. But these two new terms (helps, governments).Helps  (αντιλημψεις). Old word, from αντιλαμβανομα, to lay hold of. In LXX, common in papyri, here only in N.T. Probably refers to the work of the deacons, help rendered to the poor and the sick.Governments  (κυβερνησεις). Old word from κυβερναω (cf. Κυβερνητης in Acts 27:11) like Latin gubernare, our govern. So a governing. Probably Paul has in mind bishops (επισχοπο) or elders (πρεσβυτερο), the outstanding leaders (ο προισταμενο in 1 Thessalonians 5:12; Romans 12:8; ο ηγουμενο in Acts 15:22; Hebrews 13:7; Hebrews 13:17; Hebrews 13:24). Curiously enough, these two offices (pastors and deacons) which are not named specifically are the two that survive today. See Philippians 1:1 for both officers.
