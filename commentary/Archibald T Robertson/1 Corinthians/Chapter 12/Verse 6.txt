 Of workings  (ενεργηματων). Late word, here only in N.T., the effect of a thing wrought (from ενεργεω, to operate, perform, energize). Paul uses also the late kindred word ενεργεια (Colossians 1:29; Colossians 2:12) for efficiency.Who worketh all things in all  (ο ενεργων τα παντα εν πασιν). Paul is not afraid to say that God is the Energy and the Energizer of the Universe. "I say that the magnet floats in space by the will of God" (Dr. W. R. Whitney, a world figure in science). This is his philosophic and scientific theory of the Cosmos. No one has shown Paul's philosophy and science to be wrong. Here he is speaking only of spiritual gifts and results as a whole, but he applies this principle to the universe (τα παντα) in Colossians 1:16 (of Christ) and in Romans 11:36 (of God). Note the Trinity in these verses: the same Spirit (verse 1 Corinthians 12:4), the same Lord (Jesus) in verse 1 Corinthians 12:5, the same God (the Father) in verse 1 Corinthians 12:6.
