The ecstatic gifts (verse 1 Corinthians 13:1) are worthless. Equally so are the teaching gifts (prophecy, knowledge of mysteries, all knowledge). Crasis here in καν=κα εαν. Paul is not condemning these great gifts. He simply places love above them and essential to them. Equally futile is wonder-working faith "so as to remove mountains" (ωστε ορη μεθιστανειν) without love. This may have been a proverb or Paul may have known the words of Jesus (Matthew 17:20; Matthew 21:21).I am nothing  (ουθεν ειμ). Not ουθεις, nobody, but an absolute zero. This form in θ rather than δ (ουδεν) had a vogue for a while (Robertson, Grammar, p. 219).
