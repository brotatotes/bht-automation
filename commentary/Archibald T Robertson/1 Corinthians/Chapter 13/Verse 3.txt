 Bestow to feed  (Ψωμισω). First aorist active subjunctive of ψωμιζω, to feed, to nourish, from ψωμος, morsel or bit, and so to feed, by putting a morsel into the mouth like infant (or bird). Old word, but only here in N.T.To be burned  (ινα καυθησωμα). First future passive subjunctive (Textus Receptus), but D καυθησομα (future passive indicative of καιω, old word to burn). There were even some who courted martyrdom in later years (time of Diocletian). This Byzantine future subjunctive does not occur in the old MSS. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 876). Aleph A B here read καυχησωμα, first aorist middle subjunctive of καυχαομα (so Westcott and Hort), "that I may glory." This is correct.It profiteth me nothing  (ουδεν ωφελουμα). Literally, I am helped nothing. Ουδεν in the accusative case retained with passive verb. See two accusatives with ωφελεω in 1 Corinthians 14:6. Verb is old and from οφελος (profit).
