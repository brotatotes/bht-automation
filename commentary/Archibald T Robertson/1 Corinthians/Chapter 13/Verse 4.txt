Verses 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 picture the character or conduct of love in marvellous rhapsody.Suffereth long  (μακροθυμε). Late Koine word (Plutarch) from μακρος, long, θυμος, passion, ardour. Cf. James 5:7.Is kind  (χρηστευετα). From χρηστος (useful, gracious, kind) and that from χραομα, to use. Not found elsewhere save in Clement of Rome and Eusebius. "Perhaps of Paul's coining" (Findlay). Perhaps a vernacular word ready for Paul. Gentle in behaviour.Envieth not  (ου ζηλο). Present active indicative of ζηλοω (contraction οει=ο, same as subjunctive and optative forms). Bad sense of ζηλος from ζεω, to boil, good sense in 1 Corinthians 12:31. Love is neither jealous nor envious (both ideas).Vaunteth not itself  (ου περπερευετα). From περπερος, vainglorious, braggart (Polybius, Epictetus) like Latin perperus. Only here in N.T. and earliest known example. It means play the braggart. Marcus Anton. V. 5 uses it with αρεσκευομα, to play the toady.Is not puffed up  (ου φυσιουτα). Present direct middle indicative of φυσιοω from φυσις (late form for φυσαω, φυσιαω from φυσα, bellows), to puff oneself out like a pair of bellows. This form in Herodas and Menander. Is not arrogant. See on 1 Corinthians 4:6.
