 Beareth all things  (παντα στεγε). Στεγω is old verb from στεγη, roof, already in 1 Corinthians 9:12; 1 Thessalonians 3:1; 1 Thessalonians 3:5 which see. Love covers, protects, forbears (suffert, Vulgate). See 1 Peter 4:8 "because love covers a multitude of sins" (οτ αγαπη καλυπτε φηθος αμαρτιων), throws a veil over.Believeth all things  (παντα πιστευε). Not gullible, but has faith in men.Hopeth all things  (παντα ελπιζε). Sees the bright side of things. Does not despair. Ενδυρεθ αλλ θινγς (παντα υπομενε). Perseveres. Carries on like a stout-hearted soldier. If one knows Sir Joshua Reynolds's beautiful painting of the Seven Virtues (the four cardinal virtues of the Stoics--temperance, prudence, fortitude, justice--and the three Christian graces--faith, hope, love), he will find them all exemplified here as marks of love (the queen of them all).
