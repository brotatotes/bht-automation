 We have hoped  (ηλπικοτες εσμεν). Periphrastic perfect active indicative. Hope limited to this life even if "in Christ."Only  (μονον) qualifies the whole clause.Most pitiable  (ελεεινοτερο). Comparative form, not superlative, of old adjective ελεεινος, to be pitied, pitiable. If our hope is limited to this life, we have denied ourselves what people call pleasures and have no happiness beyond. The Epicureans have the argument on us. Paul makes morality turn on the hope of immortality. Is he not right? Witness the breaking of moral ties today when people take a merely animal view of life.
