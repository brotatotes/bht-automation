 The last enemy that shall be abolished is death  (εσχατος εχθρος καταργειτα ο θανατος). A rather free translation. Literally, "death (note article, and so subject) is done away (prophetic or futuristic use of present tense of same verb as in verse 1 Corinthians 15:24), the last enemy" (predicate and only one "last" and so no article as in 1 John 2:18).
