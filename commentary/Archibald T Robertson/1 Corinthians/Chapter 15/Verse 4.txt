 And that he was buried  (κα οτ εταφη). Note οτ repeated before each of the four verbs as a separate item. Second aorist passive indicative of θαπτω, old verb, to bury. This item is an important detail as the Gospels show.And that he hath been raised  (κα οτ εγηγερτα). Perfect passive indicative, not ηγερθη likerose  of the King James' Version. There is reason for this sudden change of tense. Paul wishes to emphasize the permanence of the resurrection of Jesus. He is still risen.On the third day  (τη ημερα τη τριτη). Locative case of time. Whether Paul had seen either of the Gospels we do not know, but this item is closely identified with the fact of Christ's resurrection. We have it in Peter's speech (Acts 10:40) and Jesus points it out as part of prophecy (Luke 24:46). The other expression occasionally found "after three days" (Mark 10:34) is merely free vernacular for the same idea and not even Matthew 12:40 disturbs it. See on Luke 24:1 for record of the empty tomb on the first day of the week (the third day).
