 For one star differeth from another star in glory  (αστηρ γαρ αστερος διαφερε εν δοξη). A beautiful illustration of Paul's point. Αστερος is the ablative case after διαφερε (old verb διαφερω, Latin differo, our differ, bear apart). On αστηρ see Matthew 2:7 and αστρον Luke 21:25. Stars differ in magnitude and brilliancy. The telescope has added more force to Paul's argument.In glory  (εν δοξη). Old word from δοκεω, to think, to seem. So opinion, estimate, then the shekinah glory of God in the LXX, glory in general. It is one of the great words of the N.T. Jesus is termed the glory in James 2:1.
