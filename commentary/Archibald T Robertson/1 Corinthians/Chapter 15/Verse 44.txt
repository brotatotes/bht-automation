 A natural body  (σωμα ψυχικον). See on 1 Corinthians 2:14 for this word, a difficult one to translate since ψυχη has so many meanings. Natural is probably as good a rendering as can be made, but it is not adequate, for the body here is not all ψυχη either as soul or life. The same difficulty exists as to a spiritual body (σωμα πνευματικον). The resurrection body is not wholly πνευμα. Caution is needed here in filling out details concerning the ψυχη and the πνευμα. But certainly he means to say that the "spiritual body" has some kind of germinal connection with the "natural body," though the development is glorious beyond our comprehension though not beyond the power of Christ to perform (Philippians 3:21). The force of the argument remains unimpaired though we cannot follow fully into the thought beyond us.If there is  (ε εστιν). "If there exists" (εστιν means this with accent on first syllable), a condition of first class assumed as true.There is also  (εστιν κα). There exists also.
