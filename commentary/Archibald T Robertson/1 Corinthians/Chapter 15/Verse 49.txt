 We shall also bear  (φορεσομεν κα). Old MSS. (so Westcott and Hort) read φορεσωμεν κα. Volitive aorist active subjunctive, Let us also bear. Ellicott strongly opposes the subjunctive. It may be merely the failure of scribes to distinguish between long o and short o. Paul hardly means to say that our attaining the resurrection body depends on our own efforts! A late frequentative form of φερω.
