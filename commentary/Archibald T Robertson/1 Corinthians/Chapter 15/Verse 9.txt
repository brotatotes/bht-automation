 The least  (ο ελαχιστος). True superlative, not elative. Explanation of the strong word εκτρωμα just used. See Ephesians 3:8 where he calls himself "less than the least of all saints" and 1 Timothy 1:15 the "chief" (πρωτος) of sinners. Yet under attack from the Judaizers Paul stood up for his rank as equal to any apostle (2 Corinthians 11:5; 2 Corinthians 11:23).Because I persecuted the church of God  (εδιωξα την εκκλησιαν του θεου). There were times when this terrible fact confronted Paul like a nightmare. Who does not understand this mood of contrition?
