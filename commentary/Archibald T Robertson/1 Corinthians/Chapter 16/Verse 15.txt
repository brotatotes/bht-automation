 Ye know  (οιδατε). Koine form for second perfect indicative used as present of οραω. Parenthetic clause through rest of the verse. Stephanas is mentioned also in 1 Corinthians 1:16 and in 1 Corinthians 16:17. For απαρχη see on 1 Corinthians 15:20; 1 Corinthians 15:23.They have set themselves  (εταξαν εαυτους). Remarkable statement worthy of attention today. This noble family appointed themselves to be ministers to the saints that needed it (the poor and needy). Personal work for Christ is still the only way to win the world for Christ, voluntary personal work. If all Christians did it!
