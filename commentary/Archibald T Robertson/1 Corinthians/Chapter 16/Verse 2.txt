 Upon the first day of the week  (κατα μιαν σαββατου). For the singular σαββατου (sabbath) for week see Luke 18:12; Mark 16:9. For the use of the cardinal μιαν in sense of ordinal πρωτην after Hebrew fashion in LXX (Robertson, Grammar, p. 672) as in Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1; Acts 20:7. Distributive use of κατα also.Lay by him in store  (παρ' εαυτω τιθετω θησαυριζων). By himself, in his home. Treasuring it (cf. Matthew 6:19. for θησαυριζω). Have the habit of doing it, τιθετω (present imperative).As he may prosper  (οτ εαν ευοδωτα). Old verb from ευ, well, and οδος, way or journey, to have a good journey, to prosper in general, common in LXX. In N.T. only here and Romans 1:10; 3 John 1:2. It is uncertain what form ευοδωτα is, present passive subjunctive, perfect passive indicative, or even perfect passive subjunctive (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 54). The old MSS. had no accents. Some MSS. even have ευοδωθη (first aorist passive subjunctive). But the sense is not altered. Hοτ is accusative of general reference and εαν can occur either with the subjunctive or indicative. This rule for giving occurs also in 2 Corinthians 8:12. Paul wishes the collections to be made before he comes.
