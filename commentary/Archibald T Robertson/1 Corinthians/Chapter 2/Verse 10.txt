 But unto us God revealed them  (ημιν γαρ απεκαλυψεν ο θεος). So with γαρ B 37 Sah Cop read instead of δε of Aleph A C D. "Δε is superficially easier; γαρ intrinsically better" (Findlay). Paul explains why this is no longer hidden, "for God revealed unto us" the wonders of grace pictured in verse 1 Corinthians 2:9. We do not have to wait for heaven to see them. Hence we can utter those things hidden from the eye, the ear, the heart of man. This revelation (απεκαλυψεν, first aorist active indicative) took place, at "the entry of the Gospel into the world," not "when we were admitted into the Church, when we were baptized" as Lightfoot interprets it.Through the Spirit  (δια του πνευματος). The Holy Spirit is the agent of this definite revelation of grace, a revelation with a definite beginning or advent (constative aorist), an unveiling by the Spirit where "human ability and research would not have sufficed" (Robertson and Plummer), "according to the revelation of the mystery" (Romans 16:25), "the revelation given to Christians as an event that began a new epoch in the world's history" (Edwards).Searcheth all things  (παντα εραυνα). This is the usual form from A.D. 1 on rather than the old ερευναω. The word occurs (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary) for a professional searcher's report and εραυνητα, searchers for customs officials. "The Spirit is the organ of understanding between man and God" (Findlay). So in Romans 8:27 we have this very verb εραυναω again of God's searching our hearts. The Holy Spirit not merely investigates us, but he searches "even the deep things of God" (κα τα βαθη του θεου). Profunda Dei (Vulgate). Cf. "the deep things of Satan" (Revelation 2:24) and Paul's language in Romans 11:33 "Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God." Paul's point is simply that the Holy Spirit fully comprehends the depth of God's nature and his plans of grace and so is fully competent to make the revelation here claimed.
