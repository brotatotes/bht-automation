 God's wisdom in a mystery  (θεου σοφιαν εν μυστηριω). Two points are here sharply made. It is God's wisdom (note emphatic position of the genitive θεου) in contrast to the wisdom of this age. Every age of the world has a conceit of its own and it is particularly true of this twentieth century, but God's wisdom is eternal and superior to the wisdom of any age or time. God's wisdom is alone absolute. See on 1 Corinthians 2:1 for mystery. It is not certain whetherin a mystery  is to be taken withwisdom  orwe speak . The result does not differ greatly, probably withwisdom , so long a secret and now at last revealed (Colossians 1:26; 2 Thessalonians 2:7).That hath been hidden  (την αποκεκρυμμενην). See Romans 16:25; Colossians 1:26; Ephesians 3:5. Articular perfect passive participle of αποκρυπτω, more precisely defining the indefinite σοφιαν (wisdom).Foreordained before the worlds  (προωρισεν προ των αιωνων). This relative clause (ην) defines still more closely God's wisdom. Note προ with both verb and substantive (αιωνων). Constative aorist of God's elective purpose as shown in Christ crucified (1 Corinthians 1:18-24). "It was no afterthought or change of plan" (Robertson and Plummer).Unto our glory  (εις δοξαν ημων). "The glory of inward enlightenment as well as of outward exaltation" (Lightfoot).
