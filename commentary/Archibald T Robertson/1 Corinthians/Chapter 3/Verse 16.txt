 Ye are a temple of God  (ναος θεου εστε). Literally, a sanctuary (ναος, not ιερον, the sacred enclosure, but the holy place and the most holy place) of God. The same picture of building as in verse 1 Corinthians 3:9 (οικοδομη), only here the sanctuary itself.Dwelleth in you  (εν υμιν οικε). The Spirit of God makes his home (οικε) in us, not in temples made with hands (Acts 7:48; Acts 17:24).
