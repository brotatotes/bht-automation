 Wherefore let no one glory in men  (ωστε μηδεις καυχασθω εν ανθρωποις). The conclusion (ωστε) from the self-conceit condemned. This particle here is merely inferential with no effect on the construction (ωσ+τε = and so) any more than ουν would have, a paratactic conjunction. There are thirty such examples of ωστε in the N.T., eleven with the imperative as here (Robertson, Grammar, p. 999). The spirit of glorying in party is a species of self-conceit and inconsistent with glorying in the Lord (1 Corinthians 1:31).
