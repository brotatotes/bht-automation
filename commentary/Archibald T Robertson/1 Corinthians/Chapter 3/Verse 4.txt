 For when one saith  (οταν γαρ λεγη τις). Indefinite temporal clause with the present subjunctive of repetition (Robertson, Grammar, p. 972). Each instance is a case in point and proof abundant of the strife.Of Paul  (Παυλου). Predicate genitive, belong to Paul, on Paul's side.Of Apollos  (Απολλω). Same genitive, but the form is the so-called Attic second declension. See the nominative Απολλως in verse 1 Corinthians 3:5.Men  (ανθρωπο). Just mere human creatures (ανθρωπο, generic term for mankind), in the flesh (σαρκινο), acting like the flesh (σαρκικο), not πνευματικο, as if still ψυχικο. It was a home-thrust. Paul would not even defend his own partisans.
