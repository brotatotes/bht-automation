 We toil  (κοπιωμεν). Common late verb for weariness in toil (Luke 5:5),working with our own hands  (εργαζομενο ταις ιδιαις χερσιν) instrumental case χερσιν and not simply for himself but also for Aquila and Priscilla as he explains in Acts 20:34. This personal touch gives colour to the outline. Paul alludes to this fact often (1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8; 1 Corinthians 9:6; 2 Corinthians 11:7). "Greeks despised manual labour; St. Paul glories in it" (Robertson and Plummer). Cf. Deissmann, Light, etc., p. 317.Being reviled we bless  (λοιδορουμενο ευλογουμεν). Almost the language of Peter about Jesus (1 Peter 2:23) in harmony with the words of Jesus in Matthew 5:44; Luke 6:27.Being persecuted we endure  (διωκομενο ανεχομεθα). We hold back and do not retaliate. Turn to Paul's other picture of his experiences in the vivid contrasts in 2 Corinthians 4:7-10; 2 Corinthians 6:3-10 for an interpretation of his language here.
