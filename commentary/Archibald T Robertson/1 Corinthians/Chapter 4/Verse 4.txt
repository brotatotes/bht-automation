 For I know nothing against myself  (ουδεν γαρ εμαυτω συνοιδα). Not a statement of fact, but an hypothesis to show the unreliability of mere complacent self-satisfaction. Note the use of συνοιδα (second perfect active indicative with dative (disadvantage) of the reflexive pronoun) for guilty knowledge against oneself (cf. Acts 5:2; Acts 12:12; Acts 14:6).Yet  (αλλ'). Adversative use of αλλα.Am I not hereby justified  (ουκ εν τουτω δεδικαιωμα). Perfect passive indicative of state of completion. Failure to be conscious of one's own sins does not mean that one is innocent. Most prisoners plead "not guilty." Who is the judge of the steward of the mysteries of God? It is the Lord "that judgeth me" (ο ανακρινων με). Probably, who examines me and then passes on my fidelity (πιστος in verse 1 Corinthians 4:2).
