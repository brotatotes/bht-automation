 To deliver such an one unto Satan  (παραδουνα τον τοιουτον τω Σατανα). We have the same idiom in 1 Timothy 1:20 used of Hymenius and Alexander. In 2 Corinthians 12:7 Paul speaks of his own physical suffering as a messenger (αγγελος) of Satan. Paul certainly means expulsion from the church (verse 1 Corinthians 5:2) and regarding him as outside of the commonwealth of Israel (Ephesians 2:11). But we are not to infer that expulsion from the local church means the damnation of the offender. The wilful offenders have to be expelled and not regarded as enemies, but admonished as brothers (2 Thessalonians 3:14).For the destruction of the flesh  (εις ολεθρον της σαρκος). Both for physical suffering as in the case of Job (Job 2:6) and for conquest of the fleshly sins, remedial punishment.That the spirit may be saved  (ινα το πνευμα σωθη). The ultimate purpose of the expulsion as discipline. Note the use of το πνευμα in contrast with σαρξ as the seat of personality (cf. 1 Corinthians 3:15). Paul's motive is not merely vindictive, but the reformation of the offender who is not named here nor in 2 Corinthians 2:5-11 if the same man is meant, which is very doubtful. The final salvation of the man in the day of Christ is the goal and this is to be attained not by condoning his sin.
