 Purge out  (εκκαθαρατε). First aorist (effective) active imperative of εκκαθαιρω, old verb to cleanse out (εκ), to clean completely. Aorist tense of urgency, do it now and do it effectively before the whole church is contaminated. This turn to the metaphor is from the command to purge out the old (παλαιαν, now old and decayed) leaven before the passover feast (Exodus 12:15; Exodus 13:7; Zephaniah 1:12). Cf. modern methods of disinfection after a contagious disease.A new lump  (νεον φυραμα). Make a fresh start as a new community with the contamination removed. Νεος is the root for νεανισκος, a young man, not yet old (γηραιος). So new wine (οινον νεον Matthew 9:17). Καινος is fresh as compared with the ancient (παλαιος). See the distinction in Colossians 3:10; Ephesians 4:22; 2 Corinthians 5:17.Unleavened  (αζυμο). Without (α privative) leaven, the normal and ideal state of Christians. Rare word among the ancients (once in Plato). They are a new creation (καινη κτισις), "exemplifying Kant's maxim that you should treat a man as if he were what you would wish him to be" (Robertson and Plummer).For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ  (κα γαρ το πασχα ημων ετυθη Χριστος). First aorist passive indicative of θυω, old verb to sacrifice. Euphony of consonants, θ to τ because of -θη. Reference to the death of Christ on the Cross as the Paschal Lamb (common use of πασχα as Mark 14:12; Luke 22:7), the figure used long before by the Baptist of Jesus (John 1:29). Paul means that the Lamb was already slain on Calvary and yet you have not gotten rid of the leaven.
