 Wherefore let us keep the feast  (ωστε εορταζωμεν). Present active subjunctive (volitive). Let us keep on keeping the feast, a perpetual feast (Lightfoot), and keep the leaven out. It is quite possible that Paul was writing about the time of the Jewish passover, since it was before pentecost (1 Corinthians 16:8). But, if so, that is merely incidental, and his language here is not a plea for the observance of Easter by Christians.With the leaven of malice and wickedness  (εν ζυμη κακιας κα πονηριας). Vicious disposition and evil deed.With the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth  (εν αζυμοις ειλικρινιας κα αληθειας). No word for "bread." The plural of αζυμοις may suggest "elements" or "loaves." Ειλικρινια (sincerity) does not occur in the ancient Greek and is rare in the later Greek. In the papyri it means probity in one example. The etymology is uncertain. Boisacq inclines to the notion of ειλη or ελη, sunlight, and κρινω, to judge by the light of the sun, holding up to the light. Αληθεια (truth) is a common word from αληθης (true) and this from α privative and ληθω (λαθειν, λανθανω, to conceal or hide) and so unconcealed, not hidden. The Greek idea of truth is out in the open. Note Romans 1:18 where Paul pictures those who are holding down the truth in unrighteousness.
