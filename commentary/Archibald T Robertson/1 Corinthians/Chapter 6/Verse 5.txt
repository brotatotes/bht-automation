From sarcasm to pathos Paul turns.Does there not exist  (εν, short form for ενεστ)? With double negative ουκ--ουδεις, expecting the answer yes. Surelyone  such man exists in the church.Who  (ος). Almost consecutive in idea, of such wisdom that he will be able.To decide between his brethren  (διακρινα ανα μεσον του αδελφου αυτου).
