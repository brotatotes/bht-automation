 Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong and defraud  (αλλα υμεις αδικειτε κα αποστερειτε). "But (adversative αλλα, on the contrary) you (emphatic) do the wronging and the robbing" (active voices) "and that your brethren" (κα τουτο αδελφους). Same idiom as at close of verse 1 Corinthians 6:6. The very climax of wrong-doings, to stoop to do this with one's brethren in Christ.
