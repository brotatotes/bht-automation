 The unrighteous  (αδικο). To remind them of the verb αδικεω just used.The Kingdom of God  (θεου βασιλειαν). Precisely, God's kingdom.Be not deceived  (μη πλανασθε). Present passive imperative with negative μη. Do not be led astray by plausible talk to cover up sin as mere animal behaviourism. Paul has two lists in verses 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Corinthians 6:10, one with repetition of ουτε, neither (fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, or μαλακο, abusers of themselves with men or αρσενοκοιτα or sodomites as in 1 Timothy 1:10 a late word for this horrid vice, thieves, covetous), the other with ου not (drunkards, revilers, extortioners). All these will fall short of the kingdom of God. This was plain talk to a city like Corinth. It is needed today. It is a solemn roll call of the damned even if some of their names are on the church roll in Corinth whether officers or ordinary members.
