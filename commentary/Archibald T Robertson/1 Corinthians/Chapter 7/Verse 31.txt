 Those that use the world  (ο χρωμενο τον κοσμον). Old verb χραομα, usually with the instrumental case, but the accusative occurs in some Cretan inscriptions and in late writers according to a tendency of verbs to resume the use of the original accusative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 468).As not abusing it  (ως μη καταχρημενο). Perfective use of κατα in composition, old verb, but here only in N.T., to use up, use to the full. Papyri give examples of this sense. This is more likely the idea than "abusing" it.For the fashion of this world passeth away  (παραγε γαρ το σχημα του κοσμου τουτου). Cf. 1 John 2:17. Σχημα is the habitus, the outward appearance, old word, in N.T. only here and Philippians 2:7. Παραγε (old word) means "passes along" like a moving panorama (movie show!). Used of Jesus passing by in Jericho (Matthew 20:30).
