 For so long time as her husband liveth  (εφ' οσον χρονον ζη ο ανηρ αυτης). While he lives (τω ζωντ ανδρ) Paul says in Romans 7:2. This is the ideal and is pertinent today when husbands meet their ex-wives and wives meet their ex-husbands. There is a screw loose somewhere. Paul here treats as a sort of addendum the remarriage of widows. He will discuss it again in 1 Timothy 5:9-13 and then he will advise younger widows to marry. Paul leaves her free here also to be married again, "only in the Lord" (μονον εν Κυριω). Every marriage ought to be "in the Lord."To be married  (γαμηθηνα) is first aorist passive infinitive followed by the dative relative ω with unexpressed antecedent τουτω.
