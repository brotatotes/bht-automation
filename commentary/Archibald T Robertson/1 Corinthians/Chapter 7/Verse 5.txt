First aorist active subjunctive of σχολαζω, late verb from σχολη, leisure (our "school"), and so to have leisure (punctiliar act and not permanent) for prayer. Note private devotions here.That Satan tempt you not  (ινα μη πειραζη). Present subjunctive, that Satan may not keep on tempting you.Because of your incontinency  (δια την ακρασιαν [υμων]). A late word from Aristotle on for ακρατεια from ακρατης (without self-control, α privative and κρατεω, to control, common old word). In N.T. only here and Matthew 23:25 which see.
