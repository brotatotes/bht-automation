 Yet I would  (θελω δε). "But I wish." Followed by accusative and infinitive (ανθρωπους εινα). This is Paul's personal preference under present conditions (1 Corinthians 7:26).Even as I myself  (ως κα εμαυτον). This clearly means that Paul was not then married and it is confirmed by 1 Corinthians 9:5. Whether he had been married and was now a widower turns on the interpretation of Acts 26:10 "I cast my vote." If this is taken literally (the obvious way to take it) as a member of the Sanhedrin, Paul was married at that time. There is no way to decide.His own gift from God  (ιδιον χαρισμα εκ θεου). So each must decide for himself. See on 1 Corinthians 1:7 for χαρισμα, a late word from χαριζομα.
