 Puffeth up  (φυσιο). From φυσιοω (present indicative active). See on 1 Corinthians 4:6. Pride may be the result, not edification (οικοδομε) which comes from love. Note article (η) with both γνωσις and αγαπη, making the contrast sharper. See on 1 Thessalonians 5:11 for the verb οικοδομεω, to build up. Love is the solution, not knowledge, in all social problems.That he knoweth anything  (εγνωκενα τ). Perfect active infinitive in indirect discourse after δοκε (condition of first class with ε). So "has acquired knowledge" (cf. 1 Corinthians 3:18), has gone to the bottom of the subject.He knoweth not yet  (ουπω εγνω). Second aorist active indicative, timeless aorist, summary (punctiliar) statement of his ignorance.As he ought to know  (καθως δε γνωνα). Second aorist active infinitive, ingressive aorist (come to know). Newton's remark that he was only gathering pebbles on the shore of the ocean of truth is pertinent. The really learned man knows his ignorance of what lies beyond. Shallow knowledge is like the depth of the mud hole, not of the crystal spring.
