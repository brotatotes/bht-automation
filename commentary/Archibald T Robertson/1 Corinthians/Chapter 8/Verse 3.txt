 The same is known of him  (ουτος εγνωστα υπ' αυτου). Loving God (condition of first class again) is the way to come to know God. It is not certain whether ουτος refers to the man who loves God or to God who is loved. Both are true. God knows those that are his (2 Timothy 2:19; Exodus 33:12). Those who know God are known of God (Galatians 4:9). We love God because he first loved us (1 John 4:19). But here Paul uses both ideas and both verbs. Εγνωστα is perfect passive indicative of γινωσκω, an abiding state of recognition by (υπ') God. No one is acquainted with God who does not love him (1 John 4:8). God sets the seal of his favour on the one who loves him. So much for the principle.
