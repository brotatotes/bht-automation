 Over you  (υμων). Objective genitive after εξουσιαν.Do not we yet more?  (ου μαλλον ημεισ;). Because of Paul's peculiar relation to that church as founder and apostle.But we bear all things  (αλλα παντα στεγομεν). Old verb to cover (στεγη, roof) and so to cover up, to conceal, to endure (1 Corinthians 13:7 of love). Paul deliberately declined to use (usual instrumental case with χραομα) his right to pay in Corinth.That we may cause no hindrance  (ινα μη τινα ενκοπην δωμεν). Late word ενκοπη, a cutting in (cf. radio or telephone) or hindrance from ενκοπτω, to cut in, rare word (like εκκοπη) here only in N.T. and once in Vettius Valens. How considerate Paul is to avoid "a hindrance to the gospel of Christ" (τω ευαγγελιω του Χριστου, dative case and genitive) rather than insist on his personal rights and liberties, an eloquent example for all modern men.
