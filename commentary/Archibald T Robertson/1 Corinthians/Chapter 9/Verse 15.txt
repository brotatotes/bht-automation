 For it were good for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void  (καλον γαρ μο μαλλον αποθανειν η το καυχημα μου ουδεις κενωσε). The tangled syntax of this sentence reflects the intensity of Paul's feeling on the subject. He repeats his refusal to use his privileges and rights to a salary by use of the present perfect middle indicative (κεχρημα). By the epistolary aorist (εγραψα) he explains that he is not now hinting for a change on their part towards him in the matter, "in my case" (εν εμο). Then he gives his reason in vigorous language without a copula (ην, were): "For good for me to die rather than," but here he changes the construction by a violent anacoluthon. Instead of another infinitive (κενωσα) after η (than) he changes to the future indicative without οτ or ινα, "No one shall make my glorying void," viz., his independence of help from them. Κενοω is an old verb, from κενος, empty, only in Paul in N.T. See on 1 Corinthians 1:17.
