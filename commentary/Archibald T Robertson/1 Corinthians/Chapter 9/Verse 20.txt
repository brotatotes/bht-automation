 As a Jew  (ως Ιουδαιος). He was a Jew and was not ashamed of it (Acts 18:18; Acts 21:26).Not being myself under the law  (μη ων αυτος υπο νομον). He was emancipated from the law as a means of salvation, yet he knew how to speak to them because of his former beliefs and life with them (Galatians 4:21). He knew how to put the gospel to them without compromise and without offence.
