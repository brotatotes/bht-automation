 To them that are without law  (τοις ανομοις). The heathen, those outside the Mosaic law (Romans 2:14), not lawless (Luke 22:37; Acts 2:23; 1 Timothy 1:9). See how Paul bore himself with the pagans (Acts 14:15; Acts 17:23; Acts 24:25), and how he quoted heathen poets. "Not being an outlaw of God, but an inlaw of Christ" (Evans, Estius has it exlex, inlex, μη ων ανομος θεου, αλλ' εννομος Χριστου). The genitive case of θεου and Χριστου (specifying case) comes out better thus, for it seems unusual with ανομος and εννομος, both old and regular adjectives.
