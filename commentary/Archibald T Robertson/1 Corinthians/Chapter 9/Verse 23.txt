 That I may be a joint partaker thereof  (ινα συνκοινωνος αυτου γενωμα). Literally, That I may become co-partner with others in the gospel. The point is that he may be able to share the gospel with others, his evangelistic passion. Συνκοινωνος is a compound word (συν, together with, κοινωνος, partner or sharer). We have two genitives with it in Philippians 1:7, though εν and the locative is used in Revelation 1:9. It is found only in the N.T. and a late papyrus. Paul does not wish to enjoy the gospel just by himself.
