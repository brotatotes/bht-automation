Refers to what precedes and to what follows as illustration of 1 Corinthians 8:13.To them that examine me  (τοις εμε ανακρινουσιν). See on 1 Corinthians 2:15; 1 Corinthians 4:3. The critics in Corinth were "investigating" Paul with sharp eyes to find faults. How often the pastor is under the critic's spy-glass.
