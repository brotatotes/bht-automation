 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn  (ου φιμωσεις βουν αλοωντα). Quotation from Deuteronomy 25:4. Prohibition by ου and the volitive future indicative. Φιμοω, to muzzle (from φιμος, a muzzle for dogs and oxen), appears first in Aristophanes (Clouds, 592) and not again till LXX and N.T., though in the papyri also. Evidently a vernacular word, perhaps a slang word. See metaphorical use in Matthew 22:12; Matthew 22:34. Αλοωντα is present active participle of the old verb αλοαω, occurs in the N.T. only here (and verse 1 Corinthians 9:10) and 1 Timothy 5:18 where it is also quoted. It is probably derived from αλος or αλον, a threshing-floor, or the disc of a shield or of the sun and moon. The Egyptians according to the monuments, used oxen to thresh out the grain, sometimes donkeys, by pulling a drag over the grain. The same process may be found today in Andalusia, Italy, Palestine. A hieroglyphic inscription at Eileithyas reads: "Thresh ye yourselves, O oxen, Measures of grain for yourselves, Measures of grain for your masters." Note μη μελε expects the negative answer, impersonal verb with dative and genitive cases (θεο, God, βοων, oxen).Altogether  (παντως). But here probably with the notion of doubtless or assuredly. The editors differ in the verse divisions here. The Canterbury Version puts both these questions in verse 1 Corinthians 9:10, the American Standard the first in verse 1 Corinthians 9:9, the second in verse 1 Corinthians 9:10.
