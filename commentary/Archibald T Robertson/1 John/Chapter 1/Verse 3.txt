 That which we have seen  (ο εωρακαμεν). Third use of this form (verses 1 John 1:1; 1 John 1:2; 1 John 1:3), this time resumption after the parenthesis in verse 1 John 1:2.And heard  (κα ακηκοαμεν). Second (verse 1 John 1:1 for first) use of this form, a third in verse 1 John 1:5. Emphasis by repetition is a thoroughly Johannine trait.Declare we  (απαγγελλομεν). Second use of this word (verse 1 John 1:2 for first), but αγγελια (message) and αναγγελλομεν (announce) in verse 1 John 1:5.That ye also may have  (ινα κα υμεις εχητε). Purpose clause with ινα and present active subjunctive of εχω (may keep on having). "Ye also" who have not seen Jesus in the flesh as well as those like John who have seen him. Like κα υμιν (to you also) just before.Fellowship with us  (κοινωνιαν μεθ' ημων). Common word in this Epistle, from κοινωνος, partner (Luke 5:10), and κοινωνεω, to share, in (1 Peter 4:13), with μετα emphasising mutual relationship (Acts 2:42). This Epistle often uses εχω with a substantive rather than a verb.Yea, and our fellowship  (κα η κοινωνια δε η ημετερα). Careful explanation of his meaning in the word "fellowship" (partnership), involving fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ and only possible in Christ.
