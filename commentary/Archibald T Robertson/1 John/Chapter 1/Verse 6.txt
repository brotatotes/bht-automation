Claiming fellowship with God (see verse 1 John 1:3) involves walking in the light with God (verse 1 John 1:5) and not in the darkness (σκοτος here, but σκοτια in John 1:5). See 1 John 2:11 also for εν τη σκοτια περιπατεω.We lie  (ψευδομεθα). Present middle indicative, plain Greek and plain English like that about the devil in John 8:44.Do not the truth  (ου ποιουμεν την αληθειαν). Negative statement of the positive ψευδομεθα as in John 8:44. See John 3:21 for "doing the truth," like Nehemiah 9:33.
