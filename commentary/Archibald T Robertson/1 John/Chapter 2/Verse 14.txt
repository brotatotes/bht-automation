 I have written  (εγραψα). Repeated three times. Epistolary aorist referring to this Epistle, not to a previous Epistle. Law (Tests of Life, p. 309) suggests that John was interrupted at the close of verse 1 John 2:13 and resumes here in verse 1 John 2:14 with a reference to what he had previously written in verse 1 John 2:13. But that is needless ingenuity. It is quite in John's style to repeat himself with slight variations.The Father  (τον πατερα). The heavenly Father as all of God's children should come to know him. He repeats from verse 1 John 2:13 what he said to "fathers." To the young men he adds ισχυρο (strong) and the word of God abiding in them. That is what makes them powerful (ισχυρο) and able to gain the victory over the evil one.
