 All that  (παν το). Collective use of the neuter singular as in 1 John 5:4, like παν ο in John 6:37; John 6:39. Three examples, not necessarily covering all sins, are given in the nominative in apposition with παν το. "The lust of the flesh" (η επιθυμια της σαρκος, subjective genitive, lust felt by the flesh) may be illustrated by Mark 4:19; Galatians 5:17. So the genitive with η επιθυμια των οφθαλμων (the lust of the eyes) is subjective, lust with the eyes as organs as shown by Jesus in Matthew 5:28. The use of the "movies" today for gain by lustful exhibitions is a case in point. For αλαζονεια see on James 4:16, the only other N.T. example. Αλαζων (a boaster) occurs in Romans 1:30; 2 Timothy 3:2. Βιος (life) as in 1 John 3:17 is the external aspect (Luke 8:14), not the inward principle (ζωη). David Smith thinks that, as in the case of Eve (Genesis 3:1-6) and the temptations of Jesus (Matthew 4:1-11), these three sins include all possible sins. But they are all "of the world" (εκ του κοσμου) in origin, in no sense "of the Father" (εκ του πατρος). The problem for the believer is always how to be in the world and yet not of it (John 17:11; John 17:14).
