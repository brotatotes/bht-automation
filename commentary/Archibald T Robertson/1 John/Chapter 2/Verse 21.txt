 I have not written  (ουκ εγραψα). Not epistolary aorist (1 John 2:14), but a reference to what he has just said.And because no lie is of the truth  (κα οτ παν ψευδος εκ της αληθειας ουκ εστιν). Not certain whether οτ here is causal (because) or declarative (that). Either makes sense. Note the idiomatic use of εκ and παν--ουκ=ουδεν (no) as in verse 1 John 2:19.
