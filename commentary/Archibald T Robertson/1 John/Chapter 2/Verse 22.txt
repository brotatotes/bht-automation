 The liar  (ο ψευστης). The liar (with the article) par excellence. Rhetorical question to sharpen the point made already about lying in 1 John 1:6; 1 John 1:10; 1 John 2:4; 1 John 2:21. See 1 John 5:5 for a like rhetorical question.But  (ε μη). Except, if not.That denieth that Jesus is the Christ  (ο αρνουμενος οτ Ιησους ουκ εστιν ο Χριστος). Common Greek idiom for ουκ to appear after αρνεομα like redundant μη in Luke 20:27; Hebrews 12:19. The old Latin retains non here as old English did (Shakespeare, Comedy of Errors IV. ii. 7, "He denied you had in him no right"). The Cerinthian Gnostics denied the identity of the man Jesus and Christ (an αεον, they held) like the modern Jesus or Christ controversy.This is the antichrist  (ουτος εστιν ο αντιχριστος). The one just mentioned, Cerinthus himself in particular.Even he that denieth the Father and the Son  (ο αρνουμενος τον πατερα κα τον υιον). This is the inevitable logic of such a rejection of the Son of God. Jesus had himself said this very same thing (John 5:23).
