 Hath not the Father  (ουδε τον πατερα εχε). "Not even does he have the Father" or God (2 John 1:9).He that confesseth the Son  (ο ομολογων τον υιον). Because the Son reveals the Father (John 1:18; John 14:9). Our only approach to the Father is by the Son (John 14:6). Confession of Christ before men is a prerequisite for confession by Christ before the Father (Matthew 10:32; Luke 12:8).
