 And this is the promise  (κα αυτη εστιν η επαγγελια). See 1 John 1:5 for the same idiom with αγγελια (message). This is the only instance of επαγγελια in the Johannine writings. Here "the promise" is explained to be "the life eternal" (1 John 1:2). In Acts 1:4 the word is used for the coming of the Holy Spirit.He promised  (αυτος επηγγειλατο). First aorist middle indicative of επαγγελλω. Αυτος (he) is Christ as is seen in 1 John 3:3 by εκεινος.
