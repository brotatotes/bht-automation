 And now  (κα νυν). John tenderly repeats the exhortation, "keep on abiding in him."If he shall be manifested  (εαν φανερωθη). Condition of third class with εαν and first aorist passive subjunctive as in verse 1 John 2:19; Colossians 3:3. A clear reference to the second coming of Christ which may be at any time.That we have boldness  (ινα σχωμεν παρρησιαν). Purpose clause with ινα and the ingressive second aorist active subjunctive of εχω, "that we may get boldness."And not be ashamed  (κα μη αισχυνθωμεν). Likewise negative purpose (after John's fashion) with μη and the first aorist passive subjunctive of αισχυνω, to put to shame.Before him  (απ' αυτου). "From him," as if shrinking away from Christ in guilty surprise. See 2 Thessalonians 1:9 for this use of απο (from the face of the Lord).
