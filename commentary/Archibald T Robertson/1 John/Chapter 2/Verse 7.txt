 Beloved  (αγαπητο). First instance of this favourite form of address in these Epistles (1 John 3:2; 1 John 3:21; 1 John 4:1; 1 John 4:7; 1 John 4:3; 1 John 4:2; 1 John 4:5; 1 John 4:11).No new commandment  (ουκ εντολην καινην). Not novel or new in kind (καινην as distinct from νεος, new in time, for which distinction see Luke 5:33-38).But an old commandment  (αλλ' εντολην παλαιαν). Ancient as opposed both to καινος and νεος. The Mosaic law taught love for one's neighbours and Christ taught love even of enemies.Which ye had  (ην ειχετε). Imperfect active, reaching back to the beginning of their Christian lives (απ' αρχης). They had heard it expressly from Jesus (John 13:34), who, however, calls it "a new commandment."
