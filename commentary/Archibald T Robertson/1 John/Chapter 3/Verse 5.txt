 He  (εκεινος). As in verse 1 John 3:3; John 1:18.Was manifested  (εφανερωθη). Same form as in verse 1 John 3:2, but here of the Incarnation as in John 21:1, not of the second coming (1 John 2:28).To take away sins  (ινα τας αμαρτιας αρη). Purpose clause with ινα and first aorist active subjunctive of αιρω as in John 1:29. In Isaiah 53:11 we have αναφερω for bearing sins, but αιρω properly means to lift up and carry away (John 2:16). So in Hebrews 10:4 we find αφαιρεω and Hebrews 10:11 περιαιρεω, to take away sins completely (the complete expiation wrought by Christ on Calvary). The plural αμαρτιας here, as in Colossians 1:14, not singular (collective sense) αμαρτιαν as in John 1:29.And in him is no sin  (κα αμαρτια εν αυτω ουκ εστιν). "And sin (the sinful principle) in him is not." As Jesus had claimed about himself (John 7:18; John 8:46) and as is repeatedly stated in the N.T. (2 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 4:15; Hebrews 7:26; Hebrews 9:13).
