 We have beheld  (τεθεαμεθα). Perfect middle of θεαομα as in verse 1 John 4:12, though the aorist in 1 John 1:1; John 1:14 (εθεασαμεθα). John is qualified to bear witness (μαρτυρουμεν as in 1 John 1:2) as Jesus had charged the disciples to do (Acts 1:8).Hath sent  (απεσταλκεν). As in verse 1 John 4:9, though απεστειλεν in verse 1 John 4:10.To be the Saviour of the world  (σωτηρα του κοσμου). Predicate accusative of σωτηρ (Saviour), like ιλασμον in verse 1 John 4:10. This very phrase occurs elsewhere only in John 4:42 as the confession of the Samaritans, but the idea is in John 3:17.
