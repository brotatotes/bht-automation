 Whosoever shall confess  (ος εαν ομολογηση). Indefinite relative clause with modal εαν (=an) and the first aorist active subjunctive, "whoever confesses." See 1 John 2:23; 1 John 4:2 for ομολογεω.That  (οτ). Object clause (indirect assertion) after ομολογεω. This confession of the deity of Jesus Christ implies surrender and obedience also, not mere lip service (cf. 1 Corinthians 12:3; Romans 10:6-12). This confession is proof (if genuine) of the fellowship with God (1 John 1:3; 1 John 3:24).
