Perfect active indicative of αποστελλω, as again in verse 1 John 4:14, the permanent mission of the Son, though in verse 1 John 4:10 the aorist απεστειλεν occurs for the single event. See John 3:16 for this great idea.His only-begotten Son  (τον υιον αυτου τον μονογενη). "His Son the only-begotten" as in John 3:16. John applies μονογενης to Jesus alone (John 1:14; John 1:18), but Luke (Luke 7:12; Luke 8:42; Luke 9:38) to others. Jesus alone completely reproduces the nature and character of God (Brooke).That we might live through him  (ινα ζησωμεν δι' αυτου). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist (ingressive, get life) active subjunctive of ζαω. "Through him" is through Christ, who is the life (John 14:6). Christ also lives in us (Galatians 2:20). This life begins here and now.
