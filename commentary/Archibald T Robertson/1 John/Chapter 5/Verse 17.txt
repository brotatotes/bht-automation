 All unrighteousness is sin  (πασα αδικια αμαρτια εστιν). Unrighteousness is one manifestation of sin as lawlessness (1 John 3:4) is another (Brooke). The world today takes sin too lightly, even jokingly as a mere animal inheritance. Sin is a terrible reality, but there is no cause for despair. Sin not unto death can be overcome in Christ.
