 We know  (οιδαμεν). As in 1 John 3:2; 1 John 3:14; 1 John 5:15; 1 John 5:19; 1 John 5:20. He has "ye know" in 1 John 2:20; 1 John 3:5; 1 John 3:15.Sinneth not  (ουχ αμαρτανε). Lineal present active indicative, "does not keep on sinning," as he has already shown in 1 John 3:4-10.He that was begotten of God  (ο γεννηθεις εκ του θεου). First aorist passive articular participle referring to Christ, if the reading of A B is correct (τηρε αυτον, not τηρε εαυτον). It is Christ who keeps the one begotten of God (γεγεννημενος εκ του θεου as in 1 John 3:9 and so different from ο γεννηθεις here). It is a difficult phrase, but this is probably the idea. Jesus (John 18:37) uses γεγεννημα of himself and uses also τηρεω of keeping the disciples (John 17:12; John 17:15; Revelation 3:10).The evil one  (ο πονηρος). Masculine and personal as in 1 John 2:13, not neuter, and probably Satan as in Matthew 6:13, not just any evil man.Touchest him not  (ουχ απτετα αυτου). Present middle indicative of απτω, elsewhere in John only John 20:17. It means to lay hold of or to grasp rather than a mere superficial touch (θιγγανω, both in Colossians 2:21). Here the idea is to touch to harm. The devil cannot snatch such a man from Christ (John 6:38).
