 For  (οτ). The reason why God's commandments are not heavy is the power that comes with the new birth from God.Whatsoever is begotten of God  (παν το γεγεννημενον εκ του θεου). Neuter singular perfect passive participle of γενναω rather than the masculine singular (verse 1 John 5:1) to express sharply the universality of the principle (Rothe) as in John 3:6; John 3:8; John 6:37; John 6:39.Overcometh the world  (νικα τον κοσμον). Present active indicative of νικαω, a continuous victory because a continuous struggle, "keeps on conquering the world" ("the sum of all the forces antagonistic to the spiritual life," D. Smith).This is the victory  (αυτη εστιν η νικη). For this form of expression see 1 John 1:5; John 1:19. Νικη (victory, cf. νικαω), old word, here alone in N.T., but the later form νικος in Matthew 12:20; 1 Corinthians 15:54; 1 Corinthians 15:57.That overcometh  (η νικησασα). First aorist active articular participle of νικαω. The English cannot reproduce the play on the word here. The aorist tense singles out an individual experience when one believed or when one met temptation with victory. Jesus won the victory over the world (John 16:33) and God in us (1 John 4:4) gives us the victory.Even our faith  (η πιστις ημων). The only instance of πιστις in the Johannine Epistles (not in John's Gospel, though in the Apocalypse). It is our faith in Jesus Christ as shown by our confession (verse 1 John 5:1) and by our life (verse 1 John 5:2).
