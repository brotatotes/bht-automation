 If we receive  (ε λαμβανομεν). Condition of first class with ε and the present active indicative, assumed as true. The conditions for a legally valid witness are laid down in Deuteronomy 19:15 (cf. Matthew 18:16; John 8:17; John 10:25; 2 Corinthians 13:1).Greater  (μειζων). Comparative of μεγας, because God is always true.For  (οτ). So it applies to this case.That  (οτ). Thus taken in the declarative sense (the fact that) as in John 3:19, though it can be causal (because) or indefinite relative with μεμαρτυρηκεν (what he hath testified, perfect active indicative of μαρτυρεω, as in John 1:32; John 4:44, etc.), a harsh construction here because of μαρτυρια, though some MSS. do read εν to agree with it (cf. verse 1 John 5:10). See οτ εαν in 1 John 3:20 for that idiom. Westcott notes the Trinity in verses 1 John 5:6-9: the Son comes, the Spirit witnesses, the Father has witnessed.
