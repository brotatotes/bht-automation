 But like as he which called you is holy  (αλλα κατα τον καλεσαντα υμας αγιον). This use of κατα is a regular Greek idiom (here in contrast with συνσχηματιζομενο). "But according to the holy one calling you or who called you" (first aorist articular participle of καλεω, to call). God is our standard or pattern (κατα), not our lusts.Be ye yourselves also holy  (κα αυτο αγιο γενηθητε). First aorist (ingressive) passive imperative of γινομα, to become with allusion (κα also) to κατα (God as our example), "Do ye also become holy." For αναστροφη (manner of life) see verse 1 Peter 1:18; 1 Peter 2:12; 1 Peter 3:1-16; James 3:13; 2 Peter 2:7. Peter uses αναστροφη eight times. The original meaning (turning up and down, back and forth) suited the Latin word conversatio (converto), but not our modern "conversation" (talk, not walk).
