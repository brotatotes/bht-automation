 According to  (κατα). Probably to be connected with εκλεκτοις rather than with αποστολος in spite of a rather loose arrangement of words and the absence of articles in verses 1 Peter 1:1; 1 Peter 1:2.The foreknowledge  (προγνωσιν). Late substantive (Plutarch, Lucian, papyri) from προγινωσκω (1 Peter 1:20), to know beforehand, only twice in N.T. (here and Acts 2:23 in Peter's sermon). In this Epistle Peter often uses substantives rather than verbs (cf. Romans 8:29).Of God the Father  (θεου πατρος). Anarthous again and genitive case. See πατηρ applied to God also in 1 Peter 1:3; 1 Peter 1:17 as often by Paul (Romans 1:7, etc.). Peter here presents the Trinity (God the Father, the Spirit, Jesus Christ).In sanctification of the Spirit  (εν αγιασμω πνευματος). Clearly the Holy Spirit, though anarthrous like θεου πατρος. Late word from αγιαζω, to render holy (αγιος), to consecrate, as in 1 Thessalonians 4:7. The subjective genitive here, sanctification wrought by the Spirit as in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 (where the Trinity mentioned as here).Unto obedience  (εις υπακοην). Obedience (from υπακουω, to hear under, to hearken) to the Lord Jesus as in 1 Peter 1:22 "to the truth," result of "the sanctification."And sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ  (ραντισμον αιματος Ιησου Χριστου). Late substantive from ραντιζω, to sprinkle (Hebrews 9:13), a word used in the LXX of the sacrifices (Numbers 19:9; Numbers 19:13; Numbers 19:20, etc.), but not in any non-biblical source so far as known, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 12:24 (of the sprinkling of blood). Reference to the death of Christ on the Cross and to the ratification of the New Covenant by the blood of Christ as given in Hebrews 9:19; Hebrews 12:24 with allusion to Exodus 24:3-8. Paul does not mention this ritual use of the blood of Christ, but Jesus does (Matthew 26:28; Mark 14:24). Hence it is not surprising to find the use of it by Peter and the author of Hebrews. Hort suggests that Peter may also have an ulterior reference to the blood of the martyrs as in Revelation 7:14; Revelation 12:11, but only as illustration of what Jesus did for us, not as having any value. The whole Epistle is a commentary upon προγνωσις θεου, αγιασμος πνευματοσ, αιμα Χριστου (Bigg). Peter is not ashamed of the blood of Christ.Be multiplied  (πληθυνθειη). First aorist passive optative (volitive) of πληθυνω, old verb (from πληθυς, fulness), in a wish. So in 2 Peter 1:2; Judges 1:2, but nowhere else in N.T. salutations. Grace and peace (χαρις κα ειρηνη) occur together in 2 Peter 1:2, in 2 John 1:2 (with ελεος), and in all Paul's Epistles (with ελεος added in I and II Timothy).
