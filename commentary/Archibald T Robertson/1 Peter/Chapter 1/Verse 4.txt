 Unto an inheritance  (εις κληρονομιαν). Old word (from κληρονομος, heir) for the property received by the heir (Matthew 21:38), here a picture of the blessedness in store for us pilgrims (Galatians 3:18).Incorruptible  (αφθαρτον). Old compound adjective (alpha privative and φθειρω, to corrupt), imperishable. So many inheritances vanish away before they are obtained.Undefiled  (αμιαντον). Old verbal adjective (note alliteration) from alpha privative and μιαινω, to defile, without defect or flaw in the title, in N.T. only here, James 1:27; Hebrews 13:4.That fadeth not away  (αμαραντον). Alliterative and verbal adjective again from alpha privative and μαραινω (to dry up, to wither, as in James 1:11), late and rare word in several inscriptions on tombs, here only in N.T. These inscriptions will fade away, but not this inheritance in Christ. It will not be like a faded rose.Reserved  (τετηρημενην). Perfect passive participle of τηρεω, old verb, to take care of, to guard. No burglars or bandits can break through where this inheritance is kept (Matthew 6:19; John 17:11). Cf. Colossians 1:5, where laid away" (αποκειμενην) occurs.For you  (εις υμας). More graphic than the mere dative.
