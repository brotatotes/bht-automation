 The proof of your faith  (το δοκιμιον υμων της πιστεως). The identical phrase in James 1:3 and probably derived from there by Peter. See there for discussion of το δοκιμιον (the test or touchstone of faith).Being more precious  (πολυτιμοτερον). No word for "being" (ον) in the Greek. The secondary uncials have πολυ τιμιωτερον. The text is the comparative of πολυτιμος, late adjective (Plutarch) from πολυ and τιμη (of great price) as in Matthew 13:46.Than gold  (χρυσιου). Ablative case after the comparative adjective.That perisheth  (του απολλυμενου). Present middle articular participle of απολλυμ to destroy. Even gold perishes (wears away).Though it is proved by fire  (δια πυρος δε δοκιμαζομενου). Present passive articular participle (in the ablative like χρυσιου) of δοκιμαζω (common verb for testing metals) with δε, which gives a concessive sense to the participle. Faith stands the test of fire better than gold, but even gold is refined by fire.That might be found  (ινα ευρεθη). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of ευρισκω, common verb, to find. As in 2 Peter 3:14, this is the result of the probation by God as the Refiner of hearts.Unto praise and glory and honour  (εις επαινον κα δοξαν κα τιμην). Here probably both to God and man in the result. Cf. Matthew 5:11; Romans 2:7; Romans 2:10; 1 Timothy 1:17.At the revelation of Jesus Christ  (εν αποκαλυψε Ιησου Χριστου). So also in 1 Peter 1:13; 1 Peter 4:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:7; Luke 17:30 of the second coming of Christ as the Judge and Rewarder (Bigg).
