See a free use of this imagery about the life of man as grass and a flower in James 1:11. The best MSS. here read αυτης (thereof) after δοξα (glory) rather than ανθρωπου (of man).Withereth  (εξηρανθη). First aorist (gnomic, timeless) passive indicative of ξηραινω (see James 1:11).Falleth  (εξεπεσεν). Second aorist (gnomic, timeless) active indicative of εκπιπτω (see James 1:11). In verse 1 Peter 1:25 note εις υμας (unto you) like εις υμας in 1 Peter 1:4 (υμιν dative).
