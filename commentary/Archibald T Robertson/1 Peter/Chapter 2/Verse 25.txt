 For ye were going astray like sheep  (ητε γαρ ως προβατα πλανωμενο). Brought from Isaiah 53:6, but changed to periphrastic imperfect indicative with ητε and present middle participle of πλαναω, to wander away. Recall the words of Jesus in Luke 15:4-7.But are now returned  (αλλα επεστραφητε). Second aorist passive indicative of επιστρεφω, old verb, to turn, to return (Matthew 10:13).Unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls  (επ τον ποιμενα κα επισκοπον των ψυχων υμων). Jesus called himself the Good Shepherd (John 10:11, and see also Hebrews 13:20). Here alone is Christ called our "Bishop" (overseer). See both ideas combined in Ezekiel 34:11. Philo calls God Επισχοπος. Jesus is also Αποστολος Hebrews 3:1) and he deserves all other titles of dignity that we can give him.
