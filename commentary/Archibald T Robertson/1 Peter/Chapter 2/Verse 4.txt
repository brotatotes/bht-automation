 Unto whom  (προς ον). The Lord, carrying on the imagery and language of the Psalm.Coming  (προσερχομενο). Present middle participle masculine plural of προσερχομα (προσελθατε in the Psalm) agreeing with the subject of οικοδομεισθε.A living stone  (λιθον ζωντα). Accusative case in apposition with ον (whom, the Lord Christ). There is apparent an intentional contradiction between "living" and "stone." Cf. "living hope" in 1 Peter 1:3 and "living word" in 1 Peter 1:23.Rejected indeed of men  (υπο ανθρωπων μεν αποδεδοκιμασμενον). Perfect passive participle of αποδοκιμαζω, old verb to repudiate after test (Luke 9:22), in the accusative case agreeing with λιθον.But with God  (παρα δε θεω). "By the side of God," as he looks at it, in contrast with the rejection "by men" (υπο ανθρωπων).Elect  (εκλεκτον). From Isaiah 28:6 as in εντιμον (precious, for which see Luke 7:2) rather than δοκιμον (proved) expected after αποδεδοκιμασμενον as meaning far more in God's sight, "a pre-eminence of position with" (Hort).
