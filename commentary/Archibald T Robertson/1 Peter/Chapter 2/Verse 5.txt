 Ye also as living stones  (κα αυτο ως λιθο ζωντες). Peter applies the metaphor about Christ as the living stone to the readers, "ye yourselves also."Are built up a spiritual house  (οικοδομεισθε οικος πνευματικος). Present passive indicative second person plural of οικοδομεω, the very verb used by Jesus to Peter in Matthew 16:18 (οικοδομησω) of building his church on the rock. If the metaphor of a house of living stones seems "violent" (Vincent), it should be remembered that Jesus employed the figure of a house of believers. Peter just carried it a bit farther and Paul uses a temple for believers in one place (1 Corinthians 3:16) and for the kingdom of God in general (Ephesians 2:22), as does the author of Hebrews (Hebrews 3:6). This "spiritual house" includes believers in the five Roman provinces of 1 Peter 1:1 and shows clearly how Peter understood the metaphor of Christ in Matthew 16:18 to be not a local church, but the church general (the kingdom of Christ).To be a holy priesthood  (εις ιερατευμα αγιον). Late word (from ιερατευω, to serve as priest, Luke 1:8 alone in N.T.), in LXX (Exodus 19:6), in N.T. only here and verse 1 Peter 2:9, either the office of priest (Hort) or an order or body of priests. At any rate, Peter has the same idea of Revelation 1:6 (ιερεις, priests) that all believers are priests (Hebrews 4:16) and can approach God directly.To offer up  (ανενεγκα). First aorist active infinitive (of purpose here) of αναφερω, the usual word for offering sacrifices (Hebrews 7:27). Only these are "spiritual" (πνευματικας) as pictured also in Hebrews 13:15.Acceptable  (ευπροσδεκτους). Late (Plutarch) double compound verbal adjective (ευ, προσ, δεχομα) as in 2 Corinthians 6:2.
