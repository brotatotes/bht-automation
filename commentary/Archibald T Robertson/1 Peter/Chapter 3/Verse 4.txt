 But the hidden man of the heart  (αλλ' ο κρυπτος της καρδιας ανθρωπος). Here ανθρωπος is in contrast with κοσμος just before. See Paul's use of ανθρωπος for the outer and old, the inner and new man (2 Corinthians 4:16; Romans 7:22; Colossians 3:9; Ephesians 3:16; Ephesians 4:22; Ephesians 4:24). See also the Jew εν κρυπτω (Romans 2:29) and what Jesus said about God seeing "in secret" (Matthew 6:4; Matthew 6:6).In the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit  (εν τω αφθαρτω του ησυχιου κα πραεως πνευματος). No word in the Greek for "apparel" (κοσμω). For αφθαρτος see 1 Peter 1:4; 1 Peter 1:23. For πραυς see Matthew 5:5; Matthew 11:29. Πνευμα (spirit) is here disposition or temper (Bigg), unlike any other use in the N.T. In 1 Peter 3:18; 1 Peter 3:19; 1 Peter 4:6 it means the whole inner man as opposed to σαρξ or σωμα, very much as ψυχη is used as opposed to σωμα.Which  (ο). Spirit just mentioned.Of great price  (πολυτελες). Old word (from πολυ and τελος, cost), in N.T. only here, Mark 14:3; 1 Timothy 2:9.
