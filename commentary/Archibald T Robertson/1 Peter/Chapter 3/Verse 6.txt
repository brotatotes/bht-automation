 As Sarah  (ως Σαρρα).Obeyed Abraham  (υπηκουεν τω Αβρααμ). Imperfect active of υπακουω, "used to obey" (with dative).Calling him lord  (κυριον αυτον καλουσα). Present active participle of καλεω. See Genesis 18:12.Whose children ye now are  (ης εγενηθητε τεκνα). First aorist passive indicative of γινομα, "whose children ye became."If ye do well  (αγαθοποιουσα). Present active feminine plural participle of αγαθοποιεω (1 Peter 2:15), "doing good."And are not put in fear by any terror  (κα μη φοβουμενα μηδεμιαν πτοησιν). Free quotation from Proverbs 3:25, "and not fearing any terror" (cognate accusative of πτοησις, after φοβουμενα, present middle participle, late and rare word from πτοεω, to terrify, as in Luke 21:9, here only in N.T.). Perhaps Peter regards Sarah's falsehood as the yielding to a sudden terror (Hart). Hannah could also be named along with Sarah. The women somehow do not organize "daughters of Sarah" societies.
