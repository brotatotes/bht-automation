 That ye no longer should live  (εις το μηκετ βιωσα). Purpose clause with εις το (negative μη) and the first aorist (for the Attic second aorist βιωνα) active infinitive of βιοω, old verb, to spend a life (from βιος, course of life, Luke 8:14), here only in N.T.The rest of your time in the flesh  (τον επιλοιπον εν σαρκ χρονον). Accusative of time (χρονον, period of time). Επιλοιπον is old adjective (επι, λοιπος, remaining in addition), here only in N.T. But εις το here can be result (so that) as in Romans 1:20; Romans 4:18.
