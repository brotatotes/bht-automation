 Who shall give account  (ο αποδωσουσιν λογον). Future active indicative of αποδιδωμ. For this use with λογον (account) see Matthew 12:36; Luke 16:2; Acts 19:40; Hebrews 13:17. For the sudden use of the relative ο see Romans 3:8.To him that is ready to judge  (τω ετοιμως κρινοντ). Dative, "to the one readily judging," correct text, not ετοιμως εχοντ κρινα, "to the one ready to judge," which "softens the rugged original" (Hart). That is Christ apparently (1 Peter 1:13; 2 Corinthians 5:10), but the Father in 1 Peter 1:17.The quick and the dead  (ζωντας κα νεκρους). "Living and dead." Those living at the time and those already dead (1 Thessalonians 4:15).
