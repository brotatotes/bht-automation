 Was the gospel preached  (ευηγγελισθη). First aorist passive indicative of ευαγγελιζω. Impersonal use.Even to the dead  (κα νεκροις). Does Peter here mean preached to men after they are dead or to men once alive but dead now or when the judgment comes? There are those (Augustine, Luther, etc.) who take "dead" here in the spiritual sense (dead in trespasses and sins as in Colossians 2:13; Ephesians 2:1), but consider it "impossible" for Peter to use the same word in two senses so close together; but Jesus did it in the same sentence, as in the case of ψυχη (life) in Matthew 16:25. Bigg takes it to mean that all men who did not hear the gospel message in this life will hear it in the next before the final judgment.That they might be judged  (ινα κριθωσιν μεν). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of κρινω, to judge, whereas ζωσιν δε (by contrast) is the present active subjunctive of ζαω, to live. There is contrast also between κατα ανθρωπους (according to men) and κατα θεον (according to God).
