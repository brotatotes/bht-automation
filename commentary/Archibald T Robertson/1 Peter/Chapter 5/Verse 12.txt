 By Silvanus  (δια Σιλουανου). Probably this postscript (1 Peter 5:12-14) is in Peter's own handwriting, as Paul did (2 Thessalonians 3:17; Galatians 6:11-18). If so, Silvanus (Silas) was the amanuensis and the bearer of the Epistle.As I account him  (ως λογιζομα). Peter uses Paul's phrase (1 Corinthians 4:1; Romans 8:18) in giving approval to Paul's former companion (Acts 15:40).I have written  (εγραψα). Epistolary aorist applying to this Epistle as in 1 Corinthians 5:11 (not 1 Corinthians 5:9); 1 Corinthians 9:15; Galatians 6:11; Romans 15:15; Philemon 1:19; Philemon 1:21.Briefly  (δι' ολιγων). "By few words," as Peter looked at it, certainly not a long letter in fact. Cf. Hebrews 13:22.Testifying  (επιμαρτυρων). Present active participle of επιμαρτυρεω, to bear witness to, old compound, here alone in N.T., though the double compound συνεπιμαρτυρεω in Hebrews 2:4.That this is the true grace of God  (ταυτην εινα αληθη χαριν του θεου). Infinitive εινα in indirect assertion and accusative of general reference (ταυτην) and predicate accusative χαριν. Peter includes the whole of the Epistle by God's grace (1 Peter 1:10) and obedience to the truth (John 1:17; Galatians 2:5; Colossians 1:6).Stand ye fast therein  (εις ην στητε). "In which (grace) take your stand" (ingressive aorist active imperative of ιστημ).
