 Be subject  (οποταγητε). Second aorist passive imperative of υποτασσω.Unto the elder  (πρεσβυτεροις). Dative case. Here the antithesis between younger and elder shows that the word refers to age, not to office as in 1 Peter 5:1. See a like change in meaning in 1 Timothy 5:1; 1 Timothy 5:17.All  (παντες). All ages, sexes, classes.Gird yourselves with humility  (την ταπεινοφροσυνην εγκομβωσασθε). First aorist middle imperative of εγκομβοομα, late and rare verb (in Apollodorus, fourth cent. B.C.), here only in N.T., from εν and κομβος (knot, like the knot of a girdle). Εγκομβωμα was the white scarf or apron of slaves. It is quite probable that Peter here is thinking of what Jesus did (John 13:4) when he girded himself with a towel and taught the disciples, Peter in particular (John 13:9), the lesson of humility (John 13:15). Peter had at last learned the lesson (John 21:15-19).The proud  (υπερηφανοις). Dative plural of υπερηφανος (James 4:6; Romans 1:30) after αντιτασσετα (present middle indicative of αντιτασσω as in James 4:6 (quoted there as here from Proverbs 3:34).
