 Be watchful  (γρηγορησατε). First aorist active imperative of γρηγορεω, late present imperative from perfect εγρηγορα (to be awake) from εγειρω (to arouse), as in Matthew 24:42. For νηψατε see 1 Peter 1:13; 1 Peter 4:7.Your adversary  (ο αντιδικος υμων). Old word for opponent in a lawsuit (Matthew 5:25).The devil  (διαβολος). Slanderer. See on Matthew 4:1.As a roaring lion  (ως ωρυομενος λεων). But Jesus is also pictured as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (Revelation 5:5). But Satanroars  at the saints. Present middle participle ωρυομα, old verb, here only in N.T., to howl like a wolf, dog, or lion, of men to sing loud (Pindar). See Psalms 22:13.Whom he may devour  (καταπιειν). Second aorist active infinitive of καταπινω, to drink down. B does not have τινα, Aleph has τινα (somebody), "to devour some one," while A has interrogative τινα, "whom he may devour" (very rare idiom). But the devil's purpose is the ruin of men. He is a "peripatetic" (περιπατε) like the peripatetic philosophers who walked as they talked. Satan wants all of us and sifts us all (Luke 22:31).
