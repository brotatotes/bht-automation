 We give thanks  (ευχαριστουμεν). Late denominative verb ευχαριστεω from ευχαριστος (grateful) and that from ευ, well and χαριζομα, to show oneself kind. See χαρις in verse 1 Thessalonians 1:1. "The plural implies that all three missionaries prayed together" (Moffatt).Always  (παντοτε). Late word, rare in LXX. So with ευχαριστεω in 2 Thessalonians 1:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 1:4; Ephesians 5:20; Philippians 1:3. Moffatt takes it to mean "whenever Paul was at his prayers." Of course, he did not make audible prayer always, but he was always in the spirit of prayer, "a constant attitude" (Milligan), "in tune with the Infinite."For you all  (περ παντων υμων). Paul "encircled (περ, around) them all," including every one of them and the church as a whole. Distance lends enchantment to the memory of slight drawbacks. Paul is fond of this phrase "you all," particularly in Phil. (Philippians 1:3; Philippians 1:7).Making mention  (μνειαν ποιουμενο). Paul uses this very idiom in Romans 1:9; Ephesians 1:16; Philemon 1:4. Milligan cites a papyrus example of μνειαν ποιουμενο in prayer (B. Y. U. 652, 5). Did Paul have a prayer list of the Thessalonian disciples which he read over with Silas and Timothy?In  here is επι="in the time of our prayers." "Each time that they are engaged in prayers the writers mention the names of the converts" (Frame).
