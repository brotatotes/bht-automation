 Knowing  (ειδοτες). Second perfect active participle of οιδα (ειδον), a so-called causal participle=since we know, the third participle with the principal verb ευχαριστουμεν, the Greek being fond of the circumstantial participle and lengthening sentences thereby (Robertson, Grammar, P. 1128).Beloved by God  (ηγαπημενο υπο [του] θεου). Perfect passive participle of αγαπαω, the verb so common in the N.T. for the highest kind of love. Paul is not content with the use of αδελφο here (often in this Epistle as 1 Thessalonians 2:1; 1 Thessalonians 2:14; 1 Thessalonians 2:17; 1 Thessalonians 3:7; 1 Thessalonians 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:10), but adds this affectionate phrase nowhere else in the N.T. in this form (cf. Jude 1:3) though in Sirach 45:1 and on the Rosetta Stone. But in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 he quotes "beloved by the Lord" from Deuteronomy 33:12. The use of αδελφο for members of the same brotherhood can be derived from the Jewish custom (Acts 2:29; Acts 2:37) and the habit of Jesus (Matthew 12:48) and is amply illustrated in the papyri for burial clubs and other orders and guilds (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary).Your election  (την εκλογην υμων). That is the election of you by God. It is an old word from εκλεγομα used by Jesus of his choice of the twelve disciples (John 15:16) and by Paul of God's eternal selection (Ephesians 1:4). The word εκλογη is not in the LXX and only seven times in the N.T. and always of God's choice of men (Acts 9:15; 1 Thessalonians 1:4; Romans 9:11; Romans 11:5; Romans 11:7; Romans 11:58; 2 Peter 1:10). The divine εκλογη was manifested in the Christian qualities of verse 1 Thessalonians 1:3 (Moffatt).
