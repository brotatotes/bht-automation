 From you hath sounded forth  (αφ' υμων εξηχητα). Perfect passive indicative of εξηχεω, late compound verb (εξ, ηχοσ, ηχω, ηχη, our echo) to sound out of a trumpet or of thunder, to reverberate like our echo. Nowhere else in the N.T. So "from you" as a sounding board or radio transmitting station (to use a modern figure). It marks forcibly "both the clear and the persuasive nature of the λογος του Κυριου" (Ellicott). This phrase, the word of the Lord, may be subjective with the Lord as its author or objective with the Lord as the object. It is both. It is a graphic picture with a pardonable touch of hyperbole (Moffatt) for Thessalonica was a great commercial and political centre for disseminating the news of salvation (on the Egnation Way).But in every place  (αλλ' εν παντ τοπω). In contrast to Macedonia and Achaia. The sentence would naturally stop here, but Paul is dictating rapidly and earnestly and goes on.Your faith to God-ward  (η πιστις υμων η προς τον θεον). Literally,the faith of you that toward the God . The repeated article makes clear that their faith is now directed toward the true God and not toward the idols from which they had turned (verse 1 Thessalonians 1:10).Is gone forth  (εξεληλυθεν). Second perfect active indicative of old verb εξερχομα, to go out, state of completion like εξηχητα above.So that we need not to speak anything  (ωστε μη χρειαν εχειν ημας λαλειν τ). Hωστε with the infinitive for actual result as in verse 1 Thessalonians 1:7. No vital distinction between λαλειν (originally to chatter as of birds) and λεγειν, both being used in the Koine for speaking and preaching (in the N.T.).
