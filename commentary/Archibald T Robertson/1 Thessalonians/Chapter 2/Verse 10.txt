 How holily and righteously and unblameably  (ως οσιως κα δικαιως κα αμεμπτως). Paul calls the Thessalonians and God as witnesses (μαρτυρες) to his life toward you the believers (υμιν τοις πιστευουσιν) dative of personal interest. He employs three common adverbs that show how holily toward God and how righteously toward men so that they did not blame him and his associates in either respect. So there is a reason for each adverb. All this argues that Paul spent a considerable time in Thessalonica, more than the three sabbaths mentioned by Luke. The pastor ought to live so that his life will bear close inspection.
