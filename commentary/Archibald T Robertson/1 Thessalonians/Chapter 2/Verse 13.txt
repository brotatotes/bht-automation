 And for this cause we also  (κα δια τουτο κα ημεις). Note κα twice. We as well as you are grateful for the way the gospel was received in Thessalonica.Without ceasing  (αδιαλειπτως). Late adverb for which see on 1 Thessalonians 1:2 and for ευχαριστουμεν see on 1 Thessalonians 1:2.The word of the message  (λογον ακοης). Literally,the word of  hearing, as in Sir. 42:1 and Hebrews 4:2 ο λογος της ακοης, the word marked by hearing (genitive case), the word which you heard. Here with του θεου (of God) added as a second descriptive genitive which Paul expands and justifies.Ye received it so  (παραλαβοντες) andaccepted or welcomed it  (εδεξασθε) so,not as the word of men  (ου λογου ανθρωπων),but as the word of God  (αλλα λογον θεου),as it is in truth  (καθως αληθως εστιν). This last clause is literally,as it truly is . Paul had not a doubt that he was proclaiming God's message. Should any preacher preach his doubts if he has any? God's message can be found and Paul found it.Worketh in you  (ενεργειτα εν υμιν). Perhaps middle voice of ενεργεω (εν, εργον, work) late verb, not in ancient Greek or LXX, but in papyri and late writers (Polybius, etc.) and in N.T. only by Paul and James. If it is passive, as Milligan thinks, it means "is set in operation," as Polybius has it. The idea then is that the word of God is set in operation in you that believe.
