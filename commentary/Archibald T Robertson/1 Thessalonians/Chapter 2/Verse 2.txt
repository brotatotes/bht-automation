 But having suffered before  (αλλα προπαθοντες). Strong adversative αλλα, antithesis to κενη. Appeal to his personal experiences in Thessalonica known to them ( as ye know , καθως οιδατε). Second aorist active participle of προπασχω, old compound verb, but here alone in the N.T. The force of προ- (before) is carried over to the next verb. The participle may be regarded as temporal (Ellicott) or concessive (Moffatt).And been shamefully entreated in Philippi  (κα υβρισθεντες εν Φιλιπποις). First aorist passive participle of υβριζω, old verb, to treat insolently. "More than the bodily suffering it was the personal indignity that had been offered to him as a Roman citizen" (Milligan), for which account see Acts 16:16-40, an interesting example of how Acts and the Epistles throw light on each other. Luke tells how Paul resented the treatment accorded to him as a Roman citizen and here Paul shows that the memory still rankled in his bosom.We waxed bold in our God  (επαρρησιασαμεθα εν τω θεω ημων). Ingressive first aorist middle of παρρησιαζομα, old deponent verb from παρρησια (full story, παν-, ρησια). In his reply to Festus (Acts 26:26) Paul uses παρρησιαζομενος λαλω,being bold I speak , while here he haswe waxed bold to speak  (επαρρησιασαμεθα λαλησα). The insult in Philippi did not close Paul's mouth, but had precisely the opposite effect "in our God." It was not wild fanaticism, but determined courage and confidence in God that spurred Paul to still greater boldness in Thessalonica,unto you  (προς υμας), be the consequences what they might,the gospel of God in much conflict , (το ευαγγελιον του θεου εν πολλω αγων). This figure of the athletic games (αγων) may refer to outward conflict like Philippians 1:30 or inward anxiety (Colossians 2:1). He had both in Thessalonica.
