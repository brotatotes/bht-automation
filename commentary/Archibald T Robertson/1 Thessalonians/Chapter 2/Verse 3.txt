 Exhortation  (παρακλησις). Persuasive discourse, calling to one's side, for admonition, encouragement, or comfort.Not of error  (ουκ εκ πλανης). This word is same as πλαναω, to lead astray (2 Timothy 3:13) like Latin errare. Passive idea oferror  here rather than deceit. That is seen innor in guile  (ουδε εν δολω) from δελω, to catch with bait. Paul is keenly sensitive against charges against the correctness of his message and the purity of his life.Nor of uncleanness  (ουδε εξ ακαθαρσιας). "This disclaimer, startling as it may seem, was not unneeded amidst the impurities consecrated by the religions of the day" (Lightfoot). There was no necessary connection in the popular mind between religion and morals. The ecstatic initiations in some of the popular religions were grossly sensual.
