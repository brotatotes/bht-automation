 Even so, being affectionately desirous of you  (ουτως ομειρομενο υμων). Clearly the correct text rather than ιμειρομενο from ιμειρω, old verb to long for. But the verb ομειρομα (Westcott and Hort om., smooth breathing) occurs nowhere else except MSS. in Job 3:21; Psalms 62:2 (Symmachus) and the Lycaonian sepulchral inscription (4th cent. A.D.) about the sorrowing parents ομειρομενο περ παιδος,greatly desiring their son  (Moulton and Milligan, Vocabulary). Moulton suggests that it comes from a root σμερ, remember, and that ο- is a derelict preposition ο like ο-δυρομαι, ο-κελλω, ω-κεανος. Wohlenberg (Zahn, Kommentar) calls the word "a term of endearment," "derived from the language of the nursery" (Milligan).We were well pleased  (ηυδοκουμεν). Imperfect active of ευδοκεω, common verb in later Greek and in N.T. (see on Matthew 3:17), picturing Paul's idea of their attitude while in Thessalonica. Paul often has it with the infinitive as here.To impart  (μεταδουνα). Second aorist active infinitive of μεταδιδωμ, old verb to share with (see on Luke 3:11). Possible zeugma withsouls  (ψυχας), though Lightfoot renders "lives." Paul and his associates held nothing back.Because ye were become very dear to us  (διοτ αγαπητο ημιν εγενηθητε). Note διοτ (double cause, δια, οτ, for that), use of γινομα again for become, and dative ημιν with verbal αγαπητο, beloved and so dear. A beautiful picture of the growth of Paul's affection for them as should be true with every pastor.
