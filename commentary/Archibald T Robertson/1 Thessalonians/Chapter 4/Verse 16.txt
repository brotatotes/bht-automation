 With a shout  (εν κελευσματ). Note this so-called instrumental use of εν. Old word, here only in N.T., from κελευω, to order, command (military command). Christ will come as Conqueror.With the voice of the archangel  (εν φωνη αρχαγγελου). Further explanation of κελευσματ (command). The only archangel mentioned in N.T. is Michael in Jude 1:9.

See same figure in 1 Corinthians 15:52.The dead in Christ shall rise first  (ο νεκρο εν Χριστω αναστησοντα πρωτον).First  here refers plainly to the fact that, so far from the dead in Christ having no share in the Parousia, they will rise before those still alive are changed.
