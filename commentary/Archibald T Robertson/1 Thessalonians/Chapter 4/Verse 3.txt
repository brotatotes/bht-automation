 Your sanctification  (ο αγιασμος υμων). Found only in the Greek Bible and ecclesiastical writers from αγιαζω and both to take the place of the old words αγιζω, αγισμος with their technical ideas of consecration to a god or goddess that did not include holiness in life. So Paul makes a sharp and pointed stand here for the Christian idea of sanctification as being "the will of God" (apposition) and as further explained by the epexegetic infinitivethat ye abstain from fornication  (απεχεσθα υμας απο της πορνειας). Pagan religion did not demand sexual purity of its devotees, the gods and goddesses being grossly immoral. Priestesses were in the temples for the service of the men who came.
