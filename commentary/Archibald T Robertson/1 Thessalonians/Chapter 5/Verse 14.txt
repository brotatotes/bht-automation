 Admonish the disorderly  (νουθετειτε τους ατακτους). Put sense into the unruly mob who break ranks (α privative and τακτος, verbal adjective of τασσω, to keep military order). Recall the idlers from the market-place used against Paul (Acts 17:5). This is a challenging task for any leader.Encourage the fainthearted  (παραμυθεισθε τους ολιγοψυχους). Old verb to encourage or console as in John 11:31, though not so common in N.T. as παρακαλεω, the compound adjective (ολιγος, little or small, ψυχη, soul), small-souled, little-souled, late word in LXX. The verb ολιγοψυχεω occurs in the papyri. Local conditions often cause some to lose heart and wish to drop out, be quitters. These must be held in line.Support the weak  (αντεχεσθε των ασθενων). Middle voice with genitive of αντεχω, old verb, in N.T. only in middle, to cling to, to hold on to (with genitive). The weak are those tempted to sin (immorality, for instance).Be long-suffering toward all  (μακροθυμειτε προς παντας). These disorderly elements try the patience of the leaders. Hold out with them. What a wonderful ideal Paul here holds up for church leaders!
