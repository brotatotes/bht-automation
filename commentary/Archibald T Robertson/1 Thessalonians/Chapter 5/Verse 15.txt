 See to it that no one render unto any one evil for evil  (ορατε μη τις κακον αντ κακου αποδω). Note μη with the aorist subjunctive (negative purpose) αποδω from αποδιδωμ, to give back. Retaliation, condemned by Jesus (Matthew 5:38-42) and by Paul in Romans 12:17, usually takes the form of "evil for evil," rather than "good for good" (καλον αντ καλου). Note idea of exchange in αντ.Follow after  (διωκετε). Keep up the chase (διωκω) after the good.
