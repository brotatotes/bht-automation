 Despise not prophesyings  (προφητειας μη εξουθενειτε). Same construction, stop counting as nothing (εξουθενεω, ουθεν=ουδεν), late form in LXX. Plutarch has εξουδενιζω. Plural form προφητειας (accusative). Word meansforth-telling  (προ-φημ) rather thanfore-telling  and is the chief of the spiritual gifts (1 Thessalonians 5:1) and evidently depreciated in Thessalonica as in Corinth later.
