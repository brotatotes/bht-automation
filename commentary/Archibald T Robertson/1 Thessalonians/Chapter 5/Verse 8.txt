 Putting on the breastplate of faith and love  (ενδυσαμενο θωρακα πιστεως κα αγαπης). First aorist (ingressive) middle participle of ενδυω. The same figure of breastplate in Ephesians 6:14, only there "of righteousness." The idea of watchfulness brings the figure of a sentry on guard and armed to Paul's mind as in Romans 13:12 "the weapons of light." The word θωραξ (breastplate) is common in the LXX.For a helmet, the hope of salvation  (περικεφαλαιαν ελπιδα σωτηριας). Same figure in Ephesians 6:17 and both like Isaiah 59:17. Late word meaning around (περ) the head (κεφαλη) and in Polybius, LXX, and in the papyri. Σωτηριας is objective genitive.
