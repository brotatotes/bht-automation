 Abounded exceedingly  (υπερεπλεονασεν). Aorist active indicative of the late and rare (Song of Solomon 5:19 and in Herond.) compound υπερπλεοναζω (here alone in N.T.), in later ecclesiastical writers. The simplex πλεοναζω Paul used in Romans 5:20; Romans 6:1 and the kindred υπερεπερισσευσεν used also with η χαρις. Paul is fond of compounds with υπερ. For "faith in Christ Jesus" see Galatians 3:26, for "faith and love in Christ Jesus" as here, see 2 Timothy 1:13.
