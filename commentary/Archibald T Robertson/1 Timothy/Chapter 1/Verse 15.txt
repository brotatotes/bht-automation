 Faithful is the saying  (πιστος ο λογος). Five times in the Pastorals (1 Timothy 1:15; 1 Timothy 3:1; 1 Timothy 4:9; Titus 3:8; 2 Timothy 2:11). It will pay to note carefully πιστισ, πιστευω, πιστος. Same use of πιστος (trustworthy) applied to λογος in Titus 1:9; Revelation 21:5; Revelation 22:6. Here and probably in 2 Timothy 2:11 a definite saying seems to be referred to, possibly a quotation (οτ) of a current saying quite like the Johannine type of teaching. This very phrase (Christ coming into the world) occurs in John 9:37; John 11:27; John 16:28; John 18:37. Paul, of course, had no access to the Johannine writings, but such "sayings" were current among the disciples. There is no formal quotation, but "the whole phrase implies a knowledge of Synoptic and Johannine language" (Lock) as in Luke 5:32; John 12:47.Acceptation  (αποδοχης). Genitive case with αξιος (worthy of). Late word (Polybius, Diod., Jos.) in N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 4:9.Chief  (πρωτος). Not ην (I was), but ειμ (I am). "It is not easy to think of any one but St. Paul as penning these words" (White). In 1 Corinthians 15:9 he had called himself "the least of the apostles" (ελαχιστος των αποστολων). In Ephesians 3:8 he refers to himself as "the less than the least of all saints" (τω ελαχιστοτερω παντων αγιων). On occasion Paul would defend himself as on a par with the twelve apostles (Galatians 2:6-10) and superior to the Judaizers (2 Corinthians 11:5; 2 Corinthians 12:11). It is not mock humility here, but sincere appreciation of the sins of his life (cf. Romans 7:24) as a persecutor of the church of God (Galatians 1:13), of men and even women (Acts 22:4; Acts 26:11). He had sad memories of those days.
