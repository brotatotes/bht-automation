 I permit not  (ουκ επιτρεπω). Old word επιτρεπω, to permit, to allow (1 Corinthians 16:7). Paul speaks authoritatively.To teach  (διδασκειν). In the public meeting clearly. And yet all modern Christians allow women to teach Sunday school classes. One feels somehow that something is not expressed here to make it all clear.Nor to have dominion over a man  (ουδε αυθεντειν ανδρος). The word αυθεντεω is now cleared up by Kretschmer (Glotta, 1912, pp. 289ff.) and by Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary. See also Nageli, Der Wortschatz des Apostels Paulus and Deissmann, Light, etc., pp. 88f. Αυτοδικεω was the literary word for playing the master while αυθεντεω was the vernacular term. It comes from αυτ-εντες, a self-doer, a master, autocrat. It occurs in the papyri (substantive αυθεντης, master, verb αυθεντεω, to domineer, adjective αυθεντικος, authoritative, "authentic"). Modern Greek has αφεντες = Effendi = "Mr."
