 Faithful is the saying  (πιστος ο λογος). Here the phrase points to the preceding words (not like 1 Timothy 1:15) and should close the preceding paragraph.If a man seeketh  (ε τις ορεγετα). Condition of first class, assumed as true. Present middle indicative of ορεγω, old verb to reach out after something, governing the genitive. In N.T. only here, 1 Timothy 6:10; Hebrews 11:16.The office of a bishop  (επισκοπης). Genitive case after ορεγετα. Late and rare word outside of LXX and N.T. (in a Lycaonian inscription). From επισκοπεω and means "over-seership" as in Acts 1:20.
