 Women  (γυναικας). Accusative with δε εινα understood (οσαυτως, likewise) as in verse 1 Timothy 3:8. Apparently "women as deacons" (Romans 16:1 about Phoebe) and not women in general or just "wives of deacons." See Pliny (Ep. X. 97) ministrae.Not slanderers  (μη διαβολους). Original meaning of διαβολος (from διαβαλλω, Luke 16:1), the devil being the chief slanderer (Ephesians 6:11). "She-devils" in reality (Titus 2:3). "While men are more prone to be διλογους, double-tongued, women are more prone than men to be slanderers" (White).Faithful in all things  (πιστας εν πασιν). Perhaps as almoners (Ellicott) the deaconesses had special temptations.
