 From them that are without  (απο των εξωθεν). "From the outside (of the church) ones." Paul's care for the witness of outsiders is seen in 1 Thessalonians 4:12; 1 Corinthians 10:32; Colossians 4:5. There are, of course, two sides to this matter.Reproach  (ονειδισμον). Late word from ονειδιζω. See Romans 15:3.The snare of the devil  (παγιδα του διαβολου). Here subjective genitive, snare set by the devil. Παγις, old word from πηγνυμ, to make fast. So a snare for birds (Luke 21:35), any sudden trap (Romans 11:9), of sin (1 Timothy 6:9), of the devil (1 Timothy 3:7; 2 Timothy 2:26). Ancients used it of the snares of love. The devil sets special snares for preachers (conceit verse 1 Timothy 3:6, money 1 Timothy 6:9, women, ambition).
