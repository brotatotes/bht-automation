 Be diligent in these things  (ταυτα μελετα). Old verb from μελετη (care, practice), present active imperative, "keep on practising these things." In N.T. only here and Acts 4:25.Give thyself wholly to them  (εν τουτοις ισθ). Present imperative second person singular of ειμ, "keep on in these things." Note five uses of εν in verse 1 Timothy 4:12 and three datives in verse 1 Timothy 4:14. Plutarch (Pomp. 656 B) says Caesar was εν τουτοις ("in these things"). It is like our "up to his ears" in work (ιν μεδιας ρες) and sticking to his task.Thy progress  (σου η προκοπη). Koine word from προκοπτω, to cut forward, to blaze the way, in N.T. only here and Philippians 1:12; Philippians 1:25. Paul's concern (purpose, ινα and present subjunctive η of ειμ) is that Timothy's "progress" may be "manifest to all." It is inspiring to see a young preacher grow for then the church will grow with him.
