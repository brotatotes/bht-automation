 If she hath brought up children  (ε ετεκνοτροφησεν). Condition of first class. Late and rare word (Aristotle, Epictetus), first aorist active indicative of τεκνοτροφεω (τεκνοτροφος, from τεκνον, τρεφω), here only in N.T. Qualification for her work as leader.If she hath used hospitality to strangers  (ε εξενοδοχησεν). First aorist again and same condition. Late form (Dio Cassius) of old verb ξενοδοκεω (Herodotus), to welcome strangers (ξενους δεχομα). Only here in N.T. Hospitality another qualification for such leadership (1 Timothy 3:2).If she hath washed the saints' feet  (ε αγιων ποδας ενιψεν). Same condition and tense of νιπτω (old form νιζω), common in N.T. (John 13:5). Proof of her hospitality, not of its being a church ordinance.If she hath relieved the afflicted  (ε θλιβομενοις επηρκεσεν). Same condition and tense of επαρκεω, to give sufficient aid, old word, in N.T. only here and verse 1 Timothy 5:16. Experience that qualified her for eleemosynary work.If she hath diligently followed  (ε επηκολουθησεν). Same condition and tense of επακολουθεω, old verb, to follow close upon (επ). So here, verse 1 Timothy 5:24; 1 Peter 2:21. In a word such a widow must show her qualifications for leadership as with bishops and deacons.
