 The elders that rule well  (ο καλως προεστωτες πρεσβυτερο). See verse 1 Timothy 5:1 for ordinary sense of πρεσβυτερος for "older man." But here of position in same sense as επισκοπος (1 Timothy 3:2) as in Titus 1:5 = επισκοπος in verse 1 Timothy 5:7. Cf. Luke's use of πρεσβυτερος (Acts 20:17) = Paul's επισκοπους (Acts 20:28). Προεστωτες is second perfect active participle of προιστημ (intransitive use) for which see 1 Timothy 3:4.Let be counted worthy  (αξιουσθωσαν). Present passive imperative of αξιοω, to deem worthy (2 Thessalonians 1:11). With genitive case here.Of double honour  (διπλης τιμης). Old and common contract adjective (διπλοος, two-fold, in opposition to απλοος, single fold). But why "of double honour"? See 1 Timothy 6:1 for "of all honour." White suggests "remuneration" rather than "honour" for τιμης (a common use for price or pay). Liddon proposes "honorarium" (both honour and pay and so "double"). Wetstein gives numerous examples of soldiers receiving double pay for unusual services. Some suggest twice the pay given the enrolled widows.Especially those who labour in word and teaching  (μαλιστα ο κοπιωντες εν λογω κα διδασκαλια). Either those who work hard or toil (usual meaning of κοπιαω, 2 Timothy 2:6) in preaching and teaching (most probable meaning. See verse 1 Timothy 5:18) or those who teach and preach and not merely preside (a doubtful distinction in "elders" at this time). See Titus 1:8. See both κοπιαω and προισταμα used for same men (elders) in 1 Thessalonians 5:12 and the use of κοπιαω in 1 Corinthians 15:10; 1 Corinthians 16:16.
