 Evident  (προδηλο). "Openly plain," "plain before all." Old word, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 7:24.Going before unto judgment  (προαγουσα εις κρισιν). See 1 Timothy 1:18 for προαγω. The sins are so plain that they receive instant condemnation.And some men also they follow after  (τισιν δε κα επακολουθουσιν). Associative instrumental case τισιν with επακολουθουσιν for which verb see verse 1 Timothy 5:10, "dog their steps" (Parry) like 1 Peter 2:21, not clearly manifest at first, but come out plainly at last. How true that is of secret sins.
