 Such as are otherwise  (τα αλλως εχοντα). "Those (deeds, εργα) which have it otherwise." That is good deeds not clearly manifest.Cannot be hid  (κρυβηνα ου δυναντα). Second aorist passive infinitive of κρυπτω. There is comfort here for modest preachers and other believers whose good deeds are not known and not blazoned forth. They will come out in the end. See Matthew 5:14-16.
