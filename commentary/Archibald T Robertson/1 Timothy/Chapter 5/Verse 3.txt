 That are widows indeed  (τας οντως χηρας). For οντως (actually, really), see Luke 23:47; 1 Corinthians 14:25; and verse 1 Timothy 5:5. For widows (χηρα) see Mark 12:40; Mark 12:42; Acts 6:1; 1 Corinthians 7:8. Parry notes that in verses 1 Timothy 5:3-8 Paul discusses widows who are in distress and 1 Timothy 5:9-16 those who are in the employment of the local church for certain work. Evidently, as in Acts 1 Timothy 6:1-6, so here in Ephesus there had arisen some trouble over the widows in the church. Both for individual cases of need and as a class Timothy is to show proper respect (τιμα, keep on honouring) the widows.
