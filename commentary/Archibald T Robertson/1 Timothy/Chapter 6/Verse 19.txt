 Laying up in store  (αποθησαυριζοντας). Late literary word (απο and θησαυριζω), only here in N.T. Same paradox as in Matthew 6:19, "laying up in store" by giving it away.Which is life indeed  (της οντως ζωης). See 1 Timothy 5:3 for οντως. This life is merely the shadow of the eternal reality to come.
