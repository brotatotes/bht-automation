 Than what ye read  (αλλ' η α αναγινωσκετε). Note comparative conjunction η (than) after αλλ' and that after αλλα (other things, same word in reality), "other than." Read in Greek (αναγινωσκω) is knowing again, recognizing. See on Acts 8:30.Or even acknowledge  (η κα επιγινωσκετε). Paul is fond of such a play on words (αναγινωσκετε, επιγινωσκετε) or paronomasia. Does he mean "read between the lines," as we say, by the use of επ (additional knowledge)?Unto the end  (εως τελους). The report of Titus showed that the majority now at last understood Paul. He hopes that it will last (1 Corinthians 1:8).
