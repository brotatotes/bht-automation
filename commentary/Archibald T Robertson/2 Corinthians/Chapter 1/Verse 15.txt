 Confidence  (πεποιθησε). This late word (LXX Philo, Josephus) is condemned by the Atticists, but Paul uses it a half dozen times (2 Corinthians 3:4 also).I was minded to come  (εβουλομην ελθειν). Imperfect, I was wishing to come, picturing his former state of mind.Before unto you  (προτερον προς υμας). This was his former plan (προτερον) while in Ephesus to go to Achaia directly from Ephesus. This he confesses in verse 2 Corinthians 1:16 "and by you to pass into Macedonia."That ye might have a second benefit  (ινα δευτεραν χαριν σχητε). Or second "joy" if we accept χαραν with Westcott and Hort. This would be a real second blessing (or joy) if they should have two visits from Paul.
