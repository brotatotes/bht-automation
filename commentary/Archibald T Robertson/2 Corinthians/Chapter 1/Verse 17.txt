 Did I shew fickleness?  (μητ αρα τη ελαφριαι?). An indignant negative answer is called for by μητ. The instrumental case of ελαφρια is regular after εχρησαμην from χραομα, to use. Ελαφρια is a late word for levity from the old adjective, ελαφρος, light, agile (2 Corinthians 10:17; Matthew 11:30). Here only in N.T.Purpose  (βουλευομα). Paul raises the question of fickleness about any of his plans.Yea yea  (Να να)--nay nay  (ου ου). See a similar repetition in Matthew 5:37. It is plain in James 5:12 where "the yea" is "yea" and "the nay" is "nay." That seems to be Paul's meaning here, "that the Yea may be yea and the Nay may be nay."
