 Concerning our affliction  (υπερ της θλιψεως ημων). Manuscripts read also περ for in the Koine υπερ (over) often has the idea of περ (around). Paul has laid down his philosophy of afflictions and now he cites a specific illustration in his own recent experience.In Asia  (εν Ασια). Probably in Ephesus, but what it was we do not know whether sickness or peril. We do know that the disciples and the Asiarchs would not allow Paul to face the mob in the amphitheatre gathered by Demetrius (Acts 20:30). In Romans 16:4 Paul says that Prisca and Aquila laid down their necks for him, risked their very lives for him. It may have been a later plot to kill Paul that hastened his departure from Ephesus (Acts 20:1). He had a trial so great that "we were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power" (καθ' υπερβολην υπερ δυναμιν εβαρηθημεν). Old verb from βαρος, weight, βαρυς, weighty. First aorist passive indicative. See on 1 Corinthians 12:31 for καθ' υπερβολην (cf. our hyperbole). It was beyond Paul's power to endure if left to himself.Insomuch that we despaired even of life  (ωστε εξαπορηθηνα ημας κα του ζηιν). Usual clause of result with ωστε and the infinitive. First aorist passive infinitive εξαπορηθηνα, late compound for utter despair (perfective use of εξ and at a complete loss, α privative and πορος, way). There seemed no way out.Of life  (του ζηιν). Ablative case of the articular infinitive, of living.
