 Now I Paul myself  (Αυτος δε εγω Παυλος). Cf. Galatians 5:2. Paul now turns to the third part of the epistle in chapters 2 Corinthians 10:10-13 in which he vigorously defends himself against the accusations of the stubborn minority of Judaizers in Corinth. Great ministers of Christ through the ages have had to pass through fiery trials like these. Paul has shown the way for us all. He speaks of himself now plainly, but under compulsion, as is clear. It may be that at this point he took the pen from the amanuensis and wrote himself as in Galatians 6:11.By the meekness and gentleness of Christ  (δια τες πραυτητος κα επιεικιας του Χριστου). This appeal shows (Plummer) that Paul had spoken to the Corinthians about the character of Christ. Jesus claimed meekness for himself (Matthew 11:29) and felicitated the meek (Matthew 5:5) and he exemplified it abundantly (Luke 23:34). See on Matthew 5:15; 1 Corinthians 4:21 for this great word that has worn thin with us. Plutarch combines πραυτης with επιεικια as Paul does here. Matthew Arnold suggested "sweet reasonableness" for επιεικεια in Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch. It is in the N.T. only here and Acts 24:4 (το επιεικες in Philippians 4:5). In Greek Ethics the equitable man was called επιεικης, a man who does not press for the last farthing of his rights (Bernard).Lowly among you  (ταπεινος εν υμιν). The bad use of ταπεινος, the old use, but here alone in N.T. in that meaning. Socrates and Aristotle used it for littleness of soul. Probably Paul here is quoting one of the sneers of his traducers in Corinth about his humble conduct while with them (1 Corinthians 2:23; 2 Corinthians 7:6) and his boldness (απων θαρρω) when away (1 Corinthians 7:16). "It was easy to satirize and misrepresent a depression of spirits, a humility of demeanour, which were either the direct results of some bodily affliction, or which the consciousness of this affliction had rendered habitual" (Farrar). The words stung Paul to the quick.
