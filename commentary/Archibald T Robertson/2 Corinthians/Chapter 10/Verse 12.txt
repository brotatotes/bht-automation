 To number or compare ourselves  (ενκρινα η συνκρινα). Paronomasia here, play on the two words. Ενκρινα is first aorist active infinitive of old verb, but here only in N.T., to judge among, to judge one as worthy to be numbered among as here. The second verb συνκρινα (first aorist active infinitive of συνκρινω, old verb, in N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 2:13) originally meant to combine as in 1 Corinthians 2:13 (which see), but here it has the sense of "compare" not found in the old Greek. The papyri use it to mean to decide. Plummer suggests "to pair and compare" for the play on the words here.Measuring themselves by themselves  (εν εαυτοις εαυτους μετρουντες). Or "in themselves." Keenest sarcasm. Setting themselves up as the standards of orthodoxy these Judaizers always measure up to the standard while Paul falls short.Comparing themselves with themselves  (συνκρινοντες εαυτους εαυτοις). Associate instrumental case εαυτοις after συνκρινοντες (verb just explained). Paul is not keen to fall into the trap set for him.Are without understanding  (ου συνιασιν). The regular form for present active indicative third plural of συνιημ, to comprehend, to grasp. Some MSS. have the late form συνιουσιν (omega form συνιω). It is a hard thing to see, but it is true. These men do not see their own picture so obvious to others (Ephesians 5:17; 1 Timothy 1:7). Cf. Mark 8:17.
