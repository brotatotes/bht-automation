 Casting down imaginations  (λογισμους καθαιρουντες). The same military figure (καθαιρεσις) and the present active participle agreeing with στρατευομεθα in verse 2 Corinthians 10:3 (verse 2 Corinthians 10:4 a parenthesis). The reasonings or imaginations (λογισμους, old word from λογιζομα, to reckon, only here in N.T. and Romans 2:15) are treated as forts or citadels to be conquered.Every high thing that is exalted  (παν υψωμα επαιρομενον). Same metaphor. Hυψωμα from υψοω is late Koine word (in LXX, Plutarch, Philo, papyri) for height and that figure carried on by επαιρομενον. Paul aims to pull down the top-most perch of audacity in their reasonings against the knowledge of God. We need Paul's skill and courage today.Bringing every thought into captivity  (αιχμαλωτιζοντες παν νοημα). Present active participle of αιχμαλωτιζω, common Koine verb from αιχμαλωτος, captive in war (αιχμη, spear, αλωτος verbal of αλισκομα, to be taken). See on Luke 21:24. Paul is the most daring of thinkers, but he lays all his thoughts at the feet of Jesus. For νοημα (device) see on 2 Corinthians 2:11.To the obedience of Christ  (εις την υπακοην του Χριστου). Objective genitive, "to the obedience unto Christ." That is Paul's conception of intellectual liberty, freedom in Christ. Deissmann (St. Paul, p. 141) calls this "the mystic genitive."
