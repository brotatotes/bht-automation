 Besides those things that are without  (χωρις των παρεκτος). Probably, "apart from those things beside these just mentioned." Surely no man ever found glory in such a peck of troubles as Paul has here recounted. His list should shame us all today who are disposed to find fault with our lot.That which presseth upon me daily  (η επιστασις μο η καθ' ημεραν). For this vivid word επιστασις see Acts 24:12, the only other place in the N.T. where it occurs. It is like the rush of a mob upon Paul.Anxiety for all the churches  (η μεριμνα πασων των εκκλησιων). Objective genitive after μεριμνα (distractions in different directions, from μεριζω) for which word see on Matthew 13:22. Paul had the shepherd heart. As apostle to the Gentiles he had founded most of these churches.
