 Through a window  (δια θυριδος). For this late word see on Acts 20:9, the only N.T. example.Was I let down  (εχαλασθην). First aorist passive of χαλαω, the very word used by Luke in Acts 9:25.In a basket  (εν σαργανη). Old word for rope basket whereas Luke (Acts 9:25) has εν σφυριδ (the word for the feeding of the 4,000 while κοφινος is the one for the 5,000). This was a humiliating experience for Paul in this oldest city of the world whither he had started as a conqueror over the despised Christians.
