 Another Jesus  (αλλον Ιησουν). Not necessarily a different Jesus, but any other "Jesus" is a rival and so wrong. That would deny the identity.A different spirit  (πνευμα ετερον). This is the obvious meaning of ετερον in distinction from αλλον as seen in Acts 4:12; Galatians 1:6. But this distinction in nature or kind is not always to be insisted on.A different gospel  (ευαγγελιον ετερον). Similar use of ετερον.Ye do well to bear with him  (καλως ανεχεσθε). Ironical turn again. "Well do you hold yourselves back from him" (the coming one, whoever he is). Some MSS. have the imperfect ανειχεσθε (did bear with).
