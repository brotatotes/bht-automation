 I must needs glory  (καυχασθα δε). This is the reading of B L Latin Syriac, but Aleph D Bohairic have δε while K M read δη. The first is probably correct. He must go on with the glorying already begun, foolish as it is, though it is not expedient (ου συμφερον).Visions  (οπτασιας). Late word from οπταζω. See on Luke 1:22; Acts 26:19.Revelations of the Lord  (αποκαλυψεις Κυριου). Unveilings (from αποκαλυπτω as in Revelation 1:1). See on 2 Thessalonians 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:7; 1 Corinthians 14:26. Paul had both repeated visions of Christ (Acts 9:3; Acts 16:9; Acts 18:9; Acts 22:17; Acts 27:23) and revelations. He claimed to speak by direct revelation (1 Corinthians 11:23; 1 Corinthians 15:3; Galatians 1:12; Ephesians 3:3, etc.).
