 Wherefore I take pleasure  (διο ευδοκω). For this noble word see on Matthew 3:17; 2 Corinthians 5:8. The enemies of Paul will have a hard time now in making Paul unhappy by persecutions even unto death (Philippians 1:20-26). He is not courting martyrdom, but he does not fear it or anything that is "for Christ's sake" (υπερ Χριστου).For when  (οταν γαρ). "For whenever," indefinite time.Then I am strong  (τοτε δυνατος ειμ). At that very time, but not in myself, but in the fresh access of power from Christ for the emergency.
