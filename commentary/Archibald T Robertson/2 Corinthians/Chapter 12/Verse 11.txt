 I am become foolish  (γεγονα αφρων). Perfect active indicative of γινομα. In spite of what he said in verse 2 Corinthians 12:6 that he would not be foolish if he gloried in the other Paul. But he feels that he has dropped back to the mood of 2 Corinthians 11:1; 2 Corinthians 11:16. He has been swept on by the memory of the ecstasy.For I ought to have been commended by you  (εγω γαρ ωφειλον υφ' υμων συνιστασθα). Explanation of "ye compelled me." Imperfect active ωφειλον of οφειλω, to be under obligation, and the tense here expresses an unfulfilled obligation about the present. But συνιστασθα is present passive infinitive, not aorist or perfect passive. He literally means, "I ought now to be commended by you" instead of having to glorify myself. He repeats his boast already made (2 Corinthians 11:5), that he is no whit behind "the super-extra apostles" (the Judaizers), "though I am nothing" (ε κα ουδεν ειμ). Even boasting himself against those false apostles causes a reaction of feeling that he has to express (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:9; 1 Timothy 1:15).
