 Lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would  (μη πως ελθων ουχ οιους θελω ευρω υμας). An idiomatic construction after the verb of fearing (φοβουμα) with μη πως as the conjunction and with ουχ as the negative of the verb ευρω (second aorist active subjunctive of ευρισκω), μη the conjunction, ουχ the negative. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 995.And I be found  (καγω ευρεθω). Same construction with first aorist passive subjunctive.Such as ye would not  (οιον ου θελετε). Neat change in voice just before and position of the negative here.Lest by any means  (μη πως). Still further negative purpose by repeating the conjunction. With graphic pen pictures Paul describes what had been going on against him during his long absence.Backbitings  (καταλαλια). Late and rare word. In N.T. only here and 1 Peter 2:1. If it only existed nowhere else!Whisperings  (ψιθυρισμο). Late word from ψιθυριζω, to whisper into one's ear. An onomatopoetic word for the sibilant murmur of a snake charmer (Ecclesiastes 10:11). Only here in N.T.Swellings  (φυσιωσεις). From φυσιοω, to swell up, late word only here and in ecclesiastical writers. Did Paul make up the word for the occasion? See on 1 Corinthians 4:6 for verb.Tumults  (ακαταστασια). See on 2 Corinthians 6:5.
