 Into Paradise  (εις παραδεισον). See on Luke 23:43 for this interesting word. Paul apparently uses paradise as the equivalent of the third heaven in verse 2 Corinthians 12:2. Some Jews (Book of the Secrets of Enoch, chapter viii) make Paradise in the third heaven. The rabbis had various ideas (two heavens, three, seven). We need not commit Paul to any "celestial gradation" (Vincent).Unspeakable words  (αρρητα ρηματα). Old verbal adjective (α privative, ρητος from ρεω), only here in N.T.Not lawful  (ουκ εξον). Copula εστιν omitted. Hence Paul doesnot  give these words.
