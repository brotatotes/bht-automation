 That I would not come again to you with sorrow  (το μη παλιν εν λυπη προς υμας ελθειν). Articular second aorist active infinitive with negative μη in apposition with τουτο (this) preceding. What does Paul mean by "again" (παλιν)? Had he paid another visit besides that described in 2 Corinthians 2:18 which was in sorrow (εν λυπη)? Or does he mean that having had one joyful visit (that in 2 Corinthians 2:18) he does not wish the second one to be in sorrow? Either interpretation is possible as the Greek stands and scholars disagree. So in 2 Corinthians 12:14 "The third time I am ready to come" may refer to the proposed second visit (2 Corinthians 1:15) and the present plan (a third). And so as to 2 Corinthians 13:1. There is absolutely no way to tell clearly whether Paul had already made a second visit. If he had done so, it is a bit odd that he did not plainly say so in 2 Corinthians 1:15 when he is apologizing for not having made the proposed visit ("a second benefit").
