 Corrupting  (καπηλευοντες). Old word from καπηλος, a huckster or peddlar, common in all stages of Greek for huckstering or trading. It is curious how hucksters were suspected of corrupting by putting the best fruit on top of the basket. Note Paul's solemn view of his relation to God as a preacher ( from God  εκ θεου,in the sight of God  κατεναντ θεου,in Christ  εν Χριστω).
