 The god of this world  (ο θεος του αιωνος τουτου). "Age," more exactly, as in 1 Corinthians 1:20. Satan is "the god of this age," a phrase nowhere else in the N.T., but Jesus uses the same idea in John 12:31; John 14:30 and Paul in Ephesians 2:2; Ephesians 6:12 and John in 1 John 5:19. Satan claimed the rule over the world in the temptations with Jesus.Blinded  (ετυφλωσεν). First aorist active of τυφλοω, old verb to blind (τυφλος, blind). They refused to believe (απιστων) and so Satan got the power to blind their thoughts. That happens with wilful disbelievers.The light  (τον φωτισμον). The illumination, the enlightening. Late word from φοτιζω, to give light, in Plutarch and LXX. In N.T. only in 2 Corinthians 4:4; 2 Corinthians 4:6. Accusative case of general reference here with the articular infinitive (εις το μη αυγασα that should not dawn). That is, if αυγασα is intransitive as is likely, though it is transitive in the old poets (from αυγη, radiance. Cf. German Auge=eye). If it is transitive, the idea would be "that they should not see clearly the illumination, etc."
