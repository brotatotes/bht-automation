 This treasure  (τον θησαυρον τουτον). On θησαυρον see Matthew 6:19-21. It is the power of giving the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God (verse 2 Corinthians 4:6). "The power is limitless, but it is stored in very unlikely receptacles" (Plummer). This warning Paul gives in contrast (δε) with the exultation of verse 2 Corinthians 4:6 (Bernard).In earthen vessels  (εν οστρακινοις σκευεσιν). This adjective is common in the LXX with σκευοσ, αγγος and αγγειον. It occurs again in 2 Timothy 2:20 with σκευη. It is found also in the papyri with σκευος as here. It is from οστρακον, baked clay (same root as οστεον, bone), so many fragments of which are found in Egypt with writing on them. We are but earthen jars used of God for his purposes (Romans 9:20) and so fragile.The exceeding greatness  (η υπερβολη). See on 1 Corinthians 12:31 for this word, "the preeminence of the power." This is God's purpose (ινα--η). God, not man, is thedynamo  (δυναμις). It comes from God (του θεου, ablative) and does not originate with us (μη εξ ημων).
