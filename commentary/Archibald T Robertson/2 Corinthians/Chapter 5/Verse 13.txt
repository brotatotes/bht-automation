 Whether we are beside ourselves  (ειτε εξεστημεν). Second aorist active indicative of εξιστημ, old verb, here to stand out of oneself (intransitive) from εκστασις, ecstasy, comes as in Mark 5:42. It is literary plural, for Paul is referring only to himself. See on 2 Corinthians 1:6 for ειτε--ειτε. It is a condition of the first class and Paul assumes as true the charge that he was crazy (if I was crazy) for the sake of argument. Festus made it later (Acts 26:24). He spoke with tongues (1 Corinthians 14:18) and had visions (2 Corinthians 12:1-6) which probably the Judaizers used against him. A like charge was made against Jesus (Mark 3:21). People often accuse those whom they dislike with being a bit off.
