 The love of Christ  (η αγαπη του Χριστου). Subjective genitive, Christ's love for Paul as shown by verse 2 Corinthians 5:15.Constraineth us  (συνεχε ημας). Old and common verb, to hold together, to press the ears together (Acts 7:57), to press on every side (Luke 8:45), to hold fast (Luke 22:63), to hold oneself to (Acts 18:5), to be pressed (passive, Luke 12:50; Philippians 1:23). So here Paul's conception of Christ's love for him holds him together to his task whatever men think or say.Judging this  (κριναντας τουτο). Having reached this conclusion, ever since his conversion (Galatians 1:17).One died for all  (εις υπερ παντων απεθανεν). This is the central tenet in Paul's theology and Christology. Hυπερ (over) here is used in the sense of substitution as in John 11:50; Galatians 3:13, death in behalf so that the rest will not have to die. This use of υπερ is common in the papyri (Robertson, Grammar, p. 631). In fact, υπερ in this sense is more usual in Greek than αντι, προ or any other preposition.Therefore all died  (αρα ο παντες απεθανον). Logical conclusion (αρα, corresponding), the one died for the all and so the all died when he did, all the spiritual death possible for those for whom Christ died. This is Paul's gospel, clear-cut, our hope today.
