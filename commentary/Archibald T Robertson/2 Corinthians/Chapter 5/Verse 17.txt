 A new creature  (καινη κτισις). A fresh start is made (καινη). Κτισις is the old word for the act of creating (Romans 1:20), but in N.T. by metonymy it usually bears the notion of κτισμα, the thing created or creature as here.The old things are passed away  (τα αρχαια παρηλθεν). Did pass by, he means. Second aorist active of παρερχομα, to go by. The ancient (αρχαια) way of looking at Christ among other things. And yet today there are scholars who are trying to revive the old prejudiced view of Jesus Christ as a mere man, a prophet, to give us "a reduced Christ." That was once Paul's view, but it passed by forever for him. It is a false view and leaves us no gospel and no Saviour.Behold, they are become new  (ιδου, γεγονε καινα). Perfect active indicative of γινομα, have become new (fresh, καινα) to stay so.
