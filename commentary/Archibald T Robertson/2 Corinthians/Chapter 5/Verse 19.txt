 To wit, that  (ως οτ). Latin puts it quoniam quidem. It is an unclassical idiom, but occurs in the papyri and inscriptions (Moulton, Prol., p. 212; Robertson, Grammar, p. 1033). It is in Esther 4:14. See also 2 Corinthians 11:21; 2 Thessalonians 2:2. It probably means "how that."Not reckoning  (μη λογιζομενος). What Jesus did (his death for us) stands to our credit (Romans 8:32) if we make our peace with God. This is our task, "the word of reconciliation," that we may receive "the righteousness of God" and be adopted into the family of God.
