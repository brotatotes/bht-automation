 Always rejoicing  (αε χαιροντες). Even in sorrow (2 Corinthians 11:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:16; Romans 5:3-5; Romans 9:2; Philippians 2:18; Philippians 2:27; Philippians 3:1; Philippians 4:4; Philippians 4:15).Yet making many rich  (πολλους δε πλουτιζοντες). Old word from πλουτος (wealth), to enrich. Spiritual riches Paul has in mind as in 1 Corinthians 1:5 (cf. Matthew 5:37).As having nothing and yet possessing all things  (ως μηδεν εχοντες κα παντα κατεχοντες). Contrast between μηδεν (nothing) and παντα (all things, cf. 1 Corinthians 3:22) and εχω (to have) and κατεχω (to hold down, to hold fast). Play on words (simple and compound) as in 2 Corinthians 3:2; 2 Corinthians 4:8. Climax of Paul's panegyric on the Christian ministry. He now resumes the thread of the story broken off in 2 Corinthians 2:14.
