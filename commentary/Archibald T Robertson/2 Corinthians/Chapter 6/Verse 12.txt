 Ye are not straitened in us  (ου στενοχωρεισθε εν ημιν). The same figure as in verse 2 Corinthians 6:11. See on 2 Corinthians 4:8 for στενοχωρεω. There is no restraint in me (my heart). My adversaries may have caused some of you to tighten up your affections (σπλαγχνα for affection as in James 5:11; 1 Peter 3:8).
