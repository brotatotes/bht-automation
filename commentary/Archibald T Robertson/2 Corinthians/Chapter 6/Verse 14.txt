 Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers  (μη γινεσθε ετεροζυγουντες απιστοις). No other example of this verb has yet been found, though the adjective from which it is apparently formed, ετεροζυγος (yoked with a different yoke) occurs in Leviticus 19:19 of the union of beasts of different kinds. In Deuteronomy 22:10 we read: "Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together." Literally, "Stop becoming (μη γινεσθε present imperative, not μη γενησθε aorist subj.) unequally yoked with unconverted heathen (unbelievers)." Some were already guilty. Marriage is certainly included, but other unions may be in mind. Cf. Ephesians 5:7. Paul gives as the reason (γαρ) for this prohibition five words in questions to distinguish the contrasts.Fellowship  (μετοχη). Sharing with and followed by associative instrumental case of δικαιοσυνη (righteousness) and iniquity (ανομια). A pertinent challenge today when church members wink at violations of laws of the land and laws of God.Communion  (κοινωνια). Partnership to light (φωτ dative case) with (προς), facing darkness.
