 Agreement  (συνκαταθεσις). Fifth of these words. Late word, but common, though here only in N.T. Approved by putting together the votes. In the papyri εκ συνκαταθεσεως means "by agreement." On the temple of God and idols see 1 Corinthians 10:14-22. See Luke 23:51 for the verb συνκατατιθημ.For we are the temple of the living God  (ημεις γαρ ναος θεου εσμεν ζωντος). We, not temples (Acts 7:48; Acts 17:24; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19).As God said  (καθως ειπεν ο θεος). A paraphrase and catena of quotations, what J. Rendel Harris calls Testimonia (from Leviticus 26:11; Isaiah 52:11; Ezekiel 20:34; Ezekiel 37:27; 2 Samuel 7:8; 2 Samuel 7:14). Plummer notes that at the beginning "I will dwell in them" (ενοικησω εν αυτοις) is not in any of them. "As God said" points to Leviticus 26:12; Ezekiel 37:27.
