 Behold, now is the acceptable time  (ιδου νυν καιρος ευπροσδεκτος). Here is another "Pauline parenthesis" (Plummer) as in 2 Corinthians 5:7 by the quotation from Isaiah 49:8. The LXX has δεκτος (δεκτο) verbal of δεχομα, but Paul employs the double compound (ευ, προσ, δεκτος), well-received. It occurs in Aristophanes, Plutarch, inscription, etc.
