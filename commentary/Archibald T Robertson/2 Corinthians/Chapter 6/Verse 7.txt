 On the right hand and on the left  (των δεξιων κα αριστερων). Offensive weapons (οπλων) on the right, defensive on the left. See 1 Thessalonians 5:8; Ephesians 6:11 for Paul's description of the panoply of God and Romans 6:13 for the phrase "weapons of righteousness," the only kind that will stand the strain. See also Book of Wisdom 5:18ff.
