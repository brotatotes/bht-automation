 These promises  (ταυτας τας επαγγελιας). So many and so precious (2 Peter 2:4 επαγγελματα; Hebrews 11:39).Let us cleanse ourselves  (καθαρισωμεν εαυτους). Old Greek used καθαιρω (in N.T. only in John 15:2, to prune). In Koine καθαριζω occurs in inscriptions for ceremonial cleansing (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 216f.). Paul includes himself in this volitive aorist subjunctive.From all defilement  (απο παντος μολυσμου). Ablative alone would have done, but with απο it is plainer as in Hebrews 9:14. Μολυσμος is a late word from μολυνω, to stain (see on 1 Corinthians 8:7), to pollute. In the LXX, Plutarch, Josephus. It includes all sorts of filthiness, physical, moral, mental, ceremonial, "of flesh and spirit." Missionaries in China and India can appreciate the atmosphere of pollution in Corinth, for instance.Perfecting holiness  (επιτελουντες αγιοσυνην). Not merely negative goodness (cleansing), but aggressive and progressive (present tense of επιτελεω) holiness, not a sudden attainment of complete holiness, but a continuous process (1 Thessalonians 3:13; Romans 1:4; Romans 1:6).
