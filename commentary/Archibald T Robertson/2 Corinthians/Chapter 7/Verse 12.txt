 But that your earnest care for us might be made manifest  (αλλ' εινεκεν του φανερωθηνα την σπουδην υμων την υπερ ημων). So the correct text, not "our care for you." Easy to interchange Greek υμων (your) and ημων (our). Usual construction with preposition ενεκεν and genitive of articular infinitive with accusative of general reference.
