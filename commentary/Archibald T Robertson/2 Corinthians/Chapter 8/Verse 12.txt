 Is there  (προκειτα). Lies before one. Old word.Acceptable  (ευπροσδεκτος). See on 2 Corinthians 6:2.According as a man hath  (καθο εαν εχη). Indefinite comparative clause with εαν and present subjunctive εχε. Clearly God does not expect us to give what we do not have.Not according as he hath not  (ου καθο ουκ εχε). Note present indicative rather than subjunctive because a specific case is presented. See 2 Corinthians 9:7; Mark 12:43.
