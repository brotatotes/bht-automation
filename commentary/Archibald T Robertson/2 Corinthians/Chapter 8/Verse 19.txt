 But who was also appointed  (αλλα κα χειροτονηθεις). Anacoluthon. The first aorist passive participle χειροτονηθεις is from χειροτονεω, old verb to stretch out the hands (χειρ τεινω) and so to vote in public. The idea is that this brother was chosen by the churches, not by Paul. Only here in N.T. save Acts 14:23 where it means to appoint without notion of raising the hands. In Acts 10:41 we have προχειροτονεω.To travel with us  (συνεκδημος). Late word for travelling companion. So in the inscriptions (συν, together with, εκδημος, away from home).
