 Seeing that they glorify God  (δοξαζοντες τον θεον). Anacoluthon again. The nominative participle used independently like πλουτιζομενο in verse 2 Corinthians 9:11.Obedience  (υποταγη). Late and rare word from υποτασσω, to subject, middle to obey. Only in Paul in N.T.Of your confession  (της ομολογιας υμων). Old word from ομολογεω (ομολογοσ, ομου, λεγω), to say together. It is either to profess (Latin profiteor, to declare openly) or to confess (Latin confiteor, to declare fully, to say the same thing as another). Both confess and profess are used to translate the verb and each idea is present in the substantive. Only the context can decide. Actions speak louder than words. The brethren in Jerusalem will know by this collection that Gentiles make as good Christians as Jews.For the liberality of your contribution  (απλοτητ της κοινωνιας). This is the point that matters just now. Paul drives it home. On this use of κοινωνια see on 2 Corinthians 8:4.
