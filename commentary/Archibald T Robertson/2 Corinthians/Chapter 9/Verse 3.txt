 I sent  (επεμψα). Not literary plural with this epistolary aorist as in 2 Corinthians 9:18; 2 Corinthians 9:22.That ye may be prepared  (ινα παρεσκευασμενο ητε). Perfect passive subjunctive in the final clause, "that ye may really be prepared," "as I said" (καθως ελεγον) and not just say that ye are prepared. Paul's very syntax tells against them.
