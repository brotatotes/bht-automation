 Is able  (δυνατε). Late verb, not found except here; 2 Corinthians 13:3; Romans 14:4. So far a Pauline word made from δυνατος, able.All sufficiency  (πασαν αυταρκειαν). Old word from αυταρκης (Philippians 4:11), common word, in N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 6:6). The use of this word shows Paul's acquaintance with Stoicism. Paul takes this word of Greek philosophy and applies it to the Christian view of life as independent of circumstances. But he does not accept the view of the Cynics in the avoidance of society. Note threefold use of "all" here (εν παντι, παντοτε, πασαν, in everything, always, all sufficiency).
