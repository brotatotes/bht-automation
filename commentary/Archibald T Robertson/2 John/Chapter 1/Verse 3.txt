 Shall be with us  (εστα μεθ' ημων). He picks up the words before in reverse order. Future indicative here, not a wish with the optative (ειε) as we have in 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Peter 1:2. The salutation is like that in the Pastoral Epistles: "Χαρις, the wellspring in the heart of God; ελεος, its outpourings; ειρηνη, its blessed effect" (David Smith).And from Jesus Christ  (κα παρα Ιησου Χριστου). The repetition of παρα (with the ablative) is unique. "It serves to bring out distinctly the twofold personal relation of man to the Father and to the Son" (Westcott). "The Fatherhood of God, as revealed by one who being His Son can reveal the Father, and who as man (Ιησου) can make him known to men" (Brooke).
