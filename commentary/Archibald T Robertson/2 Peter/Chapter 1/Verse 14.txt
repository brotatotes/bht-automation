 The putting off of my tabernacle  (η αποθεσις του σκηννωματος μου). For αποθεσις see on 1 Peter 3:21 and for σκηνωμα verse 2 Peter 1:13. For the metaphor see 2 Corinthians 5:3.Cometh swiftly  (ταχινη εστιν). Late adjective (Theocritus, LXX, inscription), in N.T. only here and 2 Peter 2:1. It is not clear whether ταχινος means soon or speedy as in Isaiah 59:7 and like ταχυς in James 1:19, or sudden, like ταχυς in Plato (Republ. 553 D). Either sense agrees with the urgent tone of Peter here, whether he felt his death to be near or violent or both.Signified unto me  (εδηλωσεν μο). First aorist active indicative of δηλοω, old verb (from δελος), as in 1 Peter 1:11. Peter refers to the incident told in John 21:18, which he knew by personal experience before John wrote it down.
