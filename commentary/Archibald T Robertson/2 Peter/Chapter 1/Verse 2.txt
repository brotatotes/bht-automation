 Be multiplied  (πληθυνθειη). First aorist passive optative of πληθυνω in a wish for the future (volitive use) as in 1 Peter 1:2; Judges 1:2.In the knowledge  (εν επιγνωσε). Full (additional, επ) knowledge as in 2 Peter 1:8 (only γνωσις in 2 Peter 1:5; 2 Peter 1:6; 2 Peter 3:18), but επιγνωσιν again in 2 Peter 1:3; 2 Peter 1:8; 2 Peter 2:20. As in Colossians, so here full knowledge is urged against the claims of the Gnostic heretics to special γνωσις.Of God and of Jesus our Lord  (του θεου κα Ιησου του κυριου ημων). At first sight the idiom here seems to require one person as in 2 Peter 1:1, though there is a second article (του) before κυριου, and Ιησου is a proper name. But the text here is very uncertain. Bengel, Spitta, Zahn, Nestle accept the short reading of P and some Vulgate MSS. and some minuscles with only του κυριου ημων (our Lord) from which the three other readings may have come. Elsewhere in II Peter γνωσις and επιγνωσις are used of Christ alone. The text of II Peter is not in a good state of preservation.
