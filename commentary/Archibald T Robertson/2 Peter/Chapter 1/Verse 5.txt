 Yea, and for this very cause  (κα αυτο τουτο δε). Adverbial accusative (αυτο τουτο) here, a classic idiom, with both κα and δε. Cf. κα τουτο (Philippians 1:29), τουτο μεν--τουτο δε (Hebrews 10:33). "The soul of religion is the practical part" (Bunyan). Because of the new birth and the promises we have a part to play.Adding on your part  (παρεισενεγκαντες).

This phrase (πασαν σπουδην) occurs in Jude 1:3 with ποιουμενος and on the inscription in Stratonicea (verse 2 Peter 1:3) with ισφερεσθα (certainly a curious coincidence, to say the least, though common in the Koine).In your faith  (εν τη πιστε υμων). Faith or πιστις (strong conviction as in Hebrews 11:1; Hebrews 11:3, the root of the Christian life Ephesians 2:8) is the foundation which goes through various steps up to love (αγαπη). See similar lists in James 1:30; 1 Thessalonians 1:3; 2 Thessalonians 1:3; Galatians 5:22; Romans 5:3; Romans 8:29. Hermas (Vis. iii. 8. 1-7) has a list called "daughters" of one another. Note the use of εν (in, on) with each step.Supply  (επιχορηγησατε). First aorist active imperative of επιχορηγεω, late and rare double compound verb (επ and χορηγεω 1 Peter 4:11 from χορηγος, chorus-leader, χορος and ηγεομα, to lead), to fit out the chorus with additional (complete) supplies. Both compound and simplex (more common) occur in the papyri. In 2 Peter 1:11 and already in 2 Corinthians 9:10; Galatians 3:5; Colossians 2:19.Virtue  (αρετην).
