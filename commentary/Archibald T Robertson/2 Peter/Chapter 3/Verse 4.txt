 Where is the promise of his coming?  (που εστιν η επαγγελια της παρουσιας αυτου;). This is the only sample of the questions raised by these mockers. Peter had mentioned this subject of the παρουσια in 2 Peter 1:16. Now he faces it squarely. Peter, like Paul (1 Thessalonians 5:1; 2 Thessalonians 2:1), preached about the second coming (2 Peter 1:16; Acts 3:20), as Jesus himself did repeatedly (Matthew 24:34) and as the angels promised at the Ascension (Acts 1:11). Both Jesus and Paul (2 Thessalonians 2:1) were misunderstood on the subject of the time and the parables of Jesus urged readiness and forbade setting dates for his coming, though his language in Matthew 24:34 probably led some to believe that he would certainly come while they were alive.From the day that  (αφ' ης).
