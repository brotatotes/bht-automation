 From God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ  (απο θεου πατρος κα Κυριου Ιησου Χριστου). These words are not genuine in 1 Thessalonians 1:1, but are here and they appear in all the other Pauline Epistles. Note absence of article both after εν and απο, though both God and Lord Jesus Christ are definite. In both cases Jesus Christ is put on a par with God, though not identical. See on 1 Thessalonians 1:1 for discussion of words, but note difference between εν, in the sphere of, by the power of, and απο, from, as the fountain head and source of grace and peace.
