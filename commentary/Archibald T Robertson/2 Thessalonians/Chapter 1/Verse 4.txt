 So that  (ωστε). Another example of ωστε and the infinitive (ενκαυχασθα) for result as in 1 Thessalonians 1:7 which see.We ourselves  (αυτους ημας). Accusative of general reference with the infinitive, but not merely ημας (or εαυτους), perhaps in contrast with εν υμιν (in you), as much as to say, "so that we ourselves, contrary to your expectations, are boasting" (Frame). Ενκαυχαομα occurs here alone in N.T., but is found in the LXX and in Aesop's Fables, proof enough of its vernacular use. Paul was not above praising one church to other churches, to provoke them to good works. Here he is boasting of Thessalonica in Macedonia to the Corinthians as he did later to the Corinthians about the collection (2 Corinthians 8:1-15) after having first boasted to the Macedonians about the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 9:1-5). There were other churches in Achaia besides Corinth (2 Corinthians 1:1).For  (υπερ). Over, about, like περ (1 Thessalonians 1:2).In all your persecutions  (εν πασιν τοις διωγμοις υμων). Their patience and faith had already attracted Paul's attention (1 Thessalonians 1:3) and their tribulations θλιψεσιν (1 Thessalonians 1:6). Here Paul adds the more specific term διωγμος, old word from διωκω, to chase, to pursue, a word used by Paul of his treatment in Corinth (2 Corinthians 12:10).Which ye endure  (αις ανεχεσθε). B here reads ενεχεσθε, to be entangled in, to be held in as in Galatians 5:1, but ανεχεσθε is probably correct and the αις is probably attracted to locative case of θλιψεσιν from the ablative ων after ανεχεσθε,from which ye hold yourselves back  (cf. Colossians 3:13).
