 Rest with us  (ανεσιν μεθ' ημων). Let up, release. Old word from ανιημ, from troubles here (2 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 7:5; 2 Corinthians 8:13), and hereafter as in this verse. Vivid word. They shared suffering with Paul (verse 2 Thessalonians 1:5) and so they will share (μεθ') therest .At the revelation of the Lord Jesus  (εν τη αποκαλυψε του Κυριου Ιησου). Here the Παρουσια (1 Thessalonians 2:19; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:23) is pictured as aRevelation  (Un-veiling, απο-καλυψις) of the Messiah as in 1 Corinthians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:7; 1 Peter 1:13 (cf. Luke 17:30). At this Unveiling of the Messiah there will come therecompense  (verse 2 Thessalonians 1:6) to the persecutors and therest  from the persecutions. This Revelation will befrom heaven  (απ' ουρανου) as to place andwith the angels of his power  (μετ' αγγελων δυναμεως αυτου) as the retinue andin flaming fire  (εν πυρ φλογος, in a fire of flame, fire characterized by flame). In Acts 7:30 the text isflame of fire  where πυρος is genitive (like Isaiah 66:15) rather than φλογος as here (Exodus 3:2).
