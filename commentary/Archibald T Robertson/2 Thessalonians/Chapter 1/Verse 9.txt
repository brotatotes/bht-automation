 Who  (οιτινες). Qualitative use, such as. Vanishing in papyri though surviving in Paul (1 Corinthians 3:17; Romans 1:25; Galatians 4:26; Philippians 4:3).Shall suffer punishment  (δικην τισουσιν). Future active of old verb τινω, to pay penalty (δικην, right, justice), here only in N.T., but αποτινω once also to repay Philemon 1:19. In the papyri δικη is used for a case or process in law. This is the regular phrase in classic writers for paying the penalty.Eternal destruction  (ολεθρον αιωνιον). Accusative case in apposition with δικην (penalty). This phrase does not appear elsewhere in the N.T., but is in IV Macc. 10:15 τον αιωνιον του τυραννου ολεθρον the eternal destruction of the tyrant (Antiochus Epiphanes). Destruction (cf. 1 Thessalonians 5:3) does not mean here annihilation, but, as Paul proceeds to show, separationfrom the face of the Lord  (απο προσωπου του κυριου) and from theglory of his might  (κα απο της δοξης της ισχυος αυτου), an eternity of woe such as befell Antiochus Epiphanes. Αιωνιος in itself only means age-long and papyri and inscriptions give it in the weakened sense of a Caesar's life (Milligan), but Paul means by age-longthe coming age  in contrast withthis age , aseternal  as the New Testament knows how to make it. See on Matthew 25:46 for use of αιωνιος both with ζωην, life, and κολασιν, punishment.
