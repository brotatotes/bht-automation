 That they all might be judged  (ινα κριθωσιν παντες). First aorist passive subjunctive of κρινω, to sift, to judge, with ινα. Ultimate purpose, almost result, of the preceding obstinate resistance to the truth and "the judicial infatuation which overtakes them" (Lightfoot), now final punishment. Condemnation is involved in the fatal choice made. These victims of the man of sin did not believe the truth and found pleasure in unrighteousness.
