 For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work  (το γαρ μυστηριον ηδη ενεργειτα της ανομιας). See 1 Thessalonians 2:13 for ενεργειτα. The genitive της ανομιας (lawlessness) describes το μυστηριον (note emphatic position of both). This mystery (μυστηριον secret, from μυστης, an initiate, μυεω, to wink or blink) means here the secret purpose of lawlessness already at work, the only instance of this usage in the N.T. where it is used of the kingdom of God (Matthew 13:11), of God (1 Corinthians 2:1) and God's will (Ephesians 1:9), of Christ (Ephesians 3:4), of the gospel (Ephesians 6:9), of faith (1 Timothy 3:9), of godliness (1 Timothy 3:16), of the seven stars (Revelation 1:20), of the woman (Revelation 17:7). But this secret will be "revealed" and then we shall understand clearly what Paul's meaning is here.Until he be taken out of the way  (εως εκ μεσου γενητα). Usual construction with εως for the future (aorist middle subjunctive, γενητα). Note absence of αν as often in N.T. and the Κοινη. Paul uses εως only here and 1 Corinthians 4:5. When the obstacle is removed then the mystery of lawlessness will be revealed in plain outline.
