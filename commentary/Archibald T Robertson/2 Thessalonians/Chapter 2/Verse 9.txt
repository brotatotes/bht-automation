 Whose coming is  (ου εστιν η παρουσια). Refers to ον in verse 2 Thessalonians 2:8. The Antichrist has his παρουσια also. Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, pp. 374, 378) notes an inscription at Epidaurus in which "Asclepius manifested his Παρουσια." Antiochus Epiphanes is called the manifest god (III Macc. 5:35). So the two Epiphanies coincide.Lying wonders  (τερασιν ψευδους). "In wonders of a lie." Note here the three words for the miracles of Christ (Hebrews 2:4), power (δυναμις), signs (σημεια), wonders (τερατα), but all according to the working of Satan (κατα ενεργειαν του Σατανα, the energy of Satan) just as Jesus had foretold (Matthew 24:24), wonders that would almost lead astray the very elect.
