 How ye ought to imitate us  (πως δε μιμεισθα ημας). Literally, how it is necessary to imitate us. The infinitive μιμεισθα is the old verb μιμεομα from μιμος (actor, mimic), but in N.T. only here (and verse 2 Thessalonians 3:9), Hebrews 13:7; 3 John 1:11. It is a daring thing to say, but Paul knew that he had to set the new Christians in the midst of Jews and Gentiles a model for their imitation (Philippians 3:17).For we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you  (οτ ουκ ητακτησαμεν εν υμιν). First aorist active indicative of old verb ατακτεω, to be out of ranks of soldiers. Specific denial on Paul's part in contrast to verse 2 Thessalonians 3:6; 2 Thessalonians 3:17.
