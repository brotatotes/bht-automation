 For nought  (δωρεαν). Adverbial accusative, as a gift, gift-wise (δωρεα, gift, from διδωμ). Same claim made to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:7), old word, in LXX, and papyri. He lodged with Jason, but did not receive his meals gratis, for he paid for them. Apparently he received no invitations to meals. Paul had to make his financial independence clear to avoid false charges which were made in spite of all his efforts. To eat bread is merely a Hebraism for eat (verse 2 Thessalonians 3:10). See 1 Thessalonians 2:9 for labour and travail, and night and day (νυκτος κα ημερας, genitive of time, by night and by day). See 1 Thessalonians 2:9 for rest of the verse in precisely the same words.
