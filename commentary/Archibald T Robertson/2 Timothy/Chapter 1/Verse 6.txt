 For the which cause  (δι' ην αιτιαν). "For which cause," stronger than διο. So in verse 2 Timothy 1:12; Titus 1:13. Only example of αιτια by Paul save in Acts 28:20.I put thee in remembrance  (αναμιμνησκω). Old compound to remind (1 Corinthians 4:17; 2 Corinthians 7:15).That thou stir up  (σε αναζωπυρειν). Present active infinitive of αναζωπυρεω, old double compound (ανα and ζωπυρον, live coal, ζωος and πυρ, then the bellows for kindling), to rekindle, to stir into flame, to keep blazing (continuous action, present time), only here in N.T. See 1 Thessalonians 5:19 for the figure of fire concerning the Holy Spirit. See αναπτω in Luke 12:49.The gift of God  (το χαρισμα του θεου). See 1 Timothy 4:14. Here Paul says μου (my), there he mentions the presbytery. Paul felt a deep personal interest in Timothy. See 1 Corinthians 7:7; Romans 6:23; Romans 11:29 for the gift of God.
