 From me  (παρ' εμου). As in 2 Timothy 1:13. Paul was Timothy's chief teacher of Christ.Among many witnesses  (δια πολλων μαρτυρων). Plutarch has δια in this sense and Field (Ot. Norv.) suggests that it is a legal phrase "supported by many witnesses." Not mere spectators, but testifiers. See Paul's use of δια 1 Thessalonians 4:2; 2 Corinthians 2:4; Romans 2:27; Romans 14:20. Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:1-8 gives many witnesses of the resurrection of Christ.Commit thou  (παραθου). Second aorist middle imperative of παρατιθημ (1 Timothy 1:18) to deposit, same metaphor as παραθηκη in 2 Timothy 1:12; 2 Timothy 1:14. "Deposit thou."Faithful  (πιστοις). "Trustworthy," "reliable," as in 1 Timothy 1:12 of Paul himself.Able  (ικανο). Capable, qualified, as in 1 Corinthians 15:9; 2 Corinthians 2:16; 2 Corinthians 3:5.Others also  (κα ετερους). Not necessarily "different," but "others in addition." This is the way to pass on the torch of the light of the knowledge of God in Christ. Paul taught Timothy who will teach others who will teach still others, an endless chain of teacher-training and gospel propaganda.
