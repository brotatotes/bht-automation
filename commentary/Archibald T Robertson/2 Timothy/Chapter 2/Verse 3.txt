 Suffer hardship with me  (συνκακοπαθησον). See 2 Timothy 1:8 for this verb. The old preacher challenges the young one to share hardship with him for Christ.As a good soldier  (ος καλος στρατιωτης). Paul does not hesitate to use this military metaphor (this word only here for a servant of Christ) with which he is so familiar. He had already used the metaphor in 1 Corinthians 9:7; 2 Corinthians 10:3; 1 Timothy 1:18. In Philippians 2:25 he called Epaphroditus "my fellow-soldier" (συνστρατιωτην μου) as he did Archippus in Philemon 1:2.
