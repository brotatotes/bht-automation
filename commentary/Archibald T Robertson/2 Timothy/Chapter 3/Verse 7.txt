 Never able to come to the knowledge of the truth  (μηδεποτε εις επιγνωσιν αληθειας ελθειν δυναμενα). Pathetic picture of these hypnotized women without intellectual power to cut through the fog of words and, though always learning scraps of things, they never come into the full knowledge (επιγνωσιν) of the truth in Christ. And yet they even pride themselves on belonging to the intelligentsia!
