 At my first defence  (εν τη πρωτη απολογια). Original sense of "apology" as in Philippians 1:7; Philippians 1:16. Either the first stage in this trial or the previous trial and acquittal at the end of the first Roman imprisonment. Probably the first view is correct, though really there is no way to decide.No one took my part  (ουδεις μο παρεγενετο). "No one came by my side" (second aorist middle indicative of παραγινομα). See 1 Corinthians 16:3.But all forsook me  (αλλα παντες με εγκατελειπον). Same verb and tense used of Demas above (verse 2 Timothy 4:10), "But all were forsaking me" (one by one) or, if aorist εγκατελιπον, "all at once left me."May it not be laid to their account  (μη αυτοις λογισθειη). First aorist passive optative in future wish with negative μη. Common Pauline verb λογιζομα (1 Corinthians 13:5; Romans 4:3; Romans 4:5).
