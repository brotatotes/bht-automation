 A time when  (καιρος οτε). One of the ακαιρως (out of season) times.Will not endure  (ουκ ανεξοντα). Future middle (direct) of ανεχω. "Will not hold themselves back from" (Col. 2 Timothy 3:13). Having itching ears (κνηθομενο την ακοην). Present middle (causative) participle of κνηθω, late and rare form of the Attic κναω, to scratch, to tickle, here only in N.T. "Getting the ears (the hearing, την ακοην) tickled." The Vulgate has πρυριεντες. Cf. the Athenians (Acts 17:21). Clement of Alexandria tells of speakers tickling (κνηθοντες) the ears of those who want to be tickled. This is the temptation of the merely "popular" preacher, to furnish the latest tickle.
