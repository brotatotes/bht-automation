 Into the upper chamber  (εις το υπερωιον). The upstairs or upper room (υπερ is upper or over, the adjective υπερωιος), the room upstairs where the women staid in Homer, then a room up under the flat roof for retirement or prayer (Acts 9:37; Acts 9:39), sometimes a large third story room suitable for gatherings (Acts 20:9). It is possible, even probable, that this is the "large upper room" (ανωγεον μεγα) of Mark 14:15; Luke 22:12. The Vulgate has coenaculum for both words. The word is used in the N.T. only in Acts. It was in a private house as in Luke 22:11 and not in the temple as Luke 24:53 might imply, "continually" (δια παντος) these words probably meaning on proper occasions.They were abiding  (ησαν καταμενοντες). Periphrastic imperfect active. Perfective use of κατα, to abide permanently. It is possible that this is the house of Mary the mother of John Mark where the disciples later met for prayer (Acts 12:12). Here alone in the N.T., though old compound. Some MSS. here read παραμενοντες. This could mean constant residence, but most likely frequent resort for prayer during these days, some being on hand all the time as they came and went.Simon the Zealot  (Σιμον ο Ζηλωτης). Called Simon the Cananaean (ο Χαναναιος) in Matthew 10:4; Mark 3:18, but Zealot in Luke 6:16 as here giving the Greek equivalent of the Aramaic word because Luke has Gentiles in mind. The epithet (member of the party of Zealots) clung to him after he became an apostle and distinguishes him from Simon Peter. See Vol. I on the Gospel of Matthew for discussion of the four lists of the apostles.Judas the son of James  (Jουδας Ιακωβου). Literally, Judas of James, whether son or brother (cf. Jude 1:1) we do not really know. "Of James" is added to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot (John 14:22). However we take it, he must be identified with the Thaddaeus (=Lebbaeus) of Mark and Matthew to make the list in the third group identical. No name appears in Acts for that of Judas Iscariot.
