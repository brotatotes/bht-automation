 With one accord  (ομοθυμαδον). Old adverb in -δον from adjective ομοθυμος and that from ομος, same, and θυμος, mind or spirit, with the same mind or spirit. Common in ancient Greek and papyri. In the N.T. eleven times in Acts and nowhere else save Romans 15:6. See Matthew 18:19.Continued  (ησαν προσκαρτερουντες). Periphrastic imperfect active of προσκαρτερεω, old verb from προς (perfective use) and καρτερεω from καρτερος, strong, steadfast, like the English "carry on." Already in Mark 3:9 which see and several times in Acts and Paul's Epistles. They "stuck to" the praying (τη προσευχη, note article) for the promise of the Father till the answer came.With the women  (συν γυναιξιν). Associative instrumental case plural of γυνη after συν. As one would expect when praying was the chief work on hand. More women certainly included than in Luke 8:2; Mark 15:40; Matthew 27:55; Luke 23:49; Mark 15:47; Matthew 27:61; Luke 23:55; Mark 16:1; Matthew 28:1; Luke 24:1; John 20:1; John 20:11-18; Matthew 28:9. There were probably other women also whose testimony was no longer scouted as it had been at first. Codex Bezae adds here "and children."And Mary the mother of Jesus  (κα Μαριαμ τη μητρ του Ιησου). A delicate touch by Luke that shows Mary with her crown of glory at last. She had come out of the shadow of death with the song in her heart and with the realization of the angel's promise and the prophecy of Simeon. It was a blessed time for Mary.With his brethren  (συν τοις αδελφοις αυτου). With his brothers, it should be translated. They had once disbelieved in him (John 7:5). Jesus had appeared to James (1 Corinthians 15:7) and now it is a happy family of believers including the mother and brothers (half-brothers, literally) of Jesus. They continue in prayer for the power from on high.
