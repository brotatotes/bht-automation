 Apostleship  (αποστολης). Jesus had called the twelve apostles. An old word for sending away, then for a release, then the office and dignity of an apostle (Acts 1:25; Romans 1:5; 1 Corinthians 9:2; Galatians 2:8).To his own place  (εις τον τοπον τον ιδιον). A bold and picturesque description of the destiny of Judas worthy of Dante's Inferno. There is no doubt in Peter's mind of the destiny of Judas nor of his own guilt. He made ready his own berth and went to it.
