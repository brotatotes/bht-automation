 He was numbered  (συνκατεψηφισθη). To the Jews the lot did not suggest gambling, but "the O.T. method of learning the will of Jehovah" (Furneaux). The two nominations made a decision necessary and they appealed to God in this way. This double compound συνκαταψηφιζω occurs here alone in the N.T. and elsewhere only in Plutarch (Them. 21) in the middle voice for condemning with others. Συνψηφιζω occurs in the middle voice in Acts 19:19 for counting up money and also in Aristophanes. Ψηφιζω with δαπανην occurs in Luke 14:28 for counting the cost and in Revelation 13:18 for "counting" the number of the beast. The ancients used pebbles (ψηφο) in voting, black for condemning, white (Revelation 2:17) in acquitting. Here it is used in much the same sense as καταριθμεω in verse Acts 1:17.
