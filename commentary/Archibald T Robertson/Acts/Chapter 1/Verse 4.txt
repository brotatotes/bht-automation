 Being assembled together with them  (συναλιζομενος). Present passive participle from συναλιζω, an old verb in Herodotus, Xenophon, etc., from sun, with, and αλιζω, from αλης, crowded. The margin of both the Authorized and the Revised Versions has "eating with them" as if from συν and αλς (salt). Salt was the mark of hospitality. There is the verb αλισθητε εν αυτω used by Ignatius Ad Magnes. X, "Be ye salted in him." But it is more than doubtful if that is the idea here though the Vulgate does have convescens illis "eating with them," as if that was the common habit of Jesus during the forty days (Wendt, Feine, etc.). Jesus did on occasion eat with the disciples (Luke 24:41-43; Mark 16:14).To wait for the promise of the Father  (περιμενειν την επαγγελιαν του πατρος). Note present active infinitive, to keep on waiting for (around, περ). In the Great Commission on the mountain in Galilee this item was not given (Matthew 28:16-20). It is the subjective genitive, the promise given by the Father (note this Johannine use of the word), that is the Holy Spirit ("the promise of the Holy Spirit," objective genitive).Which ye heard from me  (ην ηκουσατε μου). Change from indirect discourse (command), infinitives χωριζεσθα and περιμενειν after παρηγγειλεν to direct discourse without any εφη (said he) as the English (Italics). Luke often does this (oratior ariata). Note also the ablative case of μου (from me). Luke continues in verse Acts 1:5 with the direct discourse giving the words of Jesus.
