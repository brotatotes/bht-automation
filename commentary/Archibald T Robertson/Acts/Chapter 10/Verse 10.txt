 Hungry  (προσπεινος) Only instance of the word known, a απαξ λεγομενον. Probably "very hungry" (προς=besides, in addition).Desired  (ηθελεν). Imperfect active. Was longing to eat. It was about twelve o'clock noon and Peter may even have smelt the savory dishes, "while they made ready" (παρασκευαζοντων). "The natural and the supernatural border closely on one another, with no definable limits" (Furneaux).He fell into a trance  (εγενετο επ' αυτον εκστασις). More exactly, "An ecstasy came upon him," in which trance he passed out of himself (εκστασις, from εξιστημ) and from which one came to himself (Acts 12:11). Cf. also Acts 11:5; Acts 22:17. It is thus different from a vision (οραμα) as in verse Acts 10:3.
