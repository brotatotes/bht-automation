 Was much perplexed in himself  (εν εαυτω διηπορε). Imperfect active of διαπορεω, intensive compound (δια, thoroughly, and α privative and πορος, way), to be completely at a loss to know what road to take. Old verb, but in N.T. only in Luke and Acts. Page notes that Luke is singularly fond of verbs compounded with δια. See on Luke 9:7 and Acts 2:12. When out of the ecstasy he was more puzzled than ever.Might be  (αν ειη). Optative with αν in indirect question simply retained from the direct (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1021, 1044). See Acts 17:18, for the direct and Luke 1:62 for the indirect (αν θελο both times). It is the conclusion of a fourth class condition.Having made inquiry  (διερωτησαντες). First aorist active participle of διερωταω, another compound of δια, to ask one after another, to ask through, old verb, but only here in the N.T. It took diligent inquiry to find the obscure house of Simon the tanner.Stood before the gate  (επεστησαν επ τον πυλωνα). Second aorist active indicative of εφιστημ, intransitive. Note repetition of επ. The messengers stopped right at the folding gates of the passage (πυλωνα) which led from the street to the inner court or house.
