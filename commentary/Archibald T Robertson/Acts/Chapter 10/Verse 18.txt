 Called  (φωνησαντες). In a loud voice that those inside the house might hear.Asked  (επυνθανοντο). Imperfect middle of πυνθανομα, old verb to make inquiry especially with an indirect question as here. Kept on inquiring. Westcott and Hort follow B C here and read επυθοντο (second aorist middle, effective aorist). Either makes sense, though the imperfect is more picturesque.Were lodging  (ξενιζετα). Present middle indicative retained in indirect question. See on verse Acts 10:6 for the verb.
