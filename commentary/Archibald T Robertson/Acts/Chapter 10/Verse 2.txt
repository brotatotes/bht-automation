 Devout  (ευσεβης). Old word from ευ (well) and σεβομα (to worship, to reverence), but rare in the N.T. (Acts 10:2; Acts 10:7; 2 Peter 2:1). It might refer to a worshipful pagan (Acts 17:23, σεβασματα, objects of worship), but connected with "one that feared God" (φοβουμενος τον θεον) Luke describes "a God-fearing proselyte" as in Acts 10:22; Acts 10:35. This is his usual term for the Gentile seekers after God (Acts 13:16; Acts 13:26; Acts 17:4; Acts 17:17, etc.), who had come into the worship of the synagogue without circumcision, and were not strictly proselytes, though some call such men "proselytes of the gate" (cf. Acts 13:43); but clearly Cornelius and his family were still regarded as outside the pale of Judaism (Acts 10:28; Acts 10:34; Acts 11:1; Acts 11:8; Acts 15:7). They had seats in the synagogue, but were not Jews.Gave much alms  (ποιων ελεεμοσυνας πολλας). Doing many alms (the very phrase in Matthew 6:2), a characteristic mark of Jewish piety and from a Gentile to the Jewish people.Prayed  (δεομενος). Begging of God. Almsgiving and prayer were two of the cardinal points with the Jews (Jesus adds fasting in his picture of the Pharisee in Matthew 6:1-18).
