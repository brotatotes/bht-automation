 Opened his mouth  (ανοιξας το στομα). Solemn formula for beginning his address (Acts 8:35; Acts 18:14; Matthew 5:2; Matthew 13:35). But also good elocution for the speaker.I perceive  (καταλαμβανομα). Aoristic present middle of καταλαμβανω, to take hold of, the middle noting mental action, to lay hold with the mind (Acts 4:13; Acts 10:34; Acts 25:25; Ephesians 3:18). It had been a difficult thing for Peter to grasp, but now "of a truth" (επ' αληθειας) the light has cleared away the fogs. It was not until Peter had crossed the threshold of the house of Cornelius in the new environment and standpoint that he sees this new and great truth.Respecter of persons  (προσωπολημπτης). This compound occurs only here and in Chrysostom. It is composed of προσωπον face or person (προς and οπς, before the eye or face) and λαμβανω. The abstract form προσωπολημψια occurs in James 2:1 (also Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 3:25) and the verb προσωπολεμπτεω in James 2:9. The separate phrase (λαμβανειν προσωπον) occurs in Luke 20:21; Galatians 2:6. The phrase was already in the LXX (Deuteronomy 10:17; 2 Chronicles 19:7; Psalms 82:6). Luke has simply combined the two words into one compound one. The idea is to pay regard to one's looks or circumstances rather than to his intrinsic character. The Jews had come to feel that they were the favourites of God and actually sons of the kingdom of heaven because they were descendants of Abraham. John the Baptist rebuked them for this fallacy.
