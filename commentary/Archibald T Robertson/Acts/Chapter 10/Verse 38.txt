 Jesus of Nazareth  (Ιησουν τον απο Ναζαρεθ). Jesus the one from Nazareth, the article before the city identifying him clearly. The accusative case is here by προλεψις, Jesus being expressed for emphasis before the verb "anointed" and the pronoun repeated pleonastically after it. "Jesus transfers the mind from the gospel-history to the personal subject of it" (Hackett).God anointed him  (εχρισεν, αυτον, ο θεος). First aorist active of the verb χριω, to anoint, from which the verbal Χριστος is formed (Acts 2:36). The precise event referred to by Peter could be the Incarnation (Luke 1:35), the Baptism (Luke 3:22), the Ministry at Nazareth (Luke 4:14). Why not to the life and work of Jesus as a whole?Went about doing good  (διηλθεν ευεργετων). Beautiful description of Jesus. Summary (constative) aorist active of διερεομα, to go through (δια) or from place to place. The present active participle ευεργετων is from the old verb ευεργετεω (ευ, well, εργον, work) and occurs only here in the N.T. The substantive ευεργετης (benefactor) was often applied to kings like Ptolemy Euergetes and that is the sense in Luke 22:25 the only N.T. example. But the term applies to Jesus far more than to Ptolemy or any earthly king (Cornelius a Lapide).And healing  (κα ιωμενος). And in particular healing. Luke does not exclude other diseases (cf. Luke 13:11; Luke 13:16), but he lays special emphasis on demoniacal possession (cf. Mark 1:23).That were oppressed  (τους καταδυναστευομενους). Present passive articular participle of καταδυναστευω. A late verb in LXX and papyri. In the N.T. only here and James 2:6 (best MSS.). One of the compounds of κατα made transitive. The reality of the devil (the slanderer, διαβολος) is recognized by Peter.For God was with him  (οτ ο θεος ην μετ' αυτου). Surely this reason does not reveal "a low Christology" as some charge. Peter had used the same language in Acts 7:9 and earlier in Luke 1:28; Luke 1:66 as Nicodemus does in John 3:2.
