 Making no distinction  (μηδεν διακριναντα). So Westcott and Hort (first aorist active participle) instead of μηδεν διακρινομενον "nothing doubting" (present middle participle) like Acts 10:20. The difference in voice shows the distinction in meaning.We entered into the man's house  (εισηλθομεν εις τον οικον του ανδρος). Peter confesses it, but shows that the other six went in also. He avoids mention of Cornelius's name and office.
