 The grace of God, was glad  (την χαριν την του θεου εχαρη). Note repetition of the article, "the grace that of God." The verb (second aorist passive indicative of χαιρω) has the same root as χαρις. See the same suavis paronomasia in Luke 1:28. "Grace brings gladness" (Page). "A smaller man would have raised difficulties as to circumcision or baptism" (Furneaux).He exhorted  (παρεκαλε). Imperfect active, picturing the continuous encouragement from Barnabas.With purpose of heart  (τη προθεσε της καρδιας). Placing before (from προ-τιθημ), old word for set plan as in Acts 27:13; Romans 8:28. The glow of the first enthusiasm might pass as often happens after a revival. Barnabas had a special gift (Acts 4:36) for work like this.Cleave unto the Lord  (προσμενειν [εν] τω κυριω). Dative case (locative if εν is genuine) of κυριος (here Jesus again) after προσεμενειν to keep on remaining loyal to (present active infinitive). Persistence was needed in such a pagan city.
