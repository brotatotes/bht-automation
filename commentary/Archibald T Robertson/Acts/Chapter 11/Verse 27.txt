 Prophets  (προφητα). Christian prophets these were (cf. Acts 13:1) who came from Jerusalem (the headquarters, Acts 8:15). Judas and Silas are called prophets (Acts 14:4; Acts 15:32). They were not just fore-tellers, but forth-tellers. The prophet had inspiration and was superior to the speaker with tongues (1 Corinthians 14:3). John was a prophet (Luke 7:26). We need prophets in the ministry today.
