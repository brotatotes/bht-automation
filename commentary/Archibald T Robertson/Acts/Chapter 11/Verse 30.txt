 Sending  (αποστειλαντες). First aorist active participle of αποστελλω, coincident action with εποιησαν (did).To the elders  (προς τους πρεσβυτερους). The first use of that term for the Christian preachers. In Acts 20:17; Acts 20:28 "elders" and "bishops" are used interchangeably as in Titus 1:5; Titus 1:7. The term probably arose gradually and holds a position in the church similar to the same term in the synagogue. The apostles were apparently absent from Jerusalem at this time and they were no longer concerned with serving tables. In Acts 21:18 Paul presented the later collection also to the elders. Since Peter and James (till his death) were in Jerusalem during the persecution in chapter 12 it is probable that the visit of Barnabas and Saul to Jerusalem came really after that persecution for Peter left Jerusalem (Acts 12:17). The elders here mentioned may include the preachers in Judea also outside of Jerusalem (Acts 26:20).
