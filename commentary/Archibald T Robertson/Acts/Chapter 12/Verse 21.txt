 Upon a set day  (τακτη ημερα). Locative case and the verbal adjective of τασσω, to arrange, appoint, old word, here only in the N.T. Josephus (Ant. XVII. 6, 8; XIX. 8, 2) gives a full account of the occasion and the death of Herod Agrippa. It was the second day of the festival in honour of the Emperor Claudius, possibly his birthday rather than the Quinquennalia. The two accounts of Luke and Josephus supplement each other with no contradiction. Josephus does not mention the name of Blastus.Arrayed himself in royal apparel  (ενδυσαμενος εσθητα βασιλικην). First aorist middle (indirect) participle of ενδυνω or ενδυω, common verb to put on. Literally, having put royal apparel on himself (a robe of silver tissue, Josephus says). The rays of the sun shone on this brilliant apparel and the vast crowd in the open amphitheatre became excited as Herod began to speak.Made an oration  (εδημηγορε). Imperfect active of δημηγορεω, old verb from δημηγορος (haranguer of the people), and that from δημος (people) and αγορευω, to harangue or address the people. Only here in the N.T. He kept it up.
