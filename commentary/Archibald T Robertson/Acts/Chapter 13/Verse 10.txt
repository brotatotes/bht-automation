 Of all guile  (παντος δολου). From δελω, to catch with bait, old word, already seen in Matthew 26:4; Mark 7:22; Mark 14:1. Paul denounces Elymas as a trickster.All villainy  (πασης ραιδιουργιας). Late compound from ραιδιουργος (ραιδιος, easy, facile, εργον, deed, one who does a thing adroitly and with ease). So levity in Xenophon and unscrupulousness in Polybius, Plutarch, and the papyri. Only here in the N.T., though the kindred word ραιδιουργημα occurs in Acts 18:14. With deadly accuracy Paul pictured this slick rascal.Thou son of the devil  (υιε διαβολου). Damning phrase like that used by Jesus of the Pharisees in John 8:44, a slanderer like the διαβολος. This use of son (υιος) for characteristic occurs in Acts 3:25; Acts 4:36, a common Hebrew idiom, and may be used purposely by Paul in contrast with the name Barjesus (son of Jesus) that Elymas bore (Acts 13:6).Enemy of all righteousness  (εχθρε πασης δικαιοσυνης). Personal enemy to all justice, sums up all the rest. Note triple use of "all" (παντοσ, πασησ, πασης), total depravity in every sense.Wilt thou not cease?  (ου παυση). An impatient rhetorical question, almost volitive in force (Robertson, Grammar, p. 874). Note ου, not μη,To pervert  (διαστρεφων). Present active participle describing the actual work of Elymas as a perverter or distorter (see verse Acts 13:8). More exactly, Wilt thou not cease perverting?The right ways of the Lord  (τας οδους του κυριου τας ευθειας). The ways of the Lord the straight ones as opposed to the crooked ways of men (Isaiah 40:4; Isaiah 42:16; Luke 3:5). The task of John the Baptist as of all prophets and preachers is to make crooked paths straight and to get men to walk in them. This false prophet was making even the Lord's straight ways crooked. Elymas has many successors.
