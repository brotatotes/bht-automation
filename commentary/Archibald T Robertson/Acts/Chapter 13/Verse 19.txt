 When he had destroyed  (καθελων). Second aorist active participle of καθαιρεω, to tear down, old verb.He gave them for an inheritance  (κατεκληρονομησεν). First aorist active indicative of the double compound verb κατα-κληρο-νομεω, late verb in LXX (Numbers 34:18; Deuteronomy 3:28; Joshua 14:1) and only here in the N.T., to distribute by lot, to distribute as an inheritance. This is the correct reading and not κατεκληροδοτησεν from κατακληροδοτεω of the Textus Receptus. These two verbs were confused in the MSS. of the LXX as well as here.For about four hundred and fifty years  (ως ετεσιν τετρακοσιοις κα πεντηκοντα). Associative instrumental case with an expression of time as in Acts 8:11; Luke 8:29 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 527). The oldest MSS. (Aleph A B C Vg Sah Boh) place these figures before "after these things" and so in verse Acts 13:19. This is the true reading and is in agreement with the notation in 1 Kings 6:1. The difficulty found in the Textus Receptus (King James Version) thus disappears with the true text. The four hundred and fifty years runs therefore from the birth of Isaac to the actual conquest of Canaan and does not cover the period of the Judges. See on Acts 7:6.
