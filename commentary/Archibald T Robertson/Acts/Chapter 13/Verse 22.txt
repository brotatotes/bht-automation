 When he had removed him  (μεταστησας αυτον). First aorist active participle of μεθιστημ, old verb to transfer, to transpose (note force of μετα). This verb occurs in Luke 16:4 by the unjust steward about his removal from office. Cf. 1 Samuel 15:16.To be  (εις). As or for, Greek idiom like the Hebrew le, common in the LXX.A man after my heart  (ανδρα κατα την καρδιαν μου). The words quoted by Paul as a direct saying of God are a combination of Psalms 89:20; Psalms 89:21; 1 Samuel 13:14 (the word of the Lord to Samuel about David). Knowling thinks that this free and rather loose quotation of the substance argues for the genuineness of the report of Paul's sermon. Hackett observes that the commendation of David is not absolute, but, as compared with the disobedient Saul, he was a man who did God's will in spite of the gross sin of which he repented (Acts 13:51). Note "wills" (θεληματα), plural, of God.
