 Because  (διοτ). Compound conjunction (δια, οτ) like our "because that." The reason for the previous statement about "the holy things."Thou wilt not give thy holy one to see corruption  (ου δωσεις τον οσιον σου ιδειν διαφθοραν). Quotation from Psalms 16:10 to show that Jesus did not see corruption in his body, a flat contradiction for those who deny the bodily resurrection of Jesus.
