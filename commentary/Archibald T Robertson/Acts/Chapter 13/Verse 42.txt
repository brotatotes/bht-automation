 And as they went out  (Εξιοντων δε αυτων). Genitive absolute with present active participle of εξειμ, to go out, old verb, in the N.T. only in Acts 12:42; Acts 17:15; Acts 20:7; Acts 27:43. As they (Paul and Barnabas) were going out with all the excitement and hubbub created by the sermon.They besought  (παρεκαλουν). Imperfect active, inchoative, began to beseech. The Textus Receptus inserts wrongly τα εθνη (the Gentiles) as if the Jews were opposed to Paul from the first as some doubtless were. But both Jews and Gentiles asked for the repetition of the sermon (λαληθηνα, first aorist passive infinitive object of παρεκαλουν with accusative of general reference).The next Sabbath  (εις το μεταξυ σαββατον). Late use (Josephus, Plutarch, etc.) of μεταξυ (μετα and ξυν=συν) in sense of after or next instead of between (sense of μετα prevailing). Note use of εις for "on" or "by."
