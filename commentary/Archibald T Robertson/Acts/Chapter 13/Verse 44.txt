 The next Sabbath  (τω ερχομενω σαββατω). Locative case, on the coming (ερχομενω, present middle participle of ερχομα) Sabbath. So the best MSS., though some have εχομενω (present middle participle of εχω in sense of near, bordering, following as in Luke 13:33; Acts 29:15).Almost  (σχεδον). Old word, but in N.T. only here, Acts 19:26; Hebrews 9:22.Was gathered together  (συνηχθη). First aorist (effective) passive indicative of συναγω, old and common verb. The "whole city" could hardly all gather in the synagogue. Perhaps Paul spoke in the synagogue and Barnabas to the overflow outside (see verse Acts 13:46). It was an eager and earnest gathering "to hear (ακουσα, first aorist active infinitive of purpose) the word of God" and a great opportunity for Paul and Barnabas. The Codex Bezae has it "to hear Paul." It was the new preacher (Paul) that drew the big crowd. It was a crowd such as will later hang on the words of John Wesley and George Whitfield when they preach Jesus Christ.
