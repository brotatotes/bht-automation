 The Jews  (ο Ιουδαιο). Certainly not the proselytes of verse Acts 13:43. Probably many of the Jews that were then favourably disposed to Paul's message had reacted against him under the influence of the rabbis during the week and evidently on this Sabbath very many Gentiles ("almost the whole city," "the multitudes" τους οχλους) had gathered, to the disgust of the stricter Jews. Nothing is specifically stated here about the rabbis, but they were beyond doubt the instigators of, and the ringleaders in, the opposition as in Thessalonica (Acts 17:5). No such crowds (οχλους) came to the synagogue when they were the speakers.With jealousy  (ζηλου). Genitive case of ζηλος (from ζεω, to boil) after επλησθησαν (effective first aorist passive indicative of πιμπλημ). Envy and jealousy arise between people of the same calling (doctors towards doctors, lawyers towards lawyers, preachers towards preachers). So these rabbis boiled with jealousy when they saw the crowds gathered to hear Paul and Barnabas.Contradicted  (αντελεγον). Imperfect active of αντιλεγω, old verb to speak against, to say a word in opposition to (αντ, face to face). It was interruption of the service and open opposition in the public meeting. Paul and Barnabas were guests by courtesy and, of course, could not proceed further, when denied that privilege.Blasphemed  (βλασφημουντες). Blaspheming. So the correct text without the addition αντιλεγοντες (repeated from αντελεγον above). Common verb in the Gospels for saying injurious and harmful things. Doubtless these rabbis indulged in unkind personalities and made it plain that Paul and Barnabas were going beyond the limitations of pure Judaism in their contacts with Gentiles.
