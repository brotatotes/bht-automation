 In the generations gone by  (εν ταις παρωιχημεναις γενεαις). Perfect middle participle from παροιχομα, to go by, old verb, here alone in the N.T.Suffered  (ειασεν). Constative aorist active indicative of εαω (note syllabic augment). Paul here touches God in history as he did just before in creation. God's hand is on the history of all the nations (Gentile and Jew), only with the Gentiles he withdrew the restraints of his grace in large measure (Acts 17:30; Romans 1:24; Romans 1:26; Romans 1:28), judgment enough for their sins.To walk in their ways  (πορευεσθα ταις οδοις αυτων). Present middle infinitive, to go on walking, with locative case without εν. This philosophy of history does not mean that God was ignorant or unconcerned. He was biding his time in patience.
