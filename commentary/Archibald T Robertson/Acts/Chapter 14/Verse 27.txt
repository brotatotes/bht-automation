 Gathered the church together  (συναγαγοντες την εκκλησιαν). Second aorist active participle of συναγω. It "was the first missionary meeting in history" (Furneaux). It was not hard to get the church together when the news spread that Paul and Barnabas had returned. "The suitability of the Gospel to become the religion of the world had not before been put to the test" (Furneaux). Doubtless many "wise-acres" had predicted failure as they did for William Carey and for Adoniram Judson and Luther Rice.Rehearsed  (ανηγγελλον). Imperfect active. It was a long story for they had many things to tell of God's dealings "with them" (μετ' αυτων) for God had been "with them" all the while as Jesus had said he would be (Matthew 28:20, μεθ' υμων). Paul could recount some of the details given later in Acts 14:2.And how  (κα οτ). Or "and that" in particular, as the upshot of it all.He had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles  (ηνοιξεν τοις εθνεσιν θυραν πιστεως). Three times in Paul's Epistles (1 Corinthians 16:9; 2 Corinthians 2:12; Colossians 4:3) he employed the metaphor of "door," perhaps a reminiscence of the very language of Paul here. This work in Galatia gained a large place in Paul's heart (Galatians 4:14). The Gentiles now, it was plain, could enter the kingdom of God (verse Acts 14:22) through the door of faith, not by law or by circumcision or by heathen philosophy or mythology.
