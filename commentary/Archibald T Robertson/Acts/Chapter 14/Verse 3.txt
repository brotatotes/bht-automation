 Long time therefore  (ικανον μεν ουν χρονον). Accusative of duration of time (possibly six months) and note μεν ουν. There is an antithesis in εσχισθη δε (verse Acts 14:4) and in verse Acts 14:5 (εγενετο δε). After the persecution and vindication there was a season of great opportunity which Paul and Barnabas used to the full, "speaking boldly" (παρρησιαζομενο as in Acts 13:46 at Antioch in Pisidia, "in the Lord" (επ τω κυριω), upon the basis of the Lord Jesus as in Acts 4:17. And the Lord Jesus "bore witness to the word of his grace" as he always does, "granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands" (διδοντ σημεια κα τερατα γινεσθα δια των χειρων αυτων). Present participle (διδοντ) and present infinitive (γινεσθα) repetition of both signs and wonders (note both words) just as had happened with Peter and John and the other apostles (Acts 2:43; Acts 4:29; Acts 5:12; cf. Hebrews 2:4). The time of peace could not last forever with such a work of grace as this. A second explosion of persecution was bound to come and some of the MSS. actually have εκ δευτερου (a second time).
