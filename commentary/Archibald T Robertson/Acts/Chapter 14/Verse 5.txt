 An onset  (ορμη). A rush or impulse as in James 3:4. Old word, but only twice in the N.T. (here and James). It probably denotes not an actual attack so much as the open start, the co-operation of both Jews and Gentiles (the disaffected portion), "with their rulers" (συν τοις αρχουσιν αυτων), that is the rulers of the Jewish synagogue (Acts 13:27). The city officials would hardly join in a mob like this, though Hackett and Rackham think that the city magistrates were also involved as in Antioch in Pisidia (Acts 13:50).To entreat them shamefully  (υβρισα). First aorist active infinitive of υβριζω, old verb to insult insolently. See on Matthew 22:6; Luke 18:32.To stone  (λιθοβολησα). First aorist active infinitive of λιθοβολεω, late verb from λιθοβολος (λιθος, stone, βαλλω, to throw) to pelt with stones, the verb used of the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:58). See on Matthew 21:35. The plan to stone them shows that the Jews were in the lead and followed by the Gentile rabble. "Legal proceedings having failed the only resource left for the Jews was illegal violence" (Rackham).
