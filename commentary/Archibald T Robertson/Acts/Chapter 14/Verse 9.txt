This man was "no mendicant pretender," for his history was known from his birth.Fastening his eyes upon him  (ατενισας αυτω). Just as in Acts 13:9 of Paul and Acts 1:10 which see. Paul saw a new hope in the man's eyes and face.He had faith  (εχε πιστιν). Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse.To be made whole  (του σωθηνα). Genitive of articular first aorist passive infinitive (purpose and result combined) of σωζω, to make sound and also to save. Here clearly to make whole or well as in Luke 7:50 (cf.
