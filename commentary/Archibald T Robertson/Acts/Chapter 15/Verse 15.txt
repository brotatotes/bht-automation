 To this agree  (τουτω συμφωνουσιν). Associative instrumental case (τουτω) after συμφωνουσιν (voice together with, symphony with, harmonize with), from συμφωνεω, old verb seen already in Matthew 18:19; Luke 5:36; Acts 5:9 which see. James cites only Amos 9:11; Amos 9:12 from the LXX as an example of "the words of the prophets" (ο λογο των προφητων) to which he refers on this point. The somewhat free quotation runs here through verses Acts 15:16-18 of Acts 15:15 and is exceedingly pertinent. The Jewish rabbis often failed to understand the prophets as Jesus showed. The passage in Amos refers primarily to the restoration of the Davidic empire, but also the Messiah's Kingdom (the throne of David his father," Luke 1:32).
