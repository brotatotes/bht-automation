 But that we write unto them  (αλλα επιστειλα αυτοις). By way of contrast (αλλα). First aorist active infinitive of επιστελλω, old verb to send to one (message, letter, etc.). Our word επιστλε (επιστολη as in verse Acts 15:30) comes from this verb. In the N.T. only here, Hebrews 13:22, and possibly Acts 21:25.That they abstain from  (του απεχεσθα). The genitive of the articular infinitive of purpose, present middle (direct) of απεχω, old verb, to hold oneself back from. The best old MSS. do not have απο, but the ablative is clear enough in what follows. James agrees with Peter in his support of Paul and Barnabas in their contention for Gentile freedom from the Mosaic ceremonial law. The restrictions named by James affect the moral code that applies to all (idolatry, fornication, murder). Idolatry, fornication and murder were the outstanding sins of paganism then and now (Revelation 22:15). Harnack argues ably against the genuineness of the word πνικτου (strangled) which is absent from D Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian. It is a nice point, though the best MSS. have it in accord with Leviticus 17:10-16. The problem is whether the words were added because "blood" was understood as not "murder," but a reference to the Mosaic regulation or whether it was omitted to remove the ceremonial aspect and make it all moral and ethical. The Western text omits the word also in verse Acts 15:29. But with the word retained here and in verse Acts 15:29 the solution of James is not a compromise, though there is a wise concession to Jewish feeling.Pollutions of idols  (αλισγηματων). From αλισγεω only in the LXX and this substantive nowhere else. The word refers to idolatrous practices (pollutions) and things sacrificed to idols (ειδωλυθων) in verse Acts 15:29, not to sacrificial meat sold in the market (1 Corinthians 10:27), a matter not referred to here. Cf. Leviticus 17:1-9. All the four items in the position of James (accepting πνικτου) are mentioned in Acts 15:17; Acts 15:18.
