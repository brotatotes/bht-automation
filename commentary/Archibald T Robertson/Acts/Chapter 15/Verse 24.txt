 Certain which went from us  (τινες εξ ημων, Aleph B omit εξελθοντες). A direct blow at the Judaizers, put in delicate language (we heard ηκουσαμεν) as if only at Antioch (Acts 15:1), and not also in Jerusalem in open meeting (Acts 15:5).Have troubled you with words  (εταραξαν υμας λογοις). What a picture of turmoil in the church in Antioch, words, words, words. Aorist tense of the common verb ταρασσω, to agitate, to make the heart palpitate (John 14:1; John 14:27) and instrumental case of λογοις.Subverting your souls  (ανασκευαζοντες τας ψυχας υμων). Present active participle of ανασκευαζω, old verb (ανα and σκευος, baggage) to pack up baggage, to plunder, to ravage. Powerful picture of the havoc wrought by the Judaizers among the simple-minded Greek Christians in Antioch.To whom we gave no commandment  (οις ου διεστειλαμεθα). First aorist middle indicative of διαστελλω, old verb to draw asunder, to distinguish, to set forth distinctly, to command. This is a flat disclaimer of the whole conduct of the Judaizers in Antioch and in Jerusalem, a complete repudiation of their effort to impose the Mosaic ceremonial law upon the Gentile Christians.
