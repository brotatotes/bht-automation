 But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there  (εδοξε δε Σιλα επιμεινα αυτου). This verse is not in the Revised Version or in the text of Westcott and Hort, being absent from Aleph A B Vulgate, etc. It is clearly an addition to help explain the fact that Silas is back in Antioch in verse Acts 15:40. But the "some days" of verse Acts 15:36 afforded abundant time for him to return from Jerusalem. He and Judas went first to Jerusalem to make a report of their mission.
