 A spirit of divination  (πνευμα πυθωνα). So the correct text with accusative (apparition, a spirit, a python), not the genitive (πυθωνος). Hesychius defines it as δαιμονιον μανικον (a spirit of divination). The etymology of the word is unknown. Bengel suggests πυθεσθα from πυνθανομα, to inquire. Python was the name given to the serpent that kept guard at Delphi, slain by Apollo, who was called Πυθιος Απολλο and the prophetess at Delphi was termed Pythia. Certainly Luke does not mean to credit Apollo with a real existence (1 Corinthians 8:4). But Plutarch (A.D. 50-100) says that the term πυθωνες was applied to ventriloquists (εγγαστριμυθο). In the LXX those with familiar spirits are called by this word ventriloquists (Leviticus 19:31; Leviticus 20:6; Leviticus 20:27, including the witch of Endor 1 Samuel 28:7). It is possible that this slave girl had this gift of prophecy "by soothsaying" (μαντευομενη). Present middle participle of μαντευομα, old heathen word (in contrast with προφητευω) for acting the seer (μαντις) and this kin to μαινομα, to be mad, like the howling dervishes of later times. This is the so-called instrumental use of the circumstantial participles.Brought  (παρειχεν). Imperfect active of παρεχω, a steady source of income.Much gain  (εργασιαν πολλην). Work, business, from εργαζομα, to work.Her masters  (τοις κυριοις αυτης). Dative case. Joint owners of this poor slave girl who were exploiting her calamity, whatever it was, for selfish gain, just as men and women today exploit girls and women in the "white slave" trade. As a fortune-teller she was a valuable asset for all the credulous dupes of the community. Simon Magus in Samaria and Elymas Barjesus in Cyprus had won power and wealth as soothsayers.
