 Immediately by night  (ευθεως δια νυκτος). Paul's work had not been in vain in Thessalonica (1 Thessalonians 1:7; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Thessalonians 2:20). Paul loved the church here. Two of them, Aristarchus and Secundus, will accompany him to Jerusalem (Acts 20:4) and Aristarchus will go on with him to Rome (Acts 27:2). Plainly Paul and Silas had been in hiding in Thessalonica and in real danger. After his departure severe persecution came to the Christians in Thessalonica (1 Thessalonians 2:14; 1 Thessalonians 3:1-5; 2 Thessalonians 1:6). It is possible that there was an escort of Gentile converts with Paul and Silas on this night journey to Beroea which was about fifty miles southwest from Thessalonica near Pella in another district of Macedonia (Emathia). There is a modern town there of some 6,000 people.Went  (απηιεσαν). Imperfect third plural active of απειμ, old verb to go away, here alone in the N.T. A literary, almost Atticistic, form instead of απηλθον.Into the synagogue of the Jews  (εις την συναγωγην των Ιουδαιων). Paul's usual custom and he lost no time about it. Enough Jews here to have a synagogue.
