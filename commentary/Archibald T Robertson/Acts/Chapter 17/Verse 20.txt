 For thou bringest certain strange things  (ξενιζοντα γαρ τινα εισφερεις). The very verb used by Xenophon (Mem. I) about Socrates. Ξενιζοντα is present active neuter plural participle of ξενιζω and from ξενος (verse Acts 17:18), "things surprising or shocking us."We would know therefore  (βουλομεθα ουν γνωνα). Very polite still, we wish or desire, and repeating γνωνα (the essential point).
