 That they should seek God  (Ζητειν τον θεον). Infinitive (present active) of purpose again. Seek him, not turn away from him as the nations had done (Romans 1:18-32).If haply they might feel after him  (ε αρα γε ψηλαφησειαν αυτον). First aorist active (Aeolic form) optative of ψηλαφαω, old verb from ψαω, to touch. So used by the Risen Jesus in his challenge to the disciples (Luke 24:39), by the Apostle John of his personal contact with Jesus (1 John 1:1), of the contact with Mount Sinai (Hebrews 12:18). Here it pictures the blind groping of the darkened heathen mind after God to "find him" (ευροιεν, second aorist active optative) whom they had lost. One knows what it is in a darkened room to feel along the walls for the door (Deuteronomy 28:29; Job 5:14; Job 12:25; Isaiah 59:10). Helen Keller, when told of God, said that she knew of him already, groping in the dark after him. The optative here with ε is due to the condition of the fourth class (undetermined, but with vague hope of being determined) with aim also present (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1021). Note also αρα γε the inferential particle αρα with the delicate intensive particle γε.Though he is not far from each one of us  (κα γε ου μακραν απο ενος εκαστου ημων υπαρχοντα). More exactly with B L (κα γε instead of καιτο or καιτο γε), "and yet being not far from each one of us," a direct statement rather than a concessive one. The participle υπαρχοντα agrees with αυτον and the negative ου rather than the usual με with the participle makes an emphatic negative. Note also the intensive particle γε.
