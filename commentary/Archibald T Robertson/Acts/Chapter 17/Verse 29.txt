 We ought not to think  (ουκ οφειλομεν νομιζειν). It is a logical conclusion (ουν, therefore) from the very language of Aratus and Cleanthes.That the Godhead is like  (το θειον εινα ομοιον). Infinitive with accusative of general reference in indirect discourse. Το θειον is strictly "the divine" nature like θειοτης (Romans 1:20) rather than like θεοτης (Colossians 2:9). Paul may have used το θειον here to get back behind all their notions of various gods to the real nature of God. The Athenians may even have used the term themselves. After ομοιος (like) the associative instrumental case is used as with χρυσωι, αργυρωι, λιθω.Graven by art and device of man  (χαραγματ τεχνης κα ενθυμησεως ανθρωπου). Apposition with preceding and so χαραγματ in associative instrumental case. Literally, graven work or sculpture from χαρασσω, to engrave, old word, but here alone in N.T. outside of Revelation (the mark of the beast). Graven work of art (τεχνης) or external craft, and of thought or device (ενθυμησεως) or internal conception of man.
