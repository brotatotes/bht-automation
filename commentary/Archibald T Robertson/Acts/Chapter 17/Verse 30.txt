 The times of ignorance  (τους χρονους της αγνοιας). The times before full knowledge of God came in Jesus Christ. Paul uses the very word for their ignorance (αγνοουντες) employed in verse Acts 17:23.Overlooked  (υπεριδων). Second aorist active participle of υπεροραω or υπερειδω, old verb to see beyond, not to see, to overlook, not "to wink at" of the Authorized Version with the notion of condoning. Here only in the N.T. It occurs in the LXX in the sense of overlooking or neglecting (Psalms 18:62; Psalms 55:1). But it has here only a negative force. God has all the time objected to the polytheism of the heathen, and now he has made it plain. In Wisdom 11:23 we have these words: "Thou overlookest the sins of men to the end they may repent."But now  (τα νυν). Accusative of general reference, "as to the now things or situation." All is changed now that Christ has come with the full knowledge of God. See also Acts 27:22.All everywhere  (παντας πανταχου). No exceptions anywhere.Repent  (μετανοειν). Present active infinitive of μετανοεω in indirect command, a permanent command of perpetual force. See on μετανοεω Acts 2:38 and the Synoptic Gospels. This word was the message of the Baptist, of Jesus, of Peter, of Paul, this radical change of attitude and life.
