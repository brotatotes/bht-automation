 They troubled the multitude and the rulers  (εταραξαν τον οχλον κα τους πολιταρχας). First aorist active of ταρασσω, old verb to agitate. The excitement of the multitude "agitated" the politarchs still more. To the people it meant a revolution, to the politarchs a charge of complicity in treason if they let it pass. They had no way to disprove the charge of treason and Paul and Silas were not present.
