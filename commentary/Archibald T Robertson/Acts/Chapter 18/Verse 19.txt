This great city on the Cayster, the capital of the Province of Asia, the home of the worship of Diana (Artemis) with a wonderful temple, Paul at last had reached, though forbidden to come on the way out on this tour (Acts 16:6). Here Paul will spend three years after his return from Jerusalem.He left them there  (κακεινους κατελιπεν αυτου). That is, Priscilla and Aquila he left (second aorist active indicative) here (αυτου). But Luke mentions the departure by way of anticipation before he actually went away (verse Acts 18:21).But he himself  (αυτος δε). Paul again the leading person in the narrative. On this occasion he may have gone alone into the synagogue.He reasoned  (διελεξατο). Luke's favourite word for Paul's synagogue discourses (Acts 17:2; Acts 17:17; Acts 18:4 which see) as also Acts 19:8; Acts 19:9.
