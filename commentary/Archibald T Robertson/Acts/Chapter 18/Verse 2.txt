 Aquila  (Ακυλαν). Luke calls him a Jew from Pontus, apparently not yet a disciple, though there were Jews from Pontus at the great Pentecost who were converted (Acts 2:9). Aquila who made the famous A.D. translation of the O.T. was also from Pontus. Paul "found" (ευρων, second aorist active participle of ευρισκω) though we do not know how. Edersheim says that a Jewish guild always kept together whether in street or synagogue so that by this bond they probably met.Lately come from Italy  (προσφατως εληλυθοτα απο της Ιταλιας). Second perfect participle of ερχομα. Koine adverb, here only in the N.T., from adjective προσφατος (προ, σφαω or σφαζω, to kill), lately slaughtered and so fresh or recent (Hebrews 10:20).With his wife Priscilla  (κα Πρισκιλλαν γυναικα αυτου). Diminutive of Πρισκα (Romans 16:3; 1 Corinthians 16:19). Prisca is a name in the Acilian family and the Prisci was the name of another noble clan. Aquila may have been a freedman like many Jews in Rome. Her name comes before his in verses Acts 18:18; Acts 18:26; Romans 16:3; 2 Timothy 4:9.Because Claudius had commanded  (δια το διατεταχενα Κλαυδιον). Perfect active articular infinitive of διατασσω, old verb to dispose, arrange, here with accusative of general reference. Δια here is causal sense, "because of the having ordered as to Claudius." This was about A.D. 49, done, Suetonius says (Claudius C. 25), because "the Jews were in a state of constant tumult at the instigation of one Chrestus" (probably among the Jews about Christ so pronounced). At any rate Jews were unpopular in Rome for Tiberius had deported 4,000 to Sardinia. There were 20,000 Jews in Rome. Probably mainly those implicated in the riots actually left.
