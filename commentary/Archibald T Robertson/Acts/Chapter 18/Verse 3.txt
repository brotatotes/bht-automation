 Because he was of the same trade  (δια το ομοτεχνον εινα). Same construction with δια as above. Hομοτεχνον is an old word (ομοσ, τεχνη), though here alone in N.T. Rabbi Judah says: "He that teacheth not his son a trade, doth the same as if he taught him to be a thief." So it was easy for Paul to find a home with these "tentmakers by trade" (σκηνοιποιο τη τεχνη). Late word from σκηνη and ποιεω, here only in the N.T. They made portable tents of leather or of cloth of goat's hair. So Paul lived in this home with this noble man and his wife, all the more congenial if already Christians which they soon became at any rate. They worked as partners in the common trade. Paul worked for his support elsewhere, already in Thessalonica (1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8) and later at Ephesus with Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:18; Acts 18:26; Acts 20:34; 1 Corinthians 16:19). They moved again to Rome (Romans 16:3) and were evidently a couple of considerable wealth and generosity. It was a blessing to Paul to find himself with these people. So he "abode" (εμενεν, imperfect active) with them and "they wrought" (ηργαζοντο, imperfect middle), happy and busy during week days.
