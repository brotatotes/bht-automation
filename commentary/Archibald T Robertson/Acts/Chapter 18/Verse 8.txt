 Crispus  (Κρισπος). Though a Jew and ruler of the synagogue (cf. Acts 13:15), he had a Latin name. Paul baptized him (1 Corinthians 1:14) himself, perhaps because of his prominence, apparently letting Silas and Timothy baptize most of the converts (1 Corinthians 1:14-17). Probably he followed Paul to the house of Titus Justus. It looked like ruin for the synagogue.With all his house  (συν ολω τω οικω αυτου). Another household conversion, for Crispus "believed (επιστευσεν) in the Lord with all his house."Hearing believed and were baptized  (ακουοντες επιστευον κα εβαπτιζοντο). Present active participle and imperfect indicatives active and passive, expressing repetition for the "many" others who kept coming to the Lord in Corinth. It was a continual revival after Silas and Timothy came and a great church was gathered here during the nearly two years that Paul laboured in Corinth (possibly A.D. 51 and 52).
