 Purposed in the spirit  (εθετο εν τω πνευματ). Second aorist middle indicative for mental action and "spirit" expressed also. A new stage in Paul's career begins here, a new division of the Acts.Passed through  (διελθων). Word (διερχομα) used ten times in Acts (cf. Acts 19:1) of missionary journeys (Ramsay).Macedonia and Achaia  (την Μακεδονιαν κα Αχαιαν). This was the way that he actually went, but originally he had planned to go to Achaia (Corinth) and then to Macedonia, as he says in 2 Corinthians 1:15, but he had now changed that purpose, perhaps because of the bad news from Corinth. Already when he wrote I Corinthians he proposed to go first to Macedonia (1 Corinthians 16:5-7). He even hoped to spend the winter in Corinth "if the Lord permit" and to remain in Ephesus till Pentecost, neither of which things he did.I must also see Rome  (δε με κα Ρωμην ιδειν). This section of Acts begins with Rome in the horizon of Paul's plans and the book closes with Paul in Rome (Rackham). Here he feels the necessity of going as in Romans 1:15 he feels himself "debtor" to all including "those in Rome" (Romans 1:16). Paul had long desired to go to Rome (Romans 1:10), but had been frequently hindered (Romans 1:13), but he has definitely set his face to go to Rome and on to Spain (Romans 15:23-29). Paley calls sharp attention to this parallel between Acts 19:21 and Romans 1:10-15; Romans 15:23-29. Rome had a fascination for Paul as the home of Aquila and Priscilla and numerous other friends (Acts 19:16), but chiefly as the capital of the Roman Empire and a necessary goal in Paul's ambition to win it to Jesus Christ. His great work in Asia had stirred afresh in him the desire to do his part for Rome. He wrote to Rome from Corinth not long after this and in Jerusalem Jesus in vision will confirm the necessity (δε) that Paul see Rome (Acts 23:11).
