 No small stir  (ταραχος ουκ ολιγος). Same phrase in Acts 12:18 and nowhere else in the N.T. Litotes.Concerning the Way  (περ της οδου). See this phrase for Christianity in Acts 9:2; Acts 19:9; Acts 24:22 which see, like the "Jesus Way" of the Indians. There had already been opposition and "stir" before this stage (cf. Acts 19:11-20). The fight with wild beasts in 1 Corinthians 15:32 (whatever it was) was before that Epistle was written and so before this new uproar. Paul as a Roman citizen could not be thrown to wild beasts, but he so pictured the violent opponents of Christ in Ephesus.
