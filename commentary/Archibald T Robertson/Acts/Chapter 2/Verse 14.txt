 Standing up with the eleven  (σταθεις συν τοις ενδεκα). Took his stand with the eleven including Matthias, who also rose up with them, and spoke as their spokesman, a formal and impressive beginning. The Codex Bezae has "ten apostles." Luke is fond of this pictorial use of σταθεις (first aorist passive participle of ιστημ) as seen nowhere else in the N.T. (Luke 18:11; Luke 18:40; Luke 19:8; Acts 5:20; Acts 17:22; Acts 27:21).Lifted up his voice  (επηρεν την φωνην αυτου). This phrase only in Luke in the N.T. (Luke 11:29; Acts 2:14; Acts 14:11; Acts 22:22), but is common in the old writers. First aorist active indicative of επαιρω. The large crowd and the confusion of tongues demanded loud speaking. "This most solemn, earnest, yet sober speech" (Bengel). Codex Bezae adds "first" after "voice." Peter did it to win and hold attention.Give ear unto my words  (ενωτισασθε τα ρηματα μου). Late verb in LXX and only here in the N.T. First aorist middle from ενωτιζομα (εν, ους, ear) to give ear to, receive into the ear. People's ears differ greatly, but in public speech they have to be reached through the ear. That puts an obligation on the speaker and also on the auditors who should sit where they can hear with the ears which they have, an obligation often overlooked.
