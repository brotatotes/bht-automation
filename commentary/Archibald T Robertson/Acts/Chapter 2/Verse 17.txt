 In the last days  (εν ταις εσχαταις ημεραις). Joel does not have precisely these words, but he defines "those days" as being "the day of the Lord" (cf. Isaiah 2:2; Micah 4:1).I will pour forth  (εκχεω). Future active indicative of εκχεω. This future like εδομα and πιομα is without tense sign, probably like the present in the futuristic sense (Robertson, Grammar, p. 354). Westcott and Hort put a different accent on the future, but the old Greek had no accent. The old Greek had εκχευσω. This verb means to pour out.Of my Spirit  (απο του πνευματος). This use of απο (of) is either because of the variety in the manifestations of the Spirit (Acts 2:1) or because the Spirit in his entirety remains with God (Holtzmann, Wendt). But the Hebrew has it: "I will pour out my Spirit" without the partitive idea in the LXX.And your daughters  (κα α θυγατερες υμων). Anna is called a prophetess in Luke 2:36 and the daughters of Philip prophesy (Acts 21:9) and verse Acts 2:18 (handmaidens). See also 1 Corinthians 11:5 (προφητουσα).Visions  (ορασεις). Late word for the more common οραμα, both from οραω, to see. In Revelation 4:3 it means appearance, but in Revelation 9:17 as here an ecstatic revelation or vision.Dream dreams  (ενυπνιοις ενυπνιασθησοντα). Shall dream with (instrumental case) dreams. First future passive of ενυπνιαζω from ενυπνιος (εν and υπνος, in sleep), a common late word. Only here in the N.T. (this from Joel as all these verses Acts 2:17-21 are) and Jude 1:8.Yea and  (κα γε). Intensive particle γε added to κα (and), an emphatic addition (=Hebrew vegam).Servants  (δουλους),handmaidens  (δουλας). Slaves, actual slaves of men. The humblest classes will receive the Spirit of God (cf. 1 Corinthians 1:26-31). But the word "prophesy" here is not in the LXX (or the Hebrew).
