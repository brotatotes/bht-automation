 Wonders  (τερατα). Apparently akin to the verb τηρεω, to watch like a wonder in the sky,miracle  (μιραχυλυμ), marvel, portent. In the New Testament the word occurs only in the plural and only in connection with σημεια (signs) as here and in verse Acts 2:43. Butsigns  (σημεια) here is not in the LXX. See on Matthew 11:20. In verse Acts 2:22 all three words occur together: powers, wonders, signs (δυναμεσι, τερασι, σημειοις).As above  (ανω). This word is not in the LXX nor is "beneath" (κατω), both probably being added to make clearer the contrast between heaven and earth.Blood and fire and vapour of smoke  (αιμα κα πυρ κα ατμιδα καπνου). A chiasm as these words illustrate bloodshed and destruction by fire as signs here on earth.
