 When he was gone up  (αναβας). Second aorist active participle in sharp contrast to καταβας (went down) of verse Acts 20:10.Had broken bread  (κλασας τον αρτον). Probably the Eucharist to observe which ordinance Paul had come and tarried (verse Acts 20:7), though some scholars distinguish between what took place in verse Acts 20:7 and verse Acts 20:11, needlessly so as was stated on verse Acts 20:7.And eaten  (κα γευσαμενος). The word is used in Acts 10:10 of eating an ordinary meal and so might apply to the Αγαπη, but it suits equally for the Eucharist. The accident had interrupted Paul's sermon so that it was observed now and then Paul resumed his discourse.And had talked with them a long while  (εφ' ικανον τε ομιλησας). Luke, as we have seen, is fond of ικανος for periods of time, for a considerable space of time, "even till break of day" (αχρ αυγης). Old word for brightness, radiance like German Auge, English eye, only here in the N.T. Occurs in the papyri and in modern Greek for dawn. This second discourse lasted from midnight till dawn and was probably more informal (as in Acts 10:27) and conversational (ομιλησας, though our word homiletics comes from ομιλεω) than the discourse before midnight (διαλεγομα, verses Acts 20:7; Acts 20:9). He had much to say before he left.So he departed  (ουτως εξηλθεν). Thus Luke sums up the result. Paul left (went forth) only after all the events narrated by the numerous preceding participles had taken place. Effective aorist active indicative εξελθεν. Hουτως here equals τυμ δεμυμ, now at length (Acts 27:7) as Page shows.
