 Those parts  (τα μερη εκεινα). We have no way of knowing why Luke did not tell of Paul's stay in Troas (2 Corinthians 2:12) nor of meeting Titus in Macedonia (2 Corinthians 2:13-7) nor of Paul's visit to Illyricum (Romans 15:19) to give time for II Corinthians to do its work (Acts 20:2), one of the most stirring experiences in Paul's whole career when he opened his heart to the Corinthians and won final victory in the church by the help of Titus who also helped him round up the great collection in Achaia. He wrote II Corinthians during this period after Titus arrived from Corinth. The unity of II Corinthians is here assumed. Paul probably met Luke again in Macedonia, but all this is passed by except by the general phrase: "had given them much exhortation" (παρακαλεσας αυτους λογω πολλω). Literally, "having exhorted them (the Macedonian brethren) with much talk" (instrumental case).Into Greece  (εις την Hελλαδα). That is, Achaia (Acts 18:12; Acts 19:21), and particularly Corinth, whither he had at last come again after repeated attempts, pauses, and delays (2 Corinthians 13:1). Now at last the coast was clear and Paul apparently had an open door in Corinth during these three months, so completely had Titus at last done away with the opposition of the Judaizers there.
