 Testifying  (διαμαρτυρομενος). As Peter did (Acts 2:40) where Luke uses this same word thoroughly Lucan and Pauline. So again in verses Acts 20:23; Acts 20:24. Paul here as in Romans 1:16 includes both Jews and Greeks, to the Jew first.Repentance toward God  (την εις θεον μετανοιαν)and faith toward our Lord Jesus  (κα πιστιν εις τον κυριον ημων Ιησουν). These two elements run through the Epistle to the Romans which Paul had recently written and sent from Corinth. These two elements appear in all Paul's preaching whether "to Jews or Gentiles, to philosophers at Athens or to peasants at Lystra, he preached repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus" (Knowling).
