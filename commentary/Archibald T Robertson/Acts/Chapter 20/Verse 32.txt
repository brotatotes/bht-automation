 And now  (κα τα νυν). Same phrase as in verses Acts 20:22; Acts 20:25 save that ιδου (behold) is wanting and the article τα occurs before νυν, accusative of general reference. And as to the present things (or situation) as in Acts 4:29.I commend  (παρατιθεμα). Present middle indicative of παρατιθημ, old verb to place beside, middle, to deposit with one, to interest as in 1 Timothy 1:18; 2 Timothy 2:2. Paul can now only do this, but he does it hopefully. Cf. 1 Peter 4:19.The word of his grace  (τω λογω της χαριτος αυτου). The instrumentality through preaching and the Holy Spirit employed by God. Cf. Colossians 4:6; Ephesians 4:29.Which is able to build up  (τω δυναμενω οικοδομησα). God works through the word of his grace and so it is able to build up (edify); a favourite Pauline word (1 Corinthians 3:10-14; 1 Corinthians 3:9; 2 Corinthians 5:1; Ephesians 2:20-22; 2 Timothy 3:15; etc.), and James 1:21. The very words "build" and "inheritance among the sanctified" will occur in Ephesians 1:11; Ephesians 2:30; Ephesians 3:18 and which some may recall on reading. Cf. Colossians 1:12. Stephen in Acts 7:5 used the word "inheritance" (κληρονομιαν), nowhere else in Acts, but in Ephesians 1:14; Ephesians 1:18; Ephesians 5:5. In Ephesians 1:18 the very expression occurs "his inheritance among the saints " (την κληρονομιαν αυτου εν τοις αγιοις).
