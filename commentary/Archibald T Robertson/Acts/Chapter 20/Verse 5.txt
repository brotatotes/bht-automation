 Were waiting for us in Troas  (εμενον ημας εν Τροιαδ). Here again we have "us" for the first time since chapter 16 where Paul was with Luke in Philippi. Had Luke remained all this time in Philippi? We do not know, but he is with Paul now till Rome is reached. The seven brethren of verse Acts 20:4 went on ahead from Philippi to Troas while Paul remained with Luke in Philippi.
