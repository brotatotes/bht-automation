 What are you doing weeping?  (Τ ποιειτε κλαιοντεσ?) Strong protest as in Mark 11:5.Breaking my heart  (συνθρυπτοντες μου την καρδιαν). The verb συνθρυπτω, to crush together, is late Koine for αποθρυπτω, to break off, both vivid and expressive words. So to enervate and unman one, weakening Paul's determination to go on with his duty.I am ready  (Εγω ετοιμως εχω). I hold (myself) in readiness (adverb, ετοιμως). Same idiom in 2 Corinthians 12:14.Not only to be bound  (ου μονον δεθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of δεω and note ου μονον rather than μη μονον, the usual negative of the infinitive because of the sharp contrast (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1095). Paul's readiness to die, if need be, at Jerusalem is like that of Jesus on the way to Jerusalem the last time. Even before that Luke (Acts 9:51) said that "he set his face to go on to Jerusalem." Later the disciples will say to Jesus, "Master, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither?" (John 11:8). The stature of Paul rises here to heroic proportions "for the name of the Lord Jesus" (υπερ του ονοματος του κυριου Ιησου).
