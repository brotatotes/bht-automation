 When he would not be persuaded  (μη πειθομενου αυτου). Genitive absolute of the present passive participle of πειθω. Literally, "he not being persuaded." That was all. Paul's will (καρδια) was not broken, not even bent.We ceased  (ησυχασαμεν). Ingressive aorist active indicative of ησυχαζω, old verb to be quiet, silent.The will of the Lord be done  (του κυριου το θελημα γινεσθω). Present middle imperative of γινομα. There is a quaint naivete in this confession by the friends of Paul. Since Paul would not let them have their way, they were willing for the Lord to have his way, acquiescence after failure to have theirs.
