 The day following  (τη επιουση). As in Acts 20:15 which see.Went in  (εισηιε). Imperfect active of εισειμ, old classic verb used only four times in the N.T. (Acts 3:3; Acts 21:18; Acts 21:26; Hebrews 9:6), a mark of the literary style rather than the colloquial Koine use of εισερχομα. Together with us to James (συν ημιν προς Ιακωβον). So then Luke is present. The next use of "we" is in Acts 27:1 when they leave Caesarea for Rome, but it is not likely that Luke was away from Paul in Jerusalem and Caesarea. The reports of what was done and said in both places is so full and minute that it seems reasonable that Luke got first hand information here whatever his motive was for so full an account of these legal proceedings to be discussed later. There are many details that read like an eye witness's story (Acts 21:30; Acts 21:35; Acts 21:40; Acts 22:2; Acts 22:3; Acts 23:12, etc.). It was probably the house of James (προς and παρα so used often).And all the elders were present  (παντες τε παρεγενοντο ο πρεσβυτερο). Clearly James is the leading elder and the others are his guests in a formal reception to Paul. It is noticeable that the apostles are not mentioned, though both elders and apostles are named at the Conference in chapter 15. It would seem that the apostles are away on preaching tours. The whole church was not called together probably because of the known prejudice against Paul created by the Judaizers.
