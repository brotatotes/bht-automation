 That we had accomplished the days  (εξαρτισα ημας τας ημερας). First aorist active infinitive of εξαρτιζω, to furnish perfectly, rare in ancient writers, but fairly frequent in the papyri. Only twice in the N.T., here and 2 Timothy 3:17. Finish the exact number of days (seven) of verse Acts 21:4. The accusative of general reference ημας is the usual construction and the infinitive clause is the subject of εγενετο. We departed and went on our journey (εξελθοντες επορευομεθα). Sharp distinction between the first aorist active participle εξελθοντες (from εξερχομα, to go out) and the imperfect middle επορευομεθα from πορευω (we were going on).And they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way  (προπεμποντων ημας παντων συν γυναιξ κα τεκνοις). No "and" in the Greek, simply genitive absolute, "They all with wives and children accompanying us," just as at Miletus (Acts 20:28), same verb προπεμπω which see. The first mention of children in connection with the apostolic churches (Vincent). Vivid picture here as at Miletus, evident touch of an eyewitness.Till we were out of the city  (εως εξω της πολεως). Note both adverbial prepositions (εως εξω) clear outside of the city.
