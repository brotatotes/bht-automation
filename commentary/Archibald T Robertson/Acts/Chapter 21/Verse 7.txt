 Had finished  (διανυσαντες). First aorist active participle of διανυω, old verb to accomplish (ανυω) thoroughly (δια), only here in the N.T.From Tyre  (απο Τυρου). Page takes (Hackett also) with κατηντησαμεν (we arrived) rather than with "τον πλουν" (the voyage) and with good reason: "And we, having (thereby) finished the voyage, arrived from Tyre at Ptolemais." Ptolemais is the modern Acre, called Accho in Judges 1:31. The harbour is the best on the coast of Palestine and is surrounded by mountains. It is about thirty miles south of Tyre. It was never taken by Israel and was considered a Philistine town and the Greeks counted it a Phoenician city. It was the key to the road down the coast between Syria and Egypt and had successively the rule of the Ptolemies, Syrians, Romans.Saluted  (ασπασαμενο). Here greeting as in Acts 21:19 rather than farewell as in Acts 20:1. The stay was short, one day (ημεραν μιαν, accusative), but "the brethren" Paul and his party found easily. Possibly the scattered brethren (Acts 11:19) founded the church here or Philip may have done it.
