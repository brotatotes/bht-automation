 I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles  (Εγω εις εθνη μακραν εξαποστελω σε). Future active of the double (εξ, out, απο, off or away) compound of εξαποστελλω, common word in the Koine (cf. Luke 24:49). This is a repetition by Jesus of the call given in Damascus through Ananias (Acts 9:15). Paul had up till now avoided the word Gentiles, but at last it had to come, "the fatal word" (Farrar).
