 I fell  (επεσα). Second aorist active indicative with -α rather than επεσον, the usual form of πιπτω.Unto the ground  (εις το εδαφος). Old word, here alone in N.T. So the verb εδαφιζω, is in Luke 19:44 alone in the N.T.A voice saying  (φωνης λεγουσης). Genitive after ηκουσα, though in Acts 26:14 the accusative is used after ηκουσα, as in Acts 22:14 after ακουσα, either being allowable. See on Acts 9:7 for discussion of the difference in case. Saul's name repeated each time (Acts 9:4; Acts 22:7; Acts 26:14). Same question also in each report: "Why persecuted thou me?" (Τ με διωκεισ?). These piercing words stuck in Paul's mind.
