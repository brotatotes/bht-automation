 Most excellent  (κρατιστω). See on Luke 1:3 to Theophilus though not in Acts 1:1. It is usual in addressing men of rank as here, like our "Your Excellency" in Acts 24:3 and Paul uses it to Festus in Acts 26:25.Greeting  (χαιρειν). Absolute infinitive with independent or absolute nominative (Κλαυδιος Λυσιας) as is used in letters (Acts 15:23; James 1:1) and in countless papyri (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1092).
