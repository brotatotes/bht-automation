 Concerning questions of their law  (περ ζητηματα του νομου αυτων). The very distinction drawn by Gallio in Corinth (Acts 18:14). On the word see on Acts 15:2.But to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds  (μηδεν δε αξιον θανατου η δεσμων εχοντα ενκλημα). Literally, "having no accusation (or crime) worthy of death or of bonds." This phrase here only in the N.T. Εγκλημα is old word for accusation or crime from εγκαλεω used in verse Acts 23:28 and in the N.T. only here and Acts 25:16. Lysias thus expresses the opinion that Paul ought to be set free and the lenient treatment that Paul received in Caesarea and Rome (first imprisonment) is probably due to this report of Lysias. Every Roman magistrate before whom Paul appears declares him innocent (Gallio, Lysias, Felix, Festus).
