 Thou whited wall  (τοιχε κεκονιαμενε). Perfect passive participle of κονιαω (from κονια, dust or lime). The same word used in Matthew 23:27 for "whited sepulchres" (ταφο κεκονιαμενο) which see. It is a picturesque way of calling Ananias a hypocrite, undoubtedly true, but not a particularly tactful thing for a prisoner to say to his judge, not to say Jewish high priest. Besides, Paul had hurled back at him the word τυπτειν (smite) in his command, putting it first in the sentence (τυπτειν σε μελλε ο θεος) in strong emphasis. Clearly Paul felt that he, not Ananias, was living as a good citizen in God's commonwealth.And sittest thou to judge me?  (Κα συ καθη κρινων με?) Literally, "And thou (being what thou art) art sitting (καθη, second person singular middle of καθημα, late form for καθησα, the uncontracted form) judging me." Cf. Luke 22:30. Κα συ at the beginning of a question expresses indignation.Contrary to the law  (παρανομων). Present active participle of παρανομεω, old verb to act contrary to the law, here alone in the N.T., "acting contrary to the law."
