Paul takes it up and repeats it.Not more than twelve days  (ου πλειους ημερα δωδεκα). Here η (than) is absent without change of case to the ablative as usually happens. But this idiom is found in the Koine (Robertson, Grammar, p. 666).Since  (αφ' ης). Supply ημερας, "from which day."To worship  (προσκυνησων). One of the few examples of the future participle of purpose so common in the old Attic.
