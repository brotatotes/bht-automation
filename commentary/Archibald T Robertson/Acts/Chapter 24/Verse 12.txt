 Disputing  (διαλεγομενον). Simply conversing, discussing, arguing, and then disputing, common verb in old Greek and in N.T. (especially in Acts).Stirring up a crowd  (επιστασιν ποιουντα οχλου). Επιστασις is a late word from εφιστημ, to make an onset or rush. Only twice in the N.T., 2 Corinthians 11:28 (the pressure or care of the churches) and here (making a rush of a crowd). The papyri give examples also for "onset." So Paul denies the two charges that were serious and the only one that concerned Roman law (insurrection).
