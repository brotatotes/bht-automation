 That there shall be a resurrection  (αναστασιν μελλειν εσεσθα). Indirect assertion with infinitive and accusative of general reference (αναστασιν) after the word ελπιδα (hope). The future infinitive εσεσθα after μελλειν is also according to rule, μελλω being followed by either present, aorist, or future infinitive (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 870, 877, 878).Both of the just and the unjust  (δικαιων τε κα αδικων). Apparently at the same time as in John 5:29 (cf. Acts 17:31). Gardner thinks that Luke here misrepresents Paul who held to no resurrection save for those "in Christ," a mistaken interpretation of Paul in my opinion. The Talmud teaches the resurrection of Israelites only, but Paul was more than a Pharisee.
