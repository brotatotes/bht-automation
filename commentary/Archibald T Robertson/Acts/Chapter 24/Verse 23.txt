 And should have indulgence  (εχειν τε ανεσιν). From ανιημ, to let loose, release, relax. Old word, in the N.T. only here and 2 Thessalonians 1:7; 2 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 7:5; 2 Corinthians 8:13. It is the opposite of strict confinement, though under guard, "kept in charge" (τηρεισθα).Forbid  (κωλυειν). To hinder "no one of his friends" (μηδενα των ιδιων). No one of Paul's "own" (cf. Acts 4:23; John 1:11) or intimates. Of these we know the names of Luke, Aristarchus, Trophimus, Philip the Evangelist.
