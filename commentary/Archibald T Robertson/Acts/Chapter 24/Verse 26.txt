 He hoped withal  (αμα κα ελπιζων). "At the same time also hoping." Paul had mentioned the "alms" (Acts 24:17) and that excited the avarice of Felix for "money" (χρηματα). Roman law demanded exile and confiscation for a magistrate who accepted bribes, but it was lax in the provinces. Felix had doubtless received them before. Josephus (Ant. XX. 8, 9) represents Felix as greedy for money.The oftener  (πυκνοτερον). Comparative adverb of πυκνος, old word, in N.T. only here and Luke 5:33 which see and 1 Timothy 5:23. Kin to πυγμη (Mark 7:3) which see from πυκω, thick, dense, compact. Paul kept on not offering a bribe, but Felix continued to have hopes (present tense ελπιζων), kept on sending for him (present tense μεταπεμπομενος), and kept on communing (imperfect active ωμιλε from ομιλεω, old word as in Acts 20:11; Luke 24:14, which see, only N.T. examples of this word). But he was doomed to disappointment. He was never terrified again.
