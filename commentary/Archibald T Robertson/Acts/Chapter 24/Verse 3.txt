 In all ways and in all places  (παντη τε κα πανταχου). Παντη, old adverb of manner only here in N.T. Πανταχου also old adverb of place, several times in N.T. But these adverbs most likely go with the preceding clause about "reforms" rather than as here translated with "we accept" (αποδεχομεθα). But "with all gratitude" (μετα πασης ευχαριστιας) does naturally go with αποδεχομεθα.
