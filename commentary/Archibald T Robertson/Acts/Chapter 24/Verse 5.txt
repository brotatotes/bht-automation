 For we have found  (ευροντες γαρ). Second aorist active participle of ευρισκω, but without a principal verb in the sentence. Probably we have here only a "summary of the charges against Paul" (Page).A pestilent fellow  (λοιμον). An old word for pest, plague, pestilence, Paul the pest. In N.T. only here and Luke 21:11 (λοιμο κα λιμο, pestilences and famines) which see. Latin pestis. Think of the greatest preacher of the ages being branded a pest by a contemporary hired lawyer.A mover of insurrections  (κινουντα στασεις). This was an offence against Roman law if it could be proven. "Plotted against at Damascus, plotted against at Jerusalem, expelled from Pisidian Antioch, stoned at Lystra, scourged and imprisoned at Philippi, accused of treason at Thessalonica, haled before the proconsul at Corinth, cause of a serious riot at Ephesus, and now finally of a riot at Jerusalem" (Furneaux). Specious proof could have been produced, but was not. Tertullus went on to other charges with which a Roman court had no concern (instance Gallio in Corinth).Throughout the world  (κατα την οικουμενην). The Roman inhabited earth (γην) as in Acts 17:6.A ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes  (πρωτοστατην της των Ναζωραιων αιρεσεως). Πρωτοστατης is an old word in common use from πρωτος and ιστημ, a front-rank man, a chief, a champion. Here only in the N.T. This charge is certainly true. About "sect" (αιρεσις) see on Acts 5:17. Ναζωραιο here only in the plural in the N.T., elsewhere of Jesus (Matthew 2:23; Matthew 26:71; Luke 18:37; John 18:5; John 18:7; John 19:19; Acts 2:22; Acts 3:6; Acts 4:10; Acts 6:14; Acts 22:8; Acts 26:9). The disciple is not above his Master. There was a sneer in the term as applied to Jesus and here to his followers.
