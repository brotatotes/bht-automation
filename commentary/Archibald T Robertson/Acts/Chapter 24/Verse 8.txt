 From whom  (παρ' ου). Referring to Paul, but in the Textus Receptus referring to Lysias.By examining him thyself  (αυτος ανακρινας). Not by torture, since Paul was a Roman citizen, but by hearing what Paul has to say in defence of himself. Ανακρινω is to examine thoroughly up and down as in Luke 23:14.
