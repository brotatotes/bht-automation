 I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat  (Hεστως επ του βηματος Καισαρος ειμ). Periphrastic present perfect indicative (εστως ειμ), second perfect participle εστως of ιστημ (intransitive). Paul means to say that he is a Roman citizen before a Roman tribunal. Festus was the representative of Caesar and had no right to hand him over to a Jewish tribunal. Festus recognized this by saying to Paul "wilt thou" (θελεις).Where I ought to be judged  (ου με δε κρινεσθα). Rather, "Where I must be judged," for δε expresses necessity (it is necessary). Paul exposes the conduct of Festus with merciless precision.As thou also very well knowest  (ως κα συ καλλιον επιγινωσκεις). "As thou also dost understand (hast additional knowledge, επιγινωσκεις) better" (than thou art willing to admit). That this is Paul's meaning by the use of the comparative καλλιον (positive καλως) is made plain by the confession of Festus to Agrippa in verse Acts 25:18. Paul says that Festus knows that he has done no wrong to the Jews at all (ουδεν ηδικηκα) and yet he is trying to turn him over to the wrath of the Jews in Jerusalem.
