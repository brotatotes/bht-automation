 When he was come  (παραγενομενου αυτου). Genitive absolute of common verb παραγινομα (cf. Acts 24:24).Which had come down  (ο καταβεβηκοτες). Perfect active participle of καταβαινω. They had come down on purpose at the invitation of Festus (verse Acts 25:5), and were now ready.Stood round about him  (περιεστησαν αυτον). Second aorist (ingressive) active (intransitive) of περιιστημ, old verb, "Took their stand around him," "periculum intentantes" (Bengel). Cf. Luke 23:10 about Christ. They have no lawyer this time, but they mass their forces so as to impress Festus.Bringing against him  (καταφεροντες). Bearing down on. See on Acts 20:9; Acts 26:10, only N.T. examples of this ancient verb.Many and grievous charges  (πολλα κα βαρεα αιτιωματα). This word αιτιωμα for old form αιτιαμα is found in one papyrus (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary) in sense of "blame." But the charges were no "heavier" than those made by Tertullus (Acts 24:5-8). Paul's reply proves this and they were also probably on court record (Furneaux). See this adjective βαρυς (heavy) used with λυκο (wolves) in Acts 20:29.Which they could not prove  (α ουκ ισχυον αποδειξα). Imperfect active of ισχυω, to have strength or power as in Acts 19:16; Acts 19:20. Repetition and reiteration and vehemence took the place of proof (αποδειξα, first aorist active infinitive of αποδεικνυμ, to show forth, old verb, in N.T. only here, Acts 2:22 which see and 1 Corinthians 4:9).
