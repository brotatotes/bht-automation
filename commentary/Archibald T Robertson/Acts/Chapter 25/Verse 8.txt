 While Paul said in his defence  (του Παυλου απολογουμενου). Genitive absolute again, present middle participle of απολογεομα, old verb to make defence as in Acts 19:33; Acts 24:10; Acts 26:1; Acts 26:2. The recitative οτ of the Greek before a direct quotation is not reproduced in English.Have I sinned at all  (τ ημαρτον). Constative aorist active indicative of αμαρτανω, to miss, to sin. The τ is cognate accusative (or adverbial accusative). Either makes sense. Paul sums up the charges under the three items of law of the Jews, the temple, the Roman state (Caesar). This last was the one that would interest Festus and, if proved, would render Paul guilty of treason (μαjεστας). Nero was Emperor A.D. 54-68, the last of the emperors with any hereditary claim to the name "Caesar." Soon it became merely a title like Kaiser and Czar (modern derivatives). In Acts only "Caesar" and "Augustus" are employed for the Emperor, not "King" (Βασιλευς) as from the time of Domitian. Paul's denial is complete and no proof had been presented. Luke was apparently present at the trial.
