 Thou art permitted  (επιτρεπετα σο). Literally, It is permitted thee. As if Agrippa were master of ceremonies instead of Festus. Agrippa as a king and guest presides at the grand display while Festus has simply introduced Paul.For thyself  (υπερ σεαυτου). Some MSS. have περ (concerning). Paul is allowed to speak in his own behalf. No charges are made against him. In fact, Festus has admitted that he has no real proof of any charges.Stretched forth his hand  (εκτεινας την χειρα). Dramatic oratorical gesture (not for silence as in Acts 12:17; Acts 13:16) with the chain still upon it (verse Acts 26:29) linking him to the guard. First aorist active participle of εκτεινω, to stretch out.Made his defence  (απελογειτο). Inchoative imperfect of απολογεομα (middle), "began to make his defence." This is the fullest of all Paul's defences. He has no word of censure of his enemies or of resentment, but seizes the opportunity to preach Christ to such a distinguished company which he does with "singular dignity" (Furneaux). He is now bearing the name of Christ "before kings" (Acts 9:15). In general Paul follows the line of argument of the speech on the stairs (chapter Acts 26:22).
