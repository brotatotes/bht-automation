 At midday  (ημερας μεσης). Genitive of time and idiomatic use of μεσος, in the middle of the day, more vivid than μεσημβριαν (Acts 22:6).Above the brightness of the sun  (υπερ την λαμπροτητα του ηλιου). Here alone not in Acts 26:9; Acts 26:22, though implied in Acts 9:3; Acts 22:6, "indicating the supernatural character of the light" (Knowling). Luke makes no effort to harmonize the exact phrases here with those in the other accounts and Paul here (verse Acts 26:16) blends together what Jesus said to him directly and the message of Jesus through Ananias (Acts 9:15). The word λαμπροτης, old word, is here alone in the N.T.Shining round about me  (περιλαμψαν με). First aorist active participle of περιλαμπω, common Koine verb, in N.T. only here and Luke 2:9.
