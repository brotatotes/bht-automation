 But declared  (αλλα απηγγελλον). Imperfect active of απαγγελλω, repeatedly.Throughout all the country of Judea  (πασαν τε την χωραν της Ιουδαιας). The accusative here in the midst of the datives (τοις εν Δαμασκωι, Ιεροσολυμοισ, τοις εθνεσιν) seems strange and Page feels certain that εις should be here even though absent in Aleph A B. But the accusative of extent of space will explain it (Robertson, Grammar, p. 469).Doing works worthy of repentance  (αξια της μετανοιας εργα πρασσοντας). Accusative case of present active participle πρασσοντας because of the implied αυτους with the present infinitive μετανοειν (repent) and επιστρεφειν (turn), though the dative πρασσουσιν could have been used to agree with εθνεσιν (Gentiles). Cf. Matthew 3:8 for similar language used of the Baptist. Paul, the greatest of theologians, was an interesting practical preacher.
