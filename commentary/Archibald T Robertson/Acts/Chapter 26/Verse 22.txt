 Having therefore obtained  (ουν τυχων). Second aorist active participle of old verb τυγχανω.The help that is from God  (επικουριας της απο του θεου). Old word from επικουρεω, to aid, and that from επικουρος, ally, assister. Only here in N.T. God is Paul's ally. All of the plots of the Jews against Paul had failed so far.I stand  (εστηκα). Second perfect of ιστημ, to place, intransitive to stand. Picturesque word (Page) of Paul's stability and fidelity (cf. Philippians 4:1; Ephesians 6:13).Both to small and great  (μικρω τε κα μεγαλω). Dative singular (rather than instrumental, taking μαρτυρουμενος middle, not passive) and use of τε κα links the two adjectives together in an inclusive way. These two adjectives in the singular (representative singular rather than plural) can apply to age (young and old) or to rank (Revelation 11:18) as is specially suitable here with Festus and Agrippa present. In Acts 8:10 (Hebrews 8:11) the phrase explains παντες (all).Saying nothing but what  (ουδεν εκτος λεγων ων). "Saying nothing outside of those things which." The ablative relative ων is attracted into the case of the unexpressed antecedent τουτων and so ablative after εκτος (adverbial preposition common in LXX, the papyri. In N.T. here and 1 Corinthians 6:18; 1 Corinthians 15:27; 2 Corinthians 12:2). Cf. Luke 16:29 about Moses and the prophets.
