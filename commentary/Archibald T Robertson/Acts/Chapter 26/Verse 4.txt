 My manner of life  (την μεν ουν βιωσιν μου). With μεν ουν Paul passes from the captatio benevolentiae (verses Acts 26:1; Acts 26:2) "to the narratio or statement of his case" (Page). Βιωσις is from βιοω (1 Peter 4:2) and that from βιος (course of life). This is the only instance of βιωσις yet found except the Prologue (10) of Ecclesiasticus and an inscription given in Ramsay's Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, Vol II, p. 650.Know  (ισασ). Literary form instead of the vernacular Koine οιδασιν. Paul's early life in Tarsus and Jerusalem was an open book to all Jews.
