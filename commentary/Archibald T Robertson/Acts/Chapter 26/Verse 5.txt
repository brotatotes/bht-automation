 Having knowledge of me from the first  (προγινωσκοντες με ανωθεν). Literally, "knowing me beforehand" (both προ and ανωθεν), from the beginning of Paul's public education in Jerusalem (Knowling). Cf. 2 Peter 3:17.If they be willing to testify  (εαν θελωσιν μαρτυρειν). Condition of third class (εαν and subjunctive). A neat turning of the tables on the distinguished audience about Paul's Jerusalem reputation before his conversion.After the straitest sect  (την ακριβεστατην αιρεσιν). This is a true superlative (not elative) and one of the three (also αγιωτατος, Jude 1:20, τιμιωτατος Revelation 18:12; Revelation 21:11) superlatives in -τατος in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 279f., 670), though common enough in the LXX and the papyri. Hαιρεσιν (choosing) is properly used here with Pharisees (Josephus, Life, 38).Religion  (θρησκειας). From θρησκευω and this from θρησκος (James 1:26), old word for religious worship or discipline, common in the papyri and inscriptions (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary) for reverent worship, not mere external ritual. In N.T. only here, James 1:26; Colossians 2:18.I lived a Pharisee  (εζησα Φαρισαιος). Emphatic position. Paul knew the rules of the Pharisees and played the game to the full (Galatians 1:14; Philippians 3:5). The Talmud makes it plain what the life of a Pharisee was. Paul had become one of the leaders and stars of hope for his sect.
