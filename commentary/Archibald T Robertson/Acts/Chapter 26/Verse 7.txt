 Our twelve tribes  (το δωδεκαφυλον ημων). A word found only here in N.T. and in Christian and Jewish writings, though δωδεκαμηνον (twelve month) is common in the papyri and δεκαφυλος (ten tribes) in Herodotus. Paul's use of this word for the Jewish people, like James 1:1 (ταις δωδεκα φυλαις, the twelve tribes), shows that Paul had no knowledge of any "lost ten tribes." There is a certain national pride and sense of unity in spite of the dispersion (Page).Earnestly  (εν εκτενεια). A late word from εκτεινω, to stretch out, only here in N.T., but in papyri and inscriptions. Page refers to Simeon and Anna (Luke 2:25-28) as instances of Jews looking for the coming of the Messiah. Note the accusative of νυκτα κα ημεραν as in Acts 20:31.Hope to attain  (ελπιζε καταντησα). This Messianic hope had been the red thread running through Jewish history. Today, alas, it is a sadly worn thread for Jews who refuse to see the Messiah in Jesus.I am accused by Jews  (εγκαλουμα υπο Ιουδαιων). The very word used in Acts 23:28 (ενεκαλουν) which see, and by Jews of all people in the world whose mainspring was this very "hope." It is a tremendously effective turn.
