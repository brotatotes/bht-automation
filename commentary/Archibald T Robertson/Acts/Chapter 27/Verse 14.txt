 After no long time  (μετ' ου πολυ). Litotes again.Beat down from it  (εβαλεν κατ' αυτης). Second aorist active indicative of βαλλω, to throw. Here "dashed" (intransitive). Αυτης is in the ablative, not genitive case, beat "down from it" (Crete), not "against it or on it." (Robertson, Grammar, p. 606). Αυτης cannot refer to πλοιον (boat) which is neuter. So the ablative case with κατα as in Mark 5:13, Homer also. The Cretan mountains are over 7,000 feet high.A tempestuous wind which is called Euraquilo  (ανεμος τυφωνικος ο καλουμενος Ευρακυλων). Τυφων=Τυφως was used for the typhoon, a violent whirlwind (τυρβο) or squall. This word gives the character of the wind. The Ευρακυλων (reading of Aleph A B against the Textus Receptus Ευροκλυδων) has not been found elsewhere. Blass calls it a hybrid word compounded of the Greek ευρος (east wind) and the Latin αθυιλο (northeast). It is made like ευρονοτος (southeast). The Vulgate has euroaquilo. It is thus the east north east wind. Page considers Euroclydon to be a corruption of Euraquilo. Here the name gives the direction of the wind.
