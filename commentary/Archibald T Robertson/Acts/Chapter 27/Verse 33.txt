 While the day was coming on  (αχρ ου ημερα ημελλεν γινεσθα). More likely here αχρ ου (for αχρ τουτου ω) with the imperfect ημελλεν, has its usual meaning, "until which time day was about to come on (γινεσθα, present middle infinitive, linear action)." That is Paul kept on exhorting or beseeching (παρεκαλε, imperfect active) them until dawn began to come on (cf. verse Acts 27:39 when day came). In Hebrews 3:13 αχρ ου with the present indicative has to mean "so long as" or while, but that is not true here (Robertson, Grammar, p. 975). See on Acts 2:46 for the same phrase for partaking food (μεταλαμβανω τροφης, genitive case) as also in Acts 27:34. Paul wanted them to be ready for action when day really came. "Fourteenth day" repeated (verse Acts 27:27), only here in the accusative of duration of time (ημεραν). It is not clear whether the "waiting" (προσδοκωντες, present active participle predicate nominative complementary participle after διατελειτε, Robertson, Grammar, p. 1121) means fourteen days of continuous fasting or only fourteen successive nights of eager watching without food. Galen and Dionysius of Halicarnassus employ the very idiom used here by Luke (ασιτος διατελεω).Having taken nothing  (μηθεν προσλαβομενο). Second aorist middle participle of προσλαμβανω with the accusative μηθεν rather than the more usual μηδεν. Probably Paul means that they had taken no regular meals, only bits of food now and then.
