 Two hundred three-score and sixteen souls  (διακοσια εβδομηκοντα εξ). The Vatican Manuscript (B) has ως in place of διακοσια (two hundred) which Westcott and Hort put in the margin. But Alford is probably correct in suggesting that the scribe of B wrote ως by repeating the omega in πλοιω with ς = 200 (Greek numeral). If the number 276 seems large, it is to be remembered that we do not know the size of the ship. Josephus (Life, 3) says that there were 600 on the ship that took him to Italy. The grain ships were of considerable size. The number included sailors, soldiers, and prisoners. A muster or roll call may have been made.
