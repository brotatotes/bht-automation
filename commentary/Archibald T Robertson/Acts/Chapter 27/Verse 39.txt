 They knew not  (ουκ επεγινωσκον). Imperfect active of επιγινωσκω, to recognize. Probably conative, tried to recognize and could not (Conybeare and Howson). The island was well-known (Acts 28:1, επεγνωμεν), but St. Paul's Bay where the wreck took place was some distance from the main harbour (Valetta) of Melita (Malta).They perceived  (κατενοουν). Imperfect active of κατανοεω, gradually perceived after some effort as in Acts 11:16. This beach seemed their only hope.They took counsel  (εβουλευοντο). Imperfect middle showing the process of deliberation and doubt. The bay "having a beach" (εχοντα αιγιαλον) is a phrase found in Xenophon's Anabasis VI. 4, 4.Whether they could drive  (ε δυναιντο εκσωσα). This use of the optative with ε in questions of this sort (implied indirect) is a neat Greek idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1021). B C Bohairic read εκσωσα (first aorist active infinitive of εκσωζω), to save out (so Westcott and Hort), instead of εξωσα (from εξωθεω, to push out, as Textus Receptus).
