 Casting off  (περιελοντες). Second aorist active of περιαιρεω. Literally, "Having taken away from around," that is all four anchors from around the stern. Cf. the other verbs with αγκυρας in verse Acts 27:29; Acts 27:30.They left them in the sea  (ειων εις την θαλασσαν). Imperfect active of εαω, either descriptive or inchoative. They let the anchors go and the ropes fell down into the sea.At the same time loosing the bands of the rudders  (αμα ανεντες τας ζευκτηριας των πηδαλιων). On the use of αμα with the participle, old Greek idiom see Robertson, Grammar, p. 1139. The second aorist active participle of ανιημ, to relax, loosen up. Old verb, in N.T. Acts 16:26; Acts 27:40; Ephesians 6:9; Hebrews 13:5. Thayer notes that ζευκτηριας (bands) occurs nowhere else, but several papyri use it of yokes and waterwheels (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary). The word for rudders (πηδαλιον) is an old one (from πηδον, the blade of an oar), but in the N.T. only here and James 3:4. Page notes that the ancient ships had a pair of paddle rudders like those of the early northmen, one on each quarter. The paddle rudders had been fastened while the ship was anchored.Hoisting up the foresail to the wind  (επαραντες τον αρτεμωνα τη πνεουση). Supply αυρα (breeze) after πνεουση (blowing). It is not clear what "sail" is meant by "αρτεμωνα." No other example in Greek is known, though the scholiast to Juvenal XII. 68 explains ςελο προρα συο by artemone solo. Hence "foresail" is probably correct.They made for the beach  (κατειχον εις τον αιγιαλον). Imperfect active of κατεχω, to hold down, perhaps inchoative. "They began to hold the ship steadily for the beach."
