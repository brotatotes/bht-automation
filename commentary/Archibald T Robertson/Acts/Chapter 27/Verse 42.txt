Regular Greek idiom for purpose (ινα and aorist active subjunctive of αποκτεινω, to kill). Soldiers were responsible for the lives of prisoners (Acts 12:19).Swim out  (εκκολυμβησας). First aorist active participle of εκκολυμβαω, old verb to swim out and so away.Escape  (διαφυγη). Second aorist (effective) active subjunctive of διαφευγω, to make a clean (δια) escape.
