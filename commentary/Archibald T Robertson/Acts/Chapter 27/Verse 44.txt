 Some on planks  (ους μεν επ σανισιν). Common Greek idiom (ους μεν--ους δε) for "some--some." The only N.T. instance of the old Greek word σανις for board or plank. The breaking of the ship gave scraps of timber which some used.They all escaped safe  (παντας διασωθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of διασωζω (the very word used for the desire of the centurion about Paul) with accusative of general reference, the clause being subject of εγενετο. So Luke in this marvellous narrative, worthy of any historian in any age, shows how Paul's promise was fulfilled (verse Acts 27:24). Paul the prisoner is the hero of the voyage and shipwreck, a wonderful example of God's providential care.
