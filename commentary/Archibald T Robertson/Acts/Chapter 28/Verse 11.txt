Διοσκουροις is in apposition with παρασημω. The word means the twin sons (κουρος or κορος) of Zeus (Διος, genitive of Ζευς) and Leda, viz., Castor and Pollux. The Attic used the dual, τω Διοσκορω. Castor and Pollux were the tutelary deities of sailors whose figures were painted one on each side of the prow of the ship. This sign was the name of the ship. So they start in another grain ship of Alexandria bound for Rome.
