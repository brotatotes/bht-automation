 We made a circuit  (περιελθοντες). Second aorist active of περιερχομα, to go around, old verb, already in Acts 19:13. See also Hebrews 11:37; 1 Timothy 5:13. But Westcott and Hort read περιελοντες after Aleph B (from περιαιρεω) as in Acts 27:40, though here it could only mean casting loose, for which no other authority exists. At any rate the ship had to tack to reach Rhegium and was not able to make a straight course (ενθυδρομεω, Acts 16:11).Rhegium  (Ρηγιον) is from ρηγνυμ, to break off, the place where the land breaks off, the southern entrance to the straits of Messina.A south wind sprang up  (επιγενομενου νοτου). Genitive absolute again, and for all the world like that fatal south wind in Acts 27:13, but with no bad results this time, though the weather was plainly treacherous at this early season.On the second day  (δευτεραιο). This is the classical use of the predicate adjective, "We second day men" as in Luke 24:22; John 11:39; Philippians 3:5 instead of the adverb (Robertson, Grammar, p. 657).To Puteoli  (εις Ποτιολους). It was 182 miles from Rhegium and would require 26 hours (Page). It was eight miles northwest from Neapolis (Naples) and the chief port of Rome, the regular harbour for the Alexandrian ships from Rome. Portions of the great mole are said to be still visible.
