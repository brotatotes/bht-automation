 Paul was suffered to abide by himself  (επετραπη τω Παυλω μενειν καθ' εαυτον). Second aorist passive of επιτρεπο, to permit or allow. Literally, "It was permitted to Paul to abide by himself." Some late documents (Textus Receptus) here add: "The centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard" (or the στρατοπεδαρχ). This officer used to be considered Burrus who was Prefect of the Praetorian Guard A.D. 51-62. But it is by no means certain that Julius turned the prisoners over to this officer. It seems more likely that Julius would report to the captain of the Peregrini. If so, we may be sure that Julius would give a good report of Paul to this officer who would be kindly disposed and would allow Paul comparative freedom (living by himself, in his lodging, verse Acts 28:23, his own hired house verse Acts 28:30, though still chained to a soldier).With the soldier that guarded him  (συν τω φυλασσοντ αυτον στρατιωτη). Probably a new soldier every day or night, but always with this soldier chained to his right hand day and night. Now that Paul is in Rome what can he do for Christ while he awaits the outcome of his own appeal to Nero?
