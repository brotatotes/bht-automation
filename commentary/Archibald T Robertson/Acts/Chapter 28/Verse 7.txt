 To the chief man of the island  (τω πρωτω της νησου). An official title correct in Malta (Ramsay, St. Paul, p. 343). An inscription in Malta calls Prudens "Primate of the Maltese" (πρωτος Μελιταιων). Here it is plainly a title and not the common use seen in Acts 13:50; Acts 25:2; Acts 28:17.Publius  (Ποπλιω). This Greek name (πραενομεν) can be derived either from Ποπιλιυς or Πυβλιυς (cf. πυβλιχυς for ποπυλιχυς from ποπυλυς). Entertained us (εξενισεν ημας). Paul and his companions (Luke and Aristarchus). Was Julius included? On ξενιζω see Acts 10:23.Courteously  (φιλοφρονως). This old adverb from φιλοφρων (φιλοσ, φρεν, friendly mind) occurs here alone in the N.T. In a kindly or friendly manner, all the more so because of the original suspicion of Paul as a criminal.
