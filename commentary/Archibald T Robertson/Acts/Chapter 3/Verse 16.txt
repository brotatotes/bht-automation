 By faith in his name  (τη πιστε του ονοματος αυτου). Instrumental case of πιστε (Aleph and B do not have επ) and objective genitive of ονοματος.His name  (το ονομα αυτου). Repeats the word name to make the point clear. Cf. verse Acts 3:6 where Peter uses "the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth" when he healed the man.Made strong  (εστερεωσεν). Same verb used in verse Acts 3:7 (and Acts 16:5). Nowhere else in the N.T. Old verb from στερεος, firm, solid.Through him  (δι' αυτου). Through Jesus, the object of faith and the source of it.Perfect soundness  (ολοκληριαν). Perfect in all its parts, complete, whole (from ολος, whole, κληρος, allotment). Late word (Plutarch) once in LXX (Isaiah 1:6) and here alone in the N.T., but adjective ολοκληρος, old and common (James 1:4; 1 Thessalonians 5:23).
