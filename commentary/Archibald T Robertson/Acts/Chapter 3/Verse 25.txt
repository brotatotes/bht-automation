 Ye  (Hυμεις). Emphatic position.The covenant which God made  (της διαθηκης ης ο θεος διεθετο). Literally, "the covenant which God covenanted." Διαθηκη and διεθετο (second aorist middle indicative of διαθημ) are the same root. See on Matthew 26:28. The covenant (agreement between two, δια, τιθημ) was with Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3) and repeated at various times (Genesis 18:18; Genesis 22:18; Genesis 26:4, etc.). In Hebrews 9:15-18 the word is used both for covenant and will. The genitive relative ης attracted to case of the antecedent.
