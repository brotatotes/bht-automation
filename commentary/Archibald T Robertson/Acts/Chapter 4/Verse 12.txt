 Salvation  (η σωτηρια). The Messianic salvation as in Acts 5:31; Acts 17:11 and as Jesus meant in John 4:22. It is amazing to see Peter speaking thus to the Sanhedrin and proclaiming the necessity of salvation (δε σωθηνα) in the name of Jesus Christ and in no other. If this was true then, it is true today. There is no second (ετερον) name to go beside that of Jesus in India, China, Japan, or America.
