 And now  (κα τα νυν). "And as to (accusative of general reference) the now things (the present situation)." Only in the Acts in the N.T. (Acts 5:38; Acts 17:30; Acts 20:32; Acts 27:22).Grant  (δος). Second aorist active imperative of διδωμ, urgency of the aorist, Do it now.To speak thy word with all boldness  (μετα παρρησιας πασης λαλειν τον λογον σου). Literally, "with all boldness to go on speaking (present active infinitive) thy word." Peter and John had defied the Sanhedrin in verse Acts 4:20, but all the same and all the more they pray for courage in deed to live up to their brave words. A wholesome lesson.
