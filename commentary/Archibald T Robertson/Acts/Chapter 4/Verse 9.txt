 Concerning a good deed done to an impotent man  (επ ευεργεσια ανθρωπου ασθενους). Objective genitive. Note ευεργεσια (old word, in the N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 6:2), as a benefactor, not a malefactor. Skilful turn made by Peter.Is made whole  (σεσωστα). Perfect passive indicative of σωζω, stands whole.
