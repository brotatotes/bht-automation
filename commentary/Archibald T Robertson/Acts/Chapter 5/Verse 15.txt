 Insomuch that  (ωστε). With the present infinitive εκφερειν and τιθενα, regular Greek idiom for result.Into the streets  (εις τας πλατειας). Supply οδους (ways), into the broad ways.On beds and couches  (επ κλιναριων κα κραβαττων). Little beds (κλιναρια diminutive of κλινη) and camp beds or pallets (see on Mark 2:4; Mark 2:9; Mark 2:11).As Peter came by  (ερχομενου Πετρου). Genitive absolute with present middle participle.At the least his shadow might overshadow  (καν η σκια επισκιασε). Future active indicative with ινα (common with οπως in ancient Greek) and καν (crasis for κα εαν=even if), even if only the shadow. The word for shadow (σκια, like our "sky") is repeated in the verb and preserved in our "overshadow." There was, of course, no virtue or power in Peter's shadow. That was faith with superstition, of course, just as similar cases in the Gospels occur (Matthew 9:20; Mark 6:56; John 9:5) and the use of Paul's handkerchief (Acts 19:12). God honours even superstitious faith if it is real faith in him. Few people are wholly devoid of superstition.
