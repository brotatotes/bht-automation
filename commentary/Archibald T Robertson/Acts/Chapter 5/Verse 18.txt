 With jealousy  (ζηλου). Genitive case. Old word from zeo, to boil, our zeal. In itself it means only warmth, ardour, zeal, but for a bad cause or from a bad motive, jealousy, envy, rivalry results (Acts 13:45). Common in the epistles.In public ward  (εν τηρησε δημοσια). As in Acts 4:3 only with δημοσια (public) added, in the public prison, perhaps not the "common" prison, but any prison is bad enough. In verse Acts 5:19 it is called "the prison" (της φυλακης), the guardhouse.
