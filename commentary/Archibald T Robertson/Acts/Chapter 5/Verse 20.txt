 And stand  (κα σταθεντες). First aorist passive participle (intransitive, ingressive aorist), take a stand. Bold and pictorial command.All the words of this life  (παντα τα ρηματα της ζωης ταυτης). Not just a Hebraism for "all these words of life." Probably "this life" which the Sadducees deny and of which the angel is now speaking, this eternal life. (John 6:63; John 6:68; 1 Corinthians 15:19).
