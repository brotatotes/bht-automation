 Pleased  (ηρεσεν). Aorist active indicative of αρεσκω like Latin placuit when a vote was taken. The use of ενωπιον before "the whole multitude" is like the LXX.They chose  (εξελεξαντο). First aorist middle indicative of εκλεγω, to pick out for oneself. Each one of the seven has a Greek name and was undoubtedly a Hellenist, not an Aramaean Jew. Consummate wisdom is here displayed for the murmuring had come from the Hellenists, seven of whom were chosen to take proper care of the widows of Hellenists. This trouble was settled to stay settled so far as we know. Nothing is here told of any of the seven except Stephen who is "a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit" and Nicolas "a proselyte of Antioch" (who was not then born a Jew, but had come to the Jews from the Greek world).
