 This Moses  (Τουτον τον Μωυσην). Rhetorical repetition follows this description of Moses (five times, anaphora, besides the use here, six cases of ουτος here about Moses: verse Acts 7:35 twice, Acts 7:36; Acts 7:37; Acts 7:38; Acts 7:40). Clearly Stephen means to draw a parallel between Moses and Jesus. They in Egyptdenied  (ηρνησαντο) Moses as now you the Jews denied (ηρνησασθε, Acts 3:13) Jesus. Those in Egypt scouted Moses as "ruler and judge" (verses Acts 7:27; Acts 7:35, αρχοντα κα δικαστην) and God "hath sent" (απεσταλκεν, perfect active indicative, state of completion) Moses "both a ruler and a deliverer" (αρχοντα κα λυτρωτην) as Jesus was to be (Luke 1:68; Luke 2:38; Hebrews 9:12; Titus 2:14). "Ransomer" or "Redeemer" (λυτρωτης) is not found elsewhere, λυτρον (ransom), λυτροω, to ransom, and λυτρωσις, ransoming or redemption, are found often. In Acts 5:31 Christ is termed "Prince and Saviour."With the hand  (συν χειρ). So the correct text. The Pharisees had accused Stephen of blaspheming "against Moses and God" (Acts 6:11). Stephen here answers that slander by showing how Moses led the people out of Egypt in co-operation (συν) with the hand of the Angel of Jehovah.
