 Laid they their hands  (επετιθεσαν τας χειρας). Imperfect active, repetition. The laying on of hands did not occur at the great Pentecost (Acts 2:4; Acts 2:33) nor in Acts 4:31; Acts 10:44 nor is it mentioned in Acts 8:1; Acts 8:14. It is mentioned in Acts 6:7 about the deacons and in Acts 13:3 when Barnabas and Saul left Antioch. And in Saul's case it was Ananias who laid his hands on him (Acts 9:17). Hence it cannot be concluded that the Holy Spirit was received only by the laying on of the hands of the apostles or by the hands of anyone. The so-called practice of "confirmation" appeals to this passage, but inconclusively.They received  (ελαμβανον). Imperfect active, repetition as before and παρ πασσυ with the laying on of the hands.
