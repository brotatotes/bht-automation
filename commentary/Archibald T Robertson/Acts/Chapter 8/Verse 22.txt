 Wickedness  (κακιας). Only here in Luke's writings, though old word and in LXX (cf. 1 Peter 2:1; 1 Peter 2:16).If perhaps  (ε αρα). Si forte. This idiom, though with the future indicative and so a condition of the first class (determined as fulfilled), yet minimizes the chance of forgiveness as in Mark 11:13. Peter may have thought that his sin was close to the unpardonable sin (Matthew 12:31), but he does not close the door of hope.The thought  (η επινοια). Old Greek word from επινοεω, to think upon, and so purpose. Only here in the N.T.
