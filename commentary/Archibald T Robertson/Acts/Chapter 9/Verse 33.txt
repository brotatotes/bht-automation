 Aenias  (Αινεαν). Old Greek name and so probably a Hellenistic Jew. He was apparently a disciple already (the saint, verse Acts 9:32). Luke the physician notes that he had been bed ridden for eight years. See on Acts 5:15 for "bed" (κραβαττου) and Acts 8:7; Luke 5:18 for "paralyzed" (παραλελυμενος, perfect passive participle of παραλυω with ην, periphrastic past perfect passive).
