Feminine form of μαθητης, a learner from μανθανω, to learn, a late word and only here in the N.T.Tabitha  (Ταβειθα). Aramaic form of the Hebrew Tsebi and, like the Greek wordDorcas  (Δορκας), means Gazelle, "the creature with the beautiful look" (or eyes), from δερκομα. The gazelle was a favourite type for beauty in the orient (Song of Solomon Acts 2:9; Acts 2:17; Acts 4:5; Acts 7:3). She may have had both the Aramaic and the Greek name, Tabitha Dorcas like John Mark. There is nothing said about a husband and so she was probably unmarried. She is the second woman mentioned by name after Pentecost (Sapphira the other). She did her beautiful deeds by herself. She did not have a Dorcas society.Did  (εποιε). Imperfect active, her habit.
