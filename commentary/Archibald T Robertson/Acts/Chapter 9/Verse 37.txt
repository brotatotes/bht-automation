 In an upper chamber  (εν υπερωιω). See on Acts 1:13. Also in verse Acts 9:39. In that house. This service was rendered by the women, though Luke has λουσαντες (masculine plural aorist active participle of λουω), a general way of saying "they washed." The interment was not hurried as in Jerusalem (Ananias and Sapphira) and the upper room is where the body was usually placed.
