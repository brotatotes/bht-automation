 He fell upon the earth  (πεσων επ την γην). Second aorist active participle. So in Acts 22:7 Paul says: "I fell unto the ground" (επεσα εις το εδαφος) using an old word rather than the common γην. In Acts 26:14 Paul states that "we were all fallen to the earth" (παντων καταπεσοντων ημων εις την γην, genitive absolute construction). But here in verse Acts 9:7 "the men that journeyed with him stood speechless" (ιστηκεισαν ενεο). But surely the points of time are different. In Acts 26:14 Paul refers to the first appearance of the vision when all fell to the earth. Here in verse Acts 9:7 Luke refers to what occurred after the vision when both Saul and the men had risen from the ground.Saul, Saul  (Σαουλ, Σαουλ). The Hebrew form occurs also in Acts 22:7; Acts 26:14 where it is expressly stated that the voice was in the Hebrew (Aramaic) tongue as also in Acts 9:17 (Ananias). Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 316) terms this use of Σαουλ "the historian's sense of liturgical rhythm." For the repetition of names by Jesus note Luke 10:41 (Martha, Martha), Luke 22:31 (Simon, Simon).Me  (με). In persecuting the disciples, Saul was persecuting Jesus, as the words of Jesus in verse Acts 9:5 made plain. Christ had already spoken of the mystic union between himself and his followers (Matthew 10:40; Matthew 25:40; Matthew 25:45; John 15:1-5). The proverb (Pindar) that Jesus quotes to Saul about kicking against the goad is genuine in Acts 26:14, but not here.
