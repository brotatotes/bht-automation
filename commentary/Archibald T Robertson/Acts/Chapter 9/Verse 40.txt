 Put them all forth  (εκβαλων εξω παντας). Second aorist (effective) active participle of εκβαλλω, a rather strong word, perhaps with some difficulty. Cf. Mark 5:40 which incident Peter may have recalled. The words are not genuine in Luke 8:54. Peter's praying alone reminds one of Elijah (1 Kings 17:20) and the widow's son and Elisha for the Shunammite's son (2 Kings 4:33).Tabitha, arise  (Ταβειθα, αναστηθ). With sublime faith like Ταλειθα κουμ of Jesus in Mark 5:41.She sat up  (ανεκαθισεν). Effective aorist active indicative of ανακαθιζω. Often in medical writers, only here in the N.T. and Luke 7:15 where Westcott and Hort have in the margin the uncompounded form εκαθισεν. Vivid picture.
