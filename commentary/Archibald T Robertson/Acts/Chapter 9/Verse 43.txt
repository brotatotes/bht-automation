 Many days  (ημερας ικανας). See on verse Acts 9:23. Luke is fond of the phrase and uses it for time, number, size. It might be "ten days, ten months, or ten years" (Page).With one Simon a tanner  (παρα τιν Σιμων βυρσε). The use of παρα is usual for staying with one (by his side). "The more scrupulous Jews regarded such an occupation as unclean, and avoided those who pursued it. The conduct of Peter here shows that he did not carry his prejudices to that extent" (Hackett). One of the rabbis said: "It is impossible for the world to do without tanners; but woe to him who is a tanner." A Jewess could sue for divorce if she discovered that her husband was a tanner. And yet Peter will have scruples on the housetop in the tanner's house about eating food considered unclean. "The lodging with the tanner was a step on the road to eating with a Gentile" (Furneaux).
