 Lord  (κυριε). It is open to question if κυριε should not here be translated "Sir" as in Acts 16:30 and in Matthew 21:29; Matthew 21:30; John 5:7; John 12:21; John 20:15; and should be so in John 9:36. It is hardly likely that at this stage Saul recognized Jesus as Lord, though he does so greet him in Acts 22:10 "What shall I do, Lord?" Saul may have recognized the vision as from God as Cornelius says "Lord" in Acts 10:4. Saul surrendered instantly as Thomas did (John 20:28) and as little Samuel (1 Samuel 3:9). This surrender of the will to Christ was the conversion of Saul. He saw a real Person, the Risen Christ, to whom he surrendered his life. On this point he never wavered for a moment to the end.
